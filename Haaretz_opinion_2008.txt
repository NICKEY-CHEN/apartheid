<title>A danger to democracy </title>
<date>Mon Dec 08 01:59:39 IST 2008</date>
<content>
The anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations 60 years ago this week, provides a good opportunity to take stock of the state of mankind throughout the world. A report issued yesterday by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel is a disturbing reminder of this country's standing.  
The report cites a gross violation of human rights, to the point that threatens Israeli democracy. What is especially striking are the inequities suffered by Arab citizens in the areas of infrastructure, education and health, among others. Such blatant discrimination contradicts the principle of equality to which Israel is committed in its Declaration of Independence.  
The High Court of Justice recently warned that its ruling of two years ago, in which it struck down the government's plan to delineate regions of the country as "areas of national preference" in education, has yet to be upheld. This is just one example of the complete contempt with which government ministries view the principle of equality, the same contempt that in one fell swoop voided the recommendations of the Or Commission that probed the events of October 2000.  
The ACRI report also reminds us that Israel is the most inegalitarian country in the Western world, next to the United States. This is manifest primarily in income disparities, but also in citizens' ability to obtain services that have been privatized. The harm done to the weaker sectors of society is also evident in the discrimination against those who suffer from disabilities - in terms of the lack of access and the low rate of employment - in contravention of the law.  
The report encompasses many realms and problems that necessitate profound attention, such as the wholesale infringement of the right to privacy, a right that is recognized in the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty. The violation of this right is evident in, among others, the demand raised by employers to revoke the privilege of medical confidentiality, forcibly impose polygraph tests, and monitor employees' e-mail, among other things. These are violations of rights guaranteed under the Equal Opportunity in the Workplace law.  
No less outrageous are the violations of detainees' and prisoners' rights by the use of excessive force, intolerable crowding in prisons, and inferior sanitary conditions. These too are violations of directives handed down in key High Court rulings, violations that ignore official reports issued by the Public Defenders Office and the Israel Bar.  
Turning toward the issue of what is unfolding beyond the Green Line, the report notes the significant increase in settler violence against Palestinians. Only a minority that are investigated by the police result in indictments. The report states that in most instances, the police do not even launch an investigation, which harms the foundations of the rule of law. This reality contravenes the State of Israel's obligations under international law, and arouses serious concern that Israel is doing nothing to stop the entrenchment of an apartheid policy in the territories.  
This collection of data and facts enunciated in the report is worrying, and it raises hard questions regarding the future of Israel as a democratic, egalitarian society. The candidates for prime minister, and the heads of all political parties, cannot ignore the serious significance of the report, and the public must demand a response as well as a commitment to take action, all the more so because any infringement on human rights is for all intents and purposes an infringement on the rationale for the state's existence.

<title>A new constitutional revolution</title>
<date>Tue Jun 10 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann will present the cabinet committee on legislation with 33 bills today, most of them sponsored by different MKs. Toward the end of the meeting, almost as an afterthought, bill number 29 on the committee's agenda will come up for discussion. The law, proposed by MK Michael Eitan, is a veritable constitutional revolution.  
According to the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Freedom, the court has the power to rule that a law legislated by the Knesset is unconstitutional, and to declare it void. This power is what gives the Basic Laws their constitutional standing, and allows them to supersede all laws that contradict it. Now along comes the justice minister to ask the committee to approve a proposal that would remove any law pertaining to restriction of entry into Israel, or residency or naturalization, from the body of laws that can be voided by the court for contravening a Basic Law. With regard to such a law, the court would only be able to declare that it contravenes a Basic Law, but its ruling would have no practical significance, except in that it would require the Knesset to deliberate the subject within 90 days.  
One need not be an expert on Israeli politics to know that Knesset deliberations on the court's rulings will not bode well for families seeking to reunite with their non-Jewish family members. Most likely, such a discussion will lead to naught, and Israel will be left with a law passed by the Knesset and ruled unconstitutional by the court, which nonetheless remains in effect despite the court's ruling. Nor does one need to be an expert on Israeli politics to know that if there is a precedent for the practical voiding of the constitutional standing of one Basic Law - this will become the fate of all Basic Laws.  
Since the legislation of the Basic Laws, the court has conducted itself with great restraint when deliberating cases in which it was argued that regular laws contradicted them. In the few cases when the court ruled that a law was unconstitutional, the Knesset also behaved with restraint and did not rush to legislate laws meant to circumvent the rulings. This is the desired situation in a constitutionally anchored system that is based on checks and balances, and this is what MK Eitan and the justice minister wish to destroy. One can certainly imagine that the court will become less restrained in its rulings, sticking closer to theory and less to practice, if it knows that its rulings have only declaratory significance and lack real practical importance. Such a development would not be desirable for Israel.  
If the country's book of laws includes one that discriminates between different groups, and one that has been ruled unconstitutional by the court but left in place by the Knesset, this would grant significant validity to the claims being heard around the world against Israel, that it is an apartheid state. The existence of the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Freedom, of effective judicial review, and of a judiciary that is independent of politicians, seriously bolsters Israel in its argument with its critics around the world.  
Menachem Begin understood this well. When the late prime minister said that "there are judges in Jerusalem," he contributed greatly to strengthening Israel's international standing, and it is hard to believe that the Likud leadership today, Begin's successors, is turning its back on his legacy. It is also hard to believe that there is a member of the cabinet who is tirelessly working to destroy this important asset.  
The background to this debate is the government's failure in its responsibility to shape an immigration policy for Israel, opting instead for legislation that is contrary to the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Freedom. This is a mistake that undermines the democratic element in Israel's identity. This approach must also be opposed by the interior minister: From his point of view, the best option must be an initiative to formulate an immigration policy that is suitable for Israel and fitting its values.  
The justice minister and MK Eitan are rushing into the vacuum created by the government's failure. The minister is bringing to the committee a bill that Eitan proposed two years ago. It may be that the timing is tied to Friedmann's obsession about anything that has to do with the authority of the Supreme Court. Two weeks ago he was forced to shelve a memo on a Basic Law that he circulated, according to which the court would not have judicial review on legislation pertaining to entry, residency and naturalization in Israel. When it was made clear to him that he cannot legislate Basic Laws without the agreement of all coalition partners, and that even those closest to him had expressed opposition to the proposal, he pulled the memo, at least for the time being. But with Friedmann, instinct overcomes reason, and when the door is shut before him, he will try the window; thus, Eitan's two-year-old proposal is being brought back to the fore.  
This proposal needs to be rejected and shelved. There is broad agreement in Israel on the need for a constitution. The Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee has invested great effort in this. The prime minister has declared it as an important goal of his government, and the coalition agreements reflect this. What is the point of working on a constitution when even the minimal constitution that does exist is being depleted of all meaning? How is it possible that such an important constitutional revolution can be brought before the cabinet committee for legislation without any public debate taking place - even among the Knesset factions? Another question that should be asked is how is it possible that a justice minister brings for approval legislation on Basic Laws without first gaining the approval of the coalition partners, as the coalition agreement requires him to do?

<title>A thorn in the Shin Bet's side </title>
<date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
About a month ago, Dr. Mustafa Barghouti was invited to the Italian Consulate in Jerusalem to receive a citation of honor from the government of Italy. The consulate submitted requests to the Israeli authorities for 15 entry permits to Jerusalem, for Barghouti and another 14 guests - family members and friends. The consulate was informed that 14 permits were issued. Only Barghouti did not receive a permit, he relates with a laugh.  
Ever since March 2007, upon the establishment of the Palestinian unity government, the Civil Administration has not granted Barghouti - a physician by profession - entry permits to the Gaza Strip. A member of the Legislative Council for the National Initiative list that he established, Barghouti was the information minister in that short-lived unity government.   
For the past three months he has not been receiving entry permits for Jerusalem either. He estimates that he has requested entry into Jerusalem 12 or 13 times. For the most part, it was European diplomats who invited him to meetings, and it was they who submitted the request for the permit. On one occasion it was Labor MK Ophir Pines-Paz.  
The Shin Bet security service has told Haaretz in response that "Mustafa Barghouti is forbidden to enter Israel, and this is because of, among other things, his connections with terror activists and activity on behalf of a terror organization, and with no connection to his membership in the National Initiative list in the Legislative Council."  
As in thousands of other cases of individuals denied freedom of movement, the Shin Bet seems to be revealing a small glimpse while concealing the whole picture. It feels confident in firing off its standard reply because the majority in the Jewish society of Israel backs it and is convinced that the organization is guided by pure, objective and professional security considerations. It is convinced that Shin Bet officers are devoid of personal and bullying motives, and that they are either not influenced by a wink from the political echelon or that it is not possible that they have been ordered or advised to suit the political excuse to a political intention.  
In Israel, most of the public is convinced: If a person does not get a travel permit of any sort, the Shin Bet has conclusive proof that he is dangerous. So maybe it is a blunder by the Shin Bet and the Israel Defense Forces that Mustafa Barghouti moves freely back and forth to Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah and Hebron like tens of thousands of other people "prohibited for security reasons?" Because what can the layman conclude? That a person who "is active for a terror organization" must be apprehended, if only for questioning. But Barghouti has not been arrested, even when during Ramadan he tried to enter Jerusalem when Israeli authorities allowed all people over 50 to enter the city. He was delayed for three hours at the checkpoint and sent back, even though he is "active on behalf of a terrorist organization."  
The travel permits are a way to tell Palestinian public figures exactly whom the Israeli patron wants to honor. Whose politics is tolerated, whose is legitimate and whose is intolerable. With no connection to the electoral weakness of Barghouti's National Initiative, the messages that are linked with his name are clear, resonant and popular: Hamas and Fatah have to get down off their high horses, rectify the serious mistakes they have made in recent months, and get back on the path of unity to fight the occupation. Popular struggle - along the separation fence, against the Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and against the apartheid roads - is the most effective means, which involves the entire society.  
Only last Friday, Barghouti, with hundreds of Palestinian activists and a hundred Israelis, took part in a demonstration against Road 443, which is blocked to Palestinians. Barghouti is frequently interviewed by foreign journalists because of his eloquence, and he is exactly the person who will stick pins in balloons that are inflated with false optimism on the progress of the negotiations because the Palestinian and Israeli negotiating chiefs - Ahmed Qureia and Tzipi Livni - have managed to come up with procedures for convening the committee that will discuss "the core issues."  
His messages interfere with the new taming course that Israel is trying to give the Palestinian Authority's high officials. Its main lesson is how to nurture the rupture with Hamas and how to swallow the frog of the settlements. And this is what makes Barghouti a thorn in the side of the Shin Bet.

<title>Beware, appeasement </title>
<date>Thu Apr 24 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
The suicidal left has found itself a new hero: Jimmy Carter. Finally, someone is speaking the truth: Israel is an apartheid state. Finally, someone is exposing justice: Palestinian terrorism is tantamount to the actions of the Israel Defense Forces. Finally, someone is bringing peace: He is welcomed by that modern-day Sadat, Khaled Meshal.  
For the suicidal left, Carter is the good American cop who is replacing the bad American cop and ending the dark era of George Bush. After eight lean years, we once again have a brave Southern sheriff chasing the true villain - Israel. Now, then, we can once again stretch out on the soft sofas of the 1990s divan and suck on a hookah of sweet illusions. As though Camp David never happened. As though Hamas did not exist. Because Jimmy has come home. Carter has brought back hope.  
In the spring of 1979, President Carter made history: He led Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat to sign a peace accord. Carter did not initiate the accord. In some of his moves, Carter even jeopardized it. And yet ultimately the former president headed the peace summit and brought Egypt and Israel to the happy ending that they had had trouble reaching by themselves. That glowing hour on the White House lawn is the hour of grace in Carter's failed career in international politics. No one can take it away from him.  
In the fall of 1979, however, President Carter once again made history: failing to understand that the Khomeini revolution was imminent, he prevented the Shah from preventing the revolution. He thus brought about a historical catastrophe whose dimensions remain difficult to grasp even today. In the name of his commitment to moderation and human rights, Carter allowed zealots to take over Iran and turn it into a regional power of evil. This power of evil is about to become nuclear. It is a threat to Israel's existence, to the stability of the Middle East and to world peace. Carter bears the heavy burden of responsibility for this development.  
In November 1980, the Americans kicked Carter out of the White House in disgrace. They did so because they felt that he had destabilized America and brought it to its knees, and because they could no longer stand everything he represented: weakness, sanctimoniousness and groveling before evil.  
For some 30 years, Carter has been perceived by most Americans as a self-righteous fool who does not understand the basic physics of the real world. The fact that the preacher from Georgia wrapped his alchemy of international politics in a moralizing theology only increased the repugnance he aroused. Just as Carter's policy is not really policy, his morality is not really morality. There is no zealous thug that Carter will not embrace. No third-world terrorist that he will not try to appease.  
The problem, however, is not Carter, but Carterism. Carterism is a policy of appeasement: it is the unwillingness of those who seek good in the West to protect the values of the West when faced with an aggressor from the East. Carterism is the inability of the enlightened in North America and North Tel Aviv to face the fact that sometimes there is evil in the Third World. Sometimes there is evil in the Arab world. There is even Palestinian evil.  
Carter himself is not very important. He did some damage to Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian moderates, but the damage is limited. He did talk peace with Hamas at the same time that Hamas was initiating a military offensive at Kerem Shalom, an act that might have sparked a war, but in this he only exposed his own shoddiness.  
Carterism is far more important than Jimmy Carter. Carterism is a profound scourge found among certain elites in the U.S., in Western Europe and in Israel. Carterism is a dangerous distortion of thought and values among those who presume to be thinkers committed to values.  
The possibility that a Democrat will be elected president of the United States in November makes the debate over Carterism relevant and vital. Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama will have to choose whether to continue in the sober tradition of Roosevelt-Truman-Kennedy or to revive Carter's appeasement. That is why it is important to speak out strongly right now about the path chosen by the old man who came to visit us this week.  
This path is not only delusional, but immoral. Carterism's cooperation with Hamas is cooperation with the oppression of women, with the jailing of homosexuals, with the persecution of Christians. It is cooperation with a religious tyranny that tramples the Palestinian individual and seeks to eradicate the Israeli-Jewish collective. True, George Bush too has wreaked calamity on the Middle East, but the way to correct Bush's mistake is not to return to Carter's abomination. If the Israeli, European and American left chooses to become a Carterist left, it will indeed become a suicidal left.

<title>Catastrophic, but not apartheid?</title>
<date>Fri May 02 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Twice within 10 days, Israel has been labeled as ?apartheid? in Haaretz: in an editorial in support of former U.S. president Jimmy Carter?s efforts for peace; and in a column by Yossi Sarid, the former Meretz leader. Two authoritative voices, both misinformed.? 
Both Haaretz and Sarid focused on the territories. Both condemn Israel?s nearly 41-year-long occupation. Haaretz ?(?Our Debt to Jimmy Carter,? April 15?) said that the ?interim political situation in the territories has crystallized into a kind of apartheid,? while Sarid ?(?Yes, It Is Apartheid,? April 25?) wrote with great emotion that ?what acts like apartheid, is run like apartheid and harasses like apartheid, is not a duck ? it is apartheid.?? 
Yes, there is no question that our occupation policies and practices can be compared with apartheid. And, equally, with China?s control of Tibet. And also, to one degree or another, with any other place in the world where one group of people oppresses another.? 
Domination and control are the common elements. Roadblocks, licenses and permits for every little matter, arbitrary seizure of land, privileges concerning water use, cheap labor ? these and much else are the stock in trade of suppression.? 
But to apply the apartheid label is wrong, both with regard to the territories ?(to which Haaretz and Sarid refer?), or to Israel within the Green Line ?(where Arabs suffer discrimination, but to say it?s apartheid would be laughable?). Why do I say this with such certainty? Because I was a journalist with the Rand Daily Mail newspaper in Johannesburg for 26 years, and my special function was to report and comment on apartheid?s evils. And for more than 10 years I have lived in Israel, and have been engaged in dialogue work.? 
The labeling is wrong because the situations are entirely different. Apartheid in South Africa, from 1948 until 1994, was a unique?system of racial separation and discrimination, institutionalized by law and custom in every aspect of everyday life, imposed by the white minority and based on a belief in white racial superiority. Skin color decreed inferior status from birth until death for blacks, Asians and ?mixed-race? coloreds. In contrast, West Bank oppression is not based on a predetermined racist ideology. It stems rather from historical factors such as Jordan?s attack during the 1967 war and the resulting Israeli conquest of the West Bank. From that, the settlement movement has developed because of a mixture of religious messianism, economic greed and security claims.? 
Some compare Israel?s attempts to carve up the West Bank with South Africa?s tribal mini-states, the Bantustans. This is wildly inappropriate. The Bantustans were devised to deny blacks South African citizenship, while continuing to exploit their labor. Blacks were penned in rural ?reserves,? and were allowed into white South Africa only when needed for specified jobs in factories, offices and homes and on farms. Israel?s purpose on the West Bank is the opposite: to keep Palestinians there and to allow only an absolute minimum of them into Israel ? and even them, reluctantly. Instead, the country?s labor needs are met by importing large numbers of foreign workers.? 
I am among the majority of Israelis who believe that the occupation and the settlements are catastrophic for both Israelis and Palestinians. I want two states, side by side in peace: That?s an agreed-upon separation, not apartheid. I share the dismay and shame of many Israelis about the morass into which the occupation has dragged us ? the mutual killings, the infliction of suffering, and the brutalization of both Israelis and?Palestinians as perpetrators and victims. I am desperately worried about our betrayal of our moral values and of the lessons of our own persecution down the centuries.? 
Calling it apartheid, however, is not only wrong but thoughtless ? because it ignores what is happening in the world, and especially the imminence of the Durban Review Conference, due to be held next year. That meeting is to be the follow-up to the United Nations anti-racism conference in Durban, South Africa, in August-September 2001. The first part was an international conference of NGOs that went berserk in condemning Israel as ?the new apartheid.? The aim was simple: If Israel was branded like this, it would be as illegitimate as apartheid South Africa had been, and hence subject to the same severe international sanctions. Moreover, whereas the intention with apartheid South Africa was to force a change in regime, it is obvious that critics of Israel include those who seek the destruction of the state itself.? 
The conference of governments that followed tangled over similar anti-Israel and anti-Semitic wording. After pressures, it eventually dumped virtually every reference to Israel. A few days later, 9/11 overtook the Durban meetings. Singling out Israel as the fount of original sin in human-rights abuses went to the back burner. Now it is creeping back: The apartheid accusation is being spread in meetings around the world and on Internet sites. It could feature at next year?s Review Conference.? 
Anticipating the worst, Canada has already announced that it will not attend the event. Israel is waiting to see what happens before deciding whether to take part. Apartheid deserves its unique place in human memory. Just as not every tragedy is a holocaust, so not every form of separation or oppressive rule is apartheid.?

<title>Citizenship law makes Israel an apartheid state</title>
<date>Fri Jun 27 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
The government's decision last week to extend the validity of the Citizenship Law (Temporary Order), for another year, is evidence that the legal barriers preventing severe discrimination against Israel's Arab citizens and harm to their civil rights have been removed.  
This extension is the eighth since the law was first passed in 2003, and it shows just how naive Justice Edmond Levy's position was when he refused to join in the 2006 decision by five judges from the High Court of Justice, who stated that the law was unconstitutional, that it contravened the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Freedom, and that it must be removed from the law books. Levy explained his refusal by saying that he saw no need to intervene because only two months remained until the law expired. However, at the end of the two months, the law was extended by a year, and now they want to extend it for yet another year.  
Had Levy known that the law's limited validity was nothing but a deception aimed at preparing a discriminatory and unconstitutional law, there is no doubt he would have joined the five justices' majority opinion that it was unconstitutional and should be removed. We must hope that the High Court of Justice, when it rules on the new petition submitted against the law after it was extended in 2006, will take into account that the term "temporary provision," which both the government and Knesset take pains to stress, is a deception. We are talking about, in effect, a permanent law.  
The law stipulates that the interior minister does not have the authority to approve residence in Israel for a resident of Judea and Samaria (unless, of course, they are Jews - that is, settlers). This is so even regarding family reunions, meaning marriage, when it comes to Palestinian spouses who are younger than 35 (for men) or 25 (for women). In effect, the law prevents young Israeli citizens from marrying the spouse of their choice and living with this spouse in Israel, if the spouse is a Palestinian from Judea and Samaria.  
It is obvious that this has barely any effect on the right of young Israeli Jews to live in their country with the spouse of their choice, because there are hardly any marriages between Israeli Jews and Palestinians from Judea and Samaria. On the other hand, these Palestinians constitute Israeli Arabs' natural pool for choosing a spouse. For this reason, the law severely discriminates when comparing the rights of young Israeli Jewish citizens and young Israeli Arab citizens.  
When the law was first passed in 2003, supposedly as a temporary one-year measure, it was accompanied by security reasoning - the risk of implanting terrorists in Israel via marriage. The reasoning was faulty even at that time: Every Palestinian who wishes to enter Israel must be addressed individually. It is the Shin Bet security service's task to do this and thus carry out its mission - protecting the security of Israel's citizens such that the country remains democratic, with equal rights for all. However, as the years go by, it becomes clear that the security argument and the term "temporary measure" are merely a deception aimed at "koshering" discriminatory legislation for demographic reasons.  
The claim that there are characteristics of an apartheid state in Israel is widely heard in the Western world. The word apartheid is catchy and understood in many parts of the world, which makes it useful to send a message that we resent and which we claim has no connection with  reality in Israel. However, we do not need to replicate exactly the characteristics of South African apartheid within discriminatory practices in civil rights in Israel in order to call Israel an apartheid state. The amendment to the Citizenship Law is exactly such a practice, and it is best that we not try to evade the truth: Its existence in our law books turns Israel into an apartheid state.
The government decided to add the Gaza Strip to the list of countries for which the interior minister does not have the prerogative to approve residence in Israel on the grounds of family reunions, regardless of age. Both the list and the new addition are superfluous and harmful. Since Hamas gained control, no one enters or leaves Gaza anyway, and the new restriction harms couples' cases from the time when there was passage between Israel and Gaza. There is no need for this affront.

<title>Colonial Zionism </title>
<date>Fri Oct 17 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
For the past 30 years I have considered the settlements a destructive phenomenon that raises a large question mark over Israel's future. In fact, the settlement enterprise is an ideological, political and social phenomenon that has succeeded in creating an original androgynous creation: colonial Zionism.  
There have already been variations of Zionism: general, revisionist, socialist, with or without quotation marks. Now we also have colonial Zionism, based on ethnic and religious inequality, which considers itself the exclusive emissary of Jewish history. The Divine promise and not the natural rights of human beings to freedom, independence and self-government is, in its eyes, the one and only source of legitimacy for the return of the Jews to the Land of Israel. According to this viewpoint, the land belongs not only to living Jews, but to all the past generations and those yet unborn; therefore, members of the present generation have no right to share possession of the land with members of another nation.  
As a matter of course, when we speak of "the settlements" we are not referring to that vast majority of Israelis who are living in the West Bank for reasons of convenience or necessity (cheap and improved housing). In addition, we do not talk about each settler separately: We talk about the settlement enterprise the way one talks about "socialism," "conservatism" or "nationalism;" in other words, about that which is essential to the ideology and the movement, and typifies it.  
Even the ideological core, which is in essence "the settlement movement," is not all of one stripe. Between the hilltop youth and many of their parents there is a large gap, not only in patterns of behavior but also in the degree of connection to universal values.  
However, overall, they are all nurtured by the same principles and aspire to the same goals. Since this small minority is convinced that it owns the absolute truth, it considers itself permitted to force it on all of society.   
Therefore its leaders and spokespersons show disdain for both the weak politicians and the basic tenets of democracy itself. They know how to exploit democratic institutions, but they ignore human rights and recognize only the rights of the Jews. Since the High Court of Justice decision on Elon Moreh in 1979, in which the court ruled that seizing private lands is illegal, they have been attacking this basic institution of Israeli democracy, the guardian of individual rights.  
Despite the power he has acquired thanks to the cowardice of the government, the ideological settler always wears the mantle of a martyr, persecuted by the left-wing elite and the media it ostensibly controls. Although he controls the territories, he likes to be portrayed as a perpetual victim of leftist conspiracies. Although for almost four decades the ideological settler has created a reality about which Israeli voters have never been called on to decide, and in subversive ways has turned the military occupation into civilian control that contradicts every accepted norm in the Western world, he does not cease to cry that he has been robbed.  
In Hebron a situation has been created that is a national disgrace, a genuine sin and crime: Apartheid, as legal scholar Boaz Okun wrote in the weekly Yedioth Ahronoth last week, is already here. But not only in Hebron: The situation in the territories in general and the lawless outposts in particular, along with the theft of private lands, is testimony to the bankruptcy of the state when faced with the daring of the settler and his determination not to retreat before ethical or legal obstacles. In that way the settlement movement is perforce creating daily violations of the law and a culture of violence: Ofra and Beit El may be quiet and pleasant places settled by idealists, but together with their satellite outposts, Amona, Beit Hagedud and Ofra Northeast, Beit El East and Hill 909, they have seized an area that, according to aerial photos and information conveyed to the Peace Now monitoring committee by government authorities, over 90 percent of which is composed of private Palestinian land (figures from October 2006).  
Finally, I would like to make one point clear once and for all, without any connection to the attempt to hurt me, an attempt whose perpetrators could belong to any faction of the extreme right, and not necessarily the settlement movement. In three articles I wrote in May and June of 2001, one of which included a paragraph that was not properly worded, I explained my position regarding the settlers: The lives of Jews living on both sides of the Green Line are "equally precious."   
And in another place: "The settlement movement is a historical disaster, but for now there are people living there whose lives must be protected." In fact, the distinction between individuals whom we must take care of as long as they are there - and the emphasis is on the dimension of temporariness - and the settlement enterprise as an historical phenomenon is essential.  
I have already written in the past in this newspaper, and I repeat it today: If Israeli society is unable to muster the courage necessary to put an end to the settlements, the settlements will put an end to the state of the Jews and will turn it into a binational state.

<title>Divide and save </title>
<date>Fri Sep 12 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
At first, I thought it was a joke. The world is funny, so we laugh, instead of crying. Then I realized that it is serious: Serious people do not repeat the same stupid joke twice. Sari Nusseibeh and Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala) are serious people, and recently they have been bringing up the idea of a binational state: No more two states for two peoples, but rather one state for both. The end of days is preceding history; plowshares and pruning-hooks are replacing swords and spears before they have been beaten at all.  
It is possible to understand them: After 40 years of occupation and oppression, after 15 years of barren negotiations in which an agreement, like the horizon, has grown more distant the nearer one approaches, it is no wonder that people are growing addicted to despair like a narcotic.  
Abu Ala told a Fatah meeting in Ramallah that if Israel continues to block the Palestinian state that is on the way, there will be no choice but to demand a binational state, according to a New York Times report. Not long ago, the Israel-Palestine Center for Research and Information completed a working paper that includes the binational option in case the negotiations collapse. And another group, the Palestine Strategy Study Group, which is funded by the European Union, is suggesting a number of scenarios, including one involving Israel-Palestine under a single sovereignty.  
Sari Nusseibeh is now the prophet of the one-state-for-everyone, for all who dwell between the Jordan River and the sea. His despair is even more uncomfortable and much scarier, because there is no one like him for insight and realism. And if he is sending out distress and warning signals like these, that is a very bad sign for "the process," and there are not very many hopeful people left in the neighborhood.  
A joke is a joke, but this region has a nasty proclivity for fulfilling black prophecies and bad jests. An idea is an idea, but it comes with a problem: It simply has not succeeded anywhere. One state for two ethnic or religious groups is a guarantee of calamity in the Balkan or Caucasian sense, of another Lebanese or Iraqi or Cypriot story - and never mind Africa, which colonialism left in shreds and tatters. Even Belgium seems set to fall apart; even Scotland is playing with musings about independence.  
Is something that has failed everywhere going to succeed in this cursed place, of all places? The more the status quo surrounds itself with barricades, lest it be breached, the more desperate people there will be, both Palestinians and Israelis, who will unwittingly want to establish here what is essentially a bad old South Africa, but without the South African solution. After all, the Jews will never agree to give up their exclusive rule, but a reconstructed apartheid state cannot survive in this day and age - and who would want to live in it willingly?  
The same state for two peoples? There will be one neither for me nor for you. The judgment of this country is the opposite of Solomon's judgment in the case of the two prostitutes living in the same house, because this is the test of one's relationship to the land: The one who seeks to clasp it to his breast and rock it, in one piece, is in fact the one who hates it, whereas the one who wants to amputate large parts of its body - to butcher, to relinquish and to share - is in fact the one who loves it. So divide it, divide it and save it, before we die.

<title>Don't call it apartheid </title>
<date>Thu Jul 17 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Every so often, when the comparison between Israel and the apartheid regime in South Africa is once again in the headlines, I am reminded of the racism conference in Durban in 2001. One incident at that conference, which became a milestone in the struggle to delegitimize Israel, remains engraved in my memory.  
In the last few weeks, during which Israel hosted a delegation of fair-minded people who were in the vanguard of the fight against apartheid, I was reminded of the sights and sounds of that incident: During a demonstration in the streets of Durban, protesters shouted "Amandela intifada!" Amandela is the Zulu word for power and was often used in demonstrations against the minority white regime.  
Since that conference, Israel's enemies have drawn a comparison between these two struggles, in order to argue that Israel - like apartheid - does not have the right to exist. Words and slogans have a power of their own. It is acknowledged that the phrasing of questions in public opinion polls influences the answer and can point the respondent in a certain direction. When one uses the word "apartheid," which, in practice, means the superiority of one race and the inferiority of all others, it is clear that there can be no solution. The only place for regimes such as the apartheid regime in South Africa is the ash heap of history. If Israel's critics compare the Israeli regime to other phenomena, such as colonialism, the only reasonable conclusion is that the comparison is inaccurate at best or malevolent at worst - but they will also learn from history that there is a way out. When dealing with apartheid, there is no point in even trying. The die has been cast.  
There are several countries whose behavior is not approved of by someone or other. In some countries, Jews and Christians are not allowed to hold citizenship, and there are some regimes that prevent women from voting. Is this just? No. Is it apartheid? No. There are some situations where there is an insurmountable gulf between rich and poor, between the educated and the ignorant. If we were to exaggerate the case, there are some countries where it is perfectly acceptable for the state to favor those who support the regime, at the expense of its opponents. Is this hard to stomach? Yes. Is it apartheid? Obviously not. Even countries where there are bloody ethnic struggles are not compared to that most maligned of all regimes. Even if it were possible to find some similarities between a certain regime and the apartheid regime - and it is always possible to find at least one common element - the crux of the issue is different. Only when it comes to Israel and Israel's actions is this comparison used indiscriminately.  
Especially annoying is the way certain people view the roadblocks and the other symbols of Israeli rule, as if they were final proof of the similarity between Israel and South African apartheid. Did Israel erect these roadblocks for no good reason? Is this Israeli-Palestinian conflict devoid of context and history? Are the Palestinians the only ones who suffered? Are we the only ones who must shoulder the blame? Only a fool or an evil person fails to recognize the mistakes and the suffering on both sides. Those who insist on seeing the two situations as identical should be reminded that avoiding harming innocent white civilians was a cornerstone of the struggle for freedom among black South Africans. In addition, apart from some fringe elements, there was no ideology calling for whites to be driven into the sea or to be deported back to wherever they came from.  
When we host delegations from South Africa, or people who take an interest in what is going on here, one cannot help but feel sorrow at the suffering of the sick people waiting at the checkpoints and the cries of "apartheid." Under these circumstances, there is no point in reminding people about the hundreds of thousands of black and colored children who died from malnutrition because the government decided they were not deserving of fresh water, electricity, roads, food or medicine. One can only compare the tools used by those opposing both regimes; one can compare their goals and then decide whether there is any justification to their behavior.  
Not everyone who uses the word apartheid to describe Israel believes that the Zionist enterprise should go the same way as the white minority regime in South Africa. Some want what is best for Israel, regret what Israel does and seek to warn us about the ramifications. But when they choose to use such a loaded expression, they provide additional ammunition to the worst of Israel's enemies. They do not provide them with guns and bullets, but with words to be used on the critical battlefield of international legitimacy.  
I grew up in South Arica and I returned there as Israeli ambassador. In my eyes, using the word apartheid to describe Israel also cheapens the memory of those who died at the hands of that evil regime. We must speak out about the use of such a sorry comparison.

<title> From darkness into light </title>
<date>Tue May 06 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Again we celebrated the holiday of freedom while Gilad Shalit remained in captivity. We spoke of going from darkness into a great light, but left the talks about releasing the abducted soldiers in the dark. We have become accustomed to let our future depend on Shin Bet people who negotiate covertly, and we have stopped asking what we could do to release the abducted soldiers.  
Why not talk with all our neighbors, Hamas, Fatah and Hezbollah, the presidents of Syria and Egypt and the Arab states, about releasing the abducted soldiers, about stopping the Qassam fire, about reconciliation?  
We boast of Israel's democracy and freedom of information, but let the Shin Bet security service direct our reality, although they act in darkness. We have no idea what our future map is, but we have been asked for years not to ask too many questions.  
Since 1967, Israel has imprisoned more than 700,000 Palestinians, about one-fifth of the Palestinian population. According to the last United Nations report, Israel is holding behind bars more than 11,000 Palestinian prisoners, including 118 women and 376 children, who are incarcerated - in violation of international law - outside the occupied territories. The Shin Bet decides which prisoners are to receive visits and which family members will be barred from entering Israel.  
We could release first, as a goodwill gesture, some 800 "administrative" Palestinian prisoners, who have been jailed in Israel for months with no trial. These prisoners, who have not been charged and do not know why they are being jailed for months (sometimes years) with no trial, must be released as the first stage of releasing the political abductees and prisoners. Releasing prisoners can be the first step of a reconciliation process, as it has been in many countries worldwide.  
Reconciliation processes everywhere in the world are not conducted in the dark but in a bright light. They include a public debate on victims' testimonies and public recognition of the pain, rights and compromises made by all the parties concerned. Some 22,000 people testified before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, and millions heard and watched their testimonies on television. Testifying before the committees made it possible for the victims to tell their story and win recognition, enabled many South Africans to hear for the first time about the extent of the apartheid regime's oppression and gave society a chance to deal with the pain of the past in order to build a more just future.  
In Israel the authorities prefer to conduct secret talks and not to hear the Palestinian story. We keep telling the story of our renewed return to the land of our fathers. What is the story of the Palestinians who have lived here, whom this country also belongs to? Why don't we want to hear their story, about the deportation of hundreds of thousands from their homes in 1948, destroying their villages and looting their property? Why shouldn't we hear of their dream to return to their homes in Jaffa and Ramle and Lod? About their life under occupation, when their universities were closed for years at the military governor's order? Why don't we hear about children growing up in crowded homes during months of curfew, about roadblocks and fences and family members being beaten, humiliated and arrested, and life without rights?  
It is time to talk with the Palestinians about the way we will live here together. Is there really nobody to talk to? Why aren't we willing to talk with everyone about everything, about the past, present and future?  
Is it possible that Gilad Shalit is still in captivity and the Qassam fire is continuing not because there is no one to talk to, but because we don't want to hear what the Palestinian leaders have to say? We must speak out loudly and openly with everyone - about the past, present and future, about a life of fair, decent neighborly relations. Without red and green lines and with no prior conditions. Only about how we will live here together and separately, Jews and Arabs, in reconciliation.

<title>Hamas is waiting for Netanyahu</title>
<date>Mon Nov 17 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
According to recent media reports, former Lt.-Gen. Moshe Ya'alon is in talks with Likud chairman Benjamin Netanyahu on the conditions for joining Netanyahu's beehive. In May 1996, at the height of Shimon Peres' campaign for the premiership, Ya'alon stung Netanyahu where it hurts him most: terror and Iran. Ya'alon, who was chief of Military Intelligence at the time, said Iran was encouraging terror organizations to increase their activity to bring about the rise of Likud. Netanyahu defended himself: "If the goal of Iran and of the terror organizations that operate under its aegis is to bring an end to the peace process by means of terror, they will be disappointed. A Likud-led government will continue the peace process in its own way."  
Likud won those elections. Despite the promises, the way in which the "old" Netanyahu (and to be fair, his successors as well) promoted the peace process with the Palestinians (and Syrians) apparently pleased Iran and its partners, first and foremost Hamas.  
Now the "new" Netanyahu is proposing an improved path: It is called "economic peace." Mr. Privatization promises that once economic growth in the Palestinian Authority reaches 10 percent annually, and the change is seen and felt, we will achieve stability on the ground. Instead of discussing issues such as the Temple Mount, borders and refugees, he will talk to the Palestinians about building a civil society.  
Last Wednesday Aluf Benn wrote here ("Give him a chance, Netanyahu will say") that Netanyahu has already managed to interest Barack Obama in his ideas. During their meeting last June in Jerusalem, the new-old claimant to the throne explained to the U.S. visitor that instead of arguing about removing checkpoints, it would be better to create employment opportunities near Palestinian cities and build projects that will get the economy in the territories moving. Jordan and Egypt will probably join the effort, he said.  
According to all the available evidence, Hamas is welcoming Netanyahu's comeback. In an interview about a week ago with the newspaper Al-Arab al-Youm, which was cited on the Muslim Brotherhood Web site, Hamas political leader Khaled Meshal was asked what motivated Jordan to begin talks with  his organization.   
Meshal cited four regional developments working in Hamas' favor: the new Palestinian reality, a result of Hamas' rise and strengthening; the dead-end in the talks on a final-status agreement; the rightward turn in Israeli politics (which threatens Jordan); and the loss of American credibility in the region.  
The idea of replacing the peace talks with methods of conflict management suits Hamas to a tee. To them, an "overall peace" that will improve everyday life is a tahadiyeh (truce). The head of the Hamas government will be happy to sign a new temporary truce with Netanyahu and toss the road map into the trash, along with the Annapolis declaration and Ehud Olmert's maps. Hamas does not even mind if Netanyahu builds new settlements.   
On the contrary, the more Jews there are in the West Bank, the lesser the danger that Greater Israel will remain a Jewish state, and the stronger the chances that it will become a binational state, and eventually Greater Palestine.  
With unconcealed irony, veteran Palestinian columnist Hani al-Masri said during a recent meeting with Israelis that if it is really possible to carry out economic, democratic and security reform under occupation, as Netanyahu proposes, then why not leave the occupation in place?   
In an article in the East Jerusalem newspaper Al-Ayyam, Masri analyzed the reasons for the failure of the Egyptian-mediated reconciliation talks between Hamas and Fatah.   
He claimed that Hamas, which has not succeeded in ending the rule of PA President Mahmoud Abbas before the end of his term in January 2009, has decided to wait for Netanyahu's second term, to start a month later.   
Why should Hamas pay a high price, such as recognizing Israel, wrote Masri, when in a few months from now Netanyahu will be sending Abbas to drink the Dead Sea?  
Obama's reaction to Netanyahu's ideas for an "overall peace" was not available at the time of this writing. We can only hope that America's first black president will remind the Israelis of what happened to the Bantustans - the black enclaves invented by the white apartheid regime in South Africa.   
To ensure that Tehran does not get carried away in its rejoicing, it is important for Obama to point this out even before the polls in divided Jerusalem kick off, and to reveal his peace plan.

<title>If the land isn't private? </title>
<date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Not long ago the greengrocer in Ramallah recalled - between weighing locally grown zucchini and stripped hyssop leaves - that his family owns the land on which the gas station at the old entrance to the Jewish settlement of Beit El in the West Bank is located. He would not be surprised by the figure that the Peace Now movement has succeeded in officially extracting from the defense establishment, after more than a year of fighting for the freedom of information: About one-third of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank (44 out of 120) were built on privately owned Palestinian land that was seized, by means of confiscation orders, for "security needs."  
From the data it emerges that at least 19 of the 44 settlements were built on private land, even after prime minister Menachem Begin decided in 1979 that the construction and expansion of settlements would take place only on state-owned land.  
Peace Now has revealed here another act of hypocrisy, even though the Supreme Court is no longer impressed even by this: It did, after all, legitimize the construction of the settlement of Matityahu on land owned by inhabitants of Bil'in.  
The known fact that settlements are built on private Palestinian lands combines all too well with the general civic and institutional Israeli perception to the effect that Palestinian lands that are not privately owned, or that lack proof of private ownership, belong to the Jewish people in Israel and the Diaspora.  
Under the Israeli approach, which has expanded further since the Oslo Accords, any land that is not private was and remains suitable for Israeli development - for the benefit of the Jewish citizens of the state and for those who have the right to immigrate to Israel under the Law of Return. These are exactly the lands that constitute a considerable part of Area C (which is under Israeli military and administrative responsibility, and holds 60 percent of the area of the West Bank) and prohibited for any Palestinian development. It is on these lands, which are denominated "state lands," that two-thirds of the settlements are built. No less illegally.  
The discussion of whether West Bank lands are privately owned or not reverberates far more loudly than the discussion of Israel's takeover of the Palestinian expanse by means of the closure policy. For example, since February 5, the army has once again severed the towns of the northern West Bank from the rest of the territory by means of roadblocks, and has forbidden males between the ages of 16 and 35 from leaving their towns. The media don't report on this.  
The discussion of private land reverberates well in the Israeli (and American) media because of the exaggerated sanctification of private property. And now, Peace Now must correct its initial report of October 2006, in which it was stated that 86 percent of the area of Ma'aleh Adumim is private Palestinian land. It emerges that only .05 percent of Ma'aleh Adumim is private land.  
Nonetheless, this non-ideological Jewish settlement is among the most damaging to the Palestinians, and it reinforces the regime of apartheid roads: It cuts the northern part of the West Bank off from the southern part, and prevents Palestinian territorial contiguity. The road that leads to Ma'aleh Adumim will soon be closed to Palestinians, who will be diverted to a separate, narrow and winding road. This Jewish settlement has caused the banishment of many Bedouin from their lands and their ways of life. Together with the adjacent Jewish settlements and the separation barrier, it has taken over lands that had served the Palestinian towns and villages in the area, their natural reserve for development and expansion.  
And so what if this is land that was not registered as private? Because of this robbery, these villages and towns have become crowded, choking neighborhoods that are cut off from the larger expanse.  
The extensive work that Peace Now has invested in exposing the private ownership of lands is a mirror image of the extensive and systematic effort of Civil Administration experts to prevent inhabitants of the villages from cultivating their lands beyond the separation barrier. They measure out for each individual his part in an inheritance and in accordance with this, they allot him the hours during which he may pass through the gate to harvest olives or to plow the land. They prevent shared cultivation of the land and calculate which of the siblings in a family is abroad so that, heaven forfend, his share of the land will not be cultivated by others.  
All of this is a preliminary step to expropriate land that remains "without owners" and its transformation in the future into state land - that is, Jews' land.  
The exaggerated concentration on private ownership feeds into the Israeli denial of the fact that the Palestinians' right is to all of the territory that has been occupied. Not as private individuals, but rather because they constitute an indigenous national group in this land.

<title>It stinks </title>
<date>Fri Aug 15 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>

What is actually new about that invention that scatters demonstrations and is called "The Skunk"? It has a "source in the Border Police" waxing lyrical: "Here the effect is tremendous. People can't stand themselves and they leave the site." For over 40 years we've been stinking, in the words of the Border Policeman, we can still tolerate ourselves and we have yet to leave.  
Colonel Amir Baram just ended his term as commander of the Samaria Brigade. In a summarizing report, he identifies Daniella Weiss of Kedumim and Gabi Ben Zimra of Ma'aleh Levona as "major provocateurs," and warns of the harm caused by the gangs of settlers, which is steadily escalating without anyone stopping it.  
In contrast, another brigade commander, one Udi Ben Moha, who began his tour of duty three months ago, identifies the provocateurs elsewhere; he wakes up to work on the left side: Were it not for the presence of the leftist groups in Hebron and its satellites, in his opinion, the city of apartheid would be a model of coexistence.  
How is it that such a huge gap separates two brigade commanders? The occupation is the same occupation, the Palestinians are the same Palestinians and the settlers are the same settlers. There is no real difference between the strong-armed men in Yitzhar and the empty-headed ones in Hebron. The explanation is simple: One brigade commander is leaving the territories, the other is just beginning.  
Baram, free and carefree, can permit himself to describe the reality as it is, to tell the truth he did not tell previously; poor Ben Moha has no choice but to distort. He knows, does the Hebron brigade commander, that his future lies not with the leftists but with the settlers; only they are capable of determining the fate of his career, for better or worse.  
The Israel Defense Forces is the traditional collaborator of Rabbi Moshe Levinger and his sons and grandsons, and must adapt itself to the smell of the surroundings. Thus, one brigade commander decided to rid himself of the odor as he left, whereas his colleague is fated to putrefy in his tent.  
Who are we to complain about a poor officer with a miserable job, if the defense minister himself exudes a bad smell over his surroundings; he, too, lives and draws strength from the mouths of settlers. He has promised the High Court of Justice a thousand times to evacuate the outpost of Migron, which was born in sin and lives in crime, and failed to keep his promise. Now he will move the outpost by a few hundred meters, but not before all the new houses are built, another vision for evacuation and construction. It is not Ehud Barak's first rotten agreement with the heads of the Yesha (Judea and Samaria) families, and which he will make the judges swallow. The High Court, its tresses shorn, will also swallow whatever Barak feeds it.  
This week "baseless hatred" made another round on the furrowed back of Tisha B'Av. Pay attention to the chronicles as they really occurred, and not as they were distorted deliberately or by mistake. Messianic fanatics were the ones who caused the destruction of the Temple, and they are the sons of Belial, the rabble rousers of Hebron and Yitzhar and Havot Gilad and Ma'aleh Levona. And the leaders were scared to death of them; thus, due to the sins of the Sicarii [Jewish extremists during the Temple period] and their fallen vassals, we were exiled from our land. Many are already in exile.

<title>Jews who are a danger to Zionism </title>
<date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
To the eternal question as to which U.S. presidential candidate is better for the Jews, there is a Jewish answer. In other words, a question. Two questions actually. The first: "What's good for the Jews?" and the second: "For which Jews?"  
For example, this weekend the New York Times reported that at next month's Arab League conference in Damascus, the offer of Arab normalization with Israel in exchange for an end to the occupation will be reevaluated. Is this a good or a bad thing? It depends which Jews you ask.  
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert says that the most important and urgent issue for Jews is the establishment of a Palestinian state over most of the territories. He argues that if we do not find a way to divide the land into two states, as soon as possible, it will become a binational state. In other words, according to Olmert, an American president who is opposed to a final settlement agreement with the Palestinians is a threat to Zionism.  
On the other hand, Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu claims that a president who pushes for a Palestinian state is supporting the creation of a "terrorist entity" that would threaten the existence of the Jewish state. Netanyahu feels at home with American politicians from the camp of evangelist Pat Robertson, who said on a television program a few hours after Ariel Sharon collapsed, that this was Sharon's punishment for "dividing the holy land which belongs to God."  
Olmert has come to be the senior representative of the viewpoint that the settlements are an obstacle to the future success of Zionism. As such, President Bush Sr. was better for the Jews than his son, the incumbent. The father withheld U.S. loan guarantees for immigrant absorption as punishment for prime minister Yitzhak Shamir's refusal to freeze settlement activity during peace negotiations. On the other hand, Bush Jr. is making do with recycled Olmert promises to respect the commitments of his predecessor, Sharon, and to remove the illegal outposts.  
Notwithstanding Bush's vision of two states from June 2002 and his April 2004 letter to Sharon, which never got off the paper, these documents have great significance. They sealed the debate among the mainstream in the U.S. as to the preferable solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The principles guiding Bush are not substantively different from the formula his predecessor, Bill Clinton, laid out toward the end of his term.  
Between the carefully crafted statements of the three presidential candidates it is possible to discern that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John McCain also lack a more successful solution than the establishment of two states along the 1967 borders, with agreed changes to their precise location, and a fair and realistic solution to the refugee problem.  
Commitment to Israel's security has remained the litmus test for the title "friend of Israel." The Arabists in the American establishment, those who doubted Israel's right to exist securely, threw in the towel a long time ago. The three candidates surrounded themselves with advisers who consider peace with the Arabs to be the key to safeguarding Israel's security. They believe that resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict will bolster the pragmatists among the Arabs in their struggle with extremist Islam.  
According to the current Israeli government, the title "friend of Israel" is reserved for an American president who will not make do with paying lip service to a "political horizon" and who will place the Zionist challenge of two states at the top of his daily agenda.  
However, according to the Jewish establishment, the element that liaises between Israel and the decision makers in the U.S., a "friend of Israel" is an American who allows Israelis and Arabs to spill their blood on the way to a solution of one state or apartheid rule. People, for example, like the evangelist Gary Bauer, who ran eight years ago in the Republican primaries.  
The powerful pro-Israeli lobby, AIPAC, does not really bother to rally in favor of a two-state solution. AIPAC invited Bauer to speak during one of its annual conferences. The guest of honor reminded the applauding audience, "God granted the Land of Israel to the Jewish people and there is an absolute ban on giving it away to another people."  
Bauer is considered by Jewish politicos (who, according to polls, are far from representative of the majority in the Jewish community) to be a "friend of Israel." On the other hand, Obama lost his title in their eyes because Robert Malley, who was one of President Clinton's advisers on the Middle East and dedicated to promoting peace - was seen at his campaign headquarters.  
The prime minister has said that without a two-state solution, "Israel is finished." Jewish organizations say that they support the government of Israel, whatever its policy may be. So, who is a good Jew? The person who supports the candidate who calls for a Palestinian state, or the one who voted for the one who is opposed to it?

You reported on December 9, 2008, "Poll: Most Israelis think human rights groups hostile to their country." The report notes that "89 percent of Israelis attribute great importance to human rights and the protection of them." The article did not mention, however, that the poll was commissioned by NGO Monitor (together with Bar-Ilan University), and that the results reflect the findings of NGO Monitor's detailed research on human rights NGOs. The poll found that Israelis care deeply about human rights, but do not trust NGOs to safeguard them. NGO Monitor has chronicled the consistent use of double standards and selective application of international law by some organizations that claim benevolent agendas.  
In the context of continuing NGO campaigns against Israel's response to rocket attacks from Gaza, and the lead up to the Durban Review Conference in 2009, there has never been a more important time to "watch the watchers."

In its deliberations prior to nominating Shahar Zubari Israel's sportsman hero of the year, did the Olympic Committee of Israel ask itself how it would have reacted had another nation's Olympics committee bestowed a similar honor on an athlete who publicly, and in print, only a couple of months previously insulted the Jewish People in language even remotely as coarse as that employed by Zubari in his description of the Chinese? If that were to happen, protests of anti-Semitism would and should ring out, far and wide, particularly from the Olympic Committee of Israel.  
In view of our own historic experience of racial slurs, the Jewish State and its various representative organs should surely display sensitivity to the feelings of other peoples and desist from glorifying such a sportsman as a national hero and model for Israel's sportsmen, perhaps even going so far as to suspend him from representing our state and its sports for a period of time as penitence.

UN Human Rights High Commissioner Navanethem Pillay is wrong to admonish Canada and Israel for their dissociation from the fiasco that will be the Durban Review Conference. Justifiably dubbed "Durban II", the DRC will pick up where the original conference left off, providing yet another smokescreen to help regimes such as Iran, Libya and Cuba camouflage their own serial human rights violations.  
Understanding that malevolent forces had already derailed the DRC, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper made the principled decision to pull out of the hopelessly politicized and corrupt international forum. Israel has now followed suit and hopefully others will as well.  
Pillay suggests that in 2001 the states at the conference "assuaged" the concerns about the "denigration" of Israel by taking the high road in passing a framework for combating international racism. It did no such thing. The Durban process has generated seven years of unrelenting demonization of Israel and hate-filled attacks on the founding principles of Zionism. The Durban strategy has married calls for boycotts of this putative "apartheid state" with the promotion of a blinkered version of racism that begins and ends with Islamophobia.  
The planning documents for the DRC have already gutted Mr. Pillay's great opportunity to further the international anti-racism agenda. He asks, "What message does a state boycott [of the DRC] send to those who are suffering from racism?" Here's his answer: It is time for all democratic nations to admonish those egregious human rights violators behind Durban II who have hijacked the DRC from the outset because promoting their narrow vision of hatred is more important than confronting the world's legitimate human rights needs. By denying legitimacy to the farce that is the DRC, the world will make a statement that impunity and impotence no longer trump accountability and action. Thus, the global community will assert that purposeful international action to combat racism and xenophobia can no longer be sacrificed to satisfy visceral hatred of Israel, the West and the Jewish people.

<title>Netanyahu the devil </title>
<date>Sun Aug 10 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
They're playing that old tune again: Anybody but Benjamin ("they're-afffraid") Netanyahu. Shaul Mofaz loves peace, Tzipi Livni will end the occupation, Ehud Barak will treat the Palestinians like human beings. Only Netanyahu will bring disaster. Once again, the political fashion is to discuss how to stop the king of the opinion polls and the prince of disaster.  
The Likud chairman's demonization by the Anti-Netanyahu Defense League is not new. It has one goal: presenting all the other candidates as better, because they are so different from the devil Netanyahu. It is an old, tried-and-true method in Israeli discourse: For example, we will fight the "illegal outposts," thus koshering all the other, meticulously "legal" settlements. Just as there is no difference between Ariel and Asael - both are patently illegal - there is no real difference between Netanyahu and all the other candidates. None is a harbinger of peace or the end of the occupation, but only Netanyahu is painted in frightening hues, thus rendering the others kosher.  
Netanyahu, the man of our nightmares, met with Yasser Arafat, signed the Hebron agreement and did not bring peace. The prime ministers who succeeded him - Ehud Barak, Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert - did not lead Israel even one step closer to peace. Netanyahu did open the Western Wall Tunnel, a fiasco that ended with dozens killed. And who was his partner in that move? Olmert, then mayor of Jerusalem, who has never been as horrifying as Netanyahu. True, Olmert's rhetoric as prime minister was much more pleasant to peace-loving ears than Netanyahu's; he conducted negotiations, he was hospitable to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and he even sent emissaries to Turkey to conduct talks with Syria. But what did we get out of all that? More settlements, and more brutal occupation. Netanyahu, at least, did not set off on a useless, foolish war.  
The point of these arguments is not to praise Netanyahu. According to his declared ideology, he supports a one-state solution, an eternal apartheid state. But how the devil is he different from the others? Mofaz, for example, should frighten us much more: His hands have a great deal more blood on them than this scary Netanyahu has. While Netanyahu dispatched a representative to the Sryian president and sent out feelers about an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, Mofaz pledges "peace for peace," insults our intelligence, and actually promises another war in the north. The father of assassinations, he turned the Israel Defense Forces into a vengeful gang in the occupied territories. In any proper country Mofaz would have long ago been delegitimized because of his responsibility for what are considered war crimes elsewhere in the world. If he is elected prime minister, he will not be able to visit certain countries for fear of being arrested. Neither has anyone settled accounts with him over his part in the IDF's unpreparedness for the last war. But even Mofaz is not as frightening as Netanyahu.  
Barak's current term as defense minister does not give us reason to fear him any less than Netanyahu: This was a period of disproportionate and unbridled killing in Gaza. This is the man who invented the false no-partner theory and smashed the remnants of the Israeli peace camp. And now he is even going back to using that rusty and criminal weapon - demolishing terrorists' homes - in the name of the Israeli labor and peace movement. Can everyone who was shocked by Netanyahu's cruel capitalism depend on Barak? Has anyone ever caught this social democrat improving the welfare of anyone who was not his neighbor in a luxury high-rise? And yet, even he is not as frightening as Netanyahu.  
And what about Livni? She is certainly not as fearsome as Netanyahu. But she, too, thinks that talks with Syria and the Palestinians are moving too fast. After 40 years of occupation and bloodshed, Olmert's turtle-like pace is too fast for his "moderate" foreign minister.  
That is the choice. That is the arsenal of candidates seeking to succeed Olmert. None speak in the name of any ideology whatsoever. A past prime minister who failed at his post and brought about the second intifada; a former chief of staff and defense minister, a cruel military man, who fanned the flames and knows only how to sow destruction and death; a mild-mannered foreign minister who has not advanced peace in any way; and Netanyahu - the person everyone loves to hate. No worse than his fellow candidates, but immeasurably more persecuted. The media embraces Livni, accepts Mofaz as legitimate, sometimes supports Barak, but is terrified only by Netanyahu. Why?

<title>No less dangerous than anti-Semitism</title>
<date>Wed Apr 30 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Of all the Western countries, it is those in Europe - and European public opinion even more so than those countries' leaders - that are the most critical of Israel's policies in the territories. Opinion polls conducted in Europe repeatedly point to Israel as one of the greatest dangers to world peace, and one of the greatest violators of human rights. In a survey of this kind carried out in July 2007, some 45% of Europeans compared Israel's policies in the territories to those of the apartheid regime in South Africa.  
Parallel to this, European countries have been prominent in the past decade in marking the Holocaust. They have dealt extensively with their own roles during the period of extermination and expressed regret over collaboration during the time of the extermination, or over the looting of Jewish property after that.  
This duality is so obvious that there are many Jews and Israelis who try to claim that the commemoration and the criticism are two sides of the same coin which tries to relieve Europe of the heavy cloak of guilt that covers it. On the one hand Europe admits to its past and asks for forgiveness, and on the other hand it attacks the Jewish state and in this way creates some kind of "moral balance" between it and that Europe, as if to say 'when you have the power it turns out that you are no better'. Many others regard the excessive criticism of Israel as some sort of anti-Semitism.  
But one fact spoils this theory: Israel is not alone in facing the arrows of European criticism, but rather stands alongside the United States. Uncle Sam is also constantly attacked by European public opinion for having aggressive policies; the clearest example of the past few years being, of course, the American invasion and control of Iraq.  
And indeed there is a common denominator to the European criticism of Israel and the U.S., and this common denominator apparently also stems from the lessons of that war. It is the phenomenon of European pacifism, the desire to avoid the use of any kind of force, to avoid any forceful confrontation even with evil regimes.   
This instinct is particularly salient when talking about a confrontation of a Western country with a society from the developing world, such as the confrontation between the U.S. and Iraq or between Israel and the Palestinians.  
That is because another European instinct then comes into play, one that also belongs to the history of their colonialist heritage. This instinct guides the Europeans to identify any conflict between the West and the developing world as a colonialist conflict in which one must identify with the underdog, the one who seems to be weak. In that context, Israel is indeed discriminated against by the criticism leveled at it; not necessarily because it is a Jewish state, but rather mainly because it is a Western state.  
That is to say, the European sin is not anti-Semitism but rather pacifism, especially when dealing with the Europeans' attitude toward force on the part of a Western country. But this is not a sin that is any less dangerous than anti-Semitism. It was precisely the Holocaust that proved how dangerous silent acceptance was, even if accompanied with the most lofty excuses of preventing war and bringing "peace in our time" in the face of the forces of evil threatening openly to gain control, ruin and destroy - such are also the forces of fundamentalist Islam of our day.   
World War II also proved that at the end of the day, this kind of policy is not effective - it merely raises to a great extent the price that will have to be paid in order to deal with the forces of evil when they grow even stronger. With the means of mass destruction existing today, who knows if it will not be too late.  
In this sense, there is apparently a deep connection between the Europeans' pacifism and the low birth rates on the continent; both of them indicate a policy of "eat and make merry because tomorrow we may die;" a deep lack of trust in life in the long run because the wish to live - which is not merely that of an individual but rather of the civilization in which he lives - does indeed demand victims.   
It requires the effort that is involved in raising children as well as the effort and the risk involved with waging a war on behalf of the values of freedom or on behalf of a national and sovereign existence so that these may be ensured for generations to come. This is true in Europe just as it is true in Israel.

<title>No need for the A-word </title>
<date>Fri Jul 25 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
In "Don't Call it Apartheid" (Haaretz English edition, July 17), Tova Herzl takes issue with the use of the word "apartheid" to describe the situation in Israel. In particular, she implies that the recent South African human rights delegation to Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank - of which I was a member - indeed came to such a conclusion. As a group, we did no such thing.  
Instead, we sought to move beyond mere labels and focus on the manner and extent to which Israel is separating Palestinians and Israelis within the West Bank, the impact of the tools of separation on Palestinians in particular and the broader impact of the occupation on all. And in so doing, it was often impossible to avoid making comparisons with apartheid South Africa.  
Whether motivated by legitimate security considerations, fear, mistrust or sheer prejudice, the occupation's physical manifestations - including distinct identity cards, number plates and roads, as well as checkpoints, electronic fences and concrete walls - result in a degree of separation far in excess of what was achieved in South Africa. This separation speaks for itself, whether or not one categorizes it as apartheid.  
As a human rights lawyer who believes in the rule of law, I was particularly troubled by the existence of two separate - and highly unequal - systems of law operating in the West Bank. To be fair, all conduct of the military commander is subject to review by the High Court of Justice. Yet jurisdiction in all other matters is personal, with Israeli settlers having access to a modern, rights-based legal system and Palestinians being subject to the authority of military courts.  
Under apartheid, the legal system was used as a central tool in enforcing an unequal system based solely on race. In the occupied West Bank, separate legal systems are integral to the differential treatment of persons based solely on nationality. It is one thing to apply Israeli law to all citizens and residents of Israel within its internationally recognized borders; it is quite another to apply that law to Israeli citizens who choose to settle unlawfully in occupied territory.  
Our deliberate focus on the occupation meant that we did not consider any particular "solution" to the conflict. As a group, we expressed no opinion on whether a future peace agreement should be based on a two-state solution, in accordance with international law; a single binational state; or some other hybrid or federal form. Instead, we agreed on the need for and the right of both Israelis and Palestinians to live in a democratic and secular state that enshrines civil, political and socio-economic rights for all who live within its boundaries.  
At no point did we seek to "delegitimize" Israel. Nor did we try to reduce the complexity of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to a single concept, recognizing that no one needs to make use of the A-word to draw attention to the horror of the occupation. In particular, we recognized that the apartheid analogy provides Israel's unquestioning supporters with a convenient diversion. Instead of engaging the substantive issues, such as the legality of the settlements and the route and effect of the separation barrier, Herzl regretfully homes in on the red herring.

<title>No need to wait for Russia or China </title>
<date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
The permanent members of the United Nations Security Council are currently talking with Germany about formulating a resolution on more sanctions against Iran. As in past years, the United States and the European Union do not see eye to eye with Russia and China, which are opposed to severe sanctions against Tehran.  
The reasons are obvious. President Vladimir Putin's Russia has returned to the Soviet policy of the past, under which America's friends are Russia's enemies and vice versa. Thus, Iran has become Russia's close friend. Furthermore, little help can be expected from China on this issue. Its dependence on Iran for energy is total and was greatly increased by its accelerated growth in the last decade. A few years ago, the two nations signed an agreement whereby China will pay Iran $75 billion to supply it with natural gas over the next 30 years - the largest such contract in history.  
We must ask ourselves whether there is any point in waiting for Sino-Russian consent, or whether the two countries should simply be overlooked on this issue. In my opinion, waiting would be unnecessary and ineffective, and would not achieve the hoped-for result, namely, making Iran abandon its military nuclear project.  
Iran's trade with Russia is negligible: only 2 percent of its total international trade. Therefore, Russia's participation in the sanctions will not step up economic pressure on Iran. On the other hand, China does not interfere in international disputes that do not affect it directly. China never has vetoed any Security Council resolutions that did not affect its interests. Furthermore, its dependence on Iran is greater.  
There is no point in waiting. The U.S. and the EU can reach a clear, unequivocal and immediately implementable decision. Since most of Iran's international trade is with the U.S. and the EU, the decision to impose severe sanctions will have a strong, hard impact. Iran is already feeling the pinch of economic pressure. Recent decisions by a number of American states, forbidding pension funds from investing in companies operating in or conducting business with Iran, already are having an effect. The same can be said for the recent decisions by European and American banks to cancel the credit lines of Iranian companies and international corporations that do business with or operate in Iran.  
These decisions, which exert an economic stranglehold, already have caused considerable agitation in the Iranian business community, many of whose members fear that the international sword is now resting on their neck. The Tehran government already has decided to transfer a large chunk of its deposits from dollars to gold, in preparation for tougher times ahead.  
Iran's economic hardships are beginning to become apparent. The decision to ration fuel - each private vehicle is limited to 100 liters per month - is one tangible result. While it has one of the world's largest oil reserves, Iran must refine its oil in foreign refineries. The rationing of fuel has sparked great bitterness, a wave of protests and acts of arson against hundreds of service stations. Furthermore, the recent student riots are worrying Tehran and underscoring a complex problem that its leaders are now facing. Undoubtedly, the sanctions are working. In my opinion, they are the best option.  
In posing a threat to Israel's very survival, Iran markedly differs from Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad or even Syria. Thus, Israel must do everything possible to prevent Iran from acquiring a military nuclear capability. Israel can, and must, prepare for every option. Nevertheless, the alternatives are clear. The military option is problematic, complex and fraught with dangers. Certainly, the report published by the American intelligence community has tied President George W. Bush's hands and seriously narrowed his prospects of ordering an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.  
The question is: What should Israel do? Israel attacked the Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak in 1981, but today's situation is very different - Iran has many more nuclear facilities than Iraq had at the time. Moreover, Iran is further from Israel than Iraq, and in order to reach Iran, Israeli fighter jets will have to fly over friendly neighboring countries, which in itself is a problem.  
This does not mean, however, that Israel should not make the necessary preparations for the military option. Israel should be ready for any possible scenario. Yet it must also realize that sanctions are a much better and more realistic option. Economic sanctions have an impact, and have caused regimes to capitulate. They worked on South Africa's apartheid regime and on Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi, and will soon force North Korea to radically change its policies.  
Global resoluteness and tightening sanctions against Tehran will force it to capitulate as well, and to abandon its ambitious program to develop a nuclear bomb.

<title>Our debt to Jimmy Carter </title>
<date>Tue Apr 15 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
The government of Israel is boycotting Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States, during his visit here this week
The boycott will not be remembered as a glorious moment in this government's history. Jimmy Carter has dedicated his life to humanitarian missions, to peace, to promoting democratic elections, and to better understanding between enemies throughout the world. Recently, he was involved in organizing the democratic elections in Nepal, following which a government will be set up that will include Maoist guerrillas who have laid down their arms. But Israelis have not liked him since he wrote the book "Palestine: Peace not Apartheid."  
Israel is not ready for such comparisons, even though the situation begs it. It is doubtful whether it is possible to complain when an outside observer, especially a former U.S. president who is well versed in international affairs, sees in the system of separate roads for Jews and Arabs, the lack of freedom of movement, Israel's control over Palestinian lands and their confiscation, and especially the continued settlement activity, which contravenes all promises Israel made and signed, a matter that cannot be accepted. The interim political situation in the territories has crystallized into a kind of apartheid that has been ongoing for 40 years. In Europe there is talk of the establishment of a binational state in order to overcome this anomaly. In the peace agreement with Egypt, 30 years ago, Israel agreed to "full autonomy" for the occupied territories, not to settle there.  
These promises have been forgotten by Israel, but Carter remembers.  
Whether Carter's approach to conflict resolution is considered by the Israeli government as appropriate or defeatist, no one can take away from the former U.S. president his international standing, nor the fact that he brought Israel and Egypt to a signed peace that has since held. Carter's method, which says that it is necessary to talk with every one, has still not proven to be any less successful than the method that calls for boycotts and air strikes. In terms of results, at the end of the day, Carter beats out any of those who ostracize him. For the peace agreement with Egypt, he deserves the respect reserved for royalty for the rest of his life.

<title>Palestinian revenge was inevitable</title>
<date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Last week's bombing in Dimona was the first martyrdom operation committed by Hamas in more than five years. For some time, we have been warning the world that the relentless pressure on our people would eventually tell. In the last two months, more than a hundred people have been killed by the Israeli occupation forces in the Gaza Strip, including many civilians, women and children.  
Thirty people have died in the last month for lack of medical care brought on by the embargo. Only two weeks ago, we saw the appalling sight of over 40 women and children seriously injured when an Israeli F-16 dropped an enormous bomb in the middle of the densely populated Gaza City, a few meters from a wedding party. This kind of atrocity, piled onto the daily death toll, has finally tested the patience of Palestinians, and after lengthy restraint, revenge was inevitable.  
To many in Israel and the West, this act of resistance will be judged in isolation. They will no doubt say that it justifies the inhumane embargo on the people of Gaza and the arrests of more than 500 people and daily torture of innocents in the West Bank by both Israelis and the puppet government imposed on us by the U.S.  
What they seem to forget is that just in the last two years, 2,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action and thousands more injured. The cold-blooded fact is that the ratio of Palestinian deaths to Israelis is now over 40 to 1.  
The Hamas-led government has consistently called for a long-term cease-fire. For nine months before the election that brought us to power we observed a unilateral ceasefire, ensuring that no rockets were fired from Gaza by our movement. We observed this policy during the first six months in government, despite the fact that our words and actions were summarily dismissed by the Israelis and their U.S. allies.  
If the people of Sderot want to know why rockets continue to land around them, they should ask their own government why it has continually rejected our calls for a cease-fire and continued its policy of daily incursions and reckless targeting that put the whole population at risk.  
We have tried consistently to create some kind of reconciliation with Fatah. But every attempt has been ignored by Abu Mazen [Mahmoud Abbas]. The threat by Israel and the U.S. to cease negotiations if he cooperates with the lawfully elected Hamas government has led to political impotence in Ramallah. This makes our citizens deeply cynical about the peace process. It makes them feel that Israel is simply exploiting the situation and Abu Mazen.  
The cranes and bulldozers are still busy in the settlements on our land in the West Bank. Neither is there any sign that the numerous checkpoints that are crippling our economy and social life are being dismantled. While Abu Mazen and Olmert talk of a final agreement, the apartheid wall continues to be erected on land that should be part of any future Palestinian state.  
If our people can see no genuine and realistic political or economic horizon and their attempts to establish a genuine truce are consistently rejected, it is inevitable that they will turn to resistance as the only outlet for their anger and frustration. What happened at Rafah recently is a sign of what is likely to happen on a much larger scale if people can see no end to the relentless pressure and aggression that is part of our daily life here in Gaza.  
While in the past we acknowledged the right of Abu Mazen to negotiate on behalf of our people, we believe that he has forfeited this mandate, as he no longer commands the respect of the majority of our people. Given the facts on the ground and the total mistrust that now prevails on all sides, we believe neither Israelis nor Palestinians are ready for final-status negotiations. It would be disastrous if the international community were to try to impose this, especially while we remain divided as a Palestinian people.  
We have consistently suggested that the best solution to our problems is a long-term cease-fire that provides both sides with the space and opportunity to address our differences in an atmosphere of calmness and normality. We can have little optimism for the immediate future when it is impossible to see any clear light at the end of the tunnel that we are now forced to inhabit.  
The writer is a senior political advisor to the foreign minister in the Hamas government.

<title>Refreshing pocket of resistance </title>
<date>Fri May 30 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
The German Left Party, the successor to the East German Socialist Unity Party, which refused to recognize Israel between 1949 and 1989, is hardly a bastion of support for the Jewish state. Nothing more than "New Year's firecrackers" was the phrase invoked by Norman Paech, a parliament member from the Left Party, as well as its foreign policy spokesman, following his trip to the Palestinian territories in late April, to play down the danger of Hamas missiles that have been fired on Israeli cities since the evacuation of the Gaza Strip. Paech says "there is no anti-Semitism in the Mideast," and though he acknowledges the sentiment does exist in Germany, he argues that its cause is Israeli militarism. He has an affinity for employing Nazi terminology when describing Israel in the German media.  
Yet a refreshing pocket of resistance has formed within the Left Party, whose members seek a sharp break with the prevailing anti-Israeli posture characteristic of Germany's third-largest political party. The BAK Shalom Working Group (BAK is from the German word Bundesarbeitskreis, meaning "federal working group"), a pro-Israel group within the Left Party's young members federation, demanded Paech's immediate resignation from his position in an opinion piece published by the popular Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel earlier this month. Benjamin Kruger, a BAK Shalom spokesman, told me that Paech sees "Hamas as an ally of the Left Party," whereas BAK Shalom views it "as a terror organization." He added that the 60-member BAK Shalom, a caucus made up of students, young professionals and working people under 35, aims to advance a "platform against anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism, anti-Americanism and regressive capitalism."  
While BAK is attempting to dissolve prejudices against Israel in a bottom-up fashion, the co-chairman of the Left Party, Gregor Gysi, a dynamic political personality and gifted speaker, delivered a dense 16-page speech in mid-April to members of the Left Party-aligned Rosa Luxemburg Foundation at an event marking Israel's 60th anniversary. Declaring that, "anti-Zionism can no longer be a tenable position for the German left in general, nor for the Left Party," Gysi wiped more salt into the open wound of the anti-Israeli Left by asserting that Israel's existence ought to be defined by his party as part of Germany's "national interest."  
The reactions were predictably unsettling. "I consider it legitimate to be against Zionism. After all, it has apartheid-like characteristics," said Ulla Jelpke, a leading Left Party member of the Bundestag. Her former employer, the neo-Stalinist left daily junge Welt, whose coverage of Israel drips with hostility, wrote, "With his commitment to Zionism, Gregor Gysi overturned coordinated left-wing foreign policy." Responding to Jelpke, Sebastian Voigt, a co-founder of BAK, cited the contemporary relevance of the Austrian Jew Jean Amery's comment about the German Left in the late 1960s: "Anti-Zionism contains anti-Semitism like a cloud contains a storm."  
The origin of the shifting plate tectonics in the left can be traced to the Second Lebanon War in 2006. While the Left Party executive committee member Wolfgang Gehrcke placed himself in the front row of a demonstration with 2000 anti-Israel supporters in Berlin that August, in which such slogans as "No room for Israel" and "Hezbollah until victory" were ubiquitous, Katja Kipping, a 30-year-old Left Party member of parliament from the southern city of Dresden, issued a position paper castigating the anti-Zionism and so-called "anti-imperialism" of the party. Already then, Kipping called on the party to move "beyond its anti-Zionism."  
Kipping and BAK Shalom represent wings of the same nondogmatic leftist segment of the party that seeks to dismantle the Left Party myth that Israel's existence represents an outpost of American-style imperialism in the Middle East. Yet journalist and writer Tjark Kunstreich, a seasoned observer of leftist politics in Germany, told me that the pro-Israel position is still "marginal" within the Left Party. In fact, he criticized Gysi for failing to completely divorce the party from its anti-Zionism. Kunstreich said that even if "Israel is a fact" for Gysi, the Left Party leader still has not brought himself to say, "We view the Israel project as good."  
"We need a clear 'yes' to the recognition of the State of Israel," said the party's parliamentary secretary Dagmar Enkelmann. That the discussion revolves around accepting the State of Israel shows that the overwhelming majority of the Left Party's rank-and-file and leadership is still stuck in the Middle Ages. Nevertheless, Ilan Mor, the charge d'affaires at Israel's Berlin Embassy, says that such pro-Israel voices as BAK and Kipping's are welcome. Mor participated in a panel discussion with BAK members celebrating Israel's 60th anniversary in early May.  
According to a late-March poll, the Left Party has the support of 13 percent of German voters, and, following its string of local state election victories in Hamburg, Lower Saxony and Hesse this year, it is a force that must be reckoned with. As a result of those victories, the Left Party added 3,000 new members, and now has a card-carrying membership base of 73,455 (compared to some 530,000 each for both the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats). The strength of the Left Party in regions of Eastern Germany has contributed to the coalition governments in such federal states as Berlin, where the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Left co-govern.  
It's still too early to tell whether the Left's apparent softening toward Israel is the sign of a permanent change. At the Party's convention last weekend, neither a resolution nor a discussion to abandon its anti-Israeli platform was on the Party's agenda. Kunstreich analyzed the conference as a "defeat" for the pro-Israel strand within the Left Party because there was "no sign" that the membership "shares the position" of BAK. The Left Party reinforced its opposition to sending German troops to Afghanistan, and its reelected co-chairman, Oskar Lafontaine, a former chairman of the SPD before he defected to the Left Party, continues to flirt with the mullah regime in Iran. He has not spoken out against the possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran, and it was only internal party pressure that forced him to cancel a visit with Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Iran in 2006 because his presence would have coincided with the Iranian Holocaust-denial conference, thus sidestepping a public relations debacle for the Left Party. A plan to introduce a motion at the party convention to condemn the "serious human rights violations" in Iran, and "tie the economic relationship with an improved human rights situation" did not get off the ground.  
The disturbingly warm relations between their party and the Islamic regime is an overriding priority for BAK Shalom. "The discussion of these issues has begun. BAK Shalom will do everything to accelerate it. Developments in the Left Party should be exciting," wrote co-founder Voigt in the Tagesspiegel piece this month.

<title>Spotlight on the lesser evil </title>
<date>Sun Aug 03 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>

The Olmert affair has come and all but gone. A few more invoices here and some daggers there will be hurled at the hemorrhaging political corpse hanging in the town square, and Ehud Olmert will disappear into the sunset. A hedonistic, spendthrift prime minister, a relatively small-time, corrupt man who, like many others, did not know where to the draw the line between public and private money and who - like many of his colleagues in the upper crust of government - thought that a politician deserves everything, is going home. Olmert and his transgressions will be remembered as a footnote in history.  
Contrary to the typically passionate claims of a few self-styled protectors of the law, Olmert's conduct did not for one second endanger the rule of law in Israel; it did not threaten its form of government, nor did it undermine the state's foundations. Far more serious acts of corruption have been committed. Much greater dangers stalk and ultimately threaten the rule of law, and our democracy is fissured and fragile due to other phenomena. It isn't the Rishon Tours affair, nor the house on Cremieux Street, nor the Talanskys of this world, nor the cronyism and patronage in the Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry that shape the state's character. On the contrary, the manner in which the relevant instruments of power sprang into action and launched an all-out offensive clearly proves that when it comes to minor corruptible violations, the rule of law is in relatively good shape. The danger we are faced with stems from other, incalculably graver circumstances. Nobody has taken it upon himself to wage a war against these circumstances, because this war demands much more courage.  
Like the "investigative journalism" programs we see on television, the self-righteous preoccupy themselves with trifle matters. How great it must be to make a name for yourself as a pursuer of justice as you shine the spotlight of your "investigation" onto a rabbi who got a little too frisky or the mechanic who overcharges his customer. This is a war that is universally satisfying to all sides. After all, who wants to tolerate an adulterous rabbi, a swindling mechanic, or a thief for a prime minister?  
It goes without saying that such characters are worthy of ostracism, yet these battles are confined to the tiny space illuminated by a flashlight instead of the larger front where the greatest danger awaits. Olmert failed the Kolbotek (a popular consumer affairs TV show) litmus test, and he deserves to be punished accordingly, but the saintly image of the hell-bent seekers of justice that has been affixed to those who have brought him down is exaggerated, if not ridiculous.  
Olmert's predecessor was suspected of far more serious crimes. Ariel Sharon and his sons allegedly laid their hands on sums of money that far exceed what has been attributed to Olmert, but Sharon exited the stage of history as a beloved, admired leader, a likeable grandfather figure who tended to his herd and did not harm a soul. A war against Sharon's corruption was a far more difficult proposition because Sharon cut a strong, threatening figure, and he was cherished. He was also responsible for the disengagement, which for some reason was portrayed by some as a step toward peace - perhaps that was the reason why the criminal investigations against him were buried. Those who closed the investigations without indictments and forgave Sharon are also those who are now bitterly ensconced in all-out war against his successor, who is cleaner and weaker by comparison.  
But the danger lurking around the corner emanates from a different direction. The law enforcement agencies, the police, the prosecutors and the courts - those we blindly admire - have for some time now ceased to operate as a system of justice with equal rights for all. Rich and poor, Jew and Arab do not receive the same treatment. Can anyone seriously claim that a wealthy individual armed with a phalanx of high-priced lawyers is consigned to the same legal fate as that of "Buzaglo," the average Israeli? Would a Jewish child who hurled a rock at a car receive the same punishment as an Arab child who did the same? Do the Israel Defense Forces and the police investigate settler crimes against Palestinians with the same sense of urgency? Is it a coincidence that the trigger fingers of Israel's police officers become itchier time and again whenever their weapons are pointed in the direction of Arab lawbreakers?  
Israel's legal system has already laid the groundwork for the legitimization of an apartheid regime. This is the real danger to the rule of law: The quasi automatic enlistment of the justice system by the defense establishment endangers the rule of law more than all this Olmertism. The IDF's ignoring of High Court rulings, much like the ban on the use of the "neighbor procedure" (soldiers using Palestinian civilians as human shields when arresting militants); the fact that the Shin Bet security service continues to torture suspects in contravention of a High Court ruling; and the failure to implement the court-ordered change to the route of the separation fence should have sent alarm bells ringing among the guardians of justice.  
When settlers continue to rampage against Palestinians - not nearly a day goes by without a pogrom and there is no place where armed militias don't roam around, yet nobody investigates these acts nor is anyone tried in court - this threatens the state's character much more than all of Olmert's cash-stuffed envelopes. The situation in the southern Hebron Hills, for example, which for a while now has become abandoned territory, endangers the rule of law far more than all of Olmert's investigations.  
In light of all of this, the self-styled knights of justice remain silent, cover their eyes, neither seeing nor hearing. Most importantly, they do not confront these ills. True, it is difficult to do so. It is likely to arouse fierce resistance. So, as a result, they plunge their swords into convenient places, which are safe and which everyone agrees on. They are no Emile Zolas. Rather, just miniature Rafi Ginats.

<title>Stay away from Durban II </title>
<date>Thu Dec 18 22:27:17 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Navanethem Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, is secretary-general of the UN's World Conference Against Racism, scheduled for April, in Geneva. Referred to as "Durban II," the meeting is meant as a follow-up to the infamous 2001 "Durban I" UN racism conference in South Africa. After her appointment, Pillay, a Durban native, was asked by the city's mayor "to rescue" the town's name. Aware that her human-rights credentials are tied to the success of the conference, Pillay has made it a top priority. She used her maiden speech at September's session of the Human Rights Council to champion a revisionist history of Durban I, and her latest effort to promote the upcoming event appeared in Haaretz this week ("The Anti-Racism Debate," December 16).  
Although Pillay was writing ostensibly for Israelis, she knows their foreign minister has already declared that Israel will not attend the conference; her real target was thus President-elect Barack Obama. The outgoing administration has not made a decision regarding U.S. participation, which means Obama and Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton have it in their power to discredit the meeting by staying away. But pressure to attend, from Pillay and others, is mounting.  
Pillay argues that attendance is appropriate because of what occurred at Durban I. She is right to focus on this. After all, the first objective of Durban II, as organizers determined last year, is "to foster the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Program of Action." That declaration, adopted by governmental delegates at the end of Durban I, asserts that Palestinians are victims of Israeli racism. This is the only country-specific accusation in a document purporting to address international racism and xenophobia. Regardless of the quantity of new vitriol in Durban II's final product, therefore, participation would necessarily legitimize a global event dedicated to "implementing" the mantra of Israeli racism.  
Pillay attempts to allay fears with a revisionist account of Durban I, writing that, "the controversy that tainted the 2001 Durban Conference ... was caused by the anti-Semitic behavior of some non-governmental organizations at the sidelines of the conference." She says she is committed to the proposition that "the concerns ... that the review conference will become a platform for denigrating Israel must be assuaged." She then adds: "Seven years ago, states did so by elevating the conference's outcome above the hatred and hostility that took place on its periphery."  
Pillay's tale is patently false. At meetings of the governmental drafting committee at Durban I, I watched as virtually every clause on anti-Semitism was deleted. And how did participating states "elevate" the outcome, after the U.S. and Israel made their opposition plain? The European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference cut a deal: Mention of anti-Semitism and the Holocaust could stay in - but with a condemnation of Israeli racism.  
For decades, the UN has tried to label Israel as  racist, to tie it to the mast of apartheid South Africa, and to sink it with the same moral indignation, and economic and political isolation. In 1975, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution equating Zionism with racism. When the resolution was rescinded in 1991, a plan to resurrect it began almost immediately. Act II culminated in Durban I; Act III is upon us. The so-called draft outcome document for Durban II accuses Israel of committing "a new kind of apartheid, a crime against humanity, [and] a form of genocide."  
Pillay's op-ed provides a clear window onto the Durban tactic. She fawns over the Durban declaration's statement that, "the Holocaust must never be forgotten," and its expression of "deep concern about the rise in anti-Semitism." Then she proceeds to ignore the demonization of racist Israel and its connection to anti-Semitism and the murdering of Jews here and now.  
Two weeks ago, General Assembly president Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann made a similar pitch for rupturing the bond between Jews and Israel, declaring, "I have a great love for the Jewish people and this has been true all my life. I have never hesitated to condemn the crimes of the Holocaust ...." He then accused Israel of "apartheid," which "must be outlawed," advocating a "campaign of boycott, divestment and sanctions to pressure Israel."  
By contrast, the Durban II draft doesn't mention Sudan, and the final version will be no different. On December 9, Pillay reminded a reporter that the High Commissioner's office had "set up [a] commission of inquiry, but did not find a Sudanese genocidal policy, but rather 'genocidal intent' committed by a few individuals." That commission maintained that the past decade's atrocities in Darfur did not constitute an ethnic or racially driven conflict, even though it was perpetrated by Arab militias against African tribal victims. Hundreds of thousands raped and murdered, 2.5 million displaced. But no genocide.  
Ultimately, Pillay asks readers precisely the right question: "States have a responsibility to show leadership against racial discrimination and intolerance. What message does a state boycott send to those who are suffering from racism ... [and] to those who perpetuate racism?"  
The answer: A boycott of Durban II sends a message that the real victims of racism are not alone. A boycott denies legitimacy to a platform for hatemongers and a cover for human-rights abusers. For states to show leadership against racism and intolerance, they must join Canada and Israel and stay away.

<title>The anti-racism debate </title>
<date>Tue Dec 16 01:58:27 IST 2008</date>
<content>
I grew up in Durban, South Africa, under a system of apartheid that institutionalized racial discrimination, denying equal rights of citizenship to all those who were not white. I later sat as a judge on the Rwanda Tribunal, where I came to know in painful detail, killing by killing, the unimaginable destruction of humanity when ethnic hatred explodes into genocide. I know that the consequences of allowing discrimination, inequality and intolerance to fester and spiral out of control can be genocidal. But South Africa's experience shows that with political will and a commitment to act, discrimination, inequality and intolerance can be overcome. We have just witnessed the election of the first African-American president of the United States, a country where racial segregation is as vivid a memory for some as it is for me.  
States will have an opportunity to demonstrate their determination to fight intolerance by moving the anti-racism agenda forward when, in April 2009, an international review conference meets in Geneva. The conference will evaluate the implementation of government commitments to eradicate racial hatred and discrimination, made seven years ago in Durban. It is imperative that all states participate and contribute to this crucial process in order to consolidate and improve the common ground on those fundamental human rights issues we all agree on.  
Regrettably, last January, Canada announced its intention to withdraw from the Durban review conference. And this month, so did Israel.  
Behind these decisions stands the controversy that tainted the 2001 Durban Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, and that was caused by the anti-Semitic behavior of some non-governmental organizations at the sidelines of the conference. Yet the document that emerged from the conference itself, the Durban Declaration and Program of Action (DDPA), transcended divisive and intolerant approaches.  
The DDPA offers a comprehensive global framework that calls for the adoption of more effective anti-discrimination laws and policies. It highlights discrimination against minorities, migrants and indigenous people, and it empowers civil society to demand accountability for actions committed or omitted by strengthening victims' grounds for recourse.  
The DDPA clearly states that: "The Holocaust must never be forgotten." It calls for an end to violence in the Middle East and recognizes Israel's right to security. It urges Israelis and Palestinians to resume the peace process and expresses deep concern about the rise in anti-Semitism around the world, as well as alarm over mounting prejudice related to religious beliefs, including Islamophobia.  
In April 2009, at the Durban review conference, states are expected to provide an assessment of achievements and gaps in the implementation of the commitments made in 2001, as well as identify concrete ways to improve performance and impact on the ground. The review is also meant to share and take ownership of good practices in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. It is an important opportunity to renew global commitment to our common goals and revitalize efforts to move toward these goals. All too often national policies and practices lag behind states' pledges. Yet progress in combating racism and intolerance is sorely needed in every region of the world.  
The Durban review conference is a timely opportunity to reaffirm the principles of non-discrimination and to build on the Durban Declaration and Program of Action. It is for states to ensure that this objective is met and implementation gaps are closed. If all states are not engaged in the process, this goal may remain elusive. Thus, the concerns expressed by Canada and Israel that the review conference will become a platform for denigrating Israel must be assuaged. Seven years ago, states did so by elevating the conference's outcome above the hatred and hostility that took place on its periphery, and by reaching a broad agreement on the necessary measures to combat racism and intolerance. They must achieve that commonality of purpose again through active engagement rather than withdrawal.  
We owe a frank debate and concrete action to the victims of discrimination, intolerance and racism. We can avoid or overcome friction by focusing on how to give new momentum to the struggle against these unconscionable practices. States have a responsibility to show leadership against racial discrimination and intolerance. What message does a state boycott send to those who are suffering from racism? What message does it send to those who perpetuate racism? This struggle concerns all of us in our increasingly multi-cultural and multi-ethnic societies.  
Navanethem Pillay is the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.

<title>The death of the right</title>
<date>Sun Oct 05 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
With neither sorrow nor grief it may be announced: The Israeli right is dead. After long and difficult death throes it has finally and laudably come to its end. The mercy killing was administered by one of its senior sons and princes, Ehud Olmert, but the prime minister's belated courageous statements on the eve of Rosh Hashanah were not needed to know that nothing remains of the right's doctrine.  
The right's new political doctrine was born in sin, the sin of arrogance, of messianism, of militarism and nationalism of the Six-Day War, so its death was predictable. Revisionism, the minority view, became annexationism, the majority view, and the right managed by trickery and sleight of hand to deceive a whole country for a generation, irreparably damaging the cause of peace. Now the celebrations are over and the curtain is coming down. Not only Olmert must repent of his sin, as he has done - an entire country must stand up and say aloud: Oops, we were wrong.  
The radical left, in whose voice the prime minister now speaks, was correct and predicted the truth. To most of the public it has become clear that no peace will be attained that is not based on the outlines sketched in an ad placed by the Matzpen movement in September 1967. That is how far we have come. But in Israeli society's ideological vacuum, the death of the right does not herald the flourishing of the left. It, too, expired a long time ago.  
One after another, the arguments of the right have collapsed, leaving not one stone of its teachings upon another. All the solutions it proposed over the years were found to be mirages that dissipated long ago. It began with messianic and biblical explanations about the sanctity of the land and our right to all of it. That was and still is the reasoning of that minority detached from reality. No rational person today can seriously argue that sanctity means the right to sovereignty. The tomb of Rabbi Nahman in Uman is sacred - so what? And Jerusalem is sacred to Christians - so what?  
Reasons of "security" have managed to fool more people. Based on these reasons, control of the territories is a guarantee of security. This foolishness was also proven groundless a long time ago. Technological developments have made it clear to the public that Tel Aviv can be bombed from Baghdad, that there is no security significance in living on the tops of the mountains and the slopes of the Jordan Valley, and there is nothing like living in Yitzhar to endanger the future of the entire country.  
Later came the withdrawal from Sinai to prove that territory can be a security burden, and certainly no guarantee of anything, and that peace ensures security more than any territory. The greatest danger to security in our history ambushed us, of all times, when we controlled Sinai: in 1973. In contrast, no years were as secure - on the Egyptian front - as the years of peace, without Sinai and even without Sharm el-Sheikh.  
All the solutions proposed by the right were found to be hollow: First Menachem Begin's and Yitzhak Shamir's futile idea that immigration would ensure a demographic majority, then the idea of expelling the Palestinians - Rehavam Ze'evi's "voluntary" transfer and Meir Kahane's involuntary transfer. "Autonomy," "functional compromise," and the "Jordanian option" were all found to be crazy ideas that have rested in peace. No one is even talking about annexation anymore. Try asking people on the right what they predict, according to their own logic, will really happen 20 years from now and they will not be able to respond. They will mumble a few murky slogans and fall silent.  
I have never heard a clear answer to this question except "industrial parks," Benjamin Netanyahu's latest craze, which was previously Shimon Peres' idea. And what will happen when the first bomb goes off in them? They will close down, like all their predecessors. But back to the main issue, what will really happen in another 20 years when there will be close to a majority of Palestinians between the river and the sea? The right has no answer. Two states? No! One state? No! What then? A continuation of the apartheid.  
What are we left with? With a land slashed by a wall, 10,000 settlements on every hilltop, fear campaigns and the sowing of hatred, and one solution: do nothing. Time has worked, does work and will work in our favor. Meanwhile, Hamas has risen and Arafat fell, today Hamas tomorrow Al-Qaida, yesterday Jordan today Iran, yesterday stones today Qassams and tomorrow dirty bombs. The left's ideas are now expounded by the majority; after all, everyone knows that it is either two states or we are finished, as the prime minister says, but meanwhile everyone also agrees that it is better to do nothing. "The time is not yet ripe" - until that option also comes to an end, until we all come to an end.

<title>The ever-rising price </title>
<date>Thu Jul 10 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
The cost of the existence of the Jewish nation-state as an occupier is constantly on the rise. In an article published here two weeks ago, Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken took the bull by the horns: Israel is on the way to apartheid.  
Indeed, the "temporary" changes in the Citizenship Law from 2003, followed by attempts by Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann to remove the new legislation from judicial oversight, are another phase in the desperate search for ways to build a wall between people as a substitute for an international border. If such a border had existed between Israel and the state of Palestine, it is reasonable to assume that the number of marriages between Israeli citizens and foreigners would be very limited, and the idea of special legislation for Arab Israelis would not have even come up. This is only one more aspect of the damage caused by our inability to put an end to the occupation.  
In fact, like other national movements, Zionism had a great deal of difficulty assimilating universal values except those like self-determination, which were in keeping with national claims. Zionist socialism was the first victim of national particularism. As long as the occupation of the land was ongoing, up to the victory in the War of Independence, the price may have been inevitable. However, it very quickly emerged that socialism had been dealt a mortal blow. The habits, concepts and principles that had been shaped during the days of the the pre-state Jewish community were too strong to change after the establishment of the state. Nevertheless, in other areas, especially at the beginning of the post-Ben-Gurion period, great progress was made, as attested among other things by the abrogation of the military government in 1965.  
The Six Day War took Israel back an entire generation. It has now become clear that colonial rule encourages the mixture of populations, and occupation requires seeking destructive solutions in terms of human rights. We should not delude ourselves: A democracy of lords will not last long. If we consciously create second-class citizens, if we anchor discrimination in a law armed against the intervention of the Supreme Court - the only gatekeeper of our liberty - we necessarily undermine the foundations of democracy. Universal rights are the heart and soul of a democracy; the moment these are denied to some segments of the population, they will eventually wither away for everyone.  
The worst thing of all is anchoring discrimination in law: then it becomes the norm, and society becomes accustomed to it. People will be able to sleep peacefully then, too. After all, the Knesset has spoken, and this is a country of law and the rule of law. Anyone who would turn to international courts would be considered a traitor, because after all, everyone persecutes the Jews. If the International Court in The Hague finds that the laws of the land do not conform to the rules of justice, and it notes that some norms, when trampled, call for those who trample them to be removed from the family of nations, its judges will be considered anti-Semites.  
It should be noted that barbaric laws existed not only in the worst dictatorships known in the 20th century, but also in the democratic United States. Less than 50 years ago, cruel racial oppression prevailed in the southern United States. Thus it is not enough for a law to pass in the Knesset for it to be worthy of a free society: Its content must meet the test of universal norms.  
No other people in the world should know this better than the Jews. Their expulsion and destruction were made possible because first of all it was declared that universal norms - thanks to whose victory in the French Revolution the Jews were liberated - endangered the nation. Subsequently special laws for various populations replaced them, and at the end of the process the Jews ceased being considered human beings. Special laws for Jews, known as race laws, were enacted in the 20th century in the three largest countries in Western Europe, which shows that everyone is capable of everything.  
The Citizenship Law discriminates against a certain category of citizens and it is therefore illegitimate. In this case the practical, reasonable solution is an international border. Even then, not all the problems will be solved; far from it. But a conflict between countries is always less severe than a conflict between sects or ethnic groups.  
Moreover, the more one looks at the reality emerging here, the deeper the awareness that if an end is not put to the occupation, the occupation will put an end to the Jewish state. If territories are not evacuated, it will be the settlements that at the end of the day will establish a common political framework for everyone living between the Jordan and the Mediterranean, thus creating a multi-national, multi-cultural, androgynous entity, turning Zionism into a passing episode.

<title>The sin of haughtiness </title>
<date>Fri Sep 05 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Along the timeline, 15 years minus one week since the signing of the Oslo Accords on the lawn of Bill Clinton's White House, it seems the prime minister is right. We have never been so close to peace with the Palestinians. It's enough to mention that 13 years ago minus one month, during the most sensitive days of the Oslo process, then Jerusalem mayor Ehud Olmert convinced the Republican candidate for the U.S. presidency, Senator Bob Dole, to introduce a bill to move the U.S. embassy to Israel's "undivided" capital.   
Today that very same Olmert is proposing that Jerusalem be divided and the Arab neighborhoods be transferred to Palestine. Nevertheless, if there is no basic change in the concepts held by the adults responsible for the negotiations, the Israeli and Palestinian children who learned this week how to read "Shalom, Kita Aleph" will meet each other in 12 years on the battlefield, in a binational state or in an apartheid regime.  
Measured on a yardstick, Israel has gone a long way to meet the Palestinians. However, the negotiations on the "shelf agreement" are being held on parallel yardsticks.   
The distance between them has been reduced, but as we all know, parallel lines never meet. When those conducting the negotiations cannot agree on a starting point, there is no chance they will find a meeting point.   
From Olmert's point of view, and more so from Tzipi Livni's, the conflict began in 1967. The concessions therefore have to refer to the border that divided Israel from the territories until the Six-Day War.   
That is why an agreement giving 93 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians, along with compensation in the form of a few percentage points of Israel's sovereign territory is a generous offer second to none. A real "Ben-Gurion-like decision."  
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) opened negotiations with Olmert at the point Yasser Arafat had been in negotiations with Ehud Barak. Their point of departure was the Nakba - the expulsion of the Palestinians from their lands in 1947 and 1948.   
From their point of view, their first "Ben-Gurion-like decision" was taken in December 1988 with the decision by the Palestinian National Council.   
At that time, the Palestine Liberation Organization exchanged the armed struggle of liberating 78 percent of the territory of Mandatory Palestine for the political struggle of establishing an independent state on the lands Israel occupied in 1967 (22 percent).   
Their second "Ben-Gurion-like decision" was made in March 2002 when Arafat adopted the Arab peace initiative including the paragraph that requires Israel's agreement to any solution on the refugee problem.  
Israel invented the term "settlement blocs" and blew it up to monstrous proportions, whether the international community was prepared to agree or not.   
Now the Israelis are demanding that the Palestinians concede these areas and agree that the blocs cut up their minuscule state.   
From their point of view, every dunam they give up to Israel in the West Bank and Jerusalem is a concession on an already meager share. It is worth recalling that when Benjamin Netanyahu was prime minister, he argued over the scope of the withdrawal from the territories despite the second Oslo agreement, and he repeatedly said that every percentage point was equivalent to the size of Tel Aviv.  
The phenomenon of parallel lines is especially salient when referring to the negotiations on Jerusalem. The argument in Israel over the division of Jerusalem on the basis of ethnic and national lines creates the impression that Olmert (as well as Barak) is prepared to commit suicide.   
The obvious conclusion is, supposedly, that it would be fitting for the Palestinians to compensate Israel with a substantive concession; for example, on the issue of sovereignty over the Temple Mount.   
From the Palestinians' point of view, the Israelis already had a substantive concession in their pockets before the Camp David II talks began. At that stage, Arafat agreed (in return for a suitable territorial exchange) to leave the Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty.   
The demand now to give up sovereignty over the Temple Mount is identical in their eyes to a demand by Israel to put the Western Wall under the control of the Muslim Waqf.  
Olmert expects everyone, including the Palestinians, to be moved by the giant leap he has taken from the "two banks to the Jordan" camp to renouncing "most of Judea and Samaria."   
He is repeating the sins of haughtiness and lack of empathy for the needs of the neighbor that tripped up Barak and contributed to the disaster of 2000's Black September. Until the Israeli leadership frees itself of the bug of the parallel lines, we will continue to transfer the conflict from generation to generation and convince ourselves that we have no partner.

<title>Yes, it is apartheid </title>

The anchorwoman was clearly shocked: I don't have time now to respond to what you have said, she told the former U.S. president, allowing Jimmy Carter to make a narrow escape from her clutches. Then she added that she did not want to imagine what would happen to him if he bumped into her colleague from the security affairs desk in Channel 2's dark alley. And the pundit sitting there, sunk in deep thought as always, nodded his heavy head, confirming: He's lucky, the bastard, that we didn't gang up on him and cut him to shreds.  
That's how it is here: The rulers set the tone, and the media begins to gripe: Not only did Carter's mission not help, it did damage. He alone was the reason Gilad Shalit was not ransomed out of captivity during the holiday. That's what happens when an enemy of the human race, the twin of the Twin Towers' bin Laden, sticks his nose where it does not belong.  
Let's let old Carter be, so he may let sleeping warriors lie; he will not be back. The contents of his words, however, should not be ignored. "Apartheid," he said, "apartheid" - a dark, scary word coined by Afrikaners and meaning segregation, racial segregation.  
What does he want from us, that evil man: What do we have to do with apartheid? Does a separation fence constitute separation? Do separate roads for Jewish settlers and Palestinians really separate? Are Palestinian enclaves between Jewish settlements Bantustans?  
There is no hint of similarity between South Africa and Israel, and only a sick mind could draw such shadowy connections between them. Roadblocks and inspections at every turn; licenses and permits for every little matter; the arbitrary seizure of land; special privileges in water use; cheap, hard labor; forming and uniting families by bureaucratic whim - none of these are apartheid, in any way. They are an incontrovertible security necessity, period.  
The white Afrikaners, too, had reasons for their segregation policy; they, too, felt threatened - a great evil was at their door, and they were frightened, out to defend themselves. Unfortunately, however, all good reasons for apartheid are bad reasons; apartheid always has a reason, and it never has a justification. And what acts like apartheid, is run like apartheid and harasses like apartheid, is not a duck - it is apartheid. Nor does it even solve the problem of fear: Today, everyone knows that all apartheid will inevitably reach its sorry end.  
One essential difference remains between South Africa and Israel: There a small minority dominated a large majority, and here we have almost a tie. But the tiebreaker is already darkening on the horizon. Then the Zionist project will come to an end if we don't choose to leave the slave house before being visited by a fatal demographic plague.  
It is entirely clear why the word apartheid terrifies us so. What should frighten us, however, is not the description of reality, but reality itself. Even Ehud Olmert has understood at last that continuing the present situation is the end of the Jewish democratic state, as he recently said.  
The Palestinians are unfortunate because they have not produced a Nelson Mandela; the Israelis are unfortunate because they have not produced an F.W. de Klerk.

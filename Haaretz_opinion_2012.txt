<title>A case of leftist 'McCarthyism'? </title>
<date>Fri Jan 13 03:38:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
One of the most notorious newspapers ever published in America was The Spotlight, founded in 1975 by white supremacist Willis Carto. For many years the country's premier hate rag, it peaked at 330,000 subscribers in the early '80s. Alongside support for South African apartheid and exposes of the Bilderberg group, the paper was a regular purveyor of Holocaust denial, with stories like "Jewish Groups Can't Defend Position on '6 Million' Debate" and "Anne Frank Fable Losing Credibility; Establishment Continues to Push 'Diary' as 'True Story.'"
The Spotlight, which thankfully ceased publication in 2001, wasn't just concerned with falsifying history. When not questioning the existence of the gas chambers, it focused on the "Jewish lobby." And its writers had two terms for describing U.S. Jews and their activism on behalf of the Jewish state: "dual loyalists" who were for "Israel first."
When Zaid Jilani was recently informed that his use of the latter term had anti-Semitic implications, he professed ignorance. Jilani, a blogger at the Center for American Progress  (CAP ), claimed to be "unaware of all the connotations it carried." That a young blogger at a prominent liberal think tank would see nothing wrong with such language is understandable. It's an indication of just how deep the rhetoric of the far right has seeped into the discourse of the mainstream left.
Jilani is one of several individuals who have come under fire for their commentary regarding Israel and Jews. The controversy started in early December, when Politico detailed how two "core institutions" of the Democratic Party - CAP, a farm team for the Obama administration, and Media Matters for America, a self-described "progressive research and information center" - "are challenging a bipartisan consensus on Israel."
Rather than addressing the substantive criticism raised, CAP tried desperately to change the subject, turning its guns on those airing concerns, particularly Josh Block, a lifelong Democrat and former American Israel Public Affairs Committee spokesman whose criticism of the groups was quoted in Politico. The episode approached the status of Washington "scandal" when liberal website Salon published a dossier Block had disseminated documenting a series of blog posts, articles, and Twitter messages in which CAP and Media Matters employees batted around rhetoric and accusations as if "it's now just natural to talk about Jewish money in politics, about treasonous politicians."
To judge from Block's collection, the worst perpetrator is Media Matters' "senior foreign policy fellow" M.J. Rosenberg, whose "analysis" largely amounts to name-calling. Newsweek reporter Eli Lake is an "agent of influence." Playwright David Mamet is an "Israel first Likudnik." Indeed, any U.S. Jew to his right  (including Democratic congressmen ) is an "Israel-firster." When one journalist complained about Rosenberg's calling her a "dual loyalist," he responded by saying, "I say DUAL which is generous." No wonder he best expresses himself in the Twitter medium of 140 characters.
Block took considerable professional risk in challenging these two influential liberal organizations. The Truman National Security Project, a once-promising initiative to promote a hawkish sensibility in the Democratic Party that has since become little more than another greasy pole for young D.C. opportunists, expelled Block from its fellowship program.
In the Forward, Sarah Wildman attacked Block, writing that "When we debase the term [anti-Semite] by using it as a rhetorical conceit against those with whom we disagree on policy matters, we have sullied our own promises to our grandparents." But it is those who use the term "Israel-firster" who are debasing the debate by accusing anyone who disagrees with them of treasonous impulses. Wildman also argued that the offensive comments had been "taken out of context" - as if there were ever a context, other than that of, say, Jonathan Pollard, in which it would be appropriate to label an American Jew an "Israel-firster" or "dual loyalist."
Ultimately, however, Block was vindicated. While CAP publicly denied that its employees were trafficking in anti-Semitism, an e-mail from the organization's vice president, obtained by The Jerusalem Post, deemed "Israel-firster," to be "terrible, anti-Semitic language."
The left is constantly complaining that the debate about Israel is restricted, that one can't criticize Israel without "risking" his career. Reality is in fact the opposite. Figures ranging from University of Chicago professor John Mearsheimer to journalists Peter Beinart and Andrew Sullivan have all seen their careers blossom as a result of their harsh and unrelenting criticism of Israel. Indeed, obsessively attacking Israel is a bona-fide way to resuscitate one's career, not destroy it. As a measure, consider the fact that employees at mainstream liberal institutions feel comfortable using the sort of language popularized by white supremacists and Holocaust-deniers.
It isn't just figures on the medium and lower rungs of think tanks using such foul rhetoric: "Israel-firster" and "Likudnik" are favorites of Time's Joe Klein, as well as Salon's Glenn Greenwald, one of America's most popular liberal bloggers, who refers to "the many Israel-firsters in the U.S. Congress."
Since the 1950s, liberals have routinely accused conservatives of "McCarthyism." Now the tables have turned, and it is leftists questioning the loyalties of American Jews. Judging what's in a country's "interest" is highly subjective; it is the very reason why there exists such passionate and necessary debate about the purpose and tactics of American foreign policy. So-called "progressives" should stop mimicking the far right and engage in that debate without questioning the allegiance of their fellow Americans.

<title>Again that guy with his peace talk </title>
<date>Mon Nov 05 02:53:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	It's true that you can't rely on the Arabs. It was so much fun toying with the idea of Moshe Kahlon, who opposed the Gaza disengagement and supports annexing the settlements. We really enjoyed touring with Yair Lapid in Ariel, which is stuck like a bone in the throat of the occupied territories. We had started to convince Shimon Peres that at the age of 89 it might be worth dropping the prefix, "honorable president," for the old suffix "will divide Jerusalem."
	And suddenly Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas pops up on Channel 2 and totally confuses us with his version of peace.
	Only a couple of months ago we learned from historian Benny Morris (Haaretz Magazine, September 21) that Abbas is stuck on liberating the homeland through a "policy of stages," and insists on demanding the right of return. And from nowhere, in the midst of an election campaign seemingly focused on the price of cottage cheese and cellphone discounts, Abbas decides to publicly renounce his right to return to his childhood home in Safed.
	Just last month, the right found support for its claim of "no partner" in remarks by Meron Benvenisti, who said, "You cannot tell the Arabs to forget about Jaffa and Acre. They will not forget," (Haaretz Magazine, October 12 ) and that we should just forget about dividing the land (after which he tries to calm us by saying the opposite - that "most of the refugees don't even want to return" ).
	But just as the public was beginning to absorb this reinforcement of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that "the conflict is about '48, not about '67," the Palestinian president decides to declare that whatever is not part of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem is the State of Israel.
	The biggest surprise is the surprise with which Abbas' remarks were received. In January of last year, protocols published by the Al Jazeera network were already providing evidence of his pragmatic approach to the refugee issue. It was reported there that during one of the conversations he had with then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Abbas said, "It would be illogical to ask Israel to absorb five million refugees, or even a million refugees ... the result would be the end of the State of Israel."
	Moreover, during an internal debate on March 24, 2009 (an event that cannot be suspected of trying to deceive the Israeli Jewish public ), Abbas answered in the negative when asked by a Palestinian visitor from Nazareth whether he would be able to eventually get Palestinian citizenship.
	"You don't need a passport to prove you're a Palestinian," declared Abbas, adding, "You need to raise two banners: the banner of equality and the banner of an independent state for your brethren in the occupied territories."
	Last April, former Shin Bet Security Service head Yuval Diskin backed Abbas when the latter said Netanyahu had refused to launch real negotiations and never bothered to respond to the Palestinian positions on borders and security, nor even glanced at the documents the Palestinians had submitted in response to the Mideast Quartet's demands last year.
	"Don't listen to those stories they're trying to sell you about how Abu Mazen [Abbas] doesn't want to talk," said Diskin during a filmed encounter in Kfar Sava. "I was there until a year ago and I know what's happening from up close. This government has no interest in resolving anything with the Palestinians, and this I can say with certainty."
	Although Hamas officials and no few senior members of his own Fatah faction have in the past condemned Abbas in the most hateful terms for daring to renounce the right of every refugee to return to his ancestral home, the PA leader remains defiant. The Channel 2 interview is part of a comprehensive diplomatic and media offensive whose purpose is to pave the way for upgrading the Palestinians' representation in the United Nations.
	It would also be worth noting his statement that as long as he is Palestinian president, there will be no new intifada. That was a warning to the right-wing government which has threatened to respond to any "unilateral" moves at the United Nations by annexing territory: When you get a third intifada, which is likely to set the whole region on fire, don't blame me.
	Yes, Abbas' intent was to interfere in the Israeli election campaign, and that's a good thing. (Is only Netanyahu allowed to trespass on another nation's political playing field? ) Abbas was doing the work of those Zionist parties who have joined the foolish march of the right toward the abyss of a binational reality and apartheid.
	Truly, you can't rely on the Arabs. Their "no" might actually turn into a "yes." By us, no is no.

<title>Alice Walker's true colors </title>
<date>Sun Jun 24 04:00:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Through her decision not to have her book "The Color Purple" translated into Hebrew, Alice Walker is choosing to keep silent and absenting herself from Israel's crucial public discourse about racism and the occupation.
	Literature at its best should be a Trojan horse. Good authors don't just tell us a story to pass the time in a pleasant way. They offer ideas that insinuate themselves into the reader's mind, sometimes unconsciously, sometimes in the form of a tale that disguises its moral and cultural lessons. Books can provide readers with a mirror in which they can see something they hadn't seen before, and give them the uncommon opportunity of subsequently seeing themselves and their surroundings in a different light.
	Alice Walker relinquished the possibility of becoming a literary Odysseus when she announced recently she would not agree to have her book "The Color Purple" translated into Hebrew. Walker explained her decision on the grounds that Israel is an apartheid state, adding she hoped the boycott would have an effect on civil society here.
	Let us set aside the proposition that Israel is an apartheid state, though to me this doesn't seem an accurate definition. The background to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not racial. It would have been enough to talk about the Israeli occupation. There is no need to bandy slogans around in order to strengthen the argument that the occupation must be ended.
	But let us use Walker's assumption that Israel is indeed an apartheid state. If South Africa was still under an apartheid regime, would it not be smarter to enable the people there - by any means possible - to read what Walker has to say about racial discrimination?
	Boycotting is easy. A herd of boycotters is a comfortable herd. Being anti-Israeli these days is fashionable. As a boycotter you join a popular crowd, and you're safe in the knowledge that you will get automatic applause from your intellectual and literary milieu. Clearly the issue of Israel/Palestine is important to Alice Walker - she was due to participate in last year's (aborted ) Gaza flotilla - but she and others involved in the arts who are implementing a cultural boycott of Israel are accomplishing the opposite of what they believe in.
	What is Walker achieving by preventing Israelis from reading "The Color Purple" in Hebrew at this specific time? What punishment does she, and all the boycotters of Israel, think they are meting out to us? To be blunt, most Israelis don't have any special interest in Alice Walker, and her specific boycott won't make waves.
	But the cumulative trend of boycotts does have an effect on Israeli life. By isolating Israelis, boycotters are creating a renewed sense of unity and self-worth among Israelis, and greater antagonism and withdrawal from the outside world. The boycotters are feeding the flames of Israelis' eternal bonfire of victimhood. Victimhood is one of those mental constructs which is so hard for Israelis to rid themselves of - and therefore, one which the Israeli establishment itself nurtures because it is convenient. When someone boycotts Israel, Israelis immediately see themselves as victims of anti-Semitism, which unites them in the general sense of lamentation and the rightness of their way.
	Some say that when a writer prevents publication of his book in Israel, or refuses to participate in literary festivals here, s/he is in fact punishing precisely those - in the center and on the left, who are disproportionately represented in literary circles - who support peace and oppose the current government's policy.
	I'd like to suggest a different argument, using the example of the Trojan horse. I believe Alice Walker's aspiration, and that of other major cultural figures, should be to have her books read precisely by those people with whose actions and beliefs she does not agree. Walker, of all people - who has confronted racism and has written a powerful fictional critique of it - is preventing Israelis from being exposed to the very kind of literary work that it is crucial for them to read. Walker should want her books to appear not only in bookshops and on private bookshelves but also on huge billboards along highways in the state of Israel. For whose edification is she talking about racism and segregation? Is her aim only to preach to the converted, to the liberal masses of Scandinavia? It is precisely here in Israel that her voice needs to be heard, and in Hebrew.
	Israelis don't like to hear criticism. Maybe that's true of every nation in the world, but maybe the dislike is stronger than for other nations - I haven't conducted enough research globally to make a judgment, even an anecdotal one, on that. To paraphrase a local saying, anyone with butter on his head shouldn't go out in the sun.
	Had Walker herself done more serious research, she would have certainly discovered that the occupation is just one of our problems. Perhaps it's the most acute of our problems, but the manifestations of racism in Israeli life are far more extensive than solely attitudes toward Palestinians. The incarceration and deportation of African migrants living in Israel is an intense current issue and is eliciting unprecedented racism - and not only from the mob in the streets but also in the Knesset and from senior government ministers, who have actively fanned the flames of race hatred.
	Maybe this public and humiliating demonstration of primitive racism to the world is Israel's punishment for the occupation. Something inside us is sick. The situation is disturbing as well as infuriating - but the way to fight it is to make your voice heard. Not to be silent. In her decision not to have her book translated here, Walker is choosing to keep silent, absenting herself from Israel's crucial public discourse about racism and the occupation. This is a strange and disappointing choice for an activist writer.

<title>Anti-Semitism in academic guise </title>
<date>Sun Mar 11 03:07:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Every Israeli student who comes to study at a university in the United States very quickly learns that the truly important academic events are those that happen during the noontime break. In addition to a free lunch, you get additional fare that broadens your horizons a bit.
	Recently, an event of this sort was held at the Harvard Law School, devoted to the case of Khader Adnan, an Islamic Jihad operative who held a hunger strike and petitioned Israel's Supreme Court to protest his administrative detention in an Israeli prison. (Adnan has since been released.) I left this event with a bitter taste in my mouth. For about an hour, in a hall filled to capacity, the meeting's organizers depicted Israel in an extremely bleak light and did not let the facts confuse them. I am convinced that an outside observer who is not familiar with the intricacies of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict believes that Israel makes a hobby of detaining Palestinians under administrative arrest.
	Not a single word was said about Palestinian terror or about the fact that no country in the world allows an administrative detainee to petition its Supreme Court directly, as in the case of Adnan, for example. The double standard was also glaring, as only a few dozen kilometers from the bed where the hunger-striking Adnan was hospitalized, Syrian President Bashar Assad continued to slaughter his own countrymen. But of course it is Israel that is in serious violation of human rights, requiring an urgent academic discussion.
	Everyone has the right to express criticism of Israel and in some cases it is justified - this is the essence of democracy. However, the recent events at Harvard give the sense that something else is hiding beneath the guise of academic debate. I felt this even more palpably when I spoke to the organizers of the event and introduced myself. The smile on the face of the Palestinian woman who had organized the discussion faded away immediately when I said the words "I am from Israel."
	That event was only the beginning. On March 1 the topic of the annual faculty debate at the law school was: "Can Israel be both Jewish and democratic?" At this event, which was balanced, there were also harsh opinions expressed undermining Israel's legitimacy, with hints of a parallel to Germany in the 1930s.
	But the peak came a few days later at the "One-state solution" conference. Organized by a student but held under the aegis of the university, this event tried to give an academic seal of approval to the delegitimization of Israel. At this meeting, the words "apartheid" and "Israel" were paired. The Israeli side was represented by "supporters" of Israel and Zionism like anti-Zionist historian Prof. Ilan Pappe. (As Prof. Alan Dershowitz noted, it would be interesting to know what Harvard's reaction would have been had a group of students held a conference under the heading "Does a Palestinian people exist?", inviting only academics who contend that the answer is no.)
	This is not real academic discussion nor is it legitimate criticism, but rather simply an attempt to hold a debate on whether the Jewish people has the right to a state - and to answer that question in the negative. This was not a conference at some obscure institution or an event held in Europe, where the outcome is a foregone conclusion. This was a conference with an anti-Semitic hue, held at one of the most important academic institutions in the world.
	Therefore I am proud to be part of a group of students organizing the first "Harvard-Israel" conference. This event aims to present Israeli innovativeness and entrepreneurship and, more importantly, to present original solutions and economic developments for peace and coexistence between the peoples. If both sides - Israelis and Palestinians - develop a positive approach, recognize the other's legitimacy and do not engage in spreading hatred, perhaps there will be a better future for all of us.
	The writer is a lawyer studying for a master's degree at Harvard Law School.

<title>Before we lose the protective shell </title>
<date>Tue Apr 17 01:43:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Some Israelis have hard hearts when it comes to the many Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremonies and restrictions in place for tomorrow night, when movie theaters, restaurants and cafes will be closed and only certain programs will be screened on television. There are those who want us to stop dealing with "Shoah business" and be a bit more normal, and others who lament the excessive "holiday" atmosphere surrounding the March of the Living to Auschwitz, saying the time has come for us to purge ourselves of this annoying "Holocaust syndrome."
	Mostly, I'm not with these detractors. The Holocaust is, indeed, a syndrome, and it also turned us into something a bit abnormal, but that is entirely warranted. After all, this is an unfathomable event, one that is unprecedented in history: a systematic act of genocide.
	Hundreds of years of anti-Semitic propaganda, persecution, blood libels and pogroms set the stage for the Final Solution. Even when Germany's military circumstances turned bleak and defeat was on the horizon, Hitler rejected requests made by army commanders to divert some trains from extermination missions and use them for military purposes on the front. The annihilation of the Jewish people was his supreme prerogative.
	Nor was this the obsessive lunacy of one crazed leader who swept up an entire people. It suffices to mention the pogrom in Kielce, a Polish city located between Warsaw and Krakow. Dozens of Jewish survivors of concentration camps returned to Kielce after the war, trying to rebuild their lives. But a rumor broke out in the city, suggesting that Jews kidnapped a Christian child to use its blood for Passover matza. A mob surrounded a house where several Jewish families lived and slaughtered the 42 Jews inside; the massacre was so vicious that the bodies could not be identified. All this happened in 1946, a year and two months after the end of the war and the liberation of the camps.
	So it's no wonder that remembrance of anti-Semitism old and new - the persecutions, blood libels, pogroms and, more than anything, the Holocaust - constitutes the bond between Jews in Israel and the rest of the world. Moreover, the Holocaust is part of a sequence that gave us life: had it not been for feelings of guilt around the world, the United Nations would not have decided in 1947 in favor of partition, and other countries would not have helped us during the critical hours of the War of Independence. Had there been no Holocaust, European countries would have long ago imposed paralyzing economic and military sanctions, a la South Africa, against us. European governments and companies would have ceased to do business with us, and would not have supplied us with arms or conducted normal diplomatic relations with us. After all, they bitterly oppose everything that is done in the territories: the occupation, the continued settlement construction, the apartheid policy and the lack of interest in proceeding with the peace process.
	Israel's polices in the territories would not be condoned to the extent that they are, were it not for the deep feelings of guilt that other countries feel about the Holocaust. They know that Germany initiated the events, but that other countries either willingly collaborated in the extermination or didn't lift a finger to prevent it. But will this immunity last forever? Will these feelings of guilt persist for eternity?
	Clearly not. The generation of Holocaust survivors and World War II veterans is vanishing, in Israel and everywhere else. Soon there will be no living witnesses to the atrocities, and a new generation will say: Our hands are not soaked by this blood, we know of nothing like this that occurred in our lifetimes, we have no such guilt feelings.
	In democratic countries, public opinion is what ultimately determines leaders' policies. So when these guilt feelings disappear, and events of the apartheid occupation continue and grow worse, the result will be ferocious anger toward Israel. The result: South Africa-type sanctions that will cripple us. The deadly takeover of the May 2010 flotilla to Gaza, the provocative attempted "fly-in" of a few days ago, and the tape of the senior military officer hitting an activist in the face with the butt of his rifle on the Jordan Valley's Route 90 are just early signs of changes afoot in the world.
	Since this change is inexorable, it behooves our leaders to show prudence and forge an agreement with the Palestinians soon, before the world's guilt vanishes - along with the protective shell of the Holocaust.

<title>Bibi and the Bulgarian proverb </title>
<date>Fri Sep 14 02:00:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu crossed the red line, acting wildly irresponsible by causing his relationship with the American president to deteriorate. He presented himself as someone who can force President Obama to do his bidding, and in doing so, overstepped the traditional boundaries, those that prevent Israeli politicians from interfering with the U.S. presidential elections. If it does turn out that we are changing our policy - the one that says that we will cooperate with whomever is elected president - we're making a serious mistake.
	A president who does not want to set red lines for Iran, as Bibi Netanyahu wants, is correct. A great power will maintain ambiguity in order to have freedom of action. Everyone knows that it can exercise force - certainly it has more means to do so than we have; it doesn't have to publicly announce that fact. It certainly doesn't have to let Bibi call the shots.
	It's enough for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to see the aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf in order for him to understand that the United States will choose the timing and the nature of an activity, if there is one, even without the panic being conveyed by Bibi. Obama is being portrayed as a "dove," but this is the president who spent billions on the hunt for and assassination of Osama bin Laden.
	During South Africa's years of apartheid, a senior government official there told me that "if we had five million Afrikaners in America we would never have surrendered." That is the insane type of thinking that motivates right-wing extremists and the proponents of Greater Israel who support Bibi. The prime minister's conduct toward Obama could definitely be interpreted as behind-the-scenes meddling aimed at preventing Obama's election to a second term.
	Obama's aides are not blind to the phenomenon called Sheldon Adelson, who is spending tens of millions of dollars to defeat the incumbent president, in favor of the Republican candidate. This is the same man who finances the free newspaper in Israel that supports Netanyahu and his views, and is indirectly responsible for the Israeli newspaper crisis. There is no shortage of presidential friends and advisers who are whispering in his ear that Bibi is inciting American Jews against him.
	Nobody in the world is happy about Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons. It's not only Israel's problem. Iran is building long-range missiles that cover Europe. The leaders of the European countries have reason for concern and are afraid that the Israeli initiative will drive the Iranian leaders crazy, and cause them to launch missiles in all directions in the name of Allah. The leaders of Germany, Great Britain and France, not to mention the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are rightly warning Bibi, in unequivocal terms, not to act and not to present Iran with an ultimatum.
	In a full-page spread in one of the newspapers here, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. James A. Winnefeld, is seen pointing out to a smiling Bibi a map that includes Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Yemen and Turkey, as well as tiny Israel. A news editor with a macabre sense of humor would caption the photo: Look how small we are within the huge Islamic world.
	Defense Minister Ehud Barak is no coward. But as opposed to the impression that he is leading Bibi into battle, he has recently turned out to be the responsible adult. He is not enthusiastic about Bibi's ultimatum. "Great powers don't like ultimatums." He sees the very fact that the Iranian issue is on the world agenda as an achievement. Barak believes that our situation would be better if there were progress on the Palestinian issue. As opposed to Bibi's view, Barak also says that we could have repaired relations with Turkey a long time ago, were it not for Israel's insistence on not apologizing.
	Barak claims, according to an unconfirmed rumor, that during Obama's four years, the peace process with the Palestinians was nonexistent. Every past president engaged in some type of peace-promoting activity: Bill Clinton - Oslo 2; George W. Bush - a road map and Annapolis; George Bush Sr. - the Madrid Conference. Is it possible that there is veiled criticism of Bibi in Barak's reported comment? Perhaps. If Obama does end up meeting with Bibi in America, there won't be any great love lost there.
	When Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borisov stood next to Bibi during his official visit here, he probably recalled the Bulgarian proverb, "When God wants to punish someone, the first thing He does is take away his brains."

<title>Decoding Bibi's West Bank agenda</title>
<date>Wed Aug 01 13:40:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
The prime minister’s policy of de facto annexation of the West Bank will end badly for everyone, and there will be no way out.
It took a while, but the prime minister’s political ideology seems to have been decoded. The designation of a university in the West Bank city of Ariel, Judge Edmond Levy's report that Israel is not an occupier, the construction of more than a thousand new buildings in the settlements and intensive Israeli activity in Area C in the West Bank, all indicate the fundamental political principles that guide Benjamin Netanyahu.
Despite the comfortable situation at present – no terror attacks, international pressure or political opposition – Netanyahu understands the ground is quaking beneath the feet of the Zionist project. Even he can put two and two together. Israel cannot absorb millions of Palestinians and remain a Jewish country. What is the solution? In the past, Netanyahu was firmly opposed to a Palestinian state. But he has supported a two-state solution since first endorsing it in a speech at Bar-Ilan University in 2009. We were supposed to rejoice over the triumph of the Oslo Accords' ideology. The problem is that Netanyahu's application of the ideology on the ground is putting Israel's existence in danger.
Defective, partial implementation of the Oslo Accords has created the current situation, where the Palestinian Authority only controls the territory known as Areas and B, comprising 40 percent of the West Bank. These areas are scattered like an archipelago in the ocean of Area C – the 60 percent of the area under Israel’s control – cut off from each other and at the mercy of the Israel Defense Forces. Area C includes many settlements, few Palestinians and mainly open areas. The Oslo Accords required these open areas to be handed over to the Palestinians by 1999. This was never done.
Israel's new approach can be called "Bibi C." Netanyahu's overarching goal is simple, the tactic is clever and the results are disastrous. The aim is to control as much territory with as few Palestinians as possible, and to claim that the Palestinians can establish a state on the remaining land.
In this scenario, Israel controls the Palestinian state's entrances, exits and water supply, the Jordan Valley, the Dead Sea, the air space, most of Jerusalem and the border with Jordan. The room for flexibility in final status negotiations will decrease to the point where tunnels and bridges will be needed to create a territorially contiguous Palestinian state and the Palestinians will be left asking Israel how much of Area C it is willing to part with (very little).
The placement of 124 settlements and a hundred outposts, together with what academics used to call a "stakeholder analysis," indicates that Netanyahu is interested in annexing about 40 percent of the West Bank.  
We should remember that in the talks between Palestinian leader Abu Mazen and former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, which almost led to an agreement, Olmert offered to annex about six percent of the West Bank with an equal amount of territorial compensation elsewhere. United States President Bill Clinton’s proposal spoke of three to six percent annexation, with compensation.
Israel has already de facto annexed Area C. The route of the separation barrier is no longer relevant. Creeping annexation is taking place deep within the West Bank, coming right up against Palestinian population centers in Ramallah, Nablus and Hebron. Israel is investing billions of shekels in land in Area C and deliberately preventing the development of Palestinian infrastructure there. At the same time, a sophisticated campaign is under way to change the way the public regards Area C, and the Levy report is part of that. Also, in light of proposals to apply Israeli sovereignty to “all the communities in Judea and Samaria,” Netanyahu will be able to portray his plan as relatively moderate.
A situation is taking shape on the ground from which there will be no way back. If this trend continues, even if leaders like Yitzhak Rabin or Ehud Olmert come to power and wish to go back to the two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders with territorial exchanges, the situation will not allow it. A downward slide toward the occupation of the West Bank, the crumbling of the Palestinian Authority and an apartheid regime are not far off.
The policy of de facto annexation will further weaken the moderate Palestinian camp, which will be forced to admit there is no way to bring about the end of the occupation and establish a sustainable Palestinian state by holding peace talks. At the same time, the Western and Arab world will realize where Israel is headed. The ramifications could be devastating, with Egypt and Jordan severing relations, Europe and the United States implementing boycotts and the world coming to view Israel in much the same way it did South Africa's apartheid regime.

<title>Do we need to tone down the rhetoric? </title>
<date>Fri Jan 06 02:50:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
On a recent trip to Israel, law professor Alan  Dershowitz complained about the cognitive dissonance between the Israel as presented by the local media, with headlines about democracy in danger and brewing fascism, and the Israel of serious and unrestricted debate that he experienced during his stay. The overheated rhetoric not only gives a false image to friends and foes worldwide, but feeds the international anti-Israel campaigns, Dershowitz suggested. If Israelis call their own government fascist or their society apartheid, our enemies would argue that it must be so.
Dershowitz gives us fair warning that Israel's delegitimizers exploit the careless use of politically-loaded epithets. And we probably should be more sensitive to the fact that our harsh self-derision sounds different to non-Israelis than it does at home. But toning down the discourse is not easy and may not always be desirable.
Israel is an in-your-face society. People prefer directness to subtlety, they tell you what they think, they talk over each other, and rudeness begins far beyond what some Americans and Europeans are used to. Israelis reject as insincere what are elsewhere considered social niceties and diplomatic language.
If a public figure in the U.S. or Europe is observed to be angry, he or she is presumed to have lost control. But here, expressing anger is often taken as a sign of passion rather than weakness. Rhetoric routinely reaches the highest decibels, and raising one's voice is part of the patter. An outburst might quickly be followed by a rapprochement.
The etiquette of civility, which for example limits the hostilities in Republican debates to candidates challenging each other's records and low-flame sniping, is not the norm in our political discourse. Demagoguery rules from left to right. Leaders like Yitzhak Rabin, who shunned demagogic vocal tricks and emotional manipulation, are the exception.
The escalating use of the language that disturbs Dershowitz - terms like "fascist," "democracy-at-risk" or "apartheid state" - comes from the increasing frustration felt by many who feel that nobody's listening. Dershowitz sees himself as fighting the good fight against those seeking Israel's destruction, which could explain why he didn't criticize the far more vindictive language used against the left and liberal center in the right-wing and ultra-Orthodox press: Terms like "traitor," "abomination" "or self-hating Jew" probably do not serve the delegimitizers.
But we Israelis are operating in a different arena. Both the left and the right use alarmist discourse to stir things up, as a call to arms, to mobilize the base and to reassure that base that they are not the only ones who feel things are spinning out of control. It is deployed tactically, to link issues that may grow out of the same soil - think of the summer's social protest or the anti-democratic legislation - or to simplify issues so it is easier to rally support. While it would be best to examine each issue in its full complexity, in most cases, neither the media nor its consumers are up to this task.
But ultimately, bombast is popular, even when inflammatory and dangerous, because the democratic process of reasoned debate that Dershowitz suggests he sees in Israel is increasingly absent from our political process. If citizens and politicians do not have the basic trust that one side will either persuade the other through discourse or reach a tolerable compromise when persuasion fails, then there is little cause for discussion. Part of our current government's real culpability lies in its efforts to prevent reasoned debate on our most existential national challenges.
Many of us tune out scorched-earth rhetoric, yet it's effective. Witness the protests over gender segregation. While any violence resulting from media coverage of the subject is abhorrent, the country is now debating an issue that extends from bus lines to city streets to billboards and down to some first-grade classrooms in state religious schools. It's not likely that our citizens or leaders would have responded to less overblown reactions or more moderate commentary.
We are far from fascism, and our imperfect democracy is still operating, but eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. While we do not have to write our detractors' tirades for them - we could, for example, side with Amos Schocken  (in his piece in Haaretz English Edition of November 25, 2011 ) in making more careful distinctions, when he wrote that Israel is not an apartheid state, but that some aspects of the occupation do indeed resemble apartheid - we cannot afford to muzzle ourselves either. So long as we are still at liberty to be vigilant, we must sound the alarm when we feel the need. Our enemies will find ammunition to use against us, with or without our help.
Perhaps at this stage in our evolution, we can only begin to analyze our internal conflicts more deeply once we have finished yelling our heads off. And perhaps we need a government that seeks to promote discourse, rather than to stifle it.

<title>Freedom for Jerusalem, the capital of Israel and Palestine</title>
<date>Mon Apr 02 04:51:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	On the first night of Passover, the festival of freedom, the song "We were slaves but now we are free" will waft from homes throughout the country as Jews sit down to celebrate the seder. But every year, these words lose some of their luster. Every year, more Israelis go from being free men to slaves.
	They're slaves to the urge for power and the instinct of fear, slaves to the land, slaves who rule another people. A nation that after thousands of years in exile won its political freedom has become the slave of Jewish zealots, the slave of gravediggers who have made a blood pact with Muslim zealots. The slave of a government that has turned the words of the Hagaddah - "In every generation they rise up against us to annihilate us" - into foreign policy and domestic propaganda.
	For a short period, too short a period, we smelled the blossoms of true freedom. This was from 1966, when Israel abolished its military government in Arab areas, until the establishment of the military government in the occupied territories a year later. It was a period of freedom from official discrimination against the Palestinian minority at our mercy. Freedom from the fear of a neighbor and the terror of the demographic demon.
	Levi Eshkol, the prime minister who was considered a vacillator if not a coward, understood then that there could be no democracy with first-class citizens who enjoyed full freedom and second-class citizens whose freedom was restricted. Eshkol wasn't a leftist. Nor was legendary Finance Minister Pinhas Sapir, who warned that if we continued to hold the territories we had occupied in 1967, they would soon hold us.
	In view of Israel's hawkish governing coalition and the Palestinian leadership's long crisis in the territories, it's hard to believe that next year we'll be free people in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel and Palestine. The "diplomatic process" has become the code name for a process of enlarging the settlements and building outposts.
	Senior security officials predict that the lack of hope for a solution to the conflict will produce a new round of violence in the territories. Diplomats predict a decline in Israel's international status. The common excuse of "there is no partner" has turned into an alibi for the policy of sit and do nothing; it has become a surefire recipe for perpetuating the situation of masters and servants in the territories. The more negotiations on a solution recede , the closer we are to the day when the number of servants exceeds the number of masters. How do we get out of this mess?
	The movement Atid Kahol-Lavan (A Blue and White Future ) is led by Ami Ayalon, a former cabinet minister, head of the Shin Bet security service and commander of the Israel Navy; businessman Orni Petrushka; and attorney Gilead Sher, who headed the talks with the Palestinians for Ehud Barak. They have created a paradigm for a diplomatic solution. Their blueprint is not conditional on renewing negotiations. They propose "constructive unilateral steps" to reach a solution to the conflict. In other words, moves that promote a gradual reality of two states.
	The main points of the plan:
	b A declaration by Israel's government that it is not demanding sovereignty over the territories east of the separation fence, and a willingness to bring back the settlers who live in those areas or outside the big settlement blocs;
	b A construction freeze east of the fence and in Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods;
	b Continued construction inside the settlement blocs as an incentive to renew talks, without which the fence will become the permanent border;
	b Implementation of a law for evacuation by choice and compensation to residents of isolated settlements, with no link to a final-status solution;
	b Preparation of a national plan to absorb settlers who return to Israel proper, with or without an agreement.
	The movement's leaders assume that the dynamic will stir hope and encourage the sides to open serious negotiations based on the 1967 borders and land swaps. They are striving to carry out the plan through a dialogue with the settlers, whose ideological leaders they are in close contact with. Economists working for them have learned the lessons of the evacuation from Gaza and have spotted housing solutions and employment opportunities in the center of the country (other than Tel Aviv ) for residents of the isolated settlements.
	The blueprint proposed by Atid Kahol-Lavan isn't perfect. But in view of the suspicions and gaps between the sides, it seems to be the only alternative to the stalemate and/or apartheid and/or futile negotiations leading to violence. Perhaps at the next festival of freedom we'll complete the story of the Exodus from Egypt for our children with news of the exodus from the settlement of Yitzhar. If you will it, it is no Passover dream.

<title>Guilt-tripping the world is dangerous for Israel</title>
<date>Thu Mar 22 04:04:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	As if the horror in Toulouse wasn't enough, as if the suspicion that Al-Qaida was involved in the attack wasn't enough, and as if the constant criticism of Israel wasn't enough, we've invented another imaginary enemy: Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief.
	Ashton made some distasteful remarks about the cruel fate of children who had been killed, unintentionally mixing road-accident victims (Belgium ), war victims (Syria, Gaza and Sderot ) and hate-crime victims (France ). And immediately, I mean immediately, Israel fomented an international scandal, despite France's very impressive stand with the Jewish community, first and foremost by its president.
	Not a very important stateswoman, but apparently a good-intentioned one, Ashton misspoke. We realize that her intentions weren't bad, certainly not anti-Israel. Listening to her full remarks proves this. Ashton bemoaned the fate of children killed for nothing, as politicians like to do. But the thunderous attack from Jerusalem (and Tel Aviv ), orchestrated by the prime minister and the foreign minister, and backed up by a chorus of journalists and pundits, was wrong and unnecessary, no less than Ashton's remarks.
	Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs Minister Yuli Edelstein said that if he weren't a minister, his attack on Ashton would have been even harsher than his "Israel is the most moral country in the world" (no less ). Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman let loose with another nationalist pronouncement, and they all demanded that Ashton get down on her knees and beg for forgiveness.
	Even when she did this, even when the EU's ambassador to Israel, Andrew Stanley, tried unsuccessfully to explain, it wasn't enough for Jerusalem. Ashton was marked as an enemy forever.
	The day after the crime in Toulouse, Israel should have praised the French authorities and been gratified by their solidarity. The Jewish people and the State of Israel don't see such displays very often. Israel has never stood at attention the day after a hate crime; never has there been such a show of solidarity with a minority community that was attacked. Ashton's remarks should have been ignored, or maybe we simply could have taken modest note of them.
	But Israel doesn't act like that. It's enough that we suspect that an unfortunate remark has been made, especially if it comes from a relatively weak politician who isn't American. No one would have ferociously attacked Ashton if she had been a representative of the United States.
	This attack on Ashton and others like her is suspect; it probably wasn't sincere. Perhaps once again we're cynically using a statesman's faux pas to wring more and more guilt feelings about Israel, to instill more and more fear into the world's statesmen and to make more and more worthless political hay.
	Israel hunts down such remarks as if it were the Anti-Defamation League. The long-term implications are dangerous. Ashton, who was never perceived as an enemy of Israel, but rather a typical European stateswoman who believes that the Israeli occupation should end, might watch her tongue, but now she'll hold a big grudge against Israel for humiliating her. That's not good for Israel.
	Israel must never be compared to anything else - not to apartheid and not to other oppressors of freedom around the world, not to other occupation regimes and not to other colonialism. We're always something else. The children of Sderot must not be compared to the children of Gaza, the children of Toulouse must not be compared to other children who are slaughtered elsewhere in nationalist hate crimes.
	Our children are different, not only to us - that's natural. But they must be different to the whole world. That's our uncompromising demand. Neither must the Palestinian struggle be compared to any other fight for liberation elsewhere around the world. Anyone who dares compare Israel to anything else - their fate is sealed.
	The Ashton mini-storm will be forgotten in a day. Israel will celebrate another minuscule victory, but the residue will build up. It wasn't Ashton who lost her senses, but rather Israel, which is playing the role of the eternally offended party, once again seen in a maudlin light. And this happened just as the world was responding compassionately to the victims and was remarkably empathetic toward Israel.

<title>Human beings whose bodies are one big black star </title>
<date>Fri Jun 01 04:26:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	We bought a basket of cherries at the greengrocer's, and on our return home we noticed the label: "Yattir Forest Cherries." No name of the grower, no phone number, no post office box, nothing. Is someone out there in the South Hebron Hills, beyond the Green Line, trying to hide? Do they intend to deceive us?
	And what will we do with the suspicious cherries - eat them or throw them into the garbage can? Even if they're sweet, a bitter taste will remain in our mouths. For a moment I thought of consulting with Ovadia & Sons, with the w"Beit Yosef" kashrut supervisors, but they specialize in a different kind of swinishness, and give a seal of approval to different abominations. Oh, holy impurity: It's all in the family, Kosher Nostra.
	And then I thought of contacting the South African ambassador, maybe he knows: What do Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu do in such cases? What do they do when they don't want to eat pickles, to drink stolen water, or wine from the vineyard of Naboth?
	But over the radio I heard that the ambassador had disappeared. After he found out about the meeting in the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem where he would be reprimanded, he went underground; where is he? The Danish ambassador is also thinking of changing his address and cutting off contact. The low-chair method is proving itself - they're afraid.
	Because what will they have to say in their defense? They have no chance of leaving this inquiry safely. "This is singling out Israel unfavorably on a clearly political basis," said the spokesman when the scandal was revealed: They are plotting to force us to engage in truth in advertising, to distinguish between products of the settlements and Made In Israel. And who has ever heard of a government that decides "on a political basis," and of another country that offers the fruits of stolen land.
	And here is a reminder: The Israeli government promised 10 years ago to mark the difference clearly - Yesha (Judea and Samaria ) is not here. Since then the government has been using our money to compensate factories in the settlements for their losses. But the Ahabs who are being robbed insist on both benefiting and deceiving. Israel did not keep its promise, blurred the borders and mixed up the products. And they still come with complaints to those who have been deceived, who wanted to buy grapes and cherries and were sold rotten fruit.
	And perhaps the ambassador is hiding out somewhere and refusing to go up to Jerusalem because he fears for his safety. He is liable to look like a foreign worker, a cancer or a microbe, and Miri Regev is liable to stone his car on the way and shatter the windshield. Never mind that she is now a Knesset member, but only yesterday this cow was a brigadier general in the Israel Defense Forces, and we can wonder why she wasn't appointed a major general on the basis of her profile. I won't forgive her and her girlfriends, MKs Ronit, Tzipi H., Anastasia, Yulia and Limor for undermining my hope for a better world under female leadership.
	The South African government, with all due respect, is also not exempt from suspicion of ulterior motives - is it possible that they remember there what Israel did to them? Do they still bear a grudge against us for remaining among the last of the collaborators with the racist regime? Do they know in South Africa how to smell apartheid-like regimes from afar?
	The moon of Alabama is shining on Tel Aviv and Eilat. How fortunate that its light did not reveal crystal dishes, mahogany furniture and pianos. After all, what are we talking about here: about human beings who are in any case broken and battered, whose bodies are one big black star.
	And another good thing: For a brief period another "other" has been found to whom we can condescend and whom we can blame for everything, and a million "non-Jews" who live among us will enjoy a temporary respite. Xenophobia is a permanent variable, only its victim changes from time to time, and he doesn't have to be an Arab, who is harder to identify in the street, whereas all the blacks have the same face, especially at night.

<title>If only Israel were South Africa </title>
<date>Sun Sep 02 03:49:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
When did you last cry at a movie? It happened to me two days ago: Three times the tears flowed during one film, which is no trifling matter. The first time it happened was during a film at the Tel Aviv Cinematheque when the screen showed Adriaan Vlok, former minister of law and order in South Africa's apartheid regime, kneeling to wash the feet of Maria Ntuli. His people had poisoned Ntuli's teenage son, then blew him up together with nine other youths in his car, and he, one of the most reviled and apparently cruel figures of the Apartheid era, now spends his days distributing food to the families of his victims. When Vlok entered Ntuli's home she recognized him and went into shock; later he washed her feet in a Christian and humanistic ritual that could leave no one indifferent.
The second time the tears welled up was when one of the leaders of the violent opposition to apartheid, Rashid Ishmail Abu Bakar burst into bitter tears when he heard the story of his Israeli interlocutor, Robi Damelin, whose soldier son David was killed during the second intifada, and is now active on the Parents Circle forum of bereaved Israeli and Palestinian families.
The third time my eyes dampened was when Desmond Tutu began crying while telling Damelin that the day will come when Truth and Reconciliation Commissions will be set up in Israel and Palestine, as in his country.
Watching Miri and Erez Laufer's documentary "One Day After Peace" on Damelin's journey to the country of her birth, South Africa, is not only emotionally moving; it also reflects sadly on the abyss between Israel and South Africa. Just imagine Ehud Barak kneeling one day in the Jenin refugee camp to wash the feet of a bereaved Palestinian father; try to imagine Shaul Mofaz distributing food in the Deheisheh refugee camp, or Moshe Ya'alon doing the same in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. After last week's summer day dream in which Israel allowed hoards of Palestinians to come to the Tel Aviv beach, the fantasy of establishing truth and reconciliation commissions here seems farther away than ever, yet at the same time it sparks the imagination.
When comparing the similarities and differences between the occupation regime in the territories and the apartheid regime in South Africa, one must include the endings: There, it is a good one, while here an ending seems so far away. For the sake of reconciliation, Damelin, a noble and brave woman, is prepared to accept the release of Ta'er Hamad, the sniper who killed her son and nine other Israelis at the West Bank roadblock, even though he replied to her with a vitriolic letter from prison. But here one can still only dream of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions like the one in South Africa.
Israel does not cease to tongue-lash South Africa. Only last week Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon announced that "the apartheid regime has not ended" (because South Africa dared to mark goods manufactured in the settlements ). But even this ridiculous, boorish declaration by the deputy foreign minister of a state that cooperated with apartheid cannot blur the impressive lesson that this country could bequeath to Israel. But in Israel such a possibility seems hallucinatory and cannot be considered as long as the occupation continues and the injustice does not end.
And despite all of that, let us imagine, even for a moment, that far-away day when Israel will kneel and ask for forgiveness. The moment when the heads of the occupation regime admit their iniquities to the Truth and Reconciliation Commissions that will be formed here too. The day when the whole truth is revealed by its instigators, and in the footsteps of truth, and only in its footsteps, can come reconciliation. This sounds crazy? Yes, but toward the end of the 1980s, not a long time ago in historical terms, no one would ever have imagined seeing Adriaan Vlok enter the homes of blacks, kneel down to wash the feet of his victims, and watch as his victims hug him.

<title>Islamism is the real enemy of Muslims and Israel</title>
<date>Sun Sep 09 10:52:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
Islamism, and not ‘Islamophobia,’ is the real enemy of Israel, in contrast to the opinion published in Haaretz recently. Islamism is also my enemy: the enemy of all free-willed Muslim humanists.
Consider the latest stronghold of political Islamism - Ahmedinejad’s Iran, where last month 77 programs at 36 universities promptly became ‘single gender,’ instantly banning women from their studies. Ideologically, Iran is increasingly Islamist, promoting a way of thinking that is both ferociously misogynist and anti-Semitic. The global threat posed by Islamism is a central focus at this year’s International Institute of Counter Terrorism’s 12th Annual World Summit in Herzliya, Israel, that begins tomorrow.
I first encountered gender apartheid ‘in the name of Islam’ when practicing medicine in Saudi Arabia, an experience I explored in my first book. My upbringing as a pluralist Muslim daughter by liberal, yet devout, British Pakistani parents was poor preparation for Saudi Arabia indeed. Saudi Arabia excludes women from the public space by fallaciously claiming a ‘foundation’ in Islam. Saudi Arabia blatantly disregards Islam’s enshrinement of those rights of women most likely to be trampled upon by men.
Shia Iran’s confinement of women is identically motivated. Rather than faith-based however, both the extremist Shia administration in Iran and the Sunni Wahhabi theocracy in Saudi Arabia pursue identical political goals. The elimination of women from Iran’s universities solidifies increasingly Islamist-centric policies, while in Saudi Arabia, the traditional tribal monarchy relies heavily on legitimacy borrowed from a fundamentalist and misogynistic interpretation of Islam. Both demand first the bridling, and later, the complete subjugation, of the Muslim woman.
A Muslim public tightly coiled against an increasingly strained and hysterical leadership, Iran fears the growing power of its female intelligentsia, which presently outcompetes its male counterparts in Iran’s universities. These women trigger rising anxieties in a brittle leadership acutely aware that non-Arab Iran remains vulnerable to the aftershocks of the Arab Spring, never forgetting that the female Iranian university graduates who led the 2010 electoral protests were the vanguard of the uprisings in the Arab world, though sadly their protests would be brutally quashed as a disengaged West looked on.
Examining Iran’s constitution explains the intensifying Iranian Islamist appetites of which gender apartheid is integral. Originally born in the Sunni Islam of 1928's Egypt, political Islamism has only recently penetrated the Shia psyche. Today, Iran’s constitution is now brazenly Islamist, as Richard Horowitz, former Israel Defense Forces officer and New York attorney - who represents Iranian dissidents and former Iranian political prisoners - describes in the World Policy Journal. Speaking to Horowitz in New York City this week, he cited Article 20 of Iran’s constitution:“All citizens of the country, both men and women, equally enjoy the protection of the law and enjoy all human, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, in conformity with Islamic criteria.”Horowitz immediately observed to me that “the essence of ‘constitutional rights’ is that they are not subordinate to legislation or theology. Article 20’s ostensible protection of equal rights for women is immaterial if it must be ‘in conformity with Islamic criteria,’
Political scientist Dr. Bassam Tibi, a renowned global expert on Islamism, has also noted the vacuum on women’s issues within the political Islamist canon, a gap indicating the complete dismissal of women in Islamist society, even from the mere effort of discussion.
Just as perverse, Islamist anti-Semitism is an essential construct for political Islamist ideology. Make no mistake: just as the Iranian regime actively seeks to expunge the Iranian  woman so too it seeks to expunge the Israeli and the Jew.
Islamized anti-Semitism is more dangerous than the lethal Eurocentric Nazi or neo-Nazi ideology with which the world is more familiar. Because Islamist anti-Semitism wields invented religious currency, (lending it false, but hugely influential import) it become orders of magnitude more dangerous. Religionized in this way, Islamist anti-Semitism can be localized whilst being camouflaged in the rites and responsibilities of the observing faithful – a grand deception indeed, and one which invests enormous cultural and spiritual capital in subscribing to anti-Semitism.
The new Islamist anti-Semitism is indeed rooted in Eurocentric origins, deriving inspiration particularly from genocidal Nazi ideologies. Initially transplanted during the Nazi era, Eurocentric anti-Semitism was first embraced by secular Christian Arabs and later by secular Muslims as an accepted tenet of pan-Arab nationalism seeking to overthrow the vestiges of European colonialism. It was thus disengaged from religious belief.
Present-day Islamized anti-Semitism is a different animal. Despite valiant Islamist efforts to portray an ancient origin to the contrary, the new Islamized anti-Semitism is very much a modern allegory standing in stark contrast to Islam’s scriptural texts or Islam’s recorded history of interaction with global Jewry.
While Islamists (including Iran) express global intentions seeking a borderless, supremacist Caliphate and are thus mortally opposed to secular nationalism, they are unscrupulous ideological plagiarists, borrowing multilaterally when it comes to anti-Semitism.
Infusing anti-Semitism with religious overtones amplifies both its legitimacy and palatability to the unthinking Muslim masses. Further, Islamists’ strenuous laboring to manufacture a fictional point of origin of this Islamized anti-Semitism - as an article of faith - is a serious attempt to retool anti-Semitism as an authentic integral component to Islamic belief, rather than reveal its modern Western Eurocentric origins. Cloaking Islamist anti-Semitism in religious rhetoric simultaneously seduces the uneducated Muslim, while shielding these offensive ideas from scrutiny. Any inquiry into these beliefs triggers cries of Islamophobia that both distances these beliefs from a thorough examination while also defiling the enquirer.  
The Iranian university ban is a final canary in the proverbial mine - a deepening of Iran’s embrace of increasingly extreme Islamist ideologies. As hardships exacted on Iranian women accumulate, so too will the anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric escalate. Iran's leadership is neither mincing its words nor attempting to appease its long-disenfranchised public, which has languished in misery since the Revolution. No, the Iranian public does not move the Iranian leadership. Instead, in the hands of Islamists, Iran's administration is clearly articulating its foreign policy intentions.
Understand: Iran’s is not an anti-Zionism nor an anti-Semitism based on aspirations of Palestinian self-determination. Palestinians are as irrelevant to the Iranian government as are their own women. It is for this reason that even the achievement of a two-state solution would not free Israel from the threat of Islamism, whether from Iran or elsewhere. Rather, these are the cries of an Islamist superstate.
The world is long inured to an 'acceptable' level of hatred of Israel - and many warning canaries in the mine will continue to die, unnoticed. Extreme speech, however, precipitates extreme action. Dyadic discourse becomes increasingly simplistic and bipolar as conflict approaches. We can already see the diminishing nuance in the Iran-Israel discourse today.  
In Islamists, the secular Muslim, the anti-Islamist Muslim, the Israeli and every woman everywhere shares the same opponent - one that can be defeated only by joining forces both intellectual and military. At this critical moment, liberals here and abroad face a pivotal choice. They can either advance public dialogue within vibrant liberal democracies as we consider how best to scrutinize and head off the challenge of political Islamism. Or, if liberals choose to condemn such critical debate and analysis of Islamists – not of Islam in general - as ‘Islamophobic’, then we are handing a victory to the Islamists themselves who seek to silence this very discourse. Such liberals should know that our silence means we are colluding with those who seek our shared destruction even, so help us God, as we shield our nascent destroyers.

<title>Israel can't seem to kick the West Bank settlement drug</title>
<date>Sun Feb 12 04:42:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Today - a few days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the reconciliation deal between Fatah and Hamas a sign of Palestinian refusal of the peace process - the Ministerial Committee for Legislation will discuss another project showing Israel's addiction to the settlement drug.
Coalition Chairman Zeev Elkin and his Likud colleague Zion Pinyan have proposed an amendment to the law governing tax breaks on contributions to foster the growth of communities. Donors will be able to deduct 35 percent of their contribution. Thus the state's tax exemption to institutions that promote public goals will be expanded to include organizations that promote the settlements.
The initiators of the legislation say the amendment has a "negligible" significance on the budget. But its political significance cannot be overstated.
The proposed amendment, like declaring the settlements a preferred development area and promoting the legalization of outposts, is a crude breach of Israel's international obligations. Ariel Sharon's government, in which Netanyahu served as finance minister, pledged in 2004 to U.S. President George W. Bush to stop allocating resources to encourage settlement in the occupied territories. This move was designed to stop creating hasty facts on the ground that would make it difficult to implement a two-state solution.
What are your thoughts on this issue? Follow Haaretz.com on Facebook and share your views.
Elkin and Pinyan say the tax break for contributions is intended to bring progress to communities throughout the country and strengthen "Zionist values." Hopefully the cabinet is aware of the contradiction between Zionist values on the one hand and fostering settlements and erasing the Green Line on the other. The de facto annexation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem undermine Israel's Jewish and democratic character and threaten to leave it with a choice between a binational state and a pariah apartheid state.
The day after his victory over Likud's extremist wing, headed by Moshe Feiglin, Netanyahu boasted that the party's members had shown their faith in his policies. The initiative to encourage the settlements and defend the outposts, like the moves to dodge diplomatic negotiations, make it hard to spot the difference.

<title>Israeli Arabs have never been equal before the law </title>
<date>Tue Jan 17 03:49:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Last week's decision by the High Court of Justice to uphold the amendment to the Citizenship Law that keeps Palestinians apart from their Israeli spouses has closed a chapter in the life of Israeli democracy. The Supreme Court no longer wants to protect Israel's Arab citizens.
Racists sitting in the stands at soccer games who yell "Death to Arabs" have never ripped a mother away from her children. But Justice Asher Dan Grunis and his friends have rendered such expulsions kosher, and the representatives of Israel's Arab citizens will now have to bring the issue to the international community.
Of the amendment upheld by the High Court, Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken wrote in this paper in May 2005: "Ostensibly the amendment to the Citizenship Law is equitable. It prevents a man from Haifa from marrying a woman from Ramallah and living with her in Haifa, and does not distinguish between Jews and Arabs. But it's clear that it isn't equitable: Jews rarely marry Palestinians."
For three days afterward, in a hysterical response, Maariv's entire opinion page was devoted to wild attacks on Schocken and his piece. Only one of the opinion pieces is even worth quoting: that of Prof. Amnon Rubinstein, author of "The Constitutional Law of the State of Israel."
"Every state, even if not by law, has the right to prevent immigration of any kind from an enemy state or enemy territory," Rubinstein wrote at the time. "Must Israel permit immigration from Syria? Of course not. Was England, during World War II, obligated to permit immigration from Germany, or even from German protectorates? Of course not. So why doesn't this rule apply to Israel?
"It's true, the Palestinian Authority is not a state, but if a ban on immigration applies to an enemy state, it applies even more so to an enemy territory."
Afterward, Rubinstein published statements to this effect as part of a scholarly academic article, which expanded the argument with the help of numerous references and citations. He later chaired a government committee that justified this wrongdoing.
Why is Rubinstein worth quoting? Because before leaving the Knesset in 2002, he was an MK representing Meretz, the last significant political party of the Zionist left; because his words are cited by Grunis in his ruling; and because Rubinstein is considered a veteran analyst, a member of a select group of legal commentators who sat quietly for eight years, since the amendment came into force as a "temporary emergency measure."
Even now, these legal commentators are not commenting. The looming expulsion of thousands will be carried out with the silent agreement of enlightened members of society. This silence does not stem from their deep respect for the High Court of Justice. Its cause is that maintaining a Jewish majority is an ideological common denominator for the overwhelming majority of Israelis, and this ruling is a symptom of the demographic arguments made on their behalf.
But in effect, Rubinstein was lying. In order to discriminate against the Arab citizens of Israel, Rubinstein wrote about residents of the territories, who do not live in an enemy state. They live in an Israeli ghetto, a bantustan, without the right, as blacks had in apartheid South Africa, to earn a living from their masters.
The State of Israel is officially in its 64th year. But it can be more accurately seen as an imaginary entity that existed in reality only for the 19 years between 1948 and 1967.
Temporariness is an illusion. For jurists it's also a cynical trick.
The expulsion of women and children from their homes will be carried out by a state that has never held Arabs to be equal before the law. That's the real reason an Israeli constitution was never written. That inequality was the wound. Now it's just pus.

<title>Israeli roulette </title>
<date>Mon Jul 30 03:47:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Recently I had a heart-to-heart talk with a beloved relative who was born in this country, in an effort to persuade her to return and bring up her children in Israel. I was reminded of this conversation when I read the speeches made last week by the two leaders of the nation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak, at the graduation ceremony of the National Security College.
	In his speech Netanyahu presented the five leading challenges that threaten the country: the Iranian nuclear program, the missile threat, cyber warfare, problems near the borders and the stockpiling of weapons in the region. He promised Israel would do its utmost to stop the Iranian nuclear program. He vowed that, to the extent that it is necessary, Israel would surround additional parts of the country with security fences, alter the composition of its forces and increase the defense budget.
	Barak went even further in enumerating the disasters that confront us and could destroy us. The challenges we face, he said, are among the most complex and complicated that the state has faced in its entire existence. He warned that the Iranian nuclear plan could turn into an existential threat against the state, prophesized that neither diplomacy nor sanctions would be able to stop it, and promised not to remove any option from the agenda to thwart it. For dessert, the minister promised that Israel would not stand by idly watching while sophisticated weapons systems are transferred from Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
	The prime minister ended up his lecture by expressing his belief that the sons of Israel would be ready "to throw themselves into the mission of defending the country in a way unequalled in any other country." Barak told the graduates that at the moment of truth, if faced with the ultimate test, Israel would be able to rely only on itself.
	A country that has promised to provide Jews who have gathered there from all corners of the globe with peace, security and welfare, is offering them more blood, more sweat and more tears. They would not have phrased the national vision better at the graduation ceremony of the National Security College in ancient Sparta.
	Three years after his Bar-Ilan speech - in which Netanyahu repeated the word "peace" 44 times - he added it again at the end of this speech, like a leftover, when promising to safeguard Israel's security "and also our ability to preserve peace and to achieve peace with other neighbors."
	The prime minister mentioned the State of Israel's existence as a state, and as a Jewish and democratic one, only in the context of the need to guard the borders "from illegal infiltrators."
	Solving the conflict with the Palestinians won no mention in the list of national security challenges that the two most influential people in Israel presented to the graduates of the college. They did not even pay lip service to the "peace process" or a "two-state solution" which also has been imprisoned in quotation marks.
	In a hair-raising report about her experiences in Syria, published last week in The New York Times, the courageous writer and war correspondent Janine di Giovanni wonders: "When does life as you know it implode? How do you know when it is necessary to pack up your home and your family and leave your country? And if you decide not to, why?"
	Is life in Israel where we wanted to raise our children - a peace-loving country that believes in democratic and Jewish values and in a society of solidarity - not imploding on us? How do Netanyahu and Barak intend to revive these values on the morning after the bombing of Iran and the bombing in retaliation? Will it perhaps enter their minds to relate after all this time to the Arab peace initiative that has been waiting embarrassedly for more than a decade - or will they allow Israel to sink even deeper into the reality of apartheid?
	Who wants to go to sleep with the nightmare that he may be among the 500 victims of the confrontation with Tehran or to awaken in the morning with the fear of a missile attack from Lebanon? How many Israelis believe that another round of violence in the territories, with its danger of deteriorating into a regional conflict, will not be a war of "peace for [the outpost of] Migron" - that magical Israeli term that turns every war into peace and every occupation into a vision.
	How many Israelis ask themselves why they remain in a country that has become the most dangerous place for Jews? And who is prepared to recommend to a beloved relative that she should come home and raise her children here?

<title>Israelis can be angry with Gunter Grass, but they must listen to him</title>
<date>Sun Apr 08 00:51:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	The harsh, and in some parts infuriating, poem by Gunter Grass of course immediately sparked a wave of vilifications against it and mainly against its author. Grass indeed went a few steps too far (and too mendaciously ) - Israel will not destroy the Iranian people - and for that he will be punished, in his own country and in Israel. But in precisely the same way the poem's nine stanzas lost a sense of proportion in terms of their judgment of Israel, so too the angry responses to it suffer from exaggeration. Tom Segev wrote in Haaretz: "Unless Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad recently confided in him, his opinion is vacuous." ("More pathetic than anti-Semitic," April 5 ). Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu mentioned Grass' Nazi past, and Israeli embassies in Germany went so far as to state, ridiculously, that the poem signified "anti-Semitism in the best European tradition of blood libels before Passover."
	It is doubtful that Grass intended his poem to be published on the eve of Passover. It contains no blood libel. In fact, it is the branding of it as anti-Semitic that is a matter of tradition - all criticism of Israel is immediately thus labeled. Grass' Nazi past, his joining the Waffen SS as a youth, does not warrant shutting him up some 70 years later, and his opinion is far from vacuous. According to Segev, anyone who is not a nuclear scientist, an Israeli prime minister or an Iranian president must keep silent on the stormiest issue in Israel and the world today. That is a flawed approach.
	Grass' "What Must Be Said" does contain things that must be said. It can and should be said that Israel's policy is endangering world peace. His position against Israeli nuclear power is also legitimate. He can also oppose supplying submarines to Israel without his past immediately being pulled out as a counterclaim. But Grass exaggerated, unnecessarily and in a way that damaged his own position. Perhaps it is his advanced age and his ambition to attract a last round of attention, and perhaps the words came forth all at once like a cascade, after decades during which it was almost impossible to criticize Israel in Germany.
	That's the way it is when all criticism of Israel is considered illegitimate and improper and is stopped up inside for years. In the end it erupts in an extreme form. Grass' poem was published only a few weeks after another prominent German, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Sigmar Gabriel, wrote that there is an apartheid regime in Hebron. He also aroused angry responses. Therefore it is better to listen to the statements and, especially, finally, to lift the prohibition against criticizing Israel in Germany.
	Israel has many friends in Germany, more than in most European countries. Some of them support us blindly, some have justified guilt feelings and some are true, critical friends of Israel. There are, of course, anti-Semites in Germany and the demand that Germany never forget is also justified. But a situation in which any German who dares criticize Israel is instantly accused of anti-Semitism is intolerable.
	Some years ago, after a critical article of mine was published in the German daily Die Welt, one of its editors told me: "No journalist of ours could write an article like that." I was never again invited to write for that paper. For years, any journalist who joined the huge German media outlet Axel Springer had to sign a pledge never to write anything that casts aspersions on Israel's right to exist. That is an unhealthy situation that ended with an eruption of exaggerated criticism like Grass'.
	Grass is not alone. No less of a major figure, the great author Jose de Sousa Saramago opened the floodgates in his later years when, after a visit to the occupied territories, he compared what was going on there to Auschwitz. Like Grass, Saramago went too far, but his remarks about the Israelis should have been heeded: "Living under the shadow of the Holocaust and expecting forgiveness for everything they will do in the name of their suffering seems coarse. They have learned nothing from the suffering of their parents and their grandparents."
	After we denounce the exaggeration, after we shake off the unjustified part of the charge, we must listen to these great people. They are not anti-Semites, they are expressing the opinion of many people. Instead of accusing them we should consider what we did that led them to express it..

<title>Israel is fighting a losing battle over victimhood</title>
<date>Mon Mar 19 01:28:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	With regard to A.B. Yehoshua's extraordinary remark - that he had "never heard the Jews analyze the Holocaust as a Jewish failure, which was not anticipated" - I can only wonder where the renowned author was when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu waved the "Auschwitz letters"? Yehoshua didn't hear that Netanyahu said that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is the new version of Adolf Hitler? He didn't know that Netanyahu had promised that he would not, under any circumstances, allow Iran to carry out a second Holocaust? Doesn't Yehoshua understand that Shoah equals victimhood - not guilt, not failure, and without any doubt whatsoever - and that the ability to play the victim is a strategic asset with an existential value?
	In her new book, "Who is Afraid of Historical Redress: The Israeli Victim-Perpetrator Dichotomy," Dr. Ruth Amir wrotes that the perception of Israeli-Jewish victimhood, which was always present in the Jewish narrative and Jewish thought, became even stronger after the Holocaust and serves to give Israel political legitimacy.
 What are your thoughts on this issue? Follow Haaretz.com on Facebook and share your views
	Amir, who heads the Department of Multidisciplinary Studies at the Jezreel Academic College (full disclosure: This writer is a member of the college's board of governors ), notes that the fact that Israel sees itself as a victim justifies its aggression and injustice. With the help of guilt-neutralizing mechanisms, Israelis disengage the circumstantial link between an action and its consequences, and absolve themselves of responsibility. That is why they aren't interested in trying to correct injustices and reconcile with their neighbor.
	The death of John Demjanjuk recalls the declaration that Shulamit Aloni attributes to the late Prime Minister Golda Meir after the Eichmann trial: "Now, when everyone knows what they did to us, we can do anything we want, and no one has the right to criticize us and tell us what to do." Meir even apparently commented that she would never forgive our enemies for "forcing" us to kill them - another victim-like comment.
	Prime Minister Menachem Begin said before the bombing of Beirut during the first Lebanon war that "No country that fought in World War II has any right to preach morality to us, since they did nothing to stop the killing and extermination of the Jews."
	Victimhood purifies the victim of any guilt and enables him to request empathy - even if he is the stronger, victorious, occupying party. This duality is the reason that for years, victimhood speeches by Israeli leaders have succeeded in bringing American Jews to their feet, applauding, and getting them to open their wallets.
	The problem is that since World War II the language of human rights has been gradually taking the place of the Holocaust in diplomatic and moral discourse. Even in Germany it's getting harder and harder to play the role of occupier-victim. Sigmar Gabriel, the chairman of that country's Social-Democratic Party, who has his eyes on the chancellor's seat, visited Israel and the territories last week and didn't hesitate to write on his Facebook page that in Hebron there is an apartheid regime.
	If you remove the Holocaust and victimhood from the debate, Netanyahu's claim that "Israel has the right to defend itself," turns into a double-edged sword. How then, are we meant to respond to the Palestinian leader who will claim: "It's the right of a people without a state to defend itself?"
	True, there is a difference. Israel is not threatening to destroy the Palestinians. It is "only" taking their lands and has "only" been holding them under a regime of occupation for 45 years, without basic civil rights. From another perspective, if it's justified to impose sanctions on Iran because it desires nuclear deterrence, why is it forbidden to impose sanctions on Israel so as to stop settlement in the territories?
	Remove the Holocaust and victimhood from Israel and then ask yourself: If it's permissible for this country to bomb Iran to free itself from a nuclear threat, then why are the Palestinians forbidden to launch rockets against Israel to free themselves of the occupation? Does Jewish construction in the occupied territories accord with the law and international consensus any more than the Palestinian request to be accepted as a UN member? For how long will the Holocaust save the world's last colonialist government from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, when it is trying to withhold nuclear power from Iran?
	Without entering into self-righteous symmetry, it must be said that many of the Palestinians have yet to wean themselves from their addiction to the Nakba (the so-called catastrophe of the creation of the Jewish state ) and their own victimhood. The key to their old house in Sheikh Munis (now Ramat Aviv ) that they wear around their necks will not open the door for them to a Palestinian state.
	In this endless battle, the battle over victimhood, everybody loses.

<title>Israel needs a few more lessons in apartheid </title>
<date>Mon Jan 30 03:01:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Scholars of the social sciences know how to defend a public opinion survey. In their way of thinking, this is a scientific tool with which it is possible to assess feelings and understand positions and trends at any given time. Together with these "quiz shows" that supply the masses with a glimpse of the mood of the public, we are also able to familiarize ourselves with the personal feelings, points of view and tendencies of those who conduct the polls.
Zionism did not merely pave paths of ethnic discrimination in the occupied territories. Discrimination against civilians exists in every corner of the country. Research institutes and the media, whether intentionally or not, cooperate with this discrimination and also perpetuate it. In parallel to that, the slogan "a light unto the nations" is repeated here ad nauseum. It is therefore worthwhile comparing the situation in Israel with that among "the nations."
Take, for example, the Population Registry Law. During the era of apartheid in South Africa, the citizens of that country were forced to register themselves with the authorities on the basis of their skin color: white, black or colored. In Israel it is not possible to oblige people to sign up in the registry according to their race or color, since the Jews themselves belong to assorted colors and races: Some are white because they came from Poland or Russia, and others are dark skinned - from Yemen or Ethiopia. With no other option, the Zionist mind was forced to invent a unique solution that was suitable to this place, and which answers the need for separation, and thus it was that the registration was born, of Jews, Arabs, Druze and so forth, in the Israeli Interior Ministry.
Another discriminatory law that was enacted in South Africa allotted separate living areas to different races. One can compare it with the local law about selection committees, whose entire objective is to make it possible for various community settlements to chose who will be allowed to become members - based on ethnic background.
Recently the state has managed to peek into the bedrooms of the Arab citizens via the Citizenship Law, which places restrictions on their marriages. And the last word has not been said on this matter.
The election season is drawing close here. This will no doubt bring blessings and money to all who deal with it, first and foremost the polling institutes. From reports about the surveys we can learn that ethnic separation is alive and well, both in these institutes themselves as well as in most of the Israeli media. Indeed, the latter will pounce on the polls' findings. Politicians will rush to check their popularity among herds of voters. The disappointed politicians who lack inspiration and intelligence will turn to recipes supplied to them by the witch doctors known as media advisers. These witch doctors will instruct the aspiring politicians how to win the support of the masses. Between them and their followers, they will no doubt explain that a political platform is not as important as the show: The more the hopefuls sweat, run around and appear on every screen, the greater their chances of influencing the average voter.
The public opinion surveys also tell us, as noted, about those who conduct them. "If elections were to be held now," the pollsters tell us, this party would get this number of seats, and that party would get that number of seats. Then, at the very end of the detailed report about this and that, within the context of the "menu" of Jewish-democratic parties, will come the eternal sentence: "And the Arab parties will receive such and such a number of seats." Because in the eyes of every "educated" Zionist, every single Arab is an Ahmed, or is assumed to be an Ahmed.
It is therefore not clear why so much time and money is being spent. After all, the election results are a forgone conclusion: 110 Knesset seats to the Jewish parties and 10 seats to the Arab parties - is that not so? Here is yet another lesson in the apartheid sciences.

<title>Israel's 'agricultural apartheid'</title>
<date>Sun Mar 25 04:13:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria can be broken down into a number of periods - the settlement period, during which dozens of communities were established (mostly under the Labor Party, and much of it due to President Shimon Peres ); the agricultural period, during which settlers took over land, cleared stones, planted and sowed; and the period of tourism, during which wineries, bed and breakfasts, restaurants and tourist attractions were built under every tree.
	The agricultural period began some 15 years ago and has continued to this day. Some of the settlements described as agricultural, like Ofra, Carmel and those in the Jordan Valley, started their relationship with the land about 35 years ago. However, there are good people in the military advocate general's office who do not look favorably upon Jewish farmers in Judea and Samaria and are doing their best to remove Jewish presence from the area. Agricultural apartheid. One of the most important and creative means is the "directive for disruptive usage."
	According to Israeli law it is possible to evict someone who has entered an area that is not their own for 30 days after the fact. However, the directive for disruptive usage states that Jews can be evicted from land they have cultivated for as long as three years, and later this period of time was extended to five years. This applies even if the land has never been cultivated before, even if for years no single Arab has claimed ownership of the land, and even if there is no proof of another person's ownership.
	This directive discriminates against Jews. It is a racist directive. The head of the Civil Administration, Brig. Gen. Moti Almoz, recognized the fundamental problem and has so far avoided implementing it. This act, or more precisely the avoidance of taking action, has angered the legal advisers at Central Command and especially Col. Eli Bar On, who wrote a sharply worded letter to the Civil Administration head, reminding him of his role and of who runs things. He apparently forgot that he is a legal adviser. His role is to advise, and only when he is asked.
	In the letter Bar On tries to explain the reasons why the directive should be implemented - an absence of court proceedings, a lack of legal tools and an inability to access a land registry. Of course these are ridiculous claims and are fundamentally exaggerated. The courts are full of Palestinians submitting complaints all the time. And they have a fleet of top-ranking lawyers from the most moonstruck of the left-wingers.
	The fourth argument in Bar On's letter is that it is necessary to "minimize the number of conflicts and their intensity." In other words, the honored brigadier general says it is possible to prevent Palestinian violence if the Jewish side surrenders in advance, instead of holding a fair trial as is accepted throughout the world.
	Sometimes an appeal against implementation of the directive is filed with the military appeals committee. In some cases the appeals committee accepts the appeal but the state evicts the Jewish farmer nonetheless. Why should we bother with trivialities since we are in the business of justice?
	The directive of disruptive usage embroils the Civil Administration in civilian land disputes. This is not its role but the role of the courts. If someone has a claim and proof, then he should turn to the authorized organ for a decision. There is no way this directive would be accepted through proper legal proceedings. It would not pass legal evaluation at an earlier stage since it contradicts the fundamental principles of human rights.
	I think Bar On has become confused on a number of levels: a. The head of the Civil Administration should not intervene in civil land disputes; b. A legal adviser should not forcefully intervene in the decisions of the head of the executive authority on the ground; c. He apparently has forgotten that this is a Zionist state.

<title>Israel's irrational defense establishment </title>
<date>Mon Apr 30 02:05:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	It's safe to assume that when former Shin Bet chief Yuval Diskin spoke of the "two messianics" leading the country, what he really meant to say was that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak are acting on irrational motives.
	During this week's Independence Day celebration, Barak - who invented the image of Israel as a villa in the jungle - suggested the prerequisites for being accepted into the rational leaders club, insofar as rationality is defined "in the Western sense of the word." He explained that it isn't enough for rational leaders to be "sophisticated and calculating, aspiring to remain in power, and aiming for their goals with unending cunning while continuously gauging the steps and intentions of their rivals." They must prove, he said, that "they are seeking peaceful solutions to the problems on the agenda."
	Barak was referring, of course, to the ayatollahs who rule Iran. It would never occur to any of our leaders to employ calculation and cunning to break up a party while remaining in power. We clearly have a government that has been turning every stone in search of peaceful solutions.
	The following questions ought to help Barak determine whether he and Netanyahu are indeed worthy of the title "rational in the Western sense of the word":
	Would rational leadership deny the risk that intensifying the occupation and freezing negotiations with the Palestinians - combined with the growing solidarity of the general Arab public with their brethren in the territories, the regime change in Egypt, and the increased pressure on Iran - might put an end to Israel's monopoly on nuclear weapons in the region (according to foreign sources, of course )?
	Is it rational to ignore the possibility that a change in U.S. government and the rise in oil prices will generate international pressure on Israel to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and to eliminate weapons of mass destruction from the Middle East?
	Would rational leadership toss out a peace initiative that has the support of all the Muslim countries, an initiative that offers our little state recognition within borders that will be accepted by the whole world, with some territorial exchanges, normalization and security arrangements?
	Would rational leaders ignore the fact that the absence of a Syrian partner offers Israel an opportunity to come to a separate agreement with the Palestinians, without having to address demands that it give up the Golan Heights?
	Does rational leadership - whose raison d'etre is to preserve its country's Jewish and democratic identity - spend massive resources dispersing its Jewish population in a manner that advances the post- or anti-Zionist concept of turning it into a binational state, or a leprous apartheid regime?
	How rational is it to calmly accept the Knesset speaker's declaration that he would prefer a binational "Whole Land of Israel" to a Jewish state within the 1967 borders, while expelling foreign visitors who come to support a similar arrangement?
	Would a rational leadership talk day and night about "Judaizing Jerusalem," while angrily attacking those who suggest returning to the West Bank the Arab neighborhoods that were annexed to Jerusalem after the Six Day War, and whose population constitutes a third of the city's residents?
	Does anyone know a rational person who dares to seize his neighbor's land and then expects to find a judge who will take seriously his claims that expelling squatters from the property would have far-reaching social consequences?
	Would a rational leadership gamble that the hybrid creature called the Palestinian Authority - which was meant to be part of an interim arrangement - will forever serve as the occupation's subcontractor?
	What's rational about assuming that Greek taxpayers who can't make their own ends meet will pay the salaries of Palestinian teachers and policemen, instead of Israeli tycoons (the price, based on a cautious estimate, would be NIS 12 billion a year )?
	The tragic failure of this test is not just the failure of Netanyahu and Barak; it is the failure of most of Israeli society. What's rational about "social leader" Shelly Yacimovich denying that there's a connection between peace and social welfare? The tens of thousands of Israelis who demonstrated to improve their quality of life, but who refused to say a word about life itself, are irrational men and women.
	There is no great measure of rationality in the way the heads of the defense establishment are conducting themselves, quietly serving irrational leaders and divulging the bitter truth to us only after they take off their uniforms.

<title>Israel's legal 'abuse' of Arab minority is undemocratic</title>
<date>Mon Jan 23 03:38:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
It is difficult to compare the democratic State of Israel to a dark dictatorship. Nevertheless, they have one thing in common: People don't sleep well at night under either regime.
In dictatorships, they fear a revolution on the part of the majority, and in Israeli democracy they do not stop studying the graphs of the birth rate among Arabs, in case the demographic balance is upset.
And there is another commonality: Both groups of the population are oppressed. In a dark dictatorship, the minority oppresses the majority while in Israel, the regime which is supported by an ethnic majority that oppresses the minority.
For 63 years, Israel has not stopped abusing its perfectly pleasant minority, and all of this is completely legal. Every dunam that has been expropriated was approved in the Knesset, every house that was destroyed was sanctified by a court. Local governments in Arab areas are discriminated against in their budgets on the basis of ministerial procedure. All of this is able to take place because the representatives of the ethnic majority are in control in the Knesset, the government offices, the economic institutions and the legal system.
Thus, and also as a result of the demographic phobia, another chapter was written this month in the attempt to harass the minority. The Citizenship Law prohibits Palestinians from living with their Israeli spouses within Israel proper. So, in the guise of an innocent "regulation," women are separated from their husbands and children from their parents, and their lives are turned into an ongoing nightmare.
In the enlightened world, a regulation of this sort would have been thrown out immediately. In Israel it gets the blessing of the Supreme Court of the ethnic majority. The Supreme Court, which is supposed to be the court of last resort for the downtrodden, has left the Arabs without succor. And the Arabs who have learned from their long years of suffering, say: "If your judges deprive you, then to whom can you complain?"
To whom will the Arab citizens complain when the liberal flank - Yair Lapid, Tzipi Livni and Shelly Yachimovich - do not say a word in the face of this injustice, while the right-wing jumps for joy at the suffering of the Arabs?
Meanwhile, the children want to grow up. They cannot wait until the weather is fair. And with the intoxicating smell of the Arab Spring, another arena for struggle is growing - the international arena, with all its institutions. But a hypocritical cry will issue forth from the majority, as if the Arabs are undermining the country's right to existence. No, the Arabs are merely complaining about the right of the majority to abuse them.
No regime has the right to oppress part of its residents, whether it is a corrupt dictatorship or a blooming democracy. But like an abusive husband who forbids his wife to go to the police because one does not air dirty laundry in public, so Israel would like its Arab citizens to behave. Let the laundry smell inside.
And there are people who hope that the minority will move to another apartment because of the smell. The ones who are invited to move to another apartment are those who are disturbed by the crying of a newborn baby, whether it is Arab or Jewish. An Arab baby that is born is not the product of a conspiracy. An Arab baby, like a Jewish baby, is a blessing.
It is important to note that the expression "ethnic majority" is a rough generalization, since many Jews are courageous partners to the struggle against racism. The call for international public opinion to raise its voice completes the struggle of the democratic forces here. This will make it clear to all that the right-wing establishment in Israel has crossed a line in the direction of apartheid.
When Menachem Begin was prime minister, there were intellectuals who pinned their hopes, in vain, on the American administration restraining him. Like then, we cannot wait for salvation to come from the White House. Only the enlightened public opinion of the world can help. And that is for the benefit of the entire family, including those members who on the face of it are not deprived.
Karl Marx said that a people which oppresses another people cannot be free. This is also for the benefit of the ethnic majority which is entitled once and for all to sleep well, without nightmares about demography, and which is entitled to be a people that is free from abusing Arabs.

<title>Israel's suicidal left</title>
<date>Mon Jan 02 02:38:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Most people support having separate showers for men and women at the pool, object to walking naked in the street, and believe that the norm for modest dress is defined by whatever is acceptable in Western countries. That is a short summary of the stupidity over gender separation.
It's ironic that a nation whose life is founded on the cruel separation between citizens and those subject to occupation is capable of anointing anyone a Rosa Parks, as though we were blacks in Alabama and not the ladies and gentlemen of the last remaining apartheid, whose end is nowhere in sight.
Every few months, the Israeli anti-Semitism comes out of the closet and takes the form of what sociologists call "moral panic," which seems to give people license to distort and confuse various issues, especially when you add the beards and traditional dress of ultra-Orthodox men into the mix. Those who are especially meticulous even make sure to give the Jew-boy in their cartoons a hooked nose. This isn't the first time this has happened. There was the uproar about the mother who starved her child, about the Taliban sect, about the pervert who tortured children, about separate classrooms.
The fact that ultra-Orthodox women work in professions including teaching, social work and occupational therapy while the men are increasingly cooking and taking care of the children - even those alternative gender roles are thrown into the distorting pot of incitement.
The enlightened revolutionaries demand a single set of standards for everyone - their own standards. "How much are they costing us?" ask the learned professors, who enjoy financial benefits that no yeshiva head  (or professor in France or Germany ) gets.
During the 1998 "One People, One Draft" campaign, the leftist herd marched to the notes of political correctness, and in the process rehabilitated the image of the army, which had reached a low point during the first Lebanon war and the first intifada. What started with serving in the army as a condition for equality has ended up with efforts to pass a law requiring a loyalty oath.
It should be no surprise, then, that the periodic incitement against the Haredim leads to right-wing extremism. Incitement always ends up with adoration of the state. Thus, Meretz's efforts in the 1990s to make Ashkenazim scared of Shas gave birth to the centrist and secularist Shinui party, which swallowed up the left-wing Meretz party and then itself was swallowed up by Avigdor Lieberman's right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu.
It's about time that the average liberal acquired some historical perspective and asked himself, "What are we really doing when we pursue Haredim and make believe we are battling the right wing?"
There are indeed thugs in Beit Shemesh, and there are a few bus lines that have come to represent those territorial battles - characteristic of all the Jewish contradictions of the Zionist project - that exist between the Haredi minority and other parts of the population. But what does this have to do with the "social protest"?
It's true, the religious are gaining power within the Israel Defense Forces. Some of the army's policies - and not just the draconian prohibition of leaven on Passover - tend to accommodate them. But the liberals can calm down: The army needs soldiers, including religious ones, to separate the Palestinian men from the Palestinian women at the checkpoints, but on the other hand prides itself on the advancement of women. Now women can also sit in front of plasma screens and carry out assassinations at the push of a button, perhaps even while singing. Women's liberation at its best.
So the question isn't who needs the constant incitement against "the Haredim." There are different interested parties at different times, and television, for its part, needs to have a steady target so it can glorify freedom of the press - and promote equality for women, as espoused by beautiful female broadcasters who will be tossed as soon as they show a few wrinkles.
The question is, how does this periodic panic succeed in becoming anti-Semitic psychosis?
The imperative is modernization, which gives Israelis a good part of their identity and self-image. Being modern is the keyword to naturalization in our imaginary Western society.
True, we have left the Arab minority alone, as long as they let us steal their land and turn them from small farmers into poor proletarians, but the Jews who were brought here were put through a process of violent modernization. While there was usually no resistance, there are bitter historical memories.
The Haredi community is the only one challenging the state's modernist ethos. The conflict between modernism and anti-modernism appears to be inevitable, and it has turned the left into the persecutor, as if it were the state, as if the opposition doesn't need an alliance with those who object to state policies - including Haredim, Mizrahi Jews and Muslims. This is the weakness of the Israeli left: It is rooted in the ruling elites who hate minorities.
It's easy to travel to Europe and be postmodern there. It's harder over here. But more important, the right wing and the religious Jews that are the components of what is commonly referred to as the "natural alliance" don't need more fodder for incitement against the left. What the common folk call "condescension" is simply modernist discourse, as if there is only one worthy criterion for social values and only through it can we communicate.
You'll never build an opposition that way.

 Nefesh B'Nefesh bashing
	In response to "Land of Milk and Money," Haaretz Magazine, October 26
	It is with great sadness that I write this letter. I was frankly horrified at the mean-spirited journalism in Haaretz concerning Nefesh B'Nefesh. Nefesh B'Nefesh in partnership with the Jewish Agency has done so much to bring Jews to Israel in the last 10 years. They have smoothed the way and cut red tape and other obstacles so that we in Israel can be blessed with more olim.
	Why your newspaper saw fit to be so vicious and provocative in its presentation of Nefesh B'Nefesh is beyond me. At a time when Israel needs all Jews on deck, at a time when we're searching for good news, Nefesh B'Nefesh is on the scene with one goal only: to bring more Jews to Israel and help them stay in Israel, live and work here and be productive citizens.
	Tony Gelbart's home in Florida bothers you? That Rabbi Fass has a beard is a problem for you? These are men with a vision, and they have made many people's dreams come true. They are devoted to a lofty cause, and I say more power to them.
	My dear editor, what was really bothering you to have such a piece of journalism like that appear in your paper? Is NBN too successful? Your article smacked of intense jealousy and yellow journalism, and you can do much better. I hope not to have to see articles of that doubtful caliber again in your newspaper.

 Where the funding should really go 
	In response to "How to best spend Jews' money," October 26
	The second to fifth words in Anshel Pfeffer's column are "120 most important Jews" who will be in Jerusalem October 31-November 1 for the Jewish People Policy Institute meeting. Who are these 120? Except for a few names, we are left in the dark. Will Home Depot's owners be here, will Mark Zuckerberg be here, will Martin Gilbert or Philip Roth be here, will the real Hollywood David Geffen or Bobby Dylan be here?
	The wispy theme running through Pfeffer's story is that there is plenty of money out there for world Jewry to spend on Israel, Judaism and a strong Jewish future. He is unhappy with how all this money is being spent, so he showers us with his Big 5 list of where the cash should really flow.
	I happen to agree with his point that indigent Holocaust survivors who made it through hell are being shortchanged. He mentions that some of the money is being applied to "education" or "commemoration." But he could have told us that if this money goes to the survivors, its holders will have to give up elaborate banquets, five-star hotels, deluxe seating on flights and a multitude of other perks.
	He also emphasizes that Jewish money should stop going to dinosaur organizations. Sad but true, we the Jewish people are saddled by unrepentant groups who still believe their message should get through since they are sure it is the truth. The continual funding for these agencies is what drives many young Jews away from Judaism. They know what "the real thing is."
	His other three points have no attraction for me. For all three, I would substitute a major investment in Jewish education in the Diaspora. Synagogues and temples are still the largest educators in every locale Jews might live. But the schools, for the most part, are weak because Jewish religious institutions are poorly funded in this area. Give a $25,000 grant to every synagogue and temple in the world for innovative learning programs in Jewish education.
	About 35 years ago, Prof. Marcella Brenner z'l, a talented U.S. educator and philanthropist, met with officials from the Education Ministry. She was prepared to donate major sums of money and increase it regularly so Israeli teachers could create innovative programs for their students. The program offered teachers a chance to think outside the box; many of their pilots have become Ministry courses. If we could do it here, why not all over the world? Look out this week as the modern Sanhedrin lands.

 Akin to a blood libel 
	In response to 'Most Israeli Jews advocate discrimination against Arab citizens,' October 23
	As a long-time subscriber to Haaretz in English, the respected paper's shift from left of center to far left pains me. October 23's lead headline is outrageous. It is based on a minuscule survey of 503 Israeli Jews and interpreted by Gideon Levy in a front-page article.
	The 503 respondents were divided into five distinct groups. How many in each group? How many men, how many women? Young, old? Levy doesn't tell us. Was it conducted by phone or by questionnaires? The questions' formulations are not revealed, so we can't tell whether "most" Israeli Jews actually "advocate" discrimination of Arab citizens or merely tolerate it (bad enough! ).
	Now, by "most," most people think of a number way above half, say around 70 percent. Let's see: In the beginning of the article, the percentages of Jews who supposedly advocate various forms of Arab discrimination are 59, 49 and 42. Frightfully too many, but certainly not "most." On the contrary, toward the end, the percentages of secular Jews who oppose various aspects of Arab discrimination are 68, 73 and 50. Since the secular Jews are a majority, one can conclude that most (regrettably not the vast majority ) of Israeli Jews actually oppose Arab discrimination.
	But most outrageous is Levy's conclusion that "we're racists" and "we practice apartheid." Now, a bigoted person can be called a racist. A person who intentionally blows up a bus filled with passengers can be called a mass murderer, a terrorist, an activist. But "apartheid" is not subject to interpretation. It is a documented system of odious laws and sanctioned practices imposed on the large majority of blacks in South Africa by the small ruling minority of whites.
	Throwing apartheid at Israel is akin to the medieval blood libel, to equating us with the Nazis. According to the article, "the survey conductors say perhaps the term apartheid was not clear enough to some interviewees." It obviously was not clear. Is it clear to Levy?

 Dangerous nostalgia 
	In response to "Native Son," Haaretz Magazine, October 12
	Meron Benvenisti's nostalgia for the Israel of the founders is temperamentally undemocratic. How dare the present generation create its own culture in defiance of the visions of the founders? This is not only Benvenisti's problem. Nostalgia has become the sickness of our time. As Eric Roll wrote in "A History of Economic Thought":
	"It is [during] ... rapid and radical changes in the economic and social structure that there can be found those who are distressed ... but who cannot rise to more than an idealization of the past. They want to re-establish a mythical golden age, since they cannot understand the forces which are transforming their own society."
	Benvenisti confirms Roll's analyses when he says: "I don't understand exactly what is happening. Everything is different. Not what we wanted it to be." His fetishism of the land is reminiscent of Knut Hamsun's and Heidegger's views and not much different than Gush Emunim's.
	He might consider the political and cultural consequences of this land fetishism and how it resulted in some of the greatest crimes in history. This nostalgia for a simpler soil-based existence is dangerous. As historian Peter Gay has written: "Nostalgia is the most sophistic, most deceptive form that regression can take."
	In any case, his claim that the Arabs have a more "authentic" relationship with the soil (as opposed to the invented Zionist relationship ) is just another kitsch version of Orientalism. The truth is that second-generation educated Arabs have no more attachment to the land than Manhattan apartment dwellers.
	As for the one-state constitutional communalism he hints at, one only has to look at Lebanon to realize how impractical the concept is. Given the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, constitutional communalism would be an oxymoron.

 Who's really guilty of blood libel? 
	In response to Gideon Levy's piece "Survey:Most Israeli Jews advocate discrimination against Arab citizens," October 23
	Mr. Eliezer Kreindler calls it "akin to a blood libel." In fact Mr. Kreindler's letter is a libel.
	When was the last time he visited Hebron? Streets for Jews only, roads in the West Bank where no Palestinian can drive. Of course this is apartheid. Rabbis that call for punishment for anyone who rents or sells their home to an Arab - this is apartheid. Calling this "blood libel" is more horrific than any article even if there were a few errors, corrected today by Levy himself.
	There are laws on the books that would have me arrested if I call for a boycott of goods manufactured in the occupied settlements. And the attitude of cabinet ministers to refugees escaping countries to stay alive - is that not apartheid?
	Sorry Mr. Kreindler you should study what blood libel is. We are slowly moving towards an apartheid single state. And there are many politicians calling exactly for that.

 My family's extraordinary days at Emory U 
	In response to "Emory University apologizes for anti-Semitic past" (JTA, October 11 )
	I found the October 11 article about the Emory University Dental School's apology very interesting. Notwithstanding the unacceptable behavior of Emory, I want to share my family's history with the university starting in the 1920s. My mother, Annette Geffen Raskas, was born and raised in Atlanta, GA. She and five of her seven siblings attended Emory and received a total of eight degrees from the university. At that time Emory was a Methodist University and women were not generally permitted to enroll. My mother's father was Rabbi Tuvia Geffen, Chief Rabbi of Atlanta, and he approached Emory's President, Bishop William Candler, asking if there was any possibility that his daughter Annette could attend Emory. The Bishop explained that there were three options for women. Women in the Methodist religious order could attend; relatives of Emory staff members were admissible (but the Bishop apologized that no Jewish studies department existed for Rabbi Geffen ); and lastly, employees of the University could enroll.
	Bishop Candler proceeded to arrange a job for my mother in the University library, which enabled here to earn an undergraduate and masters degree in biology. She was fortunate that there were no longer any Saturday classes at that time, so she did not have to walk the many miles each Shabbat that her three older brothers had to tread while earning their degrees at Emory before her. Six of Rabbi Geffen's grandchildren and their families now live in Israel including journalist David Geffen of Jerusalem, who is also a graduate of Emory.

 Khenin is the best MK to vote for 
	In response to "There's no one to vote for," October 16,
	The juxtaposition of a photo of MK Dov Khenin with the title of this article represents extremely poor journalistic judgment and editing. Although Dov Khenin may not be the perfect candidate for "a secular, liberal, democratic and fair-minded Arab [or Jewish] citizen," he comes closer than any of his 119 fellow MKs, any one of whose photos would be a more appropriate illustration.

 Letters to the Editor  Time for Russian-speaking Israelis to dump Lieberman 
	Of all the things said about the Avigdor Lieberman's joining the Likud, there has been no mention of the Russian-speaking sector. The lack of media interest in this sector stems from a misinterpretation: The media see the move as a merger of the right-wing parties, whereas in practice Lieberman merely transferred the Russians' "home" from the State of Israel to the Likud party. Political critics viewed the move as exposing the radical nature of the Likud, while left-wingers rushed to urge all the abandoned moderates to find a new political home.
	The Russian-speaking voters saw once again how someone who presumes to be their representative uses them to accumulate personal power and then sells them for a seat with another party. For two elections, Lieberman has been appealing to the Russian population in their language and enticing them to support him. His slogan, which brought him power, is simply, "Da, Lieberman." For years he has been a senior minister and talked to the Russian community using the same determined rhetoric, while in practice, ignoring the issues of concern to them.
	With the support of immigrants from the CIS, Lieberman became foreign minister. Now he has decided "it is much more appropriate to run the country with large parties." In other words, he has had enough of being the representative of a specific group.
	It seems that Lieberman has realized that he now faces a glass ceiling; as the representative of Russians, just like any sectarian representative, there is an upper limit to the number of voters he can attract. The polls also indicated that at most he would maintain his current standing.
	If so, in a smart move for his political survival, Lieberman is dropping the Russian connection at the height of the sector's support for him. After he used that support to gain a comfortable position in the Likud, he expects to hand over the Russians to Benjamin Netanyahu. Like a flock that moves from one shepherd to another.
	Russian speakers should free themselves from Lieberman as their representative. The man who spoke Russian to them, sold them out to Netanyahu behind their backs in order to be able to return to the Likud's embrace.
	The Russian public should change the way it votes and stop searching for a representative, because these always end up exploiting them. Every Russian-speaking person should vote independently, checking which of the parties is closest to representing his positions and which one will place the welfare of the immigrant population as a whole and specifically, of the Russian immigrant population, at the forefront.

 'Superficial' errors in op-ed on Israeli support for apartheid 
	In response to "Errors and omissions excepted," by Gideon Levy, October 29
	In his op-ed piece, Gideon Levy attacks right-wing elements for focusing on superficial errors in his article which, in the Hebrew edition, ran under the headline "Most Israelis support an apartheid regime in Israel." Levy criticizes the focus on a few isolated errors that appeared in the article instead of on the essence and significance of the content of the piece. He claims the right-wing grabbed onto "negligible errors" rather than looking at the broader picture, in order to deflect criticism.
	Indeed, if Levy is aware of this method, why does he offer right-wing elements the same loophole? If, as he writes, the findings should in any case cause a scandal why not get the facts right?
	The same "unfortunate mistakes" are not only professionally damaging, but also provide right-wing supporters with the knife the writer claims they are using to stab the nation in the back.

	***
	The comparison Gideon Levy makes in his article between a survey he reported on and a theoretical survey in France are misguided. The Jews never initiated violent acts against the French; the opposite is true. Israelis' attitude stems from their accumulated knowledge of Arabs, the violence they use, the hatred, the education toward religious wars, the unwillingness to recognize Israel and to compromise. The Arabs are the ones who time after time came out against us with acts of violence and continue to act against us.

 I prayed for the planes to bomb 
	In response to "Maybe Roosevelt couldn't have saved the Jews from the Nazis after all," October 26
	Tom Segev cites historian Prof. Yehuda Bauer as saying that during the Holocaust it was not possible to bomb the concentration camps, among other reasons, because thousands of Jews imprisoned in them would have been hurt. I was "there." After the Nazi conquest, I was imprisoned in the Vilna ghetto for two years and before it was emptied, I fled and fought with the partisans in the forests of Belarus, some 180 kilometers away from Vilna.
	In the fall of 1941, one night Soviet planes passed over the Vilna ghetto heading westward toward eastern Prussia. I prayed, and many others did as I did, that the pilots would bomb the city, knowing that a bomb could fall on the ghetto and injure us. And I still ask: why didn't the allied planes, including those of the Soviet Union, drop fliers in the local language on the occupied territories on which they could have written that the gentile neighbors of the Jews and the various informers would bear responsibility for collaborating with the Nazis and their helpers?
	Given my experiences then, this would have encouraged the Jews and especially those who found shelter with the gentiles, who would later on become Righteous Gentiles. I have yet to receive an answer to this question. Anti-Semitism in America surged during the war; this is a fact. I was "asked to wait" four years to receive permission to immigrate because of the well-known quota. Prof. Bauer says a person can ask why the U.S. did not intervene with the British during the war when two million Indians died of famine. However one injustice does not cancel out another injustice.

 Guilt by association 
	In response to "Apartheid, by any other name," November 11
	Gideon Levy's article is based entirely on the most blatant logical fallacy, "guilt by association."
	It reminds us of that brilliant BBC sitcom "Yes, Prime Minister" in which Sir Humphrey Appleby spoofed this type of illogic by saying "All dogs have four legs. My cat has four legs. Therefore my cat is a dog."
	The arguments quoted by Levy are equally fallacious. For example, his argument is absurd that because the Boers in South Africa and the Zionists in Israel based their right to the respective lands on divine decree, Israel practices apartheid in the West Bank.
	The article's historical statements are as inaccurate as its purported logical arguments. Levy's statement that Israel and the Boers conquered territory (South West Africa ) in violation of international law is untrue. Israel's War of Independence and the Six-Day War were undoubtedly legal defensive wars.
	South Africa did not conquer SWA in 1910. It was a German colony since 1884. During World War I, SWA was taken by South African forces acting on behalf of Britain. After the war it was declared a League of Nations Mandated territory with South Africa responsible for administration.
	The statement "The violence of the African National Congress and the Palestine Liberation Organization, respectively, was reactive" cannot remain unchallenged. The PLO was not reactive. It was founded in 1964 before there was an occupation or settlements to react to. Its declared objective was to destroy Israel within its internationally recognized 1948 borders by armed struggle as the overall strategy, not merely a tactical phase.

 Fact-checking the fact checker 
	In response to "Bennett gets his kingdoms wrong; Maoz his empires, November 12
	Chaim Levinson writes that Habayit Hayehudi Chairman Naftali Bennett was wrong when he said Israel was the only country where "judges appoint judges." But then, as a good journalist, Levinson notes that in Spain, for example, judges are appointed by a committee in which over half are chosen by parliament, thus creating a balanced system. "Only in Israel do judges control appointments to the Supreme Court," Levinson concludes, which seems to prove Bennett correct.

 In praise of architect David Reznick 
	I was shocked and saddened by David Reznick's obituary that appeared on November 6. In a word, he deserved much more praise.
	I met David and Rachel shortly after they left the kibbutz. We became good friends and partners in about 1953. Our first project was to build some 60 houses for the members of the Americans and Canadians Association in Jerusalem. Despite a very low budget, the buildings were very successful except for one thing. We never imagined that one day each family would probably own one car, let alone two. Parking design was not a success.
	David went into partnership with architect Heinz Rau; they built many fine buildings together. David's influence on Israeli architecture over the years has been very strong. Many of the best architects today worked in his office or were students of his. There is no other architect in Israel who designed buildings with terraces as an integral part of Jerusalem's slopes as did David Reznick.
	Two examples are the Mormon Center and the Hyatt Hotel. David was asked to design the Holyland development, and I am sure he would have made a building of the hill and not on the hill. He was asked to stop designing and was paid off, as the gentlemen in charge knew he would never agree to anything that wasn't exactly according to the rules. His integrity was absolute.
	He richly deserved his Israel Prize and much more respect than he was granted in your distinguished newspaper.

<title>Meet the Israelis </title>
<date>Thu Oct 25 03:27:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Nice to make your acquaintance, we're racist and pro-apartheid. The poll whose results were published in Haaretz on Tuesday, conducted by Dialog and commissioned by the Yisraela Goldblum Fund, proved what we always knew, if not so bluntly. It's important to recognize the truth that has been thrown in our faces and those of the world (where the survey is making waves ). But it's even more important to draw the necessary conclusions from it.
	Given the current reality, making peace would be an almost anti-democratic act: Most Israelis don't want it. A just, egalitarian society would also violate the wishes of most Israelis: That, too, is something they don't want. They're satisfied with the racism, comfortable with the occupation, pleased with the apartheid; things are very good for them in this country. That's what they told the pollsters.
	Until a courageous leadership arises here, the kind that appears only rarely in history, and tries to change this nationalist, racist mood, there's no point in hoping for change to come from below. It won't come; indeed, it can't come, because it is contrary to the desires of most Israelis. This fact must be recognized.
	The world must also recognize this. Those who long to reach an agreement and draw up periodic peace plans must finally recognize that Israelis are plainly telling them, "No thanks, we're not interested." The Arab world must similarly recognize that this survey (and others like it ) is Israel's real Bar-Ilan speech.
	It's hard to blame Israelis. Years of brainwashing; the demonization and dehumanization of Arabs in general and Palestinians in particular; coupled with years of vicious terror, have left their scars. What, for heaven's sake, do you want from Israelis, who are exposed daily to the media telling them, for instance, that the recent visit to the Gaza Strip by the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, who came to donate hundreds of millions of dollars to build roads, is "Qatar for terror" (as the lead headline in yesterday's Hebrew edition of Israel Hayom put it )? Why would they want to make peace with those who for decades have been systematically portrayed to them seeking only to annihilate them?
	Why would the average Israeli agree to have an Arab student in his child's class or an Arab family in his apartment building if he has never met an Arab and knows of them only as terrorists, criminals or primitive people - the only images of Arabs to which he has been exposed? Why would he think that discrimination against Arabs by government ministries is a bad thing if the only reality he knows is one where Arabs are sewer workers or street sweepers, and he doesn't know that Arabs are capable of more than that?
	After all, even secular Israelis, who displayed the most tolerant views in the survey, don't actually know who they're talking about. When have they ever met an Arab? When have their children met one? And if they have, what kind of Arab have they met besides the delivery boy from the grocery store, the owner of the neighborhood greengrocer, the car-wash employee, Ahmed the plasterer or scaffolding builder? And that's without even talking about Palestinians: The last time (and also the first ) they met a Palestinian, if ever, was during their army service, through the sight of a rifle, as a suspicious and dangerous object.
	Nevertheless, this brainwashing doesn't absolve Israelis of responsibility. It's true that the education system, and even more so the media, incite and inflame, sow hatred and fear. But they do so to conform to their audience's tastes. It's a depressingly vicious circle, in which it isn't clear which came first.
	After all, if the Israeli media thought their brainwashing was repulsive to its customers they would long since have abandoned it. But it knows its customers' hearts. The political establishment, too, understands the nature of the beast. That's why we are now caught in a mad, dizzying race to the right: Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid is vying with Labor Party leader Shelly Yacimovich over who is more right-wing.
	Thus the situation can't be excused on the grounds of incitement: Israelis are always happy to be incited against the Arab from Baka or the Palestinian from the casbah. Ratings-conscious media and politicians facing primary battles are only hitching a ride on them.
	One-third of Israelis want to deny Arab citizens the right to vote; about half of Israelis favor a policy of "transferring" Arabs out of the country; and a majority says there is apartheid here. We need to finally give up on the hope that things will get better.

<title>Netanyahu's hypocritical sermon </title>
<date>Tue Oct 02 04:40:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	What will future historians say about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech at the United Nations General Assembly last week? Not clear. This is the risk he took on - to turn himself into a laughing stock but to be remembered as part of a tragedy.
	Meanwhile the prime minister has inserted himself into the evangelical tradition of demagogic preachers. After he spoke so dramatically about King David, and about some eternal matters that are understood as facts in church sermons, he pulled out the images of Satan who threatens Paradise. It is doubtful whether anyone else since Bush-Blair coalition has dared to prepare the world for a crusade in so cynical a fashion.
	In his arrogant description of Islam (only the militant Islam, of course) he pointed to its many branches "from the rulers of Iran with their Revolutionary Guards to Al-Qaida terrorists to the radical cells" that lie in wait in all corners of the globe. "But despite their differences," said the rewriter of the "protocols," "they are all rooted in the same bitter soil of intolerance."
	The danger to our existence in our ghetto has become even greater, our national life has become more fragile, and over the course of the speech the Palestinians have gradually become the spearhead of this very Islam. In short, an Israeli leader has again managed to describe his pitiable, nebech country with Popeye-like megalomania.
	And as if this were not a speech to those who boycott Darwin's theories throughout the United States, the history lesson continued: "Some 500 years ago, the printing press helped pry a cloistered Europe out of a dark age. Eventually, ignorance gave way to enlightenment."
	True, this was war propaganda and election propaganda, but it was also shamelessness. The printing press and ignorance did not merely make way for enlightenment, and enlightenment was not merely the technological revolution that we heard about, of course, later in the speech - as befits the leader of a technological power that is preaching morality to the savages.
	But let's set aside these details. Here is the breakdown: The leader of the last colonialist country on earth speaks to the representatives of the nations that have freed themselves of the "Western heritage." Who needed to hear about this? The victims of the English, French, Belgians, Dutch and Italians? Are they the ones who have to hear what was done to them in the name of enlightenment?
	If there is something which is central to the "enlightenment" that Netanyahu represented, it was the possibility of standing in New York and talking rubbish in its name while at home there is an apartheid regime and his army is continuing to trample on the Palestinians' hope for freedom, to knock down doors every night, to send people to jail through a ridiculous military judicial system and with weapons of the 21st century, all controlled by the enlightened heirs of King David.
	A second generation of Palestinians has been born into oppression, poverty and humiliation, and a leader from the margins of the West speaks about the darkness of the Middle Ages and enlightenment? By the way, where are the detention camps of Interior Minister Eli Yishai in this puzzle of progress?
	Israelis go wild over their leaders who can speak English with a good accent. Our country is altogether a strange place that cannot differentiate between good English and intelligence. However an historical difference can be discerned between the speech-makers at the UN over the years. Abba Eban excited the Jews of America. Netanyahu excites the Christians there who are anxiously awaiting the the Battle of Armageddon. In 1843, a century before Hitler brought the "Western heritage" to one of its technological high points, Karl Marx wrote in a letter to his co-editor, Arnold Ruge:
	"It is a truth which, at least, teaches us to recognize the emptiness of our patriotism ... and makes us hide our faces in shame. You look at me with a smile and ask: What is gained by that? No revolution is made out of shame. I reply: Shame is already revolution ... Shame is a kind of anger which is turned inward. ... I admit that in Germany even shame is not yet felt; on the contrary, these miserable people are still patriots. ... A ship full of fools could perhaps be allowed to drift for quite a time at the mercy of the wind, but it would be driven to meet its fate precisely because the fools would not believe this. This fate is the impending revolution."
	Marx, of course, was also mistaken with regard to German patriotism.

<title>Obama is turning his back on Zionism </title>
<date>Mon Apr 09 02:52:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Presidential election season in the United States is obviously an especially good time to enlarge settlements in the West Bank and strike new roots in the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.
	The incumbent president reads a report about the establishment of a new outpost for the evacuees from Migron and stuffs another matzo ball into his mouth. The secretary of state hears that the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Homa is to be expanded and asks the spokesman to send out the usual response - the same one that was used for the Gilo plan and those of Har Shlomo, the Shepherd Hotel in Sheikh Jarrah and Ras al-Amud.
	"And what should I say to the journalist who asked for information about that other issue ... what's it called? Oh yes, the peace process," the spokesman remembers on his way to the door. "He said something to the effect that the Quartet's last deadline for presenting the positions of the sides on borders and security passed last week, and that the Israeli document was reminiscent of a grocery store list rather than positions." The secretary of state sighs: "Tell the nudnik that there's no one to talk to at present, and that you'll get back to him when the Passover holiday is over."
	That's what an American administration does when it wants to do the best for Israel. Really? Does President Barack Obama not know that a two-state solution and expanding the settlements in the heart of the occupied territories are, as they say over there, an oxymoron? Does he not understand that Har Homa's constant encroachment upon Bethlehem and the penetration by right-wing extremists into Sheikh Jarrah are designed to wipe out the last chance for a reasonable arrangement in Jerusalem?
	Does he believe there is a Palestinian leader who is willing to hold negotiations with Israel at a time when Jewish thugs, if they aren't busy chasing Palestinians off their lands, are setting fire to mosques or chopping down olive trees? Is the leader of the free world blind to the fact that when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talks about two states, he is referring to a Palestine without the Jordan Valley, Gush Etzion, Ariel, Ma'aleh Adumim and, of course, without one grain of sand from the eternally holy soil of [the East Jerusalem neighborhood of] Shuafat?
	Obama is not blind, and nor is he deaf or dumb. He is just another politician who has turned his back on the values with which he grew up and the people who believed in him, in order to remain in office.
	In his new book, "The Crisis of Zionism," Prof. Peter Beinart tells the story of the black president who grew up in the heart of the Jewish community and betrayed the heroes of his moral values - Abraham Heschel and Stephen Wise, two liberal Zionist rabbis who dared to condemn the settlement enterprise and were pushed to the sidelines.
	Beinart describes how Obama replaced talented advisers such as Dan Kurtzer and Rob Malley, who did not hide their concern over Israel becoming a binational state or an apartheid regime. The book describes the right-wing path which Jewish "leaders" - who never stood for election in the Jewish community - decided on for the president who won 78 percent of the Jewish vote in the last election.
	If professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt once accused the Jewish lobby of harming American interests, the courageous book by Beinart charges it with undermining Zionist interests. The Zionist liberal from New York relates how self-important activists fought against the freezing of the settlements, and how power-hungry philanthropists enlisted Congressmen against the White House after it dared to criticize Netanyahu.
	Beinart also warns of the accelerated manner in which the young generation of Jewish Americans is distancing itself from Israel as an occupying power - a country whose values are not theirs. To Jews with a true Zionist heart, he proposes boycotting products from the settlements (but to try and buy Israeli products ); to take action against American foundations that fund the settlements; and to replace the phrases "Judea and Samaria" and "West Bank" with "nondemocratic Israel."
	At the beginning of October 1973, Lt. Benjamin Siman-Tov, a young officer in the Intelligence Corps of the Israel Defense Forces' southern command, wrote reports warning that the deployment of the Egyptian forces indicated preparations for a war. Only the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War prevented the officer from being sent to jail for "unseemly conduct under fire." Beinart has dared to wash Israel's dirty laundry in public and to criticize the president who is providing it with the washing powder. Because of this, right-wing activists, who are in effect post-Zionists, have begun burning the Siman-Tov of New York at the stake - the messenger who is warning of the terrible disaster engulfing the promised land.

<title>Palestinian Zionism </title>
<date>Tue Sep 04 01:59:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Representatives of American-Jewish businessman Irving Moskowitz on Monday took over a room in the home of the Hamdallah family in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Ras al-Amud. As in previous cases, the emissaries of Moskowitz, whose foundation raises funds for Jewish housing projects in Arab neighborhoods, enjoy a privilege that East Jerusalem's Palestinians don't have: to get back property that was abandoned during the 1948 War of Independence.
	The 15-square-meter room provides yet another small brick of evidence to boost the theory of irreversibility that is gaining strength in the public discourse. The theory holds that it is no longer possible to seriously discuss dividing the land or evacuating the settlements, since the government's decisions, the political stalemate and the resolve of the settlers have already determined that there will be a one-state, binational solution. Just the nature of that state - whether it will more closely resemble a federation or apartheid - has yet to be determined.
	Anyone who wants to see what irreversibility looks like should head to Jerusalem. The Arab residents of East Jerusalem have long continued to see themselves as part of the Palestinian community of the West Bank, even though they are officially Israeli residents and are entitled to vote in municipal (but not national ) elections. But that appears to be starting to change.
	Take the East Jerusalem Palestinians who aspire to an "Israeli" education. They no longer wish to make do with Palestinian matriculation certificates that keep them out of Israeli jobs, and they don't want to wait in line at a roadblock to attend Palestinian institutes of higher learning. They would prefer to earn an Israeli matriculation certificate and attend the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
	The separation fence, along with the discrimination faced by graduates of Palestinian educational institutions, has pushed these youth westward. This process comes on the heels of additional signs of the "Israelization" of Jerusalem's Palestinian population. There has been a drop in fertility rates among East Jerusalem families and a rise in the participation of women in the work force; Palestinian families have been moving into predominantly Jewish neighborhoods and, no less important, can increasingly be found in parts of West Jerusalem that have long been considered Jewish destinations, like Sacher Park, Malcha Mall and Jaffa Street.
	Surveys also point to an increased Palestinian interest in an Israeli-controlled Jerusalem. To the credit of Mayor Nir Barkat, the surveys also show greater satisfaction with municipal services in East Jerusalem. It seems that even violence and racist attacks like last month's severe beating of an Arab youth and Saturday's stoning of Arab vehicles in the Shuafat neighborhood have not affected the encouraging process of the city's two populations' drawing closer to one another.
	Arab observers offer varying interpretations of these changes. One theory states that Palestinian East Jerusalemites are undergoing a process of Israelization and integration similar to that which the Israeli Arabs underwent after the 1950s. Others see the current behavior as a survival tactic, a result of political apathy on the part of a young generation merely looking for a way to make it under occupation. And there is also talk of the creation of a new kind of Palestinian identity that is distinct from that of Palestinians who live in the West Bank or the Gaza Strip, as well as from that of the Israeli Arabs.
	If the theory of Israelization is correct, the next step for Arabs living in East Jerusalem should be immersion in local politics. So far, they have largely refused to vote in Israeli municipal elections, as a way of making a statement about their distinct identity. Their lack of governmental representation has made it easier for the city, and the country as a whole, to discriminate against them when it comes to apportioning slices of the budget.
	For a number of years now, representatives of Jerusalem's Palestinian population have been saying the time has come to break the taboo on voting. If there is a decision of this kind and it is accepted by the public, it will be a tremendous leap forward in the direction of a binational state.
	A united Palestinian ticket (if there were to be one ) could, based on population data, win between 10 and 13 of the 31 seats on the city council. There are even some pundits who think it is possible, even if unlikely, that as long as the Jewish vote continues to be split along religious lines and the city's Arabs succeed in remaining united enough to field only one ticket, the next mayor of the Israeli capital could be a Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
	In that case, Irving Moskowitz would have gotten what he and his followers have been asking for, even if not quite what they actually had in mind: the united home of the Hamdallah family, a united Jerusalem and a united Land of Israel.

<title>Slow thaw for gays in Arab world </title>
<date>Fri Mar 02 03:19:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Although gay Arabs have been generally supportive of the Arab Spring, the Arab Spring has not been very supportive of gay Arabs. But because the activists among them see themselves as part of a broader struggle, they face the question of how much they should set aside their gay activism while fighting for bigger and more immediate goals.
	This question came up last November when a Facebook group wanted to declare January 1 as Egypt's National Gay Day. A blogger in Cairo called Nilesby wrote: "Is shocking people this way going to support our cause, or harm it? Is the time ever 'right'? ... I do think there are times that are more appropriate than others. There are also ways more appropriate than others. How to measure this 'appropriateness'? I have no idea."
	Another blogger dismissed the argument that the time isn't right, and wrote: "Over and over we have waited, and put the 'greater' cause ahead, only to find ourselves pushed back once things are settled ... We have learned that yes, the time is not right, simply because the time for us to speak out was yesterday .... Our demands are only ours because the 'greater' cause only rarely embraces them ..."
	But, taking a longer view of the prospects for gay rights, I think the Arab Spring is opening up new possibilities. There are basically two strands to achieving LGBT rights (and sexual and gender rights as well ). One is institutional acceptance, which involves changing laws, and the other is social acceptance, which involves changing attitudes. They don't always happen simultaneously.
	What we are seeing with the Arab Spring is the beginning of generalized institutional change, starting with the removal of authoritarian regimes. But that is also being driven by social pressures - frustrations over a lack of personal and political freedom, a lack of economic opportunities, a lack of opportunities for self-fulfillment, and so on. These social pressures began long before the events in Tunisia and they'll continue long after the dictators are gone.
	Looking elsewhere in the world, institutional acceptance of LGBT rights has often been the result of political upheaval. For example, in South Africa when apartheid ended, or in Latin America when the age of the military juntas came to an end.
	I can't visualize anything similar happening with LGBT rights in the Arab countries at present; they are more likely to follow the more gradual route we saw in Britain, among other places.
	What happened in Britain was partly a change in ideas about the function of governments - a realization that policing what consenting adults did in private was not a legitimate concern of the state. This was combined with a recognition that in order for a crime to take place there has to be a victim, and that laws against homosexuality were generally unenforceable.
	On the institutional front, these are the sort of arguments that have some prospect of being accepted in at least some of the Arab countries eventually. In Lebanon, for example, there has been persistent talk of overhauling the penal code to remove those sections that are no longer seen as part of government's legitimate business - including the one that criminalizes "all unnatural intercourse."
	On the social front, I don't see much scope at this stage for a confrontational, in-your-face style of campaigning - mainly because the number of people willing to stick their heads above the parapet is too small.
	In Lebanon, though, the local LGBT organization, called Helem, has been functioning openly for about 10 years now and has played quite a smart game. This has been based on raising the visibility of gay people in a fairly low-key way and presenting them as part of the country's social and political fabric. The first public appearance of a rainbow flag in Lebanon, for example, was during a demonstration in 2003 against the Iraq war.
	The Lebanese activists have also worked hard at cultivating allies among other sections of civil society, constantly making the point that LGBT rights are an integral part of human rights.
	In 2006, when Lebanon was bombed by Israel, Helem's office became the center of a relief operation for people who fled their homes - and this certainly helped to change perceptions of them among the Shia community, and even in Hezbollah.
	When I first started writing about gay issues in the Middle East 10 years ago, it was still very much a taboo subject. I think there is more awareness now, at least among the more progressive elements, that gay Arabs do exist - despite the lack of public role models - and that the challenges posed by sexual nonconformity won't go away.
	These challenges go to the heart of the Arab Spring. They raise questions about the relationship between the state and the individual, and above all about the continuance of patriarchal rule. In a system where masculinity is highly valued and gender roles are rigidly defined, any deviation from the sexual "norms" and expected gender roles is not only subversive, but is regarded as extremely threatening.
	Brian Whitaker is an editor at the Guardian, and author of "Unspeakable Love: Gay and Lesbian Life in the Middle East" (Saqi Books / University of California Press ). This opinion piece is based on a talk he gave last month at a conference on the Arab Spring at SOAS, London.

<title>Supreme Court thrusts Israel down the slope of apartheid </title>
<date>Fri Jan 13 03:38:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
The High Court of Justice's ruling Wednesday on the legality of the Citizenship Law proves the erosion of this institution's role as Israel's guardian of civil rights. Let's look at how the justices voted at the moment of truth on the law, which bans Palestinians from living in Israel with spouses who are Israeli citizens.
In a 2006 ruling, 6 out of 11 justices said the law was unconstitutional, and in the current ruling, 6 out of 11 justices said the law, which was made more strict after the first ruling, was constitutional. That's a disappointing outcome, in part because the first ruling was made not long after the terror attacks of the second intifada, while the current ruling was made during a period of calm, due in part to coordination between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
The title that Justice Asher Grunis gave his opinion - "Human rights are not a prescription for national suicide" - is also disappointing. No one disagrees with this, but Justice Elyakim Rubinstein, who arrived at the same judicial conclusion, recognizes that "a small group - those men and women in Israel's Arab minority who want to marry residents of the region - must pay a heavy price for greater security for all Israelis, including their own."
Justice Grunis apparently would not agree to this wording; as he put it, he's not someone who gives the "constitutional rights that are mentioned in the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty the most expanded and comprehensive interpretation."
Justice Miriam Naor's opinion is disappointing - that the constitutional right to family life means everything, but establishing a family with a foreign spouse in Israel should not receive constitutional protection. It's hard to accept this contradiction, which imposes on other countries a burden that Israel is unwilling to bear and hurts Israeli citizens' right to family life.
The dissenting opinion properly balances the security needs of all citizens and the rights of individuals; the law should be annulled and replaced with security checks of any candidate for residence in Israel when family unification is involved.
The ruling touches on the balance between security needs and individual rights, but the public will understand it as a demographic ruling - one that protects the Jewish majority while harming the rights of Arab citizens. And thus the ruling pushes Israel down the slope of apartheid.

<title>Tel Aviv as a checkpoint</title>
<date>Mon Aug 27 03:16:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	It is only on rare occasions that I agree with an editorial in Haaretz. Especially when the topic is political, and particularly if it deals with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In fact, I think that might never have happened. And for a time, I thought it was impossible.
	And yet, just as we once thought it impossible to run 100 meters in under 10 seconds - until Jim Hines did that very thing - so too did Friday's editorial in Haaretz ("A vision of the End of Days?" ) accomplish the unbelievable.
	Obviously, I do not agree with every word in the editorial. The description of Judea and Samaria as "a giant prison" is completely unfounded and is reminiscent of the kind of propaganda that is cut off from reality. But these are trifles under the circumstances of the matter. Because I identify with both of the central messages of the editorial. In fact, I consider the permission granted to 130,000 Palestinians to visit "little Israel" - to swim in the sea in Tel Aviv and to have picnics on the lawns of the Charles Clore beachfront park - as a most welcome step. I also believe that this should be expanded, and should even become a routine practice - all of this, as Haaretz pointed out, subject to security considerations.
	I also second Haaretz's words of praise regarding the removal of checkpoints and the freedom of movement granted to the Palestinians - with the utmost caution that the war on terror obliges.
	Were Haaretz also to preach, as I do, increased freedom of movement by Jews in Nablus and Hebron and Jericho and all the other parts of the land where they are forbidden to go, then my joy would be complete. Every reasonable person (including Yossi Sarid) already knows there will never be a political border between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, and that there will not be any sovereignty other than Israeli east of the Jordan River. This assumption is reinforced by what I call "the Razi Barkai test." Until a few years ago, the opinionated broadcaster Razi Barkai would declare: "After all, we all know what the solution will eventually be - two states within the 1967 borders, with an exchange of territories." Now, he no longer speaks of this prospect. Even one state - of all its citizens - is impossible.
	For this reason, we have to ensure that the lives of both populations - both the Jews and the Arabs - are as normal as possible under the existing circumstances. The right to live - or, in other words, freedom from terror - is a supreme right. But when it is granted, freedom of movement is one of the basic tenets of human rights. We have to aspire to return to the days when a resident of Kfar Sava could go to a dentist in Qalqilyah, and a resident of Tul Karm could eat at a restaurant in Netanya.
	This process must conclude with the removal of the separation fence, which has wounded the land, defaced it, and caused inconvenience to so many people - Jews as well as Arabs.
	Apart from the security risks - and herein lies the difference between my opinion and that of Haaretz - the obstacle to this welcome process is not "the settlers and other rightists," but, in fact, the residents of Tel Aviv. They won't like it if the Arabs suddenly start to "get in their way."
	Enlightenment is so much more convenient when it is merely theoretical. As someone who grew up in Tel Aviv, I know that my former neighbors would have to exert considerable effort to free themselves of preconceived ideas and also a little racism. I hope they will do so, on behalf of coexistence. From our experience, I can calm them down. We use the same roads every day, buy in the same supermarkets, and this is generally without any problems. People get used to things.
	One of the initiators of the boycott against the cultural center in Ariel, a member of the Cameri Theater, explained her actions by saying her conscience would not allow her to appear in a place reached by "apartheid roads." The truth is that Route 5 and Route 60 lead to Ariel but both are open to all. On the other hand, if a Palestinian wants to see a play at the Cameri Theater, he will be stopped at a roadblock some 30 kilometers before Shaul Hamelech Street. From that point on, and within Tel Aviv, he is not at present allowed. The ball is in your court.
 The writer is the head of the Yesha Council of settlements.

<title>The Amir legacy </title>
<date>Thu Jul 05 01:28:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	The decision to release Yigal Amir from an outrageous 17 years of solitary confinement was courageous and apposite, if several years overdue. It was courageous because it is sure to ignite a firestorm of populist righteous fury. It was apposite because Amir has the same fundamental human rights as any other murderer, and they must be protected. And it was overdue because his solitary confinement was unnecessary and unreasoned from the outset.
	The sole purpose of Amir's harsh conditions of incarceration was to placate public opinion, to satisfy the lust for revenge. But the man who murdered Yitzhak Rabin is not the source of all evil that he is made out to be. Far from it. It is true that all that remains of the Rabin legacy, come what may, is the Amir legacy, but that is not because of Amir himself. Perhaps that's why some Israelis seek to vent their rage against him: They don't like the group portrait they see in the mirror, the product of their own handiwork, and so they put all the blame on Amir. The revenge against Amir is the last relic of the Rabin legacy, and it is the only part that Israelis want to preserve.
	Of course, there is no way of knowing what would have happened had Rabin not been murdered. Only one decisive fact remains: 17 years on, Amir's spirit is much more in evidence than Rabin's, in spite of the innumerable institutions and roads that now bear his name. That is not Amir's fault, it's the fault of all Israelis.
	Israel today should thank Amir for opening the door to everything it wanted to be and to do - for destroying every opportunity for and all belief in peace, for grounding the occupation so firmly that it cannot be reversed, and for creating a racist society and a ruined democracy. Amir only provided the opportunity; the Israelis did the rest, with joy and with dedication.
	This gives the lie to the false, hollow and sanctimonious claims that Amir "murdered the peace" and "killed Israeli democracy." Israeli democracy is much more deeply rent now than it was as a result of Amir's undemocratic assassination. The likelihood of reaching peace, similarly, is much more thoroughly destroyed now than it was by the diabolical wrench that Amir tossed into its gears. Everyone who was shocked by his despicable act is an accomplice, by their actions or their silence, to the passage of racist legislation, to the manhunts on the streets, to the ongoing brutality of the occupation, to the rising violence in society and to the continued building of the settlements.
	It's us, not Amir. Peace has dropped off the agenda entirely, human rights became an obscenity and the yafeh nefesh ("gentle soul" ) a curse. It's us, not Amir. Tens of millions of shekels are spent on alternative housing for settlers who stole land. It's us, not Amir. Kicking a 9-year-old Palestinian boy. It's us, not Amir. A callous apartheid state in the territories. That too is our work, not Amir's.
	But all this is difficult for Israelis to admit, so they seek revenge on Amir, only on Amir, the enemy of the people. In their eyes, the sole and absolute enemy.
	The self-righteous chorus, from the left and the right, is sure to lift up its voice any day now against easing Amir's prison conditions. Many people would even like to see him executed: They are the enemies of democracy, no less than he. They all want only to see Amir's continued mistreatment, to distract us from the real, concrete mistreatment of peace, justice and democracy in Israel, which came after Amir was already locked up in solitary confinement, devoid of all influence.
	Let our camp be pure: See how we punish anyone who dares raise his hand against peace and democracy - decisive proof that we are firmly committed to peace and democracy and it was only the despicable killer who ruined it for us. That is why he must remain in solitary confinement, why he can never go free, in contrast to any other murderer. Because we are fearless warriors against anyone who dares raise his hand against the most just, most peace-loving and most democratic kingdom in the Middle East; in the entire world, actually.

<title>The battle isn't just economic </title>
<date>Wed Aug 08 08:47:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	It was sad to be in the plaza opposite the Tel Aviv Museum of Art last Saturday night. Very sad - but not unexpected. Even at the height of the impressive wave of protests last summer, I wrote in these pages that demonstrations which don't quickly find a political base and a determined leadership are destined to evaporate. The greatest enemy of an informal movement like this one is the passage of time.
	Protests can achieve results only when they present an alternative that poses a genuine threat to the establishment. Ostensibly, there were a few days like that last summer, but they didn't last: The threat was eliminated then and there.
	Today, however, the protest doesn't even constitute a nuisance, because it's become clear that its activists aren't capable of leading a movement. One of the most prominent, by virtue of his position as chairman of the National Student Union, Itzik Shmuli, is developing into a run-of-the-mill politician in search of a path to the Knesset. And the others, who include some true idealists, have fallen victim to both their own naivete and the manipulations of the government.
	But they can also blame themselves, because a war over bread and butter for the middle class is certainly a worthwhile goal, but not for people in their twenties. That could be left to Histadrut chairman Ofer Eini.
	From them, we would have expected a great outcry, both against the oppression built into the very bones of Israel's capitalist system and in favor of an uprising against the formal establishment of an apartheid state, which the justice minister is working on at this very moment on the government's behalf. What should one think of young people who don't utter a peep in the face of the daily oppression in the territories, and also aren't frightened by the erosion of basic democratic values in the Israel Broadcasting Authority and the education system?
	Indeed, anyone who has pretensions to change anything in the Israeli reality is required to deal simultaneously with the fact that its neoliberal economy, by its very nature, rejects the principles of equality and solidarity, and with the apartheid that is rapidly gaining legitimacy among the public. Thus, in order to create a welfare state here in the Western European style, we need a different national leadership. And for that, we need an uncompromising battle to replace Netanyahu's government.
	Nevertheless, Israel's fate won't be determined by the level of value-added tax, or by the Iranian bomb that may or may not ever materialize, but by the future of the territories. On this, there is no room for doubt. Distortions in the tax system can be fixed, and Iran can be neutralized. But what can't be fixed, and is gradually bringing us to the point of no return, is the occupation.
	Yet lo and behold, this existential question has miraculously vanished from the agenda, thanks to a tacit agreement between the right, which controls the government, and the Labor Party. Thus, the danger of the liquidation of the democratic Jewish state has ceased to be a bone of contention.
	This development is without precedent in the history of democratic politics: It's doubtful that there has ever before been a democratic state where an incomparably controversial issue on which its very existence depends has been silenced and buried by agreement between the government and the opposition. There have, however, been countries in which the cowardice of the opposition has exacted an unbearable price.
	The next question, then, is what can be done? The active core of the protest still has an important role to play - not to act on its own, but to serve as a bridge between all the forces of opposition to the leadership, one that will smash the agreement between Likud and Labor. This is the way to a welfare state that aspires to equality and justice for all - for Israelis, Palestinians and work migrants alike. This is also the way to realize a two-state solution that will do justice to both peoples and save Israel from destruction.

<title>The dream has vanished, with the left's help </title>
<date>Fri Oct 26 03:08:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	The cloak that the right wing has donned in anticipation of the upcoming election bears the proud label with the brilliant and innovative "ruling" by Justice Edmond Levy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu without a doubt knows that Levy's learned conclusions will be treated in the rest of the world just like those rulings once handed down by village courts concerning evolution and the origin of man. He is also aware of the fact that if the government formally adopts the practical conclusions that stem from Levy's "ruling," Israel will be perceived as a country struck by fanaticism that deserves condemnation on every possible public stage.
	However, according to the concepts of the right wing, annexation is legitimate not only because it is legal and in accordance with the wish of the creator, but also because it rests on the desire of the people. That is the modern side of nationalist fanaticism that grants ultimate justification to the occupation. On the one hand, in the present Knesset, which represents the sovereignty of the people, there is a clear majority in favor of annexation. On the other hand, the survey published on the front page of Haaretz earlier this week confirms what is already clear from our daily experience - that a majority of Israelis are not deterred by apartheid.
	In the wake of a continuous ideological effort of an entire generation, the right wing has ultimately succeeded in endowing society with its values: If it were to annex the territories, it would not annex the human beings living there. The Arabs would remain with the status of a population that is no longer occupied because the territories - according to what Levy stated - are not occupied territories, and they will merely be the dust of humanity, without identity or rights.
	Levy and those who appointed him have apparently never heard of human rights, because after all these are the rights that people invented and they are universal and applicable to all people in all parts of the world. The only rights the various segments of the right wing have heard of are historical rights that are relative and dependent on time, place and culture. The historic rights of the Jews, who own the Promised Land, erase the Palestinians' right to be masters of their own lives.
	It is reasonable to assume that the upcoming election will give final approval to the will of the Israeli citizen. The Jew - who himself was an oppressed refugee, or whose parents were, an object of hostility, hatred and extermination - has become a tyrant who is permitted to do whatever he wants.
	This has happened because the left wing was not ideologically equipped to withstand the violent demands for sole ownership of the land. In the left, as well, too many people followed in the footsteps of those founding fathers of the Labor movement who shared that concept. Therefore, in all the years that have elapsed since 1967, the right also had sympathetic listeners among those on the left.
	Many of those who noticed the dimensions of the disaster that was taking place kept quiet or were silenced, lest they be branded "enemies of the people." The right wing stuck to its principles and sharpened its positions while the left wing, out of fear of being "cut off from the nation," helped them, the people, to bang their heads against a brick wall. And now, faithful to this path, Labor Party leader Shelly Yacimovich too is snuggling up to Likud and, if the latest reports are correct, she is becoming a collaborator with Likud in all that is connected with the territories.
	As a result of that conduct - which the second government under Yitzhak Rabin interrupted, but only for a short while - the positions of the right have become accepted among wide swaths of the center-left. Today they are considered as being identical to the national interest, or in common parlance, the "state." In this manner, the nationalistic and messianic settlement ideology has spread like an oil spill, until it reached the point that we are currently at: The dream of a liberal and open society has vanished and the rug is fast being pulled from under the feet of sane Zionism.
	The only question now is whether we have already reached the point of no return, or whether there still remains one minute before midnight.

<title>The dwarfs of Oslo</title>
<date>Mon Sep 10 05:03:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	In 1993, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to two African leaders: Nelson Mandela and Frederik Willem de Klerk. The award went to them for bringing to an end the apartheid regime in South Africa by peaceful means. These two leaders were certainly deserving of the prestigious prize. A year later, in 1994, apparently because of the inertia in the committee in charge of the “peace” department, the prize was awarded to three leaders from the Middle East: Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat, on account of the accords between them, named after the Norwegian capital of Oslo.
	The fundamentalist right in Israel has coined the phrase “the criminals of Oslo” and attached that name to the Israeli leaders who supposedly tried to promote an Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Benjamin Netanyahu, the orator, was also there when the campaign of incitement against the “Oslo criminals” was taking place. I was reminded of those “criminals” this week because I happened to have been at the Grand Hotel in the heart of Oslo, and I learned that the Nobel Peace Prize laureates stay there when they come for the award ceremony.
	It is worth recalling that the Oslo Accords that were signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Israeli government were not the result of a true and earnest desire on the part of the leaders for peace. The two leaderships of the two conflicted nations sought, each in its own way, a means of escape from the imbroglio in which they found themselves following several decades of mutual lack of recognition. The Oslo Accords were merely a trick, a deception. The Israeli government was looking for a way to continue the occupation, and thought that calming down the area, which had flared up during the first intifada, would help. The Palestinian leadership was seeking a way to regain legitimacy after the political defeat it suffered when Arafat embraced Iraq’s Saddam Hussein.
	Netanyahu, who took every opportunity to publicly speak out against the “Oslo criminals,” has become prime minister for the second time. As a student of Yitzhak Shamir, Netanyahu continues to earn his living from doing nothing. A short while ago, he even repeated the mantra of his teacher and guru about “the same sea and the same Arabs.” But it turns out the situation is actually the opposite of the one he spoke about: The sea is the same sea, the Israeli government is the same government, and what was then is what is now.
	Nobel laureate Shimon Peres, who was responsible for preparing the ground for the settlements in the 1970s, is now, many years later, continuing to hand out kashrut certificates for all the evils of the Israeli right. From time to time, he serves as the glowing showcase for the Israeli government, with its plethora of members that at no time ever intended to promote any kind of peace process.
	The Oslo saga has not ended. A few years ago, when Barack Obama was elected president of the United States, before he had done anything whatsoever toward the objective of the prize, the members of the committee hastened to grant him the Nobel Peace Prize. Among the reasons cited for the honor was the objective of strengthening the cooperation between the nations. But now, four years later and in retrospect, the prize that was awarded to Obama can also be seen as ridiculous.
	If the committee continues in this fashion, if there are more peace prize laureates of this kind, we shall be lost. Compared with Mandela, the prize winners from the Middle East look like dwarfs. That being the case, the time has come to speak about the real Oslo criminals. These are in fact the members of the selection committee for the prize, who make a mockery of the dream of peace and trample uncaringly on the principles of the prize when they award it to those people that have not done a thing to earn it.

<title>The future looks bleak for Middle East Christians</title>
<date>Thu Mar 22 09:20:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
 	Wearing a frown that creased his unreasonably handsome features, Georg Clooney was handcuffed by police outside the gates of the Sudanese Embassy in Washington, DC last Friday, during a protest against a renewed military offensive by the Khartoum regime in the border areas of newly independent South Sudan. The Hollywood actor was shepherded to a waiting patrol car along with a troupe of civil rights leaders, including several Jewish representatives, who were also detained.
	The spectacle was a timely reminder that the coalition which crystallized around the genocide in Sudan's Darfur region -- in which Jewish communal organizations were heavily involved, together with assorted celebrities and civil rights groups -- has endured. South Sudan is the site of a bloody and seemingly endless conflict that has already claimed upwards of two million lives. The country now faces a new round of murder and mass displacement at the hands of its northern neighbor.
	How should these latest horrors be contextualized? In a recent interview, Clooney discussed his visit to the Nuba Mountains, the inhospitable terrain that lies at the heart of the current conflict. "Religion is not an issue," he said, when asked about the causes of the war. "In the camps you will find Christians and Muslims hiding together. It is ethnic in nature."
	Given the increasingly sharp debate about Islam here in America, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the liberal Clooney is keen to avoid talk of a religious war. Nonetheless, the Islamist character of the regime in Khartoum can hardly be deemed incidental to the conflict.
	In common with other Arab countries, Arab chauvinism in Sudan is combined with a domineering, supremacist version of Islam. The religious aspect was dramatically underlined at the beginning of March, when Sudan announced that it had stripped around 700,000 of its citizens of their nationality, the vast majority Christian. They have just over two weeks from today to leave Sudan. Those who depart for the south will walk straight into an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe. Those who remain in the north face the prospect of imprisonment or forced deportation.
	To this depressing tale of ethno-religious cleansing, we can add the problem of slavery. The government of South Sudan says that there are 30,000 slaves being held in the north, the clear majority of whom, again, are Christians. As far as the north is concerned, there is no slavery in Sudan, a line about as credible as the Tehran regime's insistence that there are no homosexuals in Iran.
	Instances of Christian persecution can be found in nearly every Muslim country. The death sentence imposed on Youcef Nadarkhani, an Iranian pastor who committed the mortal sin of converting to Christianity from Islam, has highlighted the tenuous situation faced by Iranian adherents of the faith. In Nigeria, Christian churches are bombed with mounting frequency by the Islamist terrorists of Boko Haram, whose name translates as "western education is a sin." In Egypt, the Coptic minority faces violence and discrimination that will likely get worse, given the strong showing by the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafist parties in the recent elections. In Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia - you name it - reports of Christians being falsely charged with blasphemy or apostasy, along with gruesome tales of beheadings and beatings, are multiplying by the day.
	Though not every Christian community in the Middle East lives with the scale of terror currently spreading through Sudan, it is legitimate to ask whether Sudan provides a terrifying glimpse of the future for Christians in the wider region. In that sense, it's worth paying to heed to the statement delivered on March 12 by Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, who declared that it is "necessary to destroy all the churches of the region."
	In the event that their churches are destroyed, the Christians who worship in them will surely follow. It must also be acknowledged that Christians are repressed both by the allies of the west, like Saudi Arabia, and by its adversaries, like Iran and Sudan.
	Jews and Christians in America already have an encouraging record of joint campaigning, especially when it comes to Israel advocacy. Both communities now have a duty to raise the banner of Christian persecution, an issue with similar mobilizing potential to the campaign against apartheid in South Africa, or freedom for Soviet Jews. They need to do so with urgency and clarity. We may not have reached a final, genocidal phase yet, but we are headed in that direction.

<title>The people demand some blood </title>
<date>Mon Mar 12 04:50:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Whoever decided to kill the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees didn't do so to prevent a terror attack. The attack was foiled, thanks to the targeted killing, because the army lies only during its internal power struggles; and when its comes to anything related to war, it returns to the motherly embrace of public opinion: Its intentions are pure. That's its job during war, which only it can declare - and in wartime, after all, we fall in love with the army and with ourselves.
	But the excuse of the terror attack is another indication that there is no opposition - neither at home and nor to the west. There is no one from whom we should hide the fact that every "targeted killing" brings rockets, and only thereafter comes "wiping out terrorism." The thuggish stance of the army in relation to the rules of the game - we assassinate, you launch rockets, and we bomb and kill - is Israeli logic: We're allowed to because we're strong. There's no need for a moral masquerade.
	This was the escalation dynamic that was covered up during the second intifada with the help of every media outlet, without exception. Then, after every targeted killing, we were flooded with huge pictures of the target, and "suddenly," at Google speed, we were introduced to all kinds of enemies who only the Shin Bet security service had known about just the day before - from Hussein Abayat, the first assassination target in Bethlehem, through the elimination of Raad Carmi in Tul Karm, whose killing so inflamed Palestinian passions that they responded with a wild massacre at the Park Hotel, until the recapture of the West Bank in Operation Defensive Shield.
	This - the elimination of terror, and the elimination of Palestinian independence en route - was the initiative of the General Staff. The escalation enabled the destruction of all the political structures in the territories (since of course they were always surrounded by paramilitary organizations ), until we achieved the ultimate: Gaza in the hands of they with whom we cannot conduct negotiations, and the West Bank in the hands of they with whom we don't have to conduct negotiations. The occupation assures its own eternal existence.
	This hooligan-like logic turns into part of a totally uninhibited language. We are allowed to assassinate, but you aren't allowed to respond: For the little, if any, of our blood spilled, you will pay with many liters of blood. This is a colonial logic, in which the West has permission to do what it pleases, while the natives do not. This, incidentally, is the logic in the campaign against Iran: You don't have permission to acquire nuclear facilities, only we do.
	With regard to the Palestinians, the issue also touches on our behavior and the fact that we are an impoverished society. "You can starve, while we battle for our standard of living. We are a democracy for the Jews. You aren't really human beings."
	Why then are we surprised that the leader of "The People Demand Social Justice," Daphni Leef, is flying to England to deny that Israel is an apartheid state? Why are we surprised that the mayors of our southern cities are demanding more blood instead of social justice? Soon the policeman in the F-16 will be declared the big winner. The palace will burn some more hut-dwellers.
	It's clear why Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a by-product of the colonization - and not its cause - and the result of logic that goes, "We're allowed, because we are who we are, and you are forbidden because you're inferior." Who can demand social justice from such logic?
	The bombing of the Gaza Strip in response to the Grads and mortars that came in response to the assassination is an episode with many Palestinian funerals and the addictive feeling of subservience. But whoever decided on the assassination knew he was cancelling the south's topping off a long Purim. Those in the south had apparently celebrated enough. What exactly they would go through after the assassination didn't really interest anyone.
	This "I don't care what happens to them" attitude doesn't stop at the Green Line nor at the Mizrahi Jews' enclaves in the south. This is the kind of firmness that will be needed to bomb Iran. It's called rulers' apathy, or a society that has no opposition.

<title>The real radical left </title>
<date>Thu Apr 05 03:15:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Even a dead body can sometimes twitch reflexively. Here we go again: The settlers have occupied another building. Their lawyer isn't ashamed to boast about the deceptive way the property was acquired. The ministers make their pilgrimages. The defense minister pulls a surprise eviction. The right is furious, the remnants of the left utter praise, and even Europe and America seem satisfied - look, another settler real estate grab has been thwarted.
	If it hadn't involved the private property of an unfortunate Palestinian family it would have been one more laughable farce. If we weren't talking about a hopeless rearguard battle there would be a reason for outrage.
	But there's no point in outrage now. Migron, Hebron, whatever - the war is over. The victor was declared long ago, the vanquished was defeated long ago, notwithstanding yesterday's evacuation in Hebron. All that's left is the reflexive twitching of the corpse: the targeted removal - a drop in the bucket - and a last gasp from the moribund left.
	The part of Hebron under Israeli control, H2 under the 1997 Hebron Protocol, has for years been a ghost town, with hundreds of abandoned apartments and dozens of shuttered stores; a mute testament to the purest and most undeniable form of apartheid. But the "protest" continues: Another house on the wild prairie was saved.
	But we could have given the settlers that house; it wouldn't have changed anything. Let them have Migron, that won't make or break anything either. Even the 50 homes in Beit El's Ulpana neighborhood won't change the bigger picture. The occupation is more entrenched than ever, its end more remote than ever, and the settlers have won in a stinging knockout.
	It's time to raise the white flag, to admit publicly that the two-state solution has been foiled. There's no point in celebrating yesterday's evacuation of Hamachpela House, because there are thousands of other buildings just like it. It doesn't even pay to fight for the rule of law; if the state has the audacity to try to circumvent a ruling of the High Court of Justice, as it tried to with Migron, even that looks like a lost cause.
	If the apartheid neighborhood in Hebron could not stir Israelis from their moral fog - and any decent person who visits there is shocked to the depths of their being - and if life goes on undisturbed, with no moral questions, even as this horror occurs in our own backyard, then what difference does another stolen house make? Let it go, let other houses go; the chance for a solution is long past.
	Even the twitching of the dead are moving. The determination of organizations such as B'Tselem, Breaking the Silence and Gush Shalom not to surrender should evoke admiration here and abroad. But it's hard to revel in them when they are fighting a final battle.
	Hamachpela House was evacuated. But like its predecessor in Hebron - known variously as "Peace House," "The Brown House or "Beit Hameriva" ("The House of Contention" ), which has stood empty for more than three years, and hundreds of abandoned homes whose sole occupants are the ghosts of justice and of Israeli democracy - its owners will presumably never be able to return to live there.
	The battle for Hebron has been decided. All that remains is to ask what will replace the solution that was put to death. There will not be two states. Even a child knows the alternative: one state. There is no third option. Israel's most radical left won. For years it said one state, even as we played with ourselves at two states. Now everyone says two states, in unison, only because they know that train has left the station, and the great train robbery was pulled off.
	From now we need only take care with our definitions: The extreme left is whoever endeavors toward a single state - the plundering settlers, the establishment that embraces them and the majority of Israelis, who do not lift a finger to stop them.
	The Palestinians, as everyone knows by now, aren't going anywhere. There is even a handful of settlers that has begun talking about giving them citizenship. If this, too, is not a ruse, then this little group is openly reconciling with the great victory of Israel's most extreme left.
	The struggle? From now on it must focus on human rights. Yes, equal rights for everyone who lives in Greater Israel, just as you wanted.

<title>The rifle blow to the head that reminded Israelis of the West Bank</title>
<date>Fri Apr 20 01:54:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	The truly interesting aspect of the story in which a senior IDF officer brutally smashed his rifle into the face of a pro-Palestinian demonstrator is the extraordinary buzz it has caused in Israel. This has been a classic case of the exception proving the rule. It is difficult to remember the last time a story from the occupation grabbed the headlines so dramatically and remained there so many days.
	The doubters now clucking their tongues are correct: The scandal is being treated as a housekeeping matter. Attention is focused tediously on the image of the Israel Defense Forces and on one specific event that was photographed by chance, instead of focusing on the bigger picture.
	Yet there is also a welcome aspect to all this fuss over the brutal attack. With one blow, Lt. Col. Shalom Eisner drove a hole into the wall.
	When the separation fence was built, it was depicted as a physical barrier that would prevent terrorists from entering areas within the Green Line. It was described as a vital security necessity. Civilian life in Israel had become impossible as terrorists blew themselves up in population centers.
	But hidden from the eye at the time of the fence's construction was the tremendous negative effect it would have on Israeli consciousness. Since then it has become clear that the separation wall also makes it possible to be blind, to repress awareness and become indifferent.
	It is very good that Israeli citizens have stopped dying in terrorist attacks because of the wall. It is very bad that the wall also makes it possible to ignore reality over there on the dark side.
	In the judgment of history, when the total price is calculated, it is not clear in which direction the balance will tilt. For most Israelis, the great strategic question has turned into an empty debate, exhausting and almost academic. The issue no longer lies "five minutes from Kfar Sava" but light years from it.
	The urgent affairs of the day require slogans. There is the "occupation" and the "territories" and "Palestinians" and "settlers" and "left-wing activists" and all of these exist under the blessed jurisdiction of the IDF, far from our eyes and hearts. The Israeli mainstream is cut off from the occupation and loves it. Only in the Israel pacified by the separation fence is it possible to imagine that the head of the Labor Party, a declared candidate for the prime ministership, refuses religiously to utter a word about the country's political future.
	It is only in that walled-off Israel that idealistic social activists like Daphni Leef and Stav Shaffir, as good as their intentions may have been, can get hundreds of thousands to march in the streets demanding social justice and changes in priorities without even hinting at the occupation and its moral, economic and diplomatic costs.
	The wall blinds the Israelis and sometimes even stupefies them. Time and again they boast of being the chosen ones of "the only democracy in the Middle East" without understanding that this claim, too, has been blocked by the separation barrier.
	There is no democracy east of the wall. There is the rule of a military occupier, an apartheid-like mechanism of discrimination, and more than two million Palestinians who are denied basic civil rights. The damage caused by the wall is enormous. It was meant to serve as the basis for Israel's permanent eastern border, but because of it, Israelis are no longer in a hurry to draw permanent borders and to return to the family of nations. The diplomatic talks this week between representatives of the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority amounted to an exchange of letters.
	At the time of the wall's construction, the slogan of its supporters was, "They over there, we over here, and peace upon Israel." Thanks to the wall, the people of Israel can forget about the unnecessary peace. It is only on rare occasions that some officer like Eisner bursts forth and with one blow reminds us that under all this contentment lurks a deep despair.

<title>The storm over Bamba and apathy concerning Gaza</title>
<date>Thu Mar 15 04:47:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	For four consecutive days and nights, millions of citizens of this country once again lived under conditions of fear and terror. The innovation was that, this time, no one tried to whitewash things. The mass terror was to be expected and it stemmed directly from an Israeli act of violence. Nevertheless, no one thought of expressing opposition. Better not to even ask whether indeed a terror attack had been foiled; whether the secretary general of the Popular Resistance Committees was one of those rare people in human history for whom there is no replacement; or whether indeed his assassination was beneficial or legal.
	The assassination and the revenge were seen here as a divine edict, as a force majeure, as a storm in the southern skies - a quick strike that would blow away with the wind. The south was scared, the north turned a blind eye, and all together were amazed at the way Iron Dome successfully intercepted the missiles. And at times like these, there is no opposition in Israel.
 What are your thoughts on this issue? Follow Haaretz.com on Facebook and share your views.
	Not just at times like these. It is possible to imagine a situation in which Israel would have continued with another ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. And would anyone have raised his voice against that? Of course not. Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee's chairman Shaul Mofaz would be in favor of course, and so apparently would opposition leader Tzipi Livni (whose voice was once again not heard this week ); Labor Party leader Shelly Yachimovich is busy to the hilt with the tycoons; Knesset hopeful Yair Lapid would have made do with another ideological "okay, bye!"; the summer protest movement leader Daphni Leef is traveling across the seas to explain that Israel is not an apartheid nation; on the Facebook page of Meretz leader Zahava Gal-On there is no mention of what happened in the south; and the Arab members of the Knesset are isolated as usual from the public discourse.
	And as if that was not enough - it seems to everyone that this is a normal situation. That's how things are and there is nothing we can do about it. A difficult reality in the south following an act of choice by Israel and no one even considers asking questions, casting doubts, offering alternatives. Hamas held its fire? Rubbish. It announced it had renounced violence? Nonsense. Once again Egypt turned out to be the only party that could bring back quiet despite its Muslim Brothers? So what? Speak with Hamas? What, have we lost our minds? Only a stand-up artist in the south raised that brilliant idea on television: To continue with assassinations in Gaza "until the inventory is completed." That's an idea and that's an idea. Laughter. An Israeli democracy that lacks an opposition, free of any alternative ideas for government - a global innovation.
	But just a minute, there are storms here nevertheless. For two days a storm has been raging here over [the children's snack] Bamba, a storm which was almost wilder than the storm in the south. Had it not been for the summer social protest, the baby icon of the Bamba snack would have turned into the official mascot of Israel's Olympic team. Only decent public intervention prevented the disgrace.
	The Internet was flooded with reactions, the minister of sports and culture threatened to intervene, the chairman of the Knesset's Education Committee called for an emergency meeting, columnists joined in the struggle, and the cute little Bamba baby will not march at the London Olympics. Psychosis and neurosis. Two days of newspaper headlines. All of a sudden, everyone is interested in sports and concerned about the moral standards of the Olympic team, and they have reservations about using a commercial symbol. Suddenly there is a protest, there is an opposition and there is a popular uprising. Even if this protest is justified in principle and there really is no place for commercial sponsorship of a national mascot, what about the proportions? Where is the proportionality? This exaggeration was intended for one purpose only - to cover the shame of apathy and to give ourselves the superficial appearance of involvement.
	That is the other side of the apolitical nature of the summer protest movement - the connection between a vacuous patriot and a hollow protester. Because that's how things are in an involved democracy, that's how things are when there is an alert civil society - you keep things clean and throw the Bamba in the garbage bin. However on the other side of the colorful bag of snacks lurks a destructive apathy.
	All the futile storms of the past months - Bamba, Big Brother, Pesek-Zman, Hatikva, and even the scandal of cancelling free train rides for soldiers for three consecutive hours per week - cannot hide the disgrace: In the land of Bamba, in Bamba Land, people come to life only the marginal and the meaningless. Let it be known: there is a direct link between the storm over Bamba and the apathy concerning Gaza. Both are driven by blind and cheap patriotism. And which mascot will march in our name at the Olympic stadium in London? That affects us much more deeply than what is done in our name in Gaza.

<title>U.S. elections: Palestine can't wait</title>
<date>Mon Nov 05 14:01:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Palestine has not been part of any major discussion during the presidential election debates. That is surprising and dismaying, given the United States' role as a crucial player in the region and its unconditional financial and political support of Israel. Yet, the candidates appear to have actively avoided the issue.
	This tactic has also been adopted by Israeli politicians. Though they remain the leaders of a state that actively practices and encourages the colonial domination of another nation, Israeli politicians, from different parts of the political map, have decided to focus their attention mainly on issues such as domestic social policy and the encouragement of a new war in this region. Almost nothing has been said about the millions of people living under full Israeli control and the impossibility of peace while the occupation persists.
	However, ignoring this vital issue does not mean that Palestine and its sacred right to freedom can be bypassed. In fact, the common future of Israelis and Palestinians, as well as the rest of the region, depends on achieving peace and security for both Palestine and Israel. This is not a task that should be marginalized.
	This harmful state of denial comes at a time when the possibility of realizing the two-state solution is rapidly diminishing due to Israel’s policies of colonization. Such policies have been denounced by Israel’s long-standing allies, such as Germany and France. But it seems these calls for peace have been muffled by election campaigning in Washington.
	Successive American administrations have affirmed that the two-state solution based on the 1967 border is an American interest in the region. President Obama has also repeatedly stated his commitment to this issue. But in Israel, the current Prime Minister has unfortunately ensured that American efforts to resume meaningful negotiations between Israel and Palestine have failed, by taking actions on the ground, namely the unprecedented acceleration of Israel’s illegal settlement enterprise, that negate the spirit and purpose of those negotiations. The recently published Levy Report presents another clear example of this government's systematic efforts to derail all international efforts, as Israel threatens to effectively turn the occupation into full-fledged annexation.
	But as Israeli actions are fading out the prospects of peace, the geopolitical map of the region is also changing rapidly, opening horizons of freedom and activism that were previously blocked. The Arab Spring has set a new context for the Middle East.
	All world leaders who supported the Arab Spring, including the newly-elected American president, will have to explain to the Arab street why their support for freedom stops at Palestine's doorstep. Serious effort will be needed to explain why  the world continues to insist on trying, again, formulas that have failed time again, including the demand for resumption of negotiations without any guarantees or clear terms of reference while guaranteeing Israel immunity from any accountability for ignoring previous agreements and its internationally recognized obligations.
	We realize that the ties between Washington and Tel Aviv are solid. But it's important to remember that a friend has a responsibility to provide honest and even sobering advice to a friend who is committing a grave mistake. Entrenching the occupation and denying the Palestinian people their inalienable national rights to freedom and independence will not bring peace to Israel. On the contrary, it will guarantee perpetual conflict. 
	The next American president might very well be the last president of the “two-state solution” era. That is an historic responsibility whose far-reaching consequences cannot be understated.
	In this context, the new American administration will have an opportunity to have, as one of its first actions, a real and effective push for peace by supporting Palestine's diplomatic initiative to achieve enhanced status at the United Nations, advance our national rights and save the two-state solution. This step will enhance the political process and bolster the chances of initiating a credible and effective political effort that would conclude with the realization of the two-state solution.
	We have chosen negotiations as a means to reaching peace. Our commitment to this path is firm. Our political initiative at the United Nations is a sincere effort for the sake of peace that should enjoy the active support of all those brave enough to be true peace partners in Israel as well as Israel's friends who are committed to seeing it enjoy a future of peace.
	Efforts to prevent the Palestinian people from exercising its inalienable and sovereign right to self-determination are contradictory to stated American positions regarding the struggle for freedom and democracy embodied by the Arab Spring. Undermining the mechanisms of the international system and obstructing the will of the majority of the international community is not only counterproductive but also undemocratic. This does not help Israel, as it only strengthens those within Israel who support an apartheid regime and the systematic denial of the rights of the Palestinian people.
	Palestine is looking forward to working with the next American administration to achieve peace through freedom and justice, and in so doing, securing a future of democracy, security and prosperity for the whole region. That is why it is vitally important for the U.S. to have the political will to show that Palestine is not an exception to the international rule and that it also deserves to exercise its internationally-recognized inalienable rights. Let us work together towards this noble goal, because ignoring it will only drag the entire region further away from the peace we seek. 
	After almost a century of denied national rights and five decades of oppression, it is time for Palestine to enjoy the blanket international support it deserves for justice long overdue.

<title>Water torture </title>
<date>Sun Jul 08 01:22:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Avi is an inspection coordinator for the "Civil Administration" - the occupation regime, to speak without euphemisms. Presumably Avi likes his job. Maybe he's even proud of it.
	He doesn't bother mentioning his last name in the forms he signs. Why should he? His ornate "Avi" signature is sufficient to carry out his diktats. And Avi's are among the most brutal and inhumane diktats ever to be imposed in these parts.
	Avi confiscates water containers that serve hundreds of Palestinian and Bedouin families living in the Jordan Valley.
	The containers are these people's only water source. In recent weeks, Avi has confiscated about a dozen containers, leaving dozens of families with children in the horrific Jordan Valley heat, to go thirsty.
	The forms he takes pains to complete, in spiffy style, say: "There is reason to suspect they used the above merchandise for carrying out an offense." Avi's bosses claim the "offense" is stealing water from a pipe. This is why the containers are seized - with no inquiry, no trial. Welcome to the land of lawlessness and evil. Welcome to the land of apartheid. Israel does not permit thousands of these wretched people to hook up to the water pipes. This water is for Jews only. Even the greatest Israeli propagandists could not deny the nationalist, diabolical separation taking place here.
	The axis of evil is located about an hour's drive from your home. But emotionally distant and far from the heart, it inspires no "social protest." And on the scale of Israeli evil, it is one of the worst. Backed with forms and bureaucracy, applied by ostensibly nonviolent inspectors, it involves not a drop of blood, yet leaves no drop of water either.
	The Civil Administration is supposed to take care of the people's needs. But it does not stop at the most despicable measure - depriving people and livestock of water in the scathing summer heat - to implement Israel's strategic goal: to drive them from their lands and purge the valley of its non-Jewish residents.
	The stealing of water, whether it did or didn't take place, is of course only the excuse. Even if there was such a thing - what choice do these people have? The authorities won't allow them to connect to the water pipe running through their fields; pipes whose water is flowing to saturate the settlers' green vineyards and fields.
	Last week I saw the people whose water container Avi had confiscated, leaving them thirsty. Newborn babies, a handicapped little girl, a small boy post-surgery, women and old folks, and, of course, the sheep - the only source of income here. Denizens with no water - in Israel, not in Africa. Water for one nation only - in Israel, not in South Africa.
	But this is not the only watershed. A few days ago, the Israel Defense Forces decided to hold training exercises in the area. What did it do? Evicted the residents from their homes for 24 hours. Not all of them - only the Palestinians and Bedouin. It occurred to nobody to evict the residents of Maskiot, Beka'ot or Ro'i. The authorities don't call that apartheid, either.
	Where did the IDF evict them to? Wherever the wind carries them. Thus some 400 people were forced to leave their huts and tents and spend a day and a night on the arid soil by the roadside, exposed to the elements.
	Amjad Zahawa, a 2-day-old infant, passed his third day under the hot sun, with no shelter over his head. Greetings, Amjad; welcome to the reality of your life.
	Avi, as we have already mentioned, loves his work and is proud of it. Dozens of others like him are also doing this contemptible work. But they are not the only ones at fault. Behind them stand millions of Israelis who are entirely untouched by all this. They blithely drive through the valley roads, paying no heed to the endless embankment alongside the road, imprisoning the residents and blocking their access to the road.
	There is an iron gate every now and then. The soldiers, representatives of the merciful occupier, show up every few days to open the gate for a moment. Sometimes they forget, sometimes they are late. Sometimes they lose the key, but what does it matter?
	The occupation is enlightened, Israel is right, the IDF is the most moral army, and apartheid is merely an invention of Israel's haters. Go to the Jordan Valley and see for yourselves.

<title>World nations should issue a travel warning to Israel</title>

	The skilled attack by Lt. Col. Shalom Eisner on a blond Danish peace activist in a kaffiyeh was spectacular. The senior officer's two agitated arms grasped the M-16 rifle as if it was an indivisible part of his body, and with an instinctive movement that might be expected from someone whose life was being threatened, landed it in the face of the person who dared to look him in the eye.
	What luck that the belligerent Viking toppled over, thereby signaling his defeat. A recognized sign in the jungle. The frightened officer let him be. What a shame! Had he continued his assault, this could have been an excellent kill scene for a new series in National Geographic. Perhaps under the title "Annihilation."
	On the face of it, this is a political story in which a group of pro-Palestinian peace activists tries to convince an occupying power to behave in decent fashion toward those occupied. But there is nothing political here. When a country behaves as if it is a nature preserve where the species living in it feel they are in danger of extinction, it is a simple anthropological story.
	Anyone who wants to visit a gorilla preserve in Uganda, for example, knows what the restrictions are. The visitor must provide a certificate showing that he is not sick, and curious tourists are permitted only to visit in small groups and must leave the preserve in less than 24 hours. Tourists who go to the nature preserves in Tanzania know that it is forbidden to leave their vehicles, to throw food in the direction of the animals or get close to them. Anyone who kills a white polar bear in the snow fields will be brought to trial. There are clear, internationally recognized rules that define which species are threatened and how to preserve them.
	Israel is a dangerous preserve and responsible nations should have issued a travel warning for this country long ago, or at least published a detailed guide of what is permitted or forbidden to do here. Which words or sentences induce a warning growl. A kind of dictionary for tourists in which terms such as "fly-in," "flotilla," "Palestinian state," "illegal outposts," "apartheid," "racism," "High Court of Justice," and of course, "occupation" will be underlined in bold red.
	The guidebook would explain what is likely to cause Israel to bite and which sites the tourist is advised to avoid; where it is permitted for males and females to stay together and where mixed groups may attract stone-throwing; what response a red kaffiyeh around the neck is likely to evince; and what dangers someone wearing red, black and green clothes could face.
	This is not an extraordinary recommendation. Someone who wants to visit Somalia, Afghanistan, Algeria, Chechnya or Sudan, or merely to go on a safari, knows what he has to wear and what he cannot say.
	A threatened preserve like Israel is not meant for everyone at all times. When it was still a small country defined by a Green Line, it invited the whole world to come and visit. But when it grew fat and expanded its living space, it became more threatened and more frightened, and it has designated in lists drawn up in advance who is forbidden to enter its territory. The lists include not only wanted men who plan to carry out terror attacks, but also activists in human rights organizations, at least one German author and politicians who are not prepared to sing in the choir. The lists also include recommendations about who should not waste their money on airplane tickets - for example, a tourist whose name implies Arab or Muslim origin. It is possible that soon, new and much shorter lists will be issued bearing the names only of those who are permitted to visit the preserve.
	This is how Israel is turning itself into an enclave of nationalist fundamentalism in which the covenant between its citizens (the Jewish ones, of course ) is not based on equality or shared values but on the ceaseless marking of its borders with the outside world. This is an enclave which does not feed on a sense of victimization - though that is certainly a national value - but rather on a threat, the impact of which is understood only by denizens of the enclave.
	Therefore it is not the one who threatens but rather the one who doubts the existence of the threat who is the real danger. It is not the Palestinians who threaten to establish a state but rather the people who think a Palestinian state is not a threat who violate the borders of the enclave.
	This is the kind of person who poses the existential danger so he is the one who gets whacked in the face, no matter if he is a Danish or Israeli citizen.

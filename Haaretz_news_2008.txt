<title>Tutu: World doesn't criticize Israel because of the Holocaust</title>
<date>Thu Sep 18 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
South African Nobel Peace laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu on Thursday accused the West of complicity in Palestinian suffering by its silence, suggesting it did not want to criticize Israel because of the Holocaust.
Tutu spoke after delivering a report to the United Nations about Israel's deadly shelling of the town of Beit Hanun in Gaza in November 2006, which he said may constitute a war crime.
He criticized the international community for failing to speak out against the suffering in Gaza, home to 1.5 million Palestinians, under an Israeli blockade.
"This silence begets complicity," he told the UN Human Rights Council.
Tutu later told a news conference: "I think the West, quite rightly, is feeling contrite, penitent, for its awful connivance with the Holocaust."
"The penance is being paid by the Palestinians. I just hope again that ordinary citizens in the West will wake up and say 'we refuse to be part of this'," he said.
The Geneva-based Human Rights Council on Thursday debated the report on his fact-finding mission conducted last May, which called for an independent investigation into the Israeli strike that killed 19 Palestinians, all but one from the same family.
The Israeli military, after carrying out its own investigation, said in February that it had directed artillery fire against the Beit Hanun area on Nov. 8 2006, on the basis of intelligence that militants were planning rocket attacks.
Israeli ambassador Aharon Leshno Yaar told the Council on Thursday: "A thorough internal investigation was conducted and the results of this investigation shared with the United Nations. Nothing can be gained by rehashing this topic now."
But Tutu, who won the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent struggle against apartheid in his homeland, said his mission never had access to the internal Israeli report.
It was regrettable that Israel had not cooperated with his team, although it admitted responsibility for the strike.
"No verifiable explanation has been offered, no independent impartial and transparent investigation has been held, no one has been held to account," Tutu said.
In talks with senior Hamas officials, Tutu said he demanded an end to the firing of rockets into Israel, saying Hamas has an obligation to respect international humanitarian law.
"Families living in Sderot have the right to live without the fear of rockets, however crude, dropping from the sky," he said.
Israel and the West tightened restrictions last year on the Gaza Strip in an attempt to isolate Hamas after its fighters seized the territory. The Islamist group opposed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' peace talks with Israel.
Palestinian ambassador Mohammad Abu-Koash said Tutu's report should be brought to the attention of both the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court.
"The Israeli shelling of civilians in Beit Hanun while asleep in their homes and targeting of those fleeing is a war crime and its perpetrators must be brought before international justice," he said in a speech.

<title>ANALYSIS / Obama will find Bush has done the peacemaking for him</title>
<date>Thu Nov 06 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
While the greatest democracy in the world chose for the first time in its history a black, peace-loving man for president, tiny Israel is marking 13 years since the murder of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a home-grown zealot.  
Between us and the U.S.  
When the trumpets of victory fall silent, the galling voices of the extremists will be heard, those who will not accept the "evil decree" of the voter. America, too, has been "blessed" with messianic-racist movements whose people are prepared to die for "sacred" causes such as negating a woman's right to her own body and the right of people to purchase a deadly weapon in their corner grocery.  
America has also experienced the assassination of its leaders. Like the Shin Bet security services, the great Secret Service is not immune to a suicide-terrorist.  
The wellbeing of Barack Obama should be especially dear to Israel, not only because of its special relationship to the United States. It may be assumed that his advisers will see to it that he will not abandon Israel.  
I had the privilege of knowing two of the Middle East advisers the new president has chosen: former ambassador Dan Kurtzer and strategist Dan Shapiro. Both are Jews who support Israel and love peace. Both believe that the existence of the Jewish state depends on the existence of a Palestinian state. And naturally, a new president who was widely supported by Jews and will be thinking about his second term will not want to irritate this group.  
The shadow of the Muslim branch of Barack-Hussein's family tree will force him to be particularly careful when it comes to the United States-Israel-Arab triangle. In the past eight years Israel has become addicted to the heady fragrance of the White House and Congress, which have allowed it to do as it wanted in the territories.  
However, George W. Bush has done Obama's work for him. In the Oval Office Obama will find Bush's two-state vision: the Road Map that promised peace with all Arab countries by May 2005 and a complete freeze on settlements. He will also find a copy of the letter Bush sent to Ariel Sharon, in which he promised that the United States would support an agreement based on withdrawal from all territories except the main settlement blocs and the return of refugees to a Palestinian state.  
Obama will have to decide when he wants to redeem these debts. The outcome of the Israeli elections will doubtless impact his decision. If the Kadima-Labor coalition remains, the president will not have to work hard to get Israel going in a desirable direction for the United States. And since Obama's first year in office is PA President Mahmoud Abbas' last, the American president will not want to be blamed for the fall of the West Bank into Hammas hands.  
In March, the Arab League will reopen discussion of its peace initiative. If there is no change in the American attitude toward the Syrian-Israeli channel, Damascus will seek support for shelving this important document.  
If surveys predicting a victory for the right in Israel are borne out, the American president will obviously have some persuading to do to get the Israeli government to follow his liberal path of dialogue and compromise. The decision whether to risk re-enacting the confrontation between Bill Clinton and Benjamin Netahyahu, and shake up relations with Israel and the Jewish community, will depend on two factors: One is how important Obama thinks an Arab-Israeli peace treaty is in defusing the crisis in Iraq and isolating Iran. The second is Obama's willingness to force Israel into translating its songs of peace into action.  
The first sign the right was getting used to the American changeover could be seen in Channel 2's interview with former ambassador to Washington Danny Ayalon. The new acquisition of Yisrael Beiteinu said there was nothing to fear from Obama, and he believed Obama was good for Israel because "it would be easier for him to create a coalition against Iran." This is the same Ayalon who wrote in an op-ed in the Jerusalem Post in January that "we should look at the Obama candidacy with some degree of concern."  
It seems that Israelis who called Bush "the friendliest president to Israel" do have something to be concerned about. In contrast, those who are concerned about Israel becoming an apartheid state living forever by the sword have new hope since yesterday. In the meantime, it is only hope.

<title>Canada to skip UN racism conference due to expected 'anti-Semitism'</title>
<date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Canada will not take part in a major United Nations conference on racism next year because the event is likely to descend into "regrettable anti-Semitism", a top official said on Wednesday.
Officials said they believed Canada was the first nation to announce it will not attend the conference in Durban, South Africa.
A similar meeting at the same venue in 2001 was marred when Israel and the United States walked out in protest over draft conference texts branding Israel as a racist and apartheid state - language that was later dropped.
"(We) had hoped that the preparatory process for the 2009 ... conference would remedy the mistakes of the past. Despite our efforts, we have concluded that it will not. Canada will therefore not participate," Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier said in a statement.
Jason Kenney, the secretary of state for multiculturalism, said the Conservative government was sure the conference would "showcase the same regrettable anti-Semitism" as the 2001 meeting.
"Our government sees no value in allowing Canada's participation to continue to dignify or legitimate such hateful and un-Canadian propaganda," he told reporters.
The Canadian government is a strong supporter of Israel. Bernier apologized on Saturday for an internal Foreign Ministry training manual that listed both Israel and the United States on a torture watch list.
B'nai Brith Canada praised Ottawa for pulling out of "a farce of conference" that it said "pays lip service to anti-racism but in fact provides a platform for the promotion of hatred and bigotry".
The Canadian Jewish Congress also commended Ottawa for what it said was a principled stand.
The United Nations declined to comment directly on Canada pulling out of the conference but UN spokeswoman Marie Okabe said "racism is too important an issue for member states not to work out their differences. Next year will be a time of preparation for this conference; we hope that member states use this time constructively. The SG [secretary general] will continue to follow this issue very closely."

<title>Canadian PM cancels visit to Israel due to Olmert probe</title>
<date>Tue Jun 10 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has cancelled a June 16-20 trip to Israel due to the corruption scandal surrounding Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. 
Harper's staff never confirms a trip until shortly before the PM leaves, so the change is not characterized as a cancellation, but the trip had been talked about publicly. 
Norman Spector, former Canadian ambassador to Israel, said: "The domestic situation in Israel, quite frankly, is scandalous... Prime Minister Harper has no business being there when his counterpart is two steps away from the gallows."
Spector was referring to the corruption investigation surrounding Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, in which he is suspected of having illegally received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Jewish American businessman Morris Talansky. Talansky told a preliminary hearing at Jerusalem Magistrates Court that he gave Olmert $150,000 over a period of 15 years.
The Canadian government, however, is considered a strong supporter of Israel, and it recently announced that it will not take part in the United Nations conference on racism next year because the event is likely to descend into "regrettable anti-Semitism." 
Officials said they believed Canada was the first nation to announce it will not attend the meeting scheduled for April 2009 in Geneva, Switzerland. 
A similar meeting at the same venue in 2001 was marred when Israel and the United States walked out in protest over draft conference texts branding Israel as a racist and apartheid state - language that was later dropped. 
"(We) had hoped that the preparatory process for the 2009 ... conference would remedy the mistakes of the past. Despite our efforts, we have concluded that it will not. Canada will therefore not participate," Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier said in a statement.

<title>Carter discusses Mideast peace prospects with Assad in Syria</title>
<date>Fri Dec 12 23:20:43 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Syrian President Bashar Assad on Saturday discussed prospects for peace in the Middle east with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.
Syria and Israel this year held four rounds of indirect talks mediated by Turkey, but the talks made no significant headway.
In Syria Carter is also expected to meet with the exiled leadership of Hamas, Khaled Meshal. Carter's first meeting with Meshal in April drew sharp criticism from the Bush administration which labels Hamas as a terrorist group.
On Friday, Carter said that he would have been delighted to meet Hezbollah officials and that he regrets the meeting didn't take place during his current visit to Lebanon.
Carter spent five days talking to top Lebanese leaders and members of parliamentary blocs but didn't meet with lawmakers from the militant Hezbollah. The Iranian-backed Shiite group is on the U.S. State Department's terrorist list.
The former U.S. leader had said he was ready to meet Hezbollah but they refuse to meet current or former U.S. presidents.
Carter has offered that his Atlanta-based Carter Center monitor Lebanon's parliament elections next year. The vote will be fiercely contested between Western-backed anti-Syrian groups that hold majority seats in the current 128-member parliament and a Hezbollah-led coalition supported by Syria and Iran.
During a lecture at the American University of Beirut at the end of his visit Friday, Carter expressed disappointment that Hezbollah refused to see him.
"We came here with the hope that we can meet with all the political parties and factions in Lebanon," he said. "If the leaders of Hezbollah wanted to meet with me, I would have been delighted."
Carter also said on Friday he hoped U.S. President-elect Barack Obama would quickly engage in Middle East peace talks when he takes Office.
Carter, president from 1977 to 1981, said Obama had told him he would "begin this effort early in his term."
"The United States for the last eight years has been basically aloof from negotiations," Carter said in an address at the American University of Beirut. "My hope is we will see a new movement towards a comprehensive peace in this region."
Winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, Carter helped negotiate a 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
Critics say President George W. Bush largely ignored Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking until belatedly launching talks in November 2007.
Carter has been a tough critic of Israeli policies in the Palestinian territories, angering many with his 2006 book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid."
He also caused controversy earlier this year by meeting leaders of the Palestinian faction Hamas, which is listed as a terrorist group by the U.S. and the European Union.
Carter said he had no doubts about Obama's "political courage." "But I know the tremendous political pressure that exists in my nation among political office holders to comply almost without exception to the policies of the Israeli government," he said.
Obama's election was cheered by many Arabs glad to see an end to what they have seen as the Bush administration's ruinous Middle East policies. But the appointment of pro-Israeli figures in the new administration has tempered initial enthusiasm. 
Carter said that while Obama had picked Hillary Clinton as secretary of state and Rahm Emmanuel as White House chief of staff, there was hope in his choice of retired Marine Gen. James Jones as national security advisor.
"As far as Rahm Emmanuel is concerned, yes, he is closely affiliated with Israel... But I think that another hopeful sign is that General Jim Jones will be his national security advisor," Carter said.
Clinton had "been quite close to AIPAC's position in the past," Carter added, in reference to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobby group.
"But I think that Jim Jones is thoroughly familiar with the situation in Palestine," Carter said. Diplomats say Jones was critical of Israel in a confidential report this year on how Israelis and Palestinians had met security commitments.

<title>Carter offers to act as 'communicator' between Hamas, U.S., Israel</title>
<date>Mon Apr 14 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, defending a contentious plan to meet the leader of Hamas, said Monday he hoped to become a conduit between the militant group and Washington and even Israel.
"Isolating Hamas is counterproductive," Carter said. 
Hamas rules Gaza but is ostracized by Israel, the U.S. and Europe as a terror group.
"I think it is absolutely crucial that in the final and dreamed-about and prayed-for peace agreement for this region that Hamas be involved and Syria will be involved," Carter told a business conference outside Tel Aviv.
"I can't say that they will be amenable to any suggestions, but at least after I meet with them I can go back and relay what they say, as just a communicator, to the leaders of the United States," he said.
Earlier on Monday, Carter visited the southern town of Sderot, a frequent target of Qassam rocket fire from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, and met the city's mayor, Eli Moyal, and other municipal officials.
"I think it's a despicable crime for any deliberate effort to be made to kill innocent civilians, and my hope is there will be a cease-fire soon," Carter said during his visit.
Following the visit, Moyal said: "I don't believe that Carter can bring calm and peace and I think his meeting with Meshal is arbitrary and will do nothing to advance Israel's interests," Moyal said, referring to Carter's plans to meet with Hamas leader Khaled Meshal in Damascus this week.
Olmert's office had no immediate comment. 
Carter said Monday that a deal for the release of Israel Defense Forces soldier Gilad Shalit would top the agenda of his discussions with Meshal.
The Bush administration and close U.S. ally Israel oppose Carter's planned meeting with Meshal, whose Islamist group won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 but was boycotted by the West for refusing to renounce violence and recognize Israel.
Israel and the United States have sought to isolate Hamas, which seized control of the Gaza Strip in June from more secular Fatah forces loyal to Abbas. Abbas holds sway in the West Bank and has launched U.S.-backed peace talks with Olmert. 
Hamas leaders have offered a long-term truce with Israel in return for a viable Palestinian state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, but the group's 1988 founding charter calls for the destruction of Israel. 
The Nobel Peace Prize winner, who brokered Israel's first peace treaty with an Arab neighbor, Egypt, signed in 1979, met President Shimon Peres on Sunday but was shunned by most of the political leadership, including Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. 
In talks with MK Yossi Beilin in Jerusalem on Monday, Carter said he believed a release deal was possible and intended to make it a central aspect of his discussions with the Islamist leader. 
Carter also said he would raise the importance of a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and a halt to rocket fire on southern Israel during the meeting. 
The former U.S. leader told Beilin that in his efforts to solve international conflicts, he worked on a principle of talking with all possible sources. 
Carter told Haaretz Sunday in an exclusive interview that he intends to check Meshal's willingness to accept the Arab League peace initiative. Carter says that acceptance of this plan by Hamas would be a very positive step. 
Shin Bet security service declines request to assist in Carter security detailShin Bet security service has declined to assist Carter during his visit, U.S. sources close to the matter said on Monday. 
An American source described the snub as an "unprecedented" breach between the Shin Bet and the U.S. Secret Service, which protects all current and former U.S. presidents, as well as Israeli leaders when they visit the United States. 
Government sources on Monday described the lack of Shin Bet during Carter's visit to Sderot, an area often hit by rockets from the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, as particularly "problematic". 
Carter angered the Israeli government with plans to meet with Hamas leaders and for describing Israeli policy in the Palestinian territories as "a system of apartheid" in a 2006 book. 
Israel has also rejected Carter's request to meet jailed Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti, who is seen as a possible successor to President Mahmoud Abbas, a spokesman for Carter said. 
Barghouthi was convicted in 2004 of murder by an Israeli court over the killing of four Israelis and a Greek Orthodox monk in attacks by Palestinian militants. He is serving five life sentences. 
American sources close to the matter said the Shin Bet, which helps protect visiting dignitaries and is overseen by Olmert's office, declined to meet the head of Carter's Secret Service security detail or provide his team with assistance as is customary during such visits. 
"They're not getting support from local security," an American source said.

<title>Cool welcome for Carter in Jerusalem  </title>
<date>Mon Apr 14 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
President Shimon Peres accused former U.S. president Jimmy Carter of causing significant damage to Israel and the peace process in recent years, during a meeting between the two men yesterday at the President's Residence, officials at the residence said.  
Peres criticized Carter for comparing Israeli policies to apartheid in his hotly debated recent book, "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid," according to the officials. He also said it would be a mistake for Carter to carry through with his plans to meet with Hamas political leader Khaled Meshal in Damascus, saying Meshal is responsible for Hamas' violent takeover of the Gaza Strip.  
Members of the press were not invited to the meeting.  
Ahead of his Mideast trip, Carter defended his reasons for wanting to engage Hamas.  
"I think there's no doubt in anyone's mind that if Israel is ever going to find peace with justice concerning the relationship with their next-door neighbors, the Palestinians, that Hamas will have to be included in the process," Carter told ABC News "This Week" in a broadcast aired yesterday.  
The schedule released by the Atlanta-based Carter Center showed that the former president had no plans to meet Prime Minister Ehud Olmert Defense Minister Ehud Barak. Likud chairman Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to meet with Carter because of his planned meeting with Meshal and his views on Israel.  
A senior Israeli official said "scheduling problems" was the official reason given for the high-profile snub - even though Olmert recently took time to chat with "Prison Break" star Wentworth Miller. Olmert's bureau did not respond to a request for further clarification. But the real reason for the cold shoulder is Carter's plan to meet with Meshal, the official said, adding that Israel's leaders are not publicly criticizing Carter out of respect for his former position as U.S. president.  
Carter did meet yesterday with Noam Shalit, the father of captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Shalit described the meeting as positive, and told Haaretz he asked Carter to help advance the deal to release his son. However, Shalit provided no further details on the matter and would not say whether he asked the former president to pass on a message to Meshal.

<title>Gordimer Day </title>
<date>Tue May 13 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Day One. Yesterday was Nadine Gordimer day at the festival - at least for me, as I heard the 83-year-old South African writer in two hour-long sessions, the first in conversation with the woman who translates her work into Hebrew, Cilla Elazar, and the latter an intimate chat with Amos Oz - before an audience of probably 350, in a tent overlooking the the Old City. One Nobel Prize winner, one Nobel Prize hopeful.  
Gordimer and Oz are old friends, and they spoke with an easy familiarity that at times gave their conversation a spontaneity and intimacy that the festival's planners could only have hoped for, though sometimes Oz's metaphors used to explain "the conflict" to his friend smacked of glibness.  
But I'm getting a little ahead of myself. After an official opening on Sunday night, the festival really got down to work yesterday morning, with two sessions intended to explore the delicate work of literary translation. Gordimer and Elazar talked about the need for a title's translation to capture the spirit of a book, and whether translators should call the author when they run into trouble (absolutely not, said Gordimer).  
The two discussed the writer's 1987 novel "A Sport of Nature," which imagined a white South African woman who becomes involved in the fight for political independence of another unnamed African land, and ends up married to the black general who becomes its first president. Elazar wondered aloud if the novel's sunny ending may not have reflected an excessive optimism about the possibility for change in Africa on Gordimer's part. Gordimer insisted that a novelist isn't a prophet, and said she was proud of how her own country handled its revolution, with the leaders of the black majority having resisted any temptation to disenfranchise or even exile members of the minority that had oppressed them for hundreds of years.  
As Elazar began to respond, someone in the audience stood up and, in a style that one can only hope is unique to Israel, demanded that the translator shut up, as she and her fellow festival-goers had come to hear Nadine Gordimer, not her - though the session was in fact intended to be a conversation.  
Elazar clammed up, and Gordimer began taking questions from the audience. How, asked one woman, does she feel when she hears Israel described as an apartheid state? The writer responded judiciously: What she hears about "the methods" that Israel uses in the territories indeed "reminds me of South Africa," but "there is no historical comparison" between the situations. "Whites have no claim to even a single square inch of the whole African continent. In your country, you have two peoples with claims to the land." Gordimer also said quite clearly that it was "unacceptable prejudice" for Hamas and other Islamist groups to deny Israel its very right to existence.  
When another listener asked Gordimer to describe life in Johannesburg, she began, quite calmly, to discuss the pervasiveness of crime, of which she has been a victim. "I have been attacked in my own home, locked in a cupboard. Had my wedding band torn off my finger.  
"What can one do? The young man, who had his beautifully shaped arm wrapped around my neck - why wasn't he given job training, why wasn't he given more? When you think of what Franklin Delano Roosevelt did in the U.S. during the Great Depression, the tremendous government schemes to create jobs, to give people a living and to train them...."  
Later in the day, when Amos Oz asked her where she developed her political consciousness, Gordimer said it began when, as a child in the mining town of Springs, near Johannesburg, she passed the compound where the black laborers were housed. Even in their own shops, "they could only point" at what they wanted to buy. "They couldn't touch or feel items or try on clothing. When I went to town with my mama, we would go into the booth to try on dresses. This made me think about the way we were living."  
Gordimer believes in trying to understand the other, and she declared yesterday that cultural boycotts are "foolish." She urges Israelis to read the books of their enemies, and vice versa. In the meantime, quietly, with no publicity in Israel, and certainly no attempt to engage Israelis (the only mainstream press coverage I know of has been in The Guardian) the "Palestine Festival of Literature" also took place in the past few days, in Jerusalem, Ramallah and Bethlehem, attended by writers no less distinguished than those appearing this week at Mishkenot: Claire Messud, David Hare, Esther Freud, Roddy Doyle, Ahdaf Soueif. An impressive event, no doubt, but imagine how much more so if both sets of great writers, the people, after all, who cross borders with their words, and remind us of all that we have in common as humans, could have joined up in one big festival, spanning both sides of the Green Line.

<title>Gordimer may bow to pressure, skip Israel writers meet </title>
<date>Sun Apr 27 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
South African writer Nadine Gordimer may pull out of her appearance next month at Jerusalem's International Writers Festival in the face of a widespread campaign pressuring her to cancel.  
The 84-year-old Gordimer, winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature, is scheduled to make three appearances at the festival, which runs at Mishkenot Sha'ananim May 11-15.  
Other writers slated to attend include Americans Nathan Englander, Jonathan Safran Foer and Russell Banks, as well as Israelis David Grossman and Amos Oz, the latter of whom is scheduled to share the stage with Gordimer on May 12.  
"I am dealing with the issue now," Gordimer told Haaretz in a telephone conversation from her home in Johannesburg on Friday. She declined to comment further on the controversy, except to say she would soon make a public statement on her decision.  
Gordimer has received dozens of appeals, many of them posted online, calling on her to join a cultural boycott of Israel. Gordimer, who is Jewish, has long been identified with left-wing causes, including her backing of the African National Congress dating back to the apartheid period, when the black liberation movement was outlawed.  
In 2001, she publicly urged her friend Susan Sontag not to come to Jerusalem, where the American writer was to be honored with the Jerusalem Prize at the capital's biennial international book fair. Sontag, who died in 2004, did come in the end, and received the literary award in person.  
Now it is Gordimer who is being pressed to stay away from Israel. For example, an open letter earlier this month signed by British professors Hilary and Steven Rose implored her not to "give the Israeli establishment, the Israeli press, the whole Israeli PR machine, the prize they want - your apparent condoning of their policies."   
Yael Nahari, the director of the Jerusalem's International Writers Festival, told Haaretz that after a request from Gordimer, she is trying to arrange for the South African writer to "meet the other side [Palestinians]," including students at al-Quds University in Jerusalem. Nahari was optimistic that Gordimer will go ahead with her planned appearance at the five-day meeting. "I think she'll come," she said.

<title>Hamas: Shalit won't 'see light' until Palestinian prisoners freed</title>
<date>Fri Apr 18 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
A senior Hamas official on Friday said abducted Israel Defense Forces soldier Gilad Shalit "will not see the light" until Palestinian prisoners are released in a prisoner exchange.
"Gilad [Shalit] will not see the light, will not see his mother, will not see his father, God willing, as long as our heroic prisoners do not see their families, in their houses," Mushir al-Masri said in a speech Friday.
Shalit was kidnapped during a raid on an IDF army post near Gaza in the summer of 2006, and is being held in the coastal strip.  
Egyptian-led talks over a prisoner swap have been bogged down. Hamas has demanded the release of hundreds of prisoners. Israel has agreed to release some inmates, but has balked at some of those on Hamas' list.
Highlighting the importance of the prisoner issue to the Palestinian national agenda, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, a rival to Hamas, said in televised speech on Thursday that a release of all Palestinian prisoners
Yishai to Carter: Tell Hamas chief I want to discuss prisoner swapOn Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Eli Yishai asked  former U.S. President Jimmy Carter
Yishai relayed his message to Carter during a meeting on Monday. The meeting was held at the request of the former president, who wanted to meet with Israeli political leaders from across the political spectrum. The meeting was arranged through the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.  
Yishai's bureau said he did not ask Prime Minister Ehud Olmert for permission to hold the meeting, nor did he tell Olmert what he discussed.  
Yishai said other Israeli officials erred in boycotting Carter. During the meeting, he told Carter that he opposed the former president's use of the term "apartheid" in his book about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Yishai said Carter told him that the interpretation of his use of the word was fundamentally wrong.  
Yishai told Haaretz that in order to redeem prisoners, he was prepared to meet with anyone who could help move things ahead, including Hamas leaders. He said this did not contradict Israeli government policy, since he did not intend to discuss diplomatic issues or a cease-fire.  
After Carter visited Sderot this week, he pledged to help arrange a cease-fire. Carter also met with Shalit's parents, and said he would address Shalit's release when he spoke to Meshal.  
Shalit was kidnapped during a raid on an Israeli army post near Gaza in the summer of 2006, and is being held in the coastal strip.  
"I am ready to meet with all necessary Hamas members and with Shalit's captors, and I would be pleased if you can help," Yishai told Carter at their meeting on Monday. "I am volunteering myself for the task, and I ask you to convey a message: They also have prisoners and I am sure they want to see them released, and therefore it is proper to expedite the negotiations."  
Yishai thanked Carter for his willingness to assist in finding out the fate of missing soldiers Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser, whose kidnapping in 2006, days after Shalit's, sparked the Second Lebanon War.  
Carter promised to pass along the message and to meet with Yishai again when he returns to Israel next week, after visiting other countries in the region.  
Yishai opposes negotiating with the Palestinian leadership, led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, over a permanent-status arrangement, especially regarding Jerusalem.  
A source in Shas said Thursday that if talks with Hamas led to calm, especially around the Gaza Strip, this could lessen pressure to reach a final-status agreement, which could lead to a coalition crisis with Shas.  
Yishai placed his request as Israeli and American officials were protesting Carter's intention to meet with Meshal, the leader of an organization that Israel and the United States consider a terror group. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert did not make time to meet with Carter, and Haaretz has learned that after the press mentioned Carter's plan to meet Meshal, Defense Minister Ehud Barak cancelled a meeting that had been scheduled for Monday. Barak's bureau said the meeting had been cancelled due to scheduling conflicts.  
Carter told Haaretz this week that before he arrived in the region, his staff informed the U.S. government of all the meetings he had planned for his Middle East visit, including the meeting with Meshal. Carter said that until his plans became public knowledge, no U.S. officials objected to them.

<title>High Court closes off use of major highway to Palestinians</title>
<date>Wed Mar 19 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
The interim decision issued 10 days ago by the High Court of Justice on the use of Route 443 marks the first time the justices have issued a ruling to close a road traversing occupied territory to Palestinian use, for the convenience of Israeli travelers. 
The interim ruling on a petition by six Palestinian villages adjacent to the highway, which links the coastal plain to Jerusalem, gave the state six months to report progress on the construction of an alternative road for Palestinian use. 
The Association for Civil Rights in Israel, which submitted the petition on behalf of Palestinians who have been injured by the travel ban, noted that had the justices sincerely sought to consider opening the road to all, without regard to race or nationality, they would not have requested details on the building of an alternate route, which entails the destruction of additional land and costs tens of millions of shekels.  
The decision was issued after both parties argued their positions. According to ACRI, the ruling marks a High Court precedent in upholding a policy of separation and discrimination with regard to movement that has already earned the name "road apartheid." It violates international law, ACRI holds, permitting the expropriation of land from the local population for the protection of the occupying power.  
About 10 kilometers of Route 443 was paved on private Palestinian land in the early 1980s, on the grounds it was needed for the West Bank Palestinian population (and not for "security purposes"). A large part of the expropriated land had been earmarked for a housing development for local teachers. In response to a petition from a Palestinian whose land was expropriated for the road, the High Court ruled that the military government cannot plan and build a road system in an area held by its soldiers if the purpose is solely for the creation of a "service road" for the state. As a result, the state promised that the road was to be open to all.  
Shortly after the start of the second intifada, after attacks on Israeli vehicles, the army closed the road to Palestinians. MK Ephraim Sneh, deputy defense minister at the time, admitted in an interview that the closure was not approved by the political leadership. The closure cut off the villages on either side of the road from their main city, Ramallah, and the rest of the West Bank. In court, the Civil Administration offered to issue travel permits for 80 vehicles, for a population of about 30,000 villagers. The villagers refused to cooperate with Israeli authorities and continued their legal battle for right to use the road on their lands. ACRI claimed in court that the Israel Defense Forces had recently begun frequent raids on the six villages that included the use of illumination bombs, pressure grenades, rubber-tipped bullets and live rounds. The IDF Spokesman's Office said at the time that these were routine operations in response to the throwing or rocks on vehicles traveling on Route 443.  
ACRI officials say they fear the High Court stamp of approval for the illegal and immoral policy regarding Route 443 could be cited as a precedent for additional human rights violations. The petitioners protest what they call a lack of judicial process, noting that even though the decision was on an important principle, it was issued without any accompany explanation and with absolutely no reference to the points raised by the petitioners. In addition, they note, the alternative road will not provide for the needs of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in areas bordering Route 443.

<title>Human rights report: West Bank situation 'reminiscent of apartheid regime in South Africa'</title>
<date>Sun Dec 07 11:42:40 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Basic human rights, such as health, a life of dignity, education, housing, equality, freedom from racism, freedom of expression, privacy and democracy are increasingly being violated in Israel, a human rights watchdog group warned Sunday.
In its annual report, the Association of Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI)  pointed to "extremely worrisome trends at the center of which are violations of the most elementary human rights."
The report also noted that the situation in the occupied West Bank, between Israeli settlers and the local Palestinian population, was "reminiscent, in many and increasing ways, of the apartheid regime in South Africa."
The ACRI noted that since the foundation of Israel, the country's Arab citizens have been discriminated against though legislation and allocation of resources.
In addition, women were widely discriminated against in the workplace, earning less money than men in nearly every profession, with a higher rate of unemployment, and with representation in the Israeli academia 10 per cent lower than the average in any of the European Union nations.
While the discrimination between Jews of European origins and those of Oriental or Middle Eastern origin has now been virtually eradicated, the report said, the socioeconomic gap between the two groups has grown, which bolsters a feeling of discrimination.
As regards the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian areas, the ACRI said that Israeli settlements in the West Bank have resulted in institutionalized discrimination in which two separate populations live under two separate judicial systems.
Allocation of funds and services in the occupied area is also unequal and settler violence against local Palestinians has grown. 
Many of the 430 people killed and 1,150 wounded in the West Bank by Israeli security forcers in 2008 were innocent bystanders, the report said, without giving exact figures.
The report went on to note that despite progressive labour legislation in Israel, the rights of employees are still violated, or at least not enforced, and many services remain physically inaccessible to the handicapped, who also suffer from a high rate of unemployment compared to the rest of the population.
However, the ACRI did find that the rights of gays in Israel were relatively advanced compared to other Western countries, and gay couples enjoyed the same rights as common-law couples.
The report was published to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

<title>Internet site seeks former Swedish volunteers to act as goodwill ambassadors </title>
<date>Mon Mar 24 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Last year, Kiki Toledano, a member of Kibbutz Massada in the Jordan Valley and a lecturer of English, was invited to speak on a radio station in Sweden. "It was a program where the host raised issues close to his heart," said Toledano. "I spoke about Israel as an Israeli citizen, and I then understood how difficult our situation is."  
She also said that, in her discussions with the listeners, they described the country as a conqueror, and acting with cruelty toward Palestinians.  
"It hurt me to hear what they were saying about us," said Toledano, who arrived at Kibbutz Massada in 1982 as a volunteer and married a member of the kibbutz. "Israel's public relations in Sweden are in a sad state."  
The Web site recently launched by the Israeli embassy in Sweden is trying to change the situation Toledano described. The site (www.kibbutz.nu), was designed to attract Swedes who had spent time volunteering on kibbutzim in Israel, and spur them to act as "ambassadors" and spokesmen for the state overseas.  
The Web site, which includes content on Israel and on kibbutzim, invites former volunteers to join a social network to help Israel's public relations. The embassy estimates that about 40,000 Swedes have spent time as volunteers in Israel since 1967.  
"It is a waste not to take advantage of former volunteers," said Rina Keren, head of the volunteers department in the Kibbutz Movement. "These people are ambassadors of goodwill. About 400,000 volunteers have spent time on kibbutzim since 1967, and the vast majority have nothing but good things to say about Israel. Making good use of these people will give Israeli PR a decisive advantage."  
"We don't have an oversupply of support, and for the past two years we have been considering the best way to reach our target audience," explained Israel's Consul in Stockholm, Kobi Shoshani. "This is another common thread among 30-50 year olds, many of whom spent time on kibbutzim. Their eyes light up when they speak about this time. Anyone who has been a volunteer in Israel knows that it's not all war, it's also kibbutz, volunteers, and other things."  
"There is a community of people in Sweden who can do a lot for us," noted Keren. "Some have been appointed to powerful positions in government and embassies. When former Shin Bet chief Carmi Gillon was appointed Israel's ambassador there, he had a difficult start (criticism of the Shin Bet's activities toward Palestinians, etc.). He wrote that one thing that helped him was the fact that a third of the Parliament had been volunteers on kibbutzim."  
Toledano fondly recalls coming to Massada as a young woman of 19.  
"There was an ideological element to it," she said. "In the 1970s and 1980s, living on a collective, together, in cooperation, was a very strong motif. Life today has become very individualistic."  
But the most obvious change she sees is in the attitude toward Israel.  
"Now they compare us to South Africa, present us as an apartheid regime, and Arafat as a hero and freedom-fighter," she related. "A student of mine was killed in the terror attack on the Maxim restaurant in Haifa, and what do the Swedes see? A display of a pool of blood with an image of a terrorist. When the ambassador destroyed the display, the thing that is remembered in Sweden is the so-called crazy ambassador, and not the story about the terrorist attacks.  
"Anyone who knows the truth is someone who is very interested, and many of these are former volunteers, who see a different reality."

<title>Iran rejects tough atomic inspections, citing 'double standard'</title>
<date>Mon May 05 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Iran on Monday ruled out accepting intrusive nuclear inspections unless there was an end to "double standards" on global non-proliferation that it said benefited nuclear arms powers, which allegedly includes Israel.
Squaring off with Western nations at a global meeting on how to shore up the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran rejected allegations of covert Iranian atom bomb work, and blamed nuclear weapons powers for the treaty's problems.
Iranian Ambassador Ali Asghar Soltanieh asked why developing nations should accept intrusive International Atomic Energy Agency inspections as a condition for obtaining nuclear know-how when nuclear arms powers could unilaterally curb IAEA checks of their facilities.
Soltanieh accused industrialized powers of enshrining"nuclear apartheid" by imposing harsher export controls for developing states within the NPT while secretly helping non-NPT state Israel build a nuclear arsenal.
"This double standard cannot be sustained and no additional measure in strengthening (IAEA) safeguards can be accepted by non-nuclear weapons parties unless these serious constraints and discrimination are removed," he said.
Earlier Monday, Iran ruled out halting its disputed nuclear work, saying it would reject any incentive package offered by world powers that violated the Islamic Republic's nuclear rights.
Six world powers agreed at a meeting in London on Friday to offer a new incentives package to coax Iran to suspend uranium enrichment, a process which the West believes Tehran wants to master so that it can build nuclear weapons.
Iran, which insists its nuclear program is aimed at generating electricity, says enrichment is a national right that it will not give up.
"Those incentives that violate the Iranian nation's right in any form will not be reviewed by the Islamic state," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told a news conference Monday.
Iran's English-language Press TV earlier translated Hosseini as saying incentives violating Iran's rights would "not be supported by us". It said Iran had not officially received any package.
The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council - the United States, France, Britain, China and Russia - and Germany, known as the P5+1, offered a package to Iran in 2006 that demanded Iran halt enrichment. Tehran rejected it.
"Regarding the incentives package ... we believe the path adopted in the past should not be continued. They should act based on realities and international regulations. Talks should be held based on respecting nations' rights," Hosseini said.
Russia, which sent an envoy to Iran last week for discussions that covered the nuclear row, said on Saturday enrichment would have to be suspended during international talks aimed at resolving the dispute.
"In the past, we have expressed our view about the issue that some Russian officials talked about. There has been no change in our position," Hosseini said when asked about the comments by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
The UN Security Council has demanded that Iran stop enrichment, a process which can make both fuel for power plants and material for bombs. Tehran's refusal has led to three sets of limited sanctions since 2006.
Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday the Islamic Republic would not give up its right in the face of Western pressure, but did not explicitly mention nuclear work.

<title>Israel expels UN rights envoy who compared Israelis to Nazis</title>
<date>Mon Dec 15 13:31:09 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Professor Richard Falk, a United Nations envoy who once sparked controversy by comparing Israelis to Nazis, has been barred entry to Israel and was put on a plane bound out of the country early on Monday.
In March, the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council appointed Falk, a Jewish American and professor emeritus at Princeton University, to a six-year term monitoring the human rights situation as UN Special Rapporteur in the Palestinian territories. 
Israel's Foreign Ministry said in September that it would not allow Falk to enter the country, after the BBC quoted Falk as defending statements he made last year equating Israel's treatment of Palestinians with Nazi treatment of Jews during the Holocaust. Falk told BBC that Israel had  been unfairly shielded from international criticism.
Israel has also complained that Falk's mandate as an investigator was confined to human rights violations by Israel toward Palestinians and did not encompass violations by Palestinians toward Israelis.
Falk had been scheduled to hold meetings in Ramallah in the coming days with representatives of many human rights organizations. 
The Adalah rights organization Monday sent an urgent letter to Interior Minister Meir Sheetrit and Attorney General Menachem Mazuz, demanding that they lift the ban on Falk, which it called "a severe blow to the rights of the Palestinian civilian population living under Israeli occupation, a population which must be afforded protection by the occupier under international humanitarian law. 
The letter said it was "Israel's obligation as a member of the UN and a signatory to various international human rights conventions to respect the work of UN representatives, to enable their human rights missions and to assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities without fear ofrepercussions."
Prior to Falk's formal assumption of his duties, Israel had in the past allowed Falk to enter the country. This was the first time he had arrived in Israel in his role as Special Rapporteur.
The Foreign Ministry said that it has been made clear to Falk in advance that he would be denied entry into Israel, and that Israel would not cooperate with him.
"Falk was not invited by Israel, nor did he coordinate the visit, as UN regulations obligated him to do," said Simona Helprin, head of the Foreign Ministry's human rights department.
"It is indeed rare that Israel bars entry in this manner, but we cannot accept a situation in which an envoy arrives about whom it is known in advance that he will not carry out his role properly." 
According to Helprin, the UN is under an obligation to see that its envoys are objective and fair, while Falk has compared the situation in the territories with that of the Nazi Holocaust. "From Israel's standpoint, he is not objective," she said. 
The council's previous investigator, John Dugard from South Africa, compared Israeli treatment of Palestinians to apartheid, the discriminatory policy of the previous white regime in South Africa toward blacks.

<title>Israel likely to skip next UN racism conference</title>
<date>Wed Aug 06 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Israel will almost surely boycott the next UN racism conference in Geneva, its ambassador said Wednesday, warning that the meeting is likely to sink into the same anti-Semitism that prompted the U.S. and Israel to walk out of the last one seven years ago.
Itzhak Levanon, Israel's departing UN envoy in Geneva, said the event April 20-25, would need to be completely reworked for Israel to participate.
But with Libya chairing preparations and Iran and Cuba also involved, Levanon said the Geneva follow-up to the contentious 2001 conference in the South African city of Durban had the making of another international bashing of Israel.
"We want them to discuss human rights, and not only focus on Israel and turning this into an anti-Semitic event," he said in an interview with The Associated Press. We will attend the meeting only if there is a radical, substantive change.
The World Conference Against Racism ended three days before the Sept. 11, with a declaration and program of action that divided countries even as they agreed to it.
Dominated by clashes over the Middle East and the legacy of slavery, the U.S. and Israel walked out midway through the eight-day meeting over a draft resolution that singled out Israel for criticism and likened Zionism - the movement to establish and maintain a Jewish state - to racism.
Those references were removed from the final declaration, though it did cite the plight of the Palestinians as an issue without singling out Israel.
A parallel forum of non-governmental organizations, however, branded Israel as a racist apartheid state and called for an end to the "ongoing, Israeli systematic perpetration of racist crimes, including war crimes, acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing."
Levanon said the anti-Israel speeches at Durban were a shame and that Israel would not have any part in a repetition. But he said the nations that led the attacks on Israel have offered no encouraging signs that the next meeting will be different.
"Yes, the Europeans say it should not be anti-Semitic and the Israelis are demanding a focus on human rights around the world," he said. 
"But what about those that did the bashing? They've said nothing."
Canada is the only country that has explicitly said it will not take part in Durban II, arguing the meeting will promote racism and not combat it. In ads that appeared in April in newspapers such as the New York Sun and The Washington Times, 25 people including Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, law professor Alan Dershowitz and former CIA Director James Woolsey urged the U.S. to also skip the event, labeling it anti-Semitic.
"From what I've seen in the preparations, I'm afraid we're going to face the same scenario," Levanon said. Canada won't take part. 
"Israel most probably won't either. The United States and most of the Europeans will boycott 'Durban II' if this is going to be the case."
U.S. President George W. Bush's administration already has taken a symbolic position opposing the conference. In December, Washington cast the only no vote when the General Assembly passed a two-year UN budget because of objections to funding for the conference, which it considers anti-Israel. The U.S. State Department has said, however, that a decision whether to attend or boycott will be made closer to the time of the conference.
The Bush administration and the U.S. Senate also have taken a strong line against the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council, which like the Durban II preparations has been dominated by the same coalition of Muslim and African diplomats.
They have led the council to single out Israel for alleged abuses nearly a dozen times in its two-year existence. The body, meanwhile, has failed to criticize the Sudanese government over its conduct in Darfur and let Myanmar off lightly for its brutal crackdown last year on protesters.
The U.S. and Israel were among the four countries that rejected the 47-nation council's creation, and have both declined to run for seats. Last year, the U.S. Senate blocked the roughly U.S. $3 million Washington pays to finance it in protest.
Levanon, who has represented Israel at the council, said the body was a nice dream when it was designed to replace the Human Rights Commission, which was created after World War II under the leadership of former U.S. first lady Eleanor Roosevelt but later became bogged down in deep political fighting.
"The dream was to replace the commission with something more efficient, noble, objective and to protect human rights," said Levanon, who will return to Israel when his mandate ends later this month. "But if you see the results, it's not objective. It singles out only one country, Israel, and does nothing in Darfur or Myanmar."
"Things are happening there. People are killed," he added. 
"Where is the protection for human rights?"

<title>Israel to boycott 'Durban II' anti-racism conference</title>
<date>Wed Nov 19 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni announced Wednesday that Israel has made a final decision to boycott the United Nations "Durban II" conference on human rights this spring, fearing it would be used once again as a forum for anti-Israeli sentiment.
The World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, to be held in Geneva in April, is a follow-up to a 2001 summit in Durban, South Africa on the same issues.
"The documents prepared for the conference indicate that it is turning once again into an anti-Israeli tribunal, singling out and delegitimizing the State of Israel," Livni told Jewish-American leaders at the UJC General Assembly in Jerusalem. 
"The conference has nothing to do with fighting racism," she said. "In view of this situation, I decided that Israel will not participate and will not legitimize the Durban II conference."
The foreign minister also called on the international community "not to participate in a conference which seeks to legitimize hatred and extremism under the banner of a fight against racism."
Livni had said in February that Israel would botcott the meet, following assessment by the Foreign Ministry, and other Western governments, that it would be impossible to prevent the conference from turning into a festival of anti-Israeli attacks. 
South Africa hosted the first Durban conference in the summer of 2001 under the auspices of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. It was titled "The World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance," but most of the discussions revolved around Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. 
The United States and Israel responded by lowering the level of their diplomatic representation and eventually quit the conference, which culminated in a resolution equating Zionism and racism. 
The two country's issued over the draft texts branding Israel as a racist and apartheid state - language that was later dropped.
That conference had also provided a framework for a global convention of non-governmental organizations, which became a platform for delegitimizing Israel.
In August 2008, officials from 21 African countries held talks ahead of the Geneva conference and adopted a text which recommended it discuss, among other issues, "the plight of the Palestinian people under foreign occupations."
Canada has said it will not take part in the Geneva meeting. The United States, Britain, the Netherlands and France have said they may stay away if Israel's relations with Palestinians stands to eclipse all else.
In September, Navi Pillay, the UN's commissioner for human rights, urged all countries threatening to boycott the Geneva conference to reconsider their decision.

<title>Israel, U.S. to coordinate on Durban II boycott </title>
<date>Fri Apr 04 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Israel and the U.S. decided a few weeks ago to boycott the Durban II conference - scheduled for early 2009 and likely to harshly criticize Israel's human rights record - unless they receive firm guarantees that the event will not turn into anti-Israel festival.  
According to a senior government official, the joint decision was made after discussions among senior U.S. State Department and local Foreign Ministry officials, and after being raised in talks between Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Israel and the U.S. decided to make their participation in the conference conditional on guarantees the event would not become a rerun of the previous United Nations rights conference in Durban in 2001.  
"The burden of proof will be on the UN and the organizers," a Jerusalem source stated.  
The September 2001 conference in Durban, South Africa had been slated to deal with racism and xenophobia, sponsored by South Africa, the UN Human Rights Commission and the UN non-aligned states - a body dominated by Arab states. The conference was attended by official government delegations, as well as non-government organizations who dictated a hard anti-Israel and anti-Semitic line.  
The attacks on Israel included accusations of apartheid, that Zionism is racism, and that the Holocaust is not a unique event but similar to other events in history. Delegates also said Israel was "born in sin," the result of ethnic cleansing of Arabs and that in the present, it is committing genocide against Palestinians.  
U.S. and Israel's representatives walked out of the conference in protest at these attacks.  
Israel and world Jewish organizations have begun a campaign against the upcoming conference, although it still has no final date or location. In February, the Foreign Ministry held its first coordinating meeting and another will be held next month in Geneva, under the auspices of the UN Watch monitoring group, and will discuss strategies to prevent anti-Semitism and attacks on Israel at the follow-up conference.  
So far, Canada has announced plans to boycott the conference and Israel is trying to convince other countries to make their participation conditional on preventing a similar agenda.  
Jerusalem estimates that conference organizers will try to blur the real agenda until the last minute to draw in as many UN members as possible. "We are concerned this time too there will be criticism and an anti-Semitic attack," a Foreign Ministry official said. "What can you expect from a conference whose organizers include Cuba, Iran and North Korea."  
On Wednesday, many major U.S. newspapers ran an advertisement signed by 25 public figures including former politicians, religious leaders and intellectuals, calling on the government to boycott the conference. Signatories included Nobel Prize laureate Elie Wiesel, former CIA chief James Woolsey and law professor Alan Dershowitz. The signatories called on Rice to announce a boycott of the conference, denouncing it as a platform for anti-Semitism "slated to encourage hatred of Israel and the U.S."  
The U.S. decision to boycott the conference came in coordination with Israel. The two countries agreed to publish a joint statement similar to Livni's recent announcement that Israel plans to boycott the conference as long as it serves as a platform for anti-Semitism and anti-Israel sentiment.  
A Jerusalem official expressed regret that there appears to be no change in the conference's agenda. "Israel is sorry that the UN secretary general and the UN Human Rights Commission are not doing enough to change the content despite their dissatisfaction.  
"This is another example of how a UN-sponsored conference to fight racism and xenophobia is about to become an arena for extreme political Israel-bashing, while ignoring areas in the world where racism, religious persecution and intolerance of foreigners, are rampant."  
Israel plans to continue combating the planned conference content together with Jewish groups and the U.S. and Canadian governments.

<title>Jimmy Carter to visit Syria, Lebanon next week</title>
<date>Fri Dec 05 22:43:54 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Former President Jimmy Carter plans to meet with Syrian President Bashar Assad and other officials to discuss prospects for peace in the Middle East during visits to Lebanon and Syria next week.
The Carter Center said Friday that Carter will lead a pre-electoral assessment mission in Lebanon. The center is considering observing parliamentary elections scheduled for the spring.
Carter also will address students, faculty, and invited guests at the American University of Beirut on Dec. 12.
He will speak on 30 years after Camp David: A memo to the Arab World, Israel and the Quartet.
The Camp David Accords were a peace treaty brokered by Carter and signed by Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin on September 17, 1978.
Many Israel supporters slammed Carter for his 2006 book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid", in which Carter argues that the primary obstacle to Middle East peace is "Israel's continued control and colonization of Palestinian land."

<title>John McCain speech to AIPAC, June 2008</title>
<date>Wed Oct 29 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Thank you very much. Thank you for that kind welcome and thank you, Ron, for your generous remarks and the invitation to address you. I see that we have some students here, including a few from Arizona and I welcome you to Washington and your money and it's--it's a pleasure as always to be in the company of the men and women of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
And I know that all of us are proud to be in the company of my dear and beloved, distinguished Senator from the State of Connecticut, my dear friend, Joe Lieberman. Joe, thank you; a man of humility, a man of kindness, and a great and dear friend--not only of America--my family, State of Israel and the world.
My friends, all of you involved in the work of AIPAC have taken up a great and vital cause and a cause set firmly in the American heart. When President Truman recognized the new State of Israel 60 years ago he acted on the highest ideals and best instincts of our country. He was a man with courage and a sense of history; and he surely knew what great challenges the Jewish State would face in its early years. To his lasting credit, he resolved that the people of Israel would not face them alone because they would always have a friend and ally in the United States of America.
The cause of Israel and of our common security has also depended on men and women of courage, and I've been lucky enough to know quite a few of them. I think often of one in particular, the late Senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson. I got to know Senator Jackson when I was the Navy Liaison Officer to the United States Senate. In 1979, I traveled with him to Israel where I knew he was considered a hero. But I had no idea just how admired he was until we landed in the airport in Tel Aviv to find a crowd of 700 or 800 Israelis calling out his name, waving signs that read God Bless You Scoop and Senator Jackson, Thank You. Scoop Jackson had the special respect of the Jewish people, the kind of respect accorded to brave and faithful friends. He was and remains the model of what an American Statesman should be.
The people of Israel reserve a special respect for courage because so much courage has been required of them. In the record of history sheer survival in the face of Israel's many trials would have been impressive enough but Israel has achieved much more than that these past 60 years. Israel has endured and thrived and their people have built a nation that's an inspiration to free nations everywhere.
Yet no matter how successful a nation of Israel or how far removed from the Holocaust their experiences will never pass from memory. Not long ago I was in Jerusalem with Senator Lieberman and our colleague Lindsay Graham, and we went to the Holocaust Memorial, Yad Vashem. And for all the boundless examples of cruelty and inhumanity to be found there, for all the pain and grief remembered there, somehow I was especially moved by the story of the camp survivors who died from the very nourishment given to them by their liberators. They'd starved and suffered so much that their bodies were too weak even for food. They endured it all, only to die at the moment of their deliverance. These are the kinds of experiences that the Jewish people carry in memory and they are far from the worst experiences of the Holocaust. 
These are the kinds of grieves and afflictions from which the State of Israel offered escape, and today when we join in saying never again that is not a wish or request or a plea to the enemies of Israel; it is a promise that the United States and Israel will honor against any enemy, against enemy - any enemy  - against any enemy who cares to test us.
The threats to Israel's security are large and growing and America's commitment must grow as well. I strongly support the increase in military aid to Israel scheduled to begin in October. I am committed to making certain Israel maintains its qualitative military edge. Israel's enemies are too numerous - Israel's enemies are too numerous, its margin of error too small, and our shared interests and values too great for us to follow any other policy. Foremost - foremost in all our minds is the threat posed by the regime in Tehran. The Iranian President has called for Israel to be wiped off the map and suggested that Israel's Jewish population should return to Europe. He calls Israel a stinking corpse; that it's on its way to annihilation but the Iranian leadership does far more than issue vial insults. It acts in ways directly detrimental to the security of Israel and the United States. A sponsor of both Hamas and Hezbollah, the leadership of Iran has repeatedly used violence to undermine Israel in the Middle East peace process; it has trained, financed, and equipped extremists in Iraq who have killed American soldiers, fighting to bring freedom to that country. It remains the world's chief sponsor of terrorism and threatens to destabilize the entire Middle East from Basra to Beirut.
Tehran's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons poses an unacceptable risk, a danger we cannot allow. Emboldened by nuclear weapons, Iran would feel free to sponsor terrorist attacks--any--against any perceived enemy. It's flouting of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty would render that agreement obsolete and could induce Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and others to join a nuclear arms race. The world would have to live indefinitely with the possibility that Tehran might pass nuclear materials or weapons to one of its allied terrorist networks. Armed as well with its ballistic missile arsenal an Iranian nuclear bomb would pose an existential threat to the people of Israel.
European negotiators have proposed a peaceful end-game for Tehran should it abandon its nuclear ambitions and comply with the UN Security Council Resolutions. The plan offers far-reaching economic incentives, external support for a civilian nuclear energy and program, and integration into the international community. But Tehran has said no. The Iranians have spent years working toward a nuclear program and the idea that they now seek nuclear weapons because we refuse to engage in Presidential level talks is a serious misreading of history.
In reality - in reality a series of Administrations have tried to talk to Iran and none harder - none tried harder than the Clinton Administration. In 1998 the Secretary of State made a public overture to the Iranians, laid out a road map to normal relations and for two years tried to engage. The Clinton Administration even lifted some sanctions and Secretary Albright apologized for American actions going back to the 1950s. But even under President Khatami a man by all accounts less radical than the current President, Iran rejected these overtures. Even so we hear talk of a meeting with the Iranian leadership offered up as if it were some sudden inspiration, a bold new idea that somehow nobody has ever thought of before. 
Yet it's hard to see what such a Summit with President Ahmadinejad would actually gain except an earful of anti-Semitic rants and a worldwide audience for a man who denies one Holocaust and talks before frenzied crowds about starting another. 
Such a spectacle would harm Iranian moderates and dissidents as the radicals and hardliners strengthen their position and suddenly acquire the appearance of respectability. Rather than sitting down unconditionally with the Iranian President or Supreme Leader in the hope that we can talk sense into them, we must create the weary world pressures that will peacefully but decisively change the path that they are on. Essential to this strategy - essential to this strategy is the UN Security Council which should impose progressively tougher political and economic sanctions. Should the Security Council continue to delay in this responsibility, the United States must lead like-minded countries in imposing multi-lateral sanctions outside the UN framework. I'm proud to have been a leader on these issues for years having co-authored the 1992 Iran/Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act.
Over a year ago I proposed applying sanctions to restrict Iran's ability to import refined petroleum products on which it is highly dependent and the time has come for an international campaign to do just that. A severe limit on Iranian imports of gasoline would create immediate pressure on Khomeini and Ahmadinejad to change course and to cease in the pursuit of nuclear weapons. At the same time, we need the support of those in the region who are most concern about Iran and of our European partners as well. They can help by imposing targeted sanctions that will impose a heavy cost on the regime's leaders, including the denial of visas and freezing of assets; as a further measure to contain and deter Iran, the United States should impose financial sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran which aids in Iran's terrorism and weapons proliferation. We must--we must apply the full force of law to prevent business dealings with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps.
I was pleased - I was pleased to join Senators Lieberman and Kyle in backing an Amendment calling for the designation of the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization responsible for killing American troops in Iraq. Over three-quarters of the Senate supported this obvious step, but not Senator Obama. He opposed this Resolution because its support for countering Iranian influence in Iraq was he said quote a wrong message not only to the world but also to the region. But here too, he's mistaken; holding Iran's influence in check and holding a terrorist organization accountable sends exactly the right message to Iran, to the region, and to the world.
We should privatize the sanctions against Iran by launching a worldwide divestment campaign. As more people--businesses, pension funds, and financial institutions across the world divest from companies doing business with Iran the radical elite who run that country will become even more unpopular than they are already.
Years ago - years ago the moral clarity and conviction of civilized nations came together in a divestment campaign against South Africa helping to rid that nation of the evil of apartheid. In our day, we must use that same power and moral conviction against the regime in Iran and help - and help to safeguard the people of Israel and the peace of the world. In all of this, we will not only be defending our own safety and welfare, but also the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people. They are a great - they are a great and civilized people with little sympathy for the terrorists their leaders finance and no wish to threaten other nations with nuclear weapons. 
Iran's rulers would be very different if the people themselves had a choice in the matter and American policy should always reflect their hopes for a freer and more just society.
The same holds true - the same holds true for the Palestinian people most of whom ask only for a better life in a less violent world. They are badly served by the terrorist led group in charge of Gaza; this is a group that still refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist, refuses to denounce violence, and refuses to acknowledge prior peace commitments. They deliberately target Israeli civilians in an attempt to terrorize the Jewish population. They spread violence and hatred and with every new bombing they setback the cause of their own people.
During my last visit to Israel in March I saw for myself the work of Hamas in the town of Sderot just across the Border as you know from Gaza. I saw the houses that had been hit by Hamas rockets; in the face of injuries, death, and destruction thousands of Israelis have had to flee. Many others have stayed to carry on as best they can. I visited the home of a man named Pinhas Amar, who lives with his disabled wife, Aliza and their children. One day last year the sirens sounded again to alert the town to incoming rocket-fire. The rest of the family found cover. Aliza on the other side of the house was knocked out of her wheelchair and struck by shrapnel. This occurred on December 17th and from that day until the day of my visit just some three months later, more than 1,000 rockets had struck Sderot. Today, siren warnings are commonplace; the elementary schools are surrounded by concrete shelters and children walking the streets in costume for Purim celebrations did so in fear.
No nation in the world would allow its population to be attacked so incessantly, to be killed and intimidated so mercilessly without responding. And the nation of Israel is no exception. Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are engaged in talks that all of us hope will yield progress toward peace. Yet while we encourage this process we must also insure that Israel's people can live in safety until there is a Palestinian leadership willing and able to deliver peace. The peace process that places face in terrorists can never end in peace and we do no favors to the Palestinian people by conferring approval upon the terrorist syndicate that has seized power in Gaza.
Likewise, Israel's chance for enduring peace with Lebanon depends on a Lebanese government that has a monopoly on authority within its country's borders. That means no independent militias, no Hezbollah fighters, no weapons and equipment flowing to Hezbollah. Hezbollah fighters recently took up arms against their fellow Lebanese starting the worst internal fighting since the Civil War ended in 1990. In the process they extracted an agreement for a new political arrangement in which Hezbollah and its allies can veto any Cabinet decision. As a leader of Hezbollah often reminds us, this group's mission is the defeat of Israel. The international community needs to more fully empower our allies in Lebanon, not only with military aid but also with the resources to undermine Hezbollah's appeal - better schools, hospitals, roads and power generation and the like. We simply cannot afford to cede Lebanon's future to Syria and Iran.
And we have an additional task; in the summer of 2006 Hamas and Hezbollah kidnapped - kidnapped three young Israelis, Gilad Shalit, Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser. And they've held them ever since. I met with the families of two of these men in December 2006 and heard firsthand about their ordeal. I committed then to bring attention to their situation, to insist that the Geneva Conventions are observed and call for the swift release of these men.
These men are being unlawfully held and they must be set free and--and returned home to Israel. 
Another great - matter of great importance to the security of both America and Israel is Iraq. You would never know from listening to those who are still caught up in angry arguments over yesterday's options but our troops in Iraq have made hard-one progress under General Petraeus' new strategy. And Iraqi political leaders have moved ahead slowly and insufficiently but forward nonetheless. Sectarian violence declined dramatically; Sunnis in Anbar Province and throughout Iraq are cooperating in the fight against Al Qaeda and Shia extremist militias no longer control Basra. The Malaki government and its forces are in charge. Al Qaeda terrorists are on the run and our troops are going to make sure that they never - never come back.
It's worth recalling that America's progress in Iraq is the direct result of the new strategy that Senator Obama vehemently opposed. It was the strategy he predicted would fail when he voted to cut off funds for our forces in Iraq. He now says he intends to withdraw combat troops from Iraq one to two brigades per month until they're all removed. He will do so regardless of the conditions in Iraq, regardless of the consequences for our national security, regardless of Israel's security and in disregard of the best advice of our Commander's on the ground. This course will result in a catastrophe. If our troops are ordered to make a forced retreat we risk all out civil war genocide and a failed state in the heart of the Middle East. 
Al Qaeda terrorists would rejoice in the defeat of the United States; allowing a potential terrorist sanctuary would profoundly affect the security of the United States, Israel, and our other friends and would invite further intervention from Iraq's neighbors, including a very much emboldened Iran.
We must not let this happen. We must not leave the region to suffer chaos, terrorist violence, and a wider war. My friends, as the people of Israel know better than most, the safety of free people can never be taken for granted. And in a world full of dangers, Israel and the United States must always stand together.
The State of Israel stands as a singular achievement in many ways and not the least is its achievement as the great democracy of the Middle East. If there are ties between America and Israel that critics of our alliance have never understood perhaps that's because they do not fully understand the love of liberty and the pursuit of justice. But they should know--they should know those ties cannot be broken. We were brought together by shared ideals and by shared adversity; we have been comrades in struggle and trusted partners in the quest for peace. We are the most natural of allies and like Israel itself - that alliance is forever. Thank you.

<title>Leftist groups gather in Tel Aviv to protest 41 years of occupation</title>
<date>Sun Jun 08 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Assorted left-wing groups on Saturday gathered in Tel Aviv for a protest marking Israel's 41-year occupation of Palestinian land, which began when Israel conquered in the Six-Day War in June  1967.
Members of Gush Shalom, the Hadash political party, the Committee against House Demolition, Anarchists against the Wall concluded their march at Meir Park, which Friday was the starting point for Tel Aviv's 11th annual Gay Pride parade. The protesters were joined by representatives from the Coalition of Women for Peace, the Communist Youth League of Israel and the Socialist struggle movement.
"We demonstrate here against the occupation, against the war, against the unjustified reign over a foreign people - the people of Palestine," said Or Shay, a member of the Communist youth league.  
The march itself departed from a nearby meeting point and protesters of all ages marched under police escort to the park.
Gush Shalom spokesman Adam Keller, one of the event's organizers, drew a parallel with between the situation of Palestinians in the West Bank and that of Black South Africans under Apartheid.
"When I look at the [West Bank] roads which are only for Israelis, I would say this is a specific apartheid feature which did not exist actually in apartheid South Africa, but it could have been.  It is certainly fitting with the mindset of apartheid."
In an unusual step, the march was followed by small discussion groups. According to Keller, "We decided that it is better that we have circles where everybody could express his or her opinion rather than a rally where we have a few speakers who make speeches and then everybody claps and goes."
Despite the overall peaceful nature of the rally, marchers did face some opposition to their protest. According to one demonstrator, a woman told him "you're sick. Go do this march at the kibbutzim that are now being bombed in the south."

<title>Lieberman to Carter: Meeting Meshal will only heighten terror</title>
<date>Wed Apr 16 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Yisrael Beiteinu Chairman Avigdor Lieberman on Wednesday urged former U.S. president Jimmy Carter to cancel his plans to meet with Hamas' exiled leader Khaled Meshal, saying such talks would only heighten terror.
During their talks Wednesday, Lieberman presented Carter with his program for territorial exchange, which calls for the transfer of land and their local populations as the optimal solution for peace.
According to an associate of Lieberman, Carter seemed interested by the idea of realigning borders according to population. In response to Carter's question concerning the fate of Arabs not living by the border, Lieberman said: "Whoever declares their faith in the state can remain here and those that do not cannot."
Carter said that he was pleased to have had the opportunity to meet with Lieberman, adding that he had come to the region to hear all sides of the conflict. No further details were released on the meeting.
Aside from Lieberman, President Shimon Peres and Shas leader Eli Yishai are the only senior Israeli leaders to have met with Carter. Other Israeli officials have shunned the former U.S. president over his contacts with the Islamist group.
Meanwhile, Hamas said on Wednesday that Carter would meet two of its leaders from Gaza in Egypt, in further defiance of Israeli leaders.
Hamas official Ayman Taha told Reuters senior leaders Mahmoud al-Zahar and Saeed Seyam would travel to Cairo later in the day for talks with Carter, who began a Middle East visit on Sunday.
"Mr. Carter asked for the meeting. He wanted to hear the Hamas vision regarding the situation, and we are interested in clarifying our position and emphasising the rights of our people," Taha said.
Carter's delegation in Israel declined to comment.
Carter had wanted to visit the Gaza Strip, which is governed by Hamas, but Israel rejected his request.
All the border crossings between Israel and the Gaza Strip are controlled by Israel. Egyptian forces are stationed at Gaza's southern border, which is usually closed.
On Tuesday, in the occupied West Bank, Carter met Nasser Shaer, who served as deputy prime minister in the Hamas-led government that the United States and other Western powers boycotted.
Hamas, which took control of the Gaza Strip by force in June from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah faction, has rejected Western demands to recognize Israel, renounce violence and accept existing Israeli-Palestinian interim peace deals.
Carter has angered the Israeli government with plans to meet Hamas' top leader, Khaled Meshal, in Syria, and by describing Israeli policy in the occupied Palestinian territories as "a system of apartheid" in a 2006 book.
Carter, a broker of Israel's 1979 peace treaty with Egypt, met Israel's ceremonial president Shimon Peres on Sunday but was shunned by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and other policymakers.
Carter stressed he was not acting during his current regional visit as negotiator or mediator but that he hoped, "just as a communicator", to relay to leaders of the United States what Hamas and Syria have to say.
Shaer said he and Carter had discussed efforts to broker an unofficial truce between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.
He said Carter had also voiced a desire to help in trying to end the enmity between Hamas and Fatah.
Israel and Washington have sought to isolate Hamas and bolster Abbas, who has entered U.S.-backed peace talks with Olmert.
Like Israel, the Bush administration opposes Carter's planned meeting with Meshal.

Moishe Smith of Ottawa, Canada, is the first non-U.S. citizen elected president of B'nai B'rith International
Smith has long focused on B'nai B'rith's public policy arena and has developed expertise on a broad range of issues. He led B'nai B'rith Canada's first-ever mission to the Soviet Union; served as Chair of the International Council of B'nai B'rith; Vice Chair of the Center forHuman Rights and Public Policy; and for many years served as a member of the B'nai B'rith Delegation to the World Zionist Organization.
Before being named President of BBI, Smith completed two terms as Chairman of the Executive. He also served two consecutive two-year terms as a Senior International Vice President. Professionally, Smith is in the food and hospitality industry, with restaurants across Canada and headquarters in Ottawa.  Smith also sits on the board of the Ottawa Food Bank, the Ottawa Tourism & Convention Association, the Ottawa Restaurant Association, and the Canada Israel Committee.
Readers can send questions to: rosnersdomain@haaretz.co.il
Last one, also from a reader:
Please see that he gets it.
Dear Mr. Smith,
Do you see anti-Semitism in North America as a problem - or is it mostly something of the past (clearly, europe is another story).
Thank you,
Ravi Tal
Mr. Tal, thank you for raising this important issue.
We all see, on a regular basis, horrific examples of antisemitic inEurope, indeed, in many parts of the world.  North America is not immuneto this rising tide of hate.
We have seen a significant increase in anti-Israel rhetoric andactivities as of late.  And, anti-Israel activities often turnantisemitic.
College campuses are a case in point. Anti-Israel bias turned toantisemitism at Concordia University in Canada.  The recent speech byIranian President Ahmadinejad at Columbia University in New York alsofanned the flames of hate.
Did you know that February 3-9 is Israel Apartheid Week around theworld?  Again, it's only a short leap from anti-Israel sentiment toantisemitism.
In communities around North America, Jewish cemeteries have beendesecrated, synagogues have been defaced, and antisemitic graffiti hasshowered the streets.  All are more common than they have been indecades. These days, no part of the world is immune to antisemitism.
What are we doing about this? It is the goal of B'nai B'rithInternational to use education programs, like Diverse Minds YouthWriting Challenge and Enlighten America essay contests to teach tolerance to the next generation.
On college campuses, we are taking direct action through a joint programwith Alpha Epsilon Pi (AEPi), a historically Jewish fraternity; KappaAlpha Psi, a historically African-American fraternity; and B'nai B'rith.A Black-Jewish Relations series of programs will be coming to a numberof U.S. campuses this spring to forge understanding, foster ongoingrelationships, and build on similarities rather than differences.
B'nai B'rith International continues to identify and undermine acts ofintolerance and antisemitism in North America and around the world.  Ourwork in support of tolerance and human rights continues at theOrganization of American States (OAS), the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE), the United Nations, and before theCanadian and U.S. governments.  Unfortunately, our work is far fromdone.
Moishe
Another one, this time from a reader:
Dear Mr. Smith,
Excuse me for this question, but what exactly is the role of B'nai Brith today and why to we still need it? I have the impression that there are more Jewish organizations working for Jews than there are Jews. Aren't abolishing organizations a part of this "new definition" we need for the Jewish world?
I know this might be a provocative question to ask you, and do not expect that you agree with me. But please, help me understand your point of view.
Thank you,
Gabriel Goold
Thank you Gabriel, for asking a truly important question. It'll allow meto talk about an organization that I've been deeply involved in for morethan 25 years. And to address the very real issue of the relevancy ofB'nai B'rith, 165 years after it was founded.
First off, B'nai B'rith has been a ground breaking humanitarian, humanrights, and advocacy organization since 1843.  Jewish unity is just asimportant today as when a group of German immigrants established B'naiB'rith to help Jewish widows and orphans. Today, BBI's reach extends tomore than 50 countries around the world. That's no small feat. In someplaces, the small Jewish community of Uruguay comes to mind, B'naiB'rith serves as the link to the broader Jewish community, and alsoprovides an umbrella to shield and protect a small Jewish population.
Today, B'nai B'rith, as it has since its inception, fights againstantisemitism and anti-Israel bias. We do this on our own, througheducational programs, and within a broader coalition of Jewish groups.Sometimes, teaming up with other Jewish organizations gives us a biggervoice.
And that actually leads to your comment, "I have the impression that here are more Jewish organizations working for Jews than there are Jews."
That's an interesting way to see things. But what I see is a wonderful array of Jewish groups, each with its own unique and important mission. Sure we overlap on some topics, such as fighting antisemitism. But there are so many issues central not just to the Jewish community, but to the broader global community, that different Jewish groups specialize in.
Having a wide range of Jewish groups concentrating on a wide range of subjects ensures lots of Jewish voices get heard. There's a home for every opinion. And this ensures the Jewish community stays vital in the world. I don't think "abolishing" Jewish organizations, as you put it, would or should be a part of any plan that could help Jews the world over. We are a small community, constantly having to watch our backs. Yet thanks to the dedicated work of so many Jewish groups, we not only look after our most basic issue - our survival - but we can also focus on helping our own community and helping others.
So back to what we do and why it's important. Another critical role wefill is providing senior housing and advocacy on issues of concern toseniors and their families. BBI is the largest national Jewish sponsorof senior housing in the United States and operates nearly 50 fixed-income and market rate housing facilities worldwide. The United States government has even suggested our senior housing experts to foreign governments trying to deal with their own issues of senior housing.
We meet with law makers on a regular basis to ensure senior issues,especially pertaining to healthcare, are front and center. BBI bringsprograms and services to seniors and gives them the opportunity to takecontrol of their own futures.
Helping communities in crisis is an often overlooked, yet criticalresource we provide.  B'nai B'rith has been engaged in disaster reliefsince 1865.  Our Disaster Relief Fund has provided aid to populationsaffected by natural and man-made catastrophes around the world. Ourdisaster relief is on a different scale and with a different focus thanthat of organizations such as the Red Cross. Our focus is to help acommunity get back on its feet, after immediate disaster relief groupshave tended to immediate needs of food and shelter, and have left. B'naiB'rith continues to rebuild houses in New Orleans. We donated money tosynagogues and churches to help worshippers get back something importantto their spiritual needs. That's an ongoing commitment we make tocommunities. After the tsunami in Southeast Asia, we helped fundbusiness cooperatives so residents could learn a new trade, or have aplace to continue the line of work they already knew before the tsunamihit. After the fall 2007 earthquake in Peru, we sent medical teams tohelp people with ongoing medical issues.
In world affairs, B'nai B'rith has a big voice at the United Nations.BBI has served as an NGO (non governmental organization) at the UnitedNations since its inception. In fact, B'nai B'rith is the only Jewishorganization with an office dedicated exclusively to United Nationsaffairs. We meet with ambassadors and world leaders and give a voice toJewish communities and concerns.
Our World Center in Jerusalem serves as our eyes and ears in Israel.It's the voice of the B'nai B'rith community to the Israeli government.We provided books to Israel Defense Forces soldiers in 2006, so whenthey had a small break from the war in Lebanon, they had a positivedistraction. This is one way we are making a difference in Israel.
But of course, this organization is only as strong its members andsupporters. The only way a group as old and established as B'nai B'rithcan continue to grow and thrive, and can continue to further the Jewishcause, and pursue humanitarian issues and human rights, and stayrelevant, is to seek input and ideas from people - from both within andoutside our organization.
Gabriel, you demonstrated with your question how high the bar is forB'nai B'rith and how important it is to hear from the community atlarge. Thank you.
--Moishe
Dear Moishe,
And what will Israel have to do if it wants to play a role in this new partnership?
SR
Hi shmuel,
For such a partnership to work, Israel and the Diaspora both havecrucial roles to play.
The Diaspora must remain connected to Israel - the home for all Jews.One way B'nai B'rith keeps open the dialogue between young people fromthe U.S. and from Israel is through our Camp Passport program. Each ofthe past five summers, Israeli children have attended one of two B'naiB'rith summer camps, all expenses paid. The program allows Israelichildren between the ages of 10 and 16 who have been directly affectedby terrorism to recapture a bit of their childhood, while they learnabout American Jewish children, and in turn teach American kids aboutlife in Israel.  Summer camp, a rite of passage for many American kids,takes on an important context when Israeli children take part. Theprogram, heading into its sixth summer, enables American children andIsraeli children to learn about each other in a casual atmosphere.
Another wonderful partnership that we can talk about is the Birthrightprogram. Sending young Americans to Israel to see and feel first-handwhat Jews fight so hard for everyday is a brilliant program. But the twoweeks Americans spend there can't be the end of it. Many young Jews comeback feeling very connected to Israel, but that quickly wanes. We mustcapitalize on those feelings. We can encourage on-going discussiongroups with those who have visited Israel to keep their attachmentalive. And perhaps there can be a reverse Birthright -- where Israeliyoung people can visit other Jewish communities around the world tolearn how Jews outside of Israel celebrate their heritage and culture.
We can encourage modern-day pen-pals- through email, of course - whereyoung Israelis are paired with young Americans and they can learn aboutday-to-day life in each other's countries.
Of course the government of Israel must be engaged in the educationprocess as well for such a partnership to work. Perhaps some sectionscould be added to the school curriculum to really show Israeli youth howDiaspora Jews helped in the creation of Israel. Seeing that Jews aroundthe world marched to establish the Jewish state, raised money forIsrael's defence, and sent people to visit - many of whom ended upmaking aliyah, could be "news" to today's young Israelis. Israeli youthcan learn how American candidates for high office seek out the Jewishcommunity as a vital support network.
I am fortunate that in my position as B'nai B'rith Internationalpresident, I get to travel throughout Israel and meet a wide range ofIsraelis, from government leaders to victims of terror attacks. I havelearned from my trips that Israelis have a keen understanding of howdeeply American Jews are attached to the Holy Land. 
Moishe
Dear Moishe,
Let's expand this discussion by asking the following question: 
It appears that the Jewish Diaspora, especially the younger generation, is moving away from Israel. Do you think there's a need for a new definition of the relations between the communities - maybe a new covenant - and what should it be?
Best
Rosner
Shmuel, I'm glad you brought this issue up.
Attracting the next generation to all things Jewish is a problem for every Jewish organization and the Diaspora communities generally: Attachment to Holocaust remembrance, to synagogues, to Jewish philanthropy and indeed to Israel are all issues of concern.
I believe the next generation views Israel as a strong, vibrant country, yet they have no attachment to the pioneering enterprise that helped build Israel into the strong country that it is today. I also don?t think that young people have a good understanding of the obstacles Israelis face in their daily lives. That?s where the disconnect is.
The concepts of aliyah and Zionism are not as palatable for them as they were for my generation.
The Diaspora must remain connected to Israel ? the home for all Jews. 
I think a new partnership is in order. We can do this by assisting constantly and consistently with those who want to make aliyah. We must also undertake an educational process that encourages the next generation to forge strong Diaspora communities.
We should aim to introduce cross-cultural partnerships on a large scale. This would inspire younger people to advocate on behalf of Israel -- a concept that I would call modern Zionism.
Dear Moishe,
In a recent poll conducted by BBI
Do you agree with this position of the majority of Israelis? Do you see any role that Diaspora Jews should be playing in the discussion over the future of Jerusalem? What should it be?
Thank you,
Shmuel
Thank you for inviting me to participate in this conversation, Shmuel. I appreciate the opportunity.
The B'nai B'rith International poll that you are referring to yielded some very thought-provoking results on a variety of topics, and I found the poll results very interesting.
On the particular question that you ask, I believe that the Jewish community in the Diaspora has been committed to a united Jerusalem for decades. While I respect the views of the citizens of Israel, Jerusalem is central to the being of every Jew, wherever they live.
Israel isn't a country unlike any other. Israel as a country hasstakeholders, not only from within the country, but from outside the country - all over the world.
While the ultimate decision will be in the hands of the citizens ofIsrael, we in the Diaspora not only want to express our opinion, we have a right and indeed a duty to have an opinion.
Moishe
Moishe,
I need a follow up on this one: everybody has the right to an opinion on any matter. The question, though, is whether you expect your opinion to have some impact on decisions made by the Israeli government.
If you - what impact, and how do you expect this to happen?
SR
A good follow-up question, Shmuel.
We hope Diaspora Jews have some impact on decisions, or at least on the thought-processes that Israeli Jews are using to make decisions about Israel and Jerusalem. Though Diaspora Jews of course don't live in Israel, we support Israel, emotionally and financially. It's the homeland of all Jews.
How this impact could happen could be through talking with Israelis, sharing our ideas, meeting with officials to share our ideas. Also perhaps, by holding information forums in the Diaspora communities, where Israeli government officials, Israeli citizens, and Diaspora Jewry all have an opportunity to exchange ideas, so that we all could understand one another's opinions.
I am convinced that the citizens of Israel and the Jews of the Diaspora are on the same page when it comes to the future of Israel and Jerusalem.
The final decision is still in the hands of our brothers and sisters inIsrael. We just need to be part of the debate.
Moishe

South African writer Nadine Gordimer on Tuesday defended her decision to attend a writers conference in Israel next month, saying that her "comrades" should have no doubts about her "solidarity with the struggle - our struggle - against apartheid."
Gordimer noted that her invitation came not from the Israeli government but from Mishkenot Sha'ananim. About 15 foreign and 40 Israeli writers are expected to attend the mid-May five-day gathering.  
The 1991 Nobel Prize for Literature laureate had been under enormous pressure at home and abroad to boycott the conference. Last weekend she said she decided to attend after arranging to meet with Palestinians as well as Israelis.  
Her remarks Tuesday came in a statement she released from her Johannesburg home. Gordimer, a longtime supporter of the African National Congress and an outspoken critic of Israeli policies, suggested that the purpose of the festival "is to assert vitally that whatever violent, terrible, bitter and urgent chasms of conflict lie between peoples, the only solutions for peace and justice exist and must begin with both sides talking to one another."  
Acknowledging that Hamas denies "the right of Israel to exist," Gordimer nonetheless said it must be part of the solution. She urged the Palestinian Islamist movement not to forget "that Nelson Mandela went, was escorted from and returned to Pollsmore Prison, for a face-to-face meeting with apartheid president P.W. Botha." 
She reminded those urging her to boycott the festival of her endorsements of Ronnie Kasrils' 'Not in our name'" statement. The December 2001 letter by the Jewish cabinet minister and former ANC rebel was signed by "South Africans of Jewish descent." It said "the root cause" of the second intifada was Israel's occupation of the territories and urged Israel to renew negotiations with the Palestinians.  
Gordimer's letter noted that she will visit Ramallah and meet in Jerusalem with students at the Palestinian Al-Quds University. She ended it by stating, "I shall do my utmost to uphold the principles and practice I have held, and still hold, at home in our country."

<title>New laws would revoke terrorists' citizenship </title>
<date>Wed Jul 09 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Israeli Arabs and their families could be deprived of citizenship if involved in terrorism, under legislation the Knesset approved in a preliminary reading yesterday.   
The six bills ban terrorists' families from setting up mourning tents and similar displays, and two also revoke former MK Azmi Bishara's pension benefits.  
The vote came hours after a Palestinian man went on a deadly rampage in downtown Jerusalem, ramming a bulldozer into a crowded bus and a string of vehicles, killing at least four people and wounding dozens.  
"Look what bills were approved today," said Balad faction whip Jamal Zahalka. "A racist fever is washing over the Knesset. It is hurtling down the slope toward open apartheid and racism is becoming the law."  
Hadash chairman Mohammad Barakeh said "the Knesset operates like a kangaroo court."   
The six bills were proposed by MKs Yuli Edelstein (Likud) and Nissan Slomiansky (National Union-National Religious Party), and were approved by an overwhelming majority in the Knesset.  
Slomiansky proposed granting the interior minister the authority to revoke the permanent residency of East Jerusalem residents involved in terror and those of their families.   
"There is a limit to how far democracy does. It is shocking that a person is given a blue [Israeli] ID card and he uses it to carry out terror attacks," he said.  
Edelstein's proposal suggests that the citizenship or permanent residency of any person participating in terrorist acts against Israel should be revoked. Edelstein said that this amendment must be made "once and for all."   
The legislative ministerial committee had originally planned not to approve this bill, however in the wake of yesterday's terror attack, the cabinet chose to refrain from taking a stance.  
The police said that yesterday's terror attack perpetrator was a resident of East Jerusalem and had a blue ID card. He also had a criminal record.  
The bills denying Bishara's pension were presented by MKs Zvi Hendel, Yitzhak Levy and Effi Eitam (National Union).

Gordimer confirms J'lem festival attendance 
Nadine Gordimer has confirmed she will participate in the International Writer's Festival in Jerusalem next month, allaying concerns that she would cancel due to political pressure. The 84-year-old South African Nobel laureate had warned festival organizers last week that she would cancel unless they arranged meetings for her with Palestinians. She reportedly said her attendance was perceived at home as support for apartheid in Israel. "She will meet with Sari Nusseibeh, with students from Al-Quds University, travel to Ramallah with [Meretz MK] Haim Oron, and meet with Robi Damelin of the Parents Circle organization of bereaved Palestinian and Israeli families," festival director Yael Nahari said.

F-16-Is cleared to fly after carcinogen scare 
The Israel Air Force renewed flights of its F-16-Is yesterday, after the entire fleet of the fighter jets had been grounded for the past five weeks. IAF commander Elyezer Shkedy ordered the grounding after carcinogenic formaldehyde was discovered leaking into cockpits - concentrations above allowed limits were found in seven planes. The IDF said these planes would remain grounded until the problem was solved. All F-16-I pilots were summoned for medical tests, and told the IAF said the risk-level is very low. (Yuval Azoulay)   
Undercover cop busts W. Bank drug ring 
An undercover police agent has broken up a drug ring operating in West Bank settlements. Fifteen suspects were arrested. The agent, a 26-year-old Jerusalem woman with a bachelor's degree in criminology, has been working with the police since August, gaining the trust of the suspects and eventually buying drugs from them for what she told them was personal use. The suspects were arrested yesterday in Ma'aleh Adumim, Ariel, and settlements in Gush Etzion and the Benyamin area. (Jonathan Lis)   
Knesset okays funds for reinforced rooms 
The Knesset Finance Committee approved a request by the Finance Ministry to transfer NIS 277 million from the state budget for the construction of reinforced rooms for homes in communities around the Gaza Strip. Among the three opposition members of the committee present at the meeting yesterday who approved the outlay, MK Stas Misezhnikov (Yisrael Beiteinu) said that with people's security and livelihood so adversely affected, "there are no considerations of coalition and opposition."

Chief of staff to join 'March of the Living' 
Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi is to fly to Poland tonight to visit Holocaust commemoration sites and meet with the heads of the Polish Jewish community. He will also meet with the Polish defense minister and Polish army's chief of staff. On Thursday, Holocaust Memorial Day, Ashkenazi will lead the 10,000-strong March of the Living. It is the first time an IDF chief of staff has taken part in the event. Yesterday, the General Staff attended a Holocaust seminar at Kibbutz Lohamei Hageta'ot, where Ashkenazi said the IDF was responsible for ensuring that the Holocaust never happens again.

MI chief: Terrorists trained in Syria, Iran infiltrate Gaza  
Military Intelligence chief Amos Yadlin said yesterday that terrorists trained in Syria and Iran infiltrated the Gaza Strip while the border between Gaza and Egypt was breached last month. Major General Yadlin said the militants had undergone workshops and intensive training in all military areas. Presenting the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee with a general security assessment, Yadlin said large amounts of money and ammunition also made their way into Gaza during the 12 days the border was breached. (Shahar Ilan)  
More than 1,200 refugees are expected to arrive in Israel over the next month, more than 12 times the number who entered last February, Population Registrar head Ya'akov Ganot told the Kneseet's Committee on Foreign Workers yesterday. Some 880 people illegally entered Israel from Egypt in January, about 11 times as many as in January 2007. Some 7,500 crossed over in the past year. "At the current rate, we will pass the 12,000 mark by the end of the year," Ganot said. (Shahar Ilan)  
Israel Defense Forces troops killed a Palestinian farmer near the Gaza Strip border yesterday, his relatives and hospital officials said. The IDF said the man was an armed militant. An IDF spokeswoman said a tank unit spotted a Palestinian planting a bomb at Gaza's periphery patrol road near the Kissufim border crossing, and shot him. The man was brought to a Palestinian hospital, where he died. Relatives said he had been working his land when he was shot. (Reuters)  
A report commissioned by the United Nations suggests that Palestinian terrorism is the inevitable consequence of Israeli occupation and laws that resemble South African apartheid - a claim Israel rejected yesterday. The report by South African lawyer John Dugard, for the UN Human Rights Council, says, "Common sense ... dictates that a distinction must be drawn between acts of mindless terror, such as acts committed by Al-Qaida, and acts committed in the course of a war of national liberation against colonialism, apartheid or military occupation."

<title>Noam Shalit: The fact that Carter isn't pro-Israel may be beneficial</title>
<date>Sun Apr 13 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Noam Shalit, the father of Israel Defense Forces soldier Gilad Shalit who was captured by Hamas in June 2006, said Sunday after meeting with former U.S. president Jimmy Carter that the fact that Carter is not considered pro-Israel could be beneficial in securing his son's release. 
"This could help him reach certain people and raise certain ideas that may be received with suspicion coming from someone more pro-Israel," Shalit said after the Jerusalem meeting, Army Radio reported.
Rumors had been circulating over recent weeks that Carter was planning to meet with Damascus-based Hamas political leader Khaled Meshal as he travels to Syria later in the week. 
Shalit met with the former president in hopes that the latter may be able to help secure the captive soldier's freedom, perhaps at his meeting with Hamas leaders. 
Shalit described the meeting as positive, and told Haaretz he asked Carter to help advance the deal to release his son. However, Shalit provided no further details on the matter and would not say whether he asked the former president to pass on a message to Meshal.
Carter, broker of the first Israeli-Arab peace treaty, arrived in Israel Sunday on a peace mission to the region only to receive a cool reception: Israeli leaders are shunning him for accusing Israel of apartheid and for planning to meet with the head of the violently anti-Israel Hamas group.
A schedule released by the U.S.-based Carter Center showed no plans for the former president to meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni or Defense Minister Ehud Barak during this week's visit in Israel.
"Scheduling problems" was the official reason given, a senior Israeli official said - even though Olmert recently took time from his busy schedule to chat with Wentworth Miller of the U.S. TV drama, Prison Break. Olmert's office declined comment.
What is really behind the cold shoulder is Carter's plan to meet with Khaled Meshal, the Israeli official said. "Israeli leaders are not publicly criticizing Carter out of respect for his former position as U.S. president," he added.
In remarks to air Sunday on ABC News' "This Week" Carter said that his upcoming visit to the Middle East will probably include a meeting in Syria with leaders of the militant group Hamas.
"I've not confirmed our itinerary yet for the Syrian visit, but it's likely that I will be meeting with the Hamas leaders," Carter said, bolstering the rumors that he was planning to meet Meshal. 
Ahead of his arrival in Israel, Carter said he feels quite at ease about meeting Hamas militants.
"I think there's no doubt in anyone's mind that if Israel is ever going to find peace with justice concerning the relationship with their next-door neighbors, the Palestinians, that Hamas will have to be included in the process," Carter said.
Hamas is sworn to Israel's destruction and has carried out dozens of suicide bombings that have killed more than 250 Israelis. Israel has no contacts with the Islamic militant group, whose violent takeover of the Gaza Strip in June has undercut newly revived efforts by Israel and the Palestinians to strike a final peace deal.
Peres tells Carter he has damaged peace process
The most prominent Israeli to meet with Carter during his visit was President Shimon Peres, Israel's ceremonial head of state, and a Nobel peace laureate for his role in the historic 1993 accord between Israel and the Palestinians. 
Sources at the President's residence reported that during their meeting, Peres sharply rebuked Carter over his last book, in which he called Israel an apartheid state. 
Peres told Carter that despite the former president's many achievements in advancing peace during the Camp David era, his activity in recent years has caused grave damage to Israel and to the peace process. 
The meeting between the two men was low-key and representatives from the media were not invited to document the event. 
Carter also met with the parents of abducted soldier Gilad Shalit, who were planning to give him a message to pass on to Hamas.
Carter was also scheduled to meet with several Israeli lawmakers, and was planning to visit Sderot, the southern Israeli town most frequently targeted by Gaza rocket squads.
Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work in mediating conflicts, while president and under the auspices of The Carter Center. In 1978, he brokered the landmark accord between Egypt and Israel, for which Egypt's Anwar Sadat and Israel's Menachem Begin were awarded that year's Nobel Peace Prize.
But the goodwill Carter earned here through that agreement was all but swept away two years ago with the publication of his controversial book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid" which equates the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories with the racial segregation and oppression that once reigned in South Africa.
Jewish groups and some fellow Democrats strongly objected to the book and more than a dozen members of the Carter Center's advisory board resigned in protest.
In a later afterword to his book, Carter criticized the lack of balanced debate in the United States about the Middle East and warned officials against being seen as knee-jerk supporters of every action or policy of the Israeli government.
"For the past two to three years, Carter has embarked upon a crusade of hate against Israel," Uzi Arad, an adviser to parliamentary opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu, told Israel Radio.
"There is no doubt that Jimmy Carter as a former president should be greeted as a matter of protocol, but it does not mean that the prime minister, the foreign minister and certainly the opposition leader have to meet him," Arad said.
In addition to Israel, Carter is scheduled to visit the West Bank, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Carter will not be visiting Hamas-ruled Gaza.
A Carter-Meshal meeting would be the first public contact between a prominent American figure and Hamas officials since The Rev. Jesse Jackson met with Mashaal in Syria in 2006.
The U.S. lists Hamas as a terrorist organization, and on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice criticized Carter
"I find it hard to understand what is going to be gained by having discussions with Hamas about peace when Hamas is, in fact, the impediment to peace," Rice said.
The State Department says it twice advised Carter against meeting any Hamas representative.

<title>Nobel Peace Prize winner urges Obama to focus on Middle East</title>
<date>Wed Dec 10 14:37:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari urged U.S. President-elect Barack Obama on Wednesday to start his term by giving high priority to the Middle East conflict, calling it the world's most challenging peace-building project.
In his acceptance speech in Oslo, the Finnish diplomat and mediator also warned that the global financial crisis would strike hard at the developing world, and called on governments to not cut back on foreign aid.
Insisting that all conflicts can be settled, Ahtisaari said he did not share the view that the decades-long violence between Israel and Palestinians would rage indefinitely.
"Many have come to believe that the Middle East knot can never be untied. I do not share this belief," Ahtisaari said in his acceptance speech. "All crises, including the one in the Middle East, can be resolved. The solution would require a contribution from all the parties involved as well as the international community as a whole."
The 71-year-old former Finnish president was awarded what many consider the world's most coveted prize for his three decades of work mediating conflicts from Namibia to Kosovo and Indonesia. So far he has not sought a role to mediate in the Middle East.
"I hope that the new president of the United States, who will be sworn in next month, will give high priority to the Middle East conflict during his first year in office," Ahtisaari said.
In an interview with The Associated Press before the award ceremony, he criticized world leaders for not doing enough to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
"The international community and those in power are sitting there letting them destroy each other and they are allowing both parties to make their lives in the future even more complicated and difficult than it is today," he said.
In Wednesday's prepared remarks, the skilled and dogged negotiator said he could not accept religious tensions as a reason for the intractability of the bloodshed in the Middle East. "Religions," he said, "are peace-loving and can be a constructive force in solving conflicts. That also applies to Mideast peace efforts, which he called the most challenging peace-building project ahead of us."
By selecting Ahtisaari for the prize, the Nobel committee returned its focus to traditional peace work after tapping climate campaigner Al Gore and the UN panel on climate change last year.
"His efforts have been untiring, and he has achieved good results," committee chairman Ole Danbolt Mjoes said of Ahtisaari in prepared remarks. Ahtisaari was a senior Finnish diplomat when in 1977 he was named the UN envoy for Namibia, where guerrillas were battling South African apartheid rule. He later rose to undersecretary-general, and in 1988 was dispatched to Namibia to lead 8,000 UN peacekeepers during its transition to independence.
He served as Finland's president from 1994 until declining re-election in 2000, when he left politics and founded his Crisis Management Initiative, a peace mediation institute. His peace efforts continued, in Kosovo and in Indonesia, where he negotiated a 2005 peace deal between the Indonesian government and rebels in Aceh province.
Ahtisaari warned that the effects of the financial crisis could prove another major setback for poor countries already hit hard by climate change, rising food prices and declining levels of foreign trade.
"A reduction in foreign assistance and investment would be disastrous for badly needed economic growth," he said. "At this difficult time I call on all governments to remain committed to their stated goals of eradicating poverty."
The Nobel prizes are always presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of their founder, Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel. The peace prize is presented in Oslo, and the prizes in medicine, physics, chemistry, economics and literature in Stockholm, Sweden.

<title>No voice for peace </title>

On Monday, at 2 A.M., police detained eight employees of RAM FM, which broadcasts from Jerusalem and Ramallah, alleging that the station in Jerusalem was operating illegally. Transmitters and office equipment were confiscated from the Jerusalem bureau although the Ramallah station has continued broadcasting.  
The Communications Ministry stated that the station's staff were detained because of police assessments that they were operating without a license and had gone on the air without a tender.  
"The resource of [available] frequencies is currently classed as a depleted resource, and the quality of broadcasting is compromised, as there are too many [broadcast] 'suppliers' offering services. We lack the authority to decide whom to arrest," Yehiel Shalvi, the ministry's spokesman, said yesterday.   
Regarding the ongoing broadcasting from Ramallah, Shalvi said that licenses to operate radio stations there are issued by the Palestinian Authority.  
RAM FM staffers say the station operates legally, and that they are looking into the legal ramifications of the police's action.   
Jerusalem District Police spokesman Shmulik Ben-Ruby confirmed that eight of the station's personnel had been detained, among them station manager Maysoun Odeh-Gangat.  
"The Communications Ministry issued orders to shut down the station and confiscate the 'pirate' broadcasting equipment operating there.   
"We detained eight people for questioning, in accordance with new directives published by the State Prosecutor's Office and the attorney general, which state that we must deal with pirate radio stations with all the force of the law, after repeated cases of frequency interference, among other places, at Ben-Gurion Airport."   
The eight workers were released to house arrest yesterday afternoon, but the Jerusalem office remains closed and its equipment is still confiscated.   
Despite this, the station can be heard on 93.6 FM and on its Internet site, www.ramfm.net. Until Monday, everything at the Jerusalem station had seemed idyllic.   
At the entrance to the spotless building in the Malkha technology park in which the RAM FM studios are located, the strains of Keren Peles' latest hit were still playing. Eleven floors above, facing broad views of the Judean Hills, one could forget for the moment that this was Israel. As a rule, some 20 Anglo youths work in the spacious offices, established by South African millionaire Issy Kirsh in 2006.  
Kirsh is chairman of Primedia Broadcasting, and built RAM FM on the model of another station he owns, Radio 702, which operates in South Africa.   
During the apartheid era, this was the only station in which both whites and blacks were on the air.  
In its first year of operation, $2 million was invested in RAM FM, which began operating in February of last year.   
The station's declared goal is bringing people together through music.   
Recently the station mounted an outdoor advertising campaign in Israel and the Palestinian Authority with the catchphrase "music has no boundaries."   
The ads featured artists like Bob Marley and the Beatles as examples of musicians who transcended continents and cultures through their work.  
Brothers in arms - like South Africans 
 Station manager Odeh-Gangat, a 42-year old Palestinian, studied economics in France and political science in Washington. She said the station's promotional concept reflects its attempt to create a professional radio station, untainted by racism and prejudice, to forge a connection between the two peoples. The station employs local DJs, editors, and writers as well as South Africans, Australians, Brits, and Americans who, according to Odeh-Gangat, "want to be partners in what is happening in the Middle East."  
RAM FMs chief news editor Mark Klusener noted that South Africans particularly feel that in Israel "they can make use of the unique life experience they gained in South Africa."  
Odeh-Gangat met her husband Rafique Gangat, a South African of Indian descent, when he served as the South African consul-general in the Palestinian Authority. He is also an announcer on the station.  
Apart from his wife, the other staff members detained on Monday are also "under house arrest for seven days and cannot leave Jerusalem, talk to each other, anyone else or members of the media," Gangat said yesterday.  
"The reality is that if RAM FM was a pirate station, we wouldn't have invested $2 million in it, and we wouldn't have launched a massive advertising campaign. Pirate stations stay under the radar; they don't have advertising campaigns. But we know that we are legal. Both of our frequencies (93.6 and 87.7) are licensed by the Palestinian Authority and we pay for those licenses. "The Jerusalem studio and the Ramallah studio are linked by fiber optics. Everything that is produced in Jerusalem is sent back to Ramallah and broadcast from there. Nothing is actually broadcast from Jerusalem. "We feel very strongly about our mission and this has just made us more determined," he said. "The show must go on." Martin B., a blue-eyed, 33-year old Londoner, exemplifies the team of adventurous and highly-motivated young announcers who entered a fray that is foreign to them.  
B. wandered the world for a decade, appearing on radio stations in Dubai, the Canary Islands, Egypt, and other locations before arriving here.   
He now lives at the top of the hill he sees from the window of his office, and presents "The Breakfast Show," daily from 6-9 A.M. His is one of the most popular programs on the station.  
He discovered RAM FM in a want ad. "You know the feeling when you just want to be part of something? That's how I felt when I read about the station," he said. "I thought that a station like that, so unique in the region in which it operates, would leave ample room for creativity." Despite his identification with the station's agenda, B. prefers to distance himself from politics on his own program.  
"I believe that people prefer lighter content when they wake up in the morning. So I try to maintain an upbeat atmosphere on the program," he says. B. says he has hosted a variety of guests in the studio, including representatives of charitable organizations, Jewish and Arab students who attend a local high school together, and even Uri Geller.  
For now, he enjoys living in the Middle East. "I'm in a new place, meet new and interesting people, and sense enormous openness. There's also a positive feeling at the station that something exciting is happening."  
Although most programs on RAM FM refrain from direct involvement in political issues, its chief point of pride are its self-produced hourly news bulletins. "Media in Israel is commonly classified as pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian," Odeh- Gangat observed. "We try to find a balance between the two sides."  
Following the Jerusalem station's closure, B. said: "Listeners have been calling us and sending emails to express their support. This came as a surprise. There were no prior warnings." B. is now broadcasting from the station's Ramallah branch.  
A balanced viewpoint 
The station employs Israeli announcers and writers, like Mike Brand, alongside Palestinians like Arda Aghazarian, who presents a daily, lunch program with Brand. This attempt to maintain balance is also evident in the content of news bulletins.  
"We won't use a term like 'terrorist,' which is considered offensive in Palestinian eyes, nor will we use 'freedom fighter,'" said station director Odeh-Gangat, adding that the station attempts to provide in-depth coverage of issues ignored by Israeli media.  
"A few days ago, a settler killed a Palestinian near Ramallah, after he took out a knife," she said. "We immediately reported the event but later sent a reporter to Bir Zeit University, where the Palestinian was a student, to shed light on the story from a Palestinian perspective. We will always try to bring both versions of the story. We do not have a political agenda. We mainly try to present facts on the ground in the most objective way possible."  
The station concurrently strives to present a broader view of local, cultural issues. Odeh-Gangat calls such subjects, the Ramallah International Film Festival, the local water shortage, the organic food industry in Israel, and special events at Bir Zeit University, "the little things."  
The station broadcasts 24 hours a day, but plays Western hits from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s rather than Israeli or Palestinian music. Music director Kevin Lee says that the station opts for a variety of music from Madonna to Linkin Park, "but we don't play the same songs a thousand times."  
Although the station is aimed largely at Israelis and Palestinians, all broadcasts are in English. Odeh-Gangat said that the choice is part of the station's effort to be impartial. "First and foremost, market research we conducted indicated that there was a demand for an English-language station," she said.  
"Moreover, we consider English to be a neutral language. If it is the official language used to conduct peace talks between Israel and Palestine, it is good enough for us."

<title>Police close English radio aimed at Israeli-Palestinian coexistence</title>
<date>Mon Apr 07 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Police on Monday closed the Jerusalem studio of Ram FM, an English-language West Bank radio station that plays Western music in a stated mission to bring Israelis and Palestinians together. 
"We instructed the police to close the station in Jerusalem because they were broadcasting without a permit," said a Communications Ministry official. "They interfere with airwaves and endanger airport signals," he added.
The station replied in a statement that it had not broken the law.
Police shut down the transmitter and closed the studio, taking staff for questioning and hauling away equipment in Monday's raid, but the station remained on the air via its West Bank frequency 93.6.
Owned by a South African Jewish businessman, it is modeled after a South African station that provided a venue for reconciliation after apartheid. The station's tens of thousands of listeners include Palestinians, settlers and foreign diplomats, a portion of whom participate in its talkback segments.
There are numerous pirate radio stations broadcasting throughout Israel. They are often blamed for dangerous disruptions in airport air traffic communications and interference in regular radio broadcasts.

<title>Police shut J'lem studio of station promoting coexistence </title>
<date>Tue Apr 08 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Israeli police yesterday closed the Jerusalem studio and transmitter of an English-language West Bank radio station that plays Western music and tries to bring Israelis and Palestinians together through its broadcasts. The station, RAM-FM, is headquartered in Ramallah, where it broadcasts on 93.6 FM. It set up an office in Jerusalem and a local transmitter on another frequency to overcome airwave interference in the city.  
Yesterday, Israeli police shut down the transmitter and closed the studio, taking away staff for questioning and hauling away equipment. "We instructed the police to close the station in Jerusalem because they were broadcasting without a permit," said Yehiel Shalvi, a spokesman for the Israeli Communications Ministry. "They interfere with airwaves and endanger airport signals." After the raid, the station remained on the air from the West Bank as usual.  
RAM-FM is owned by Jewish businessman Issy Kirsh in South Africa and has been on the air for a year. Modeled after a South African station that provided a venue for reconciliation after apartheid, RAM-FM says it wants to create a safe place for Israelis and Palestinians to talk.

<title>Prof. Sternhell: Supporters of occupation are not Zionist</title>
<date>Mon Sep 29 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Professor Zeev Sternhell's house on Jerusalem's Agnon Street is easily located by the iron gate with the broken glass. Sternhell says the bombing could have ended with him having to have both legs amputated.  
Fortunately, last Thursday night he and his wife Ziva had returned from abroad and their suitcases, left in the narrow hallway, separated him and the pipe bomb that had been attached to the door.  
The living room is filled with flowers and the telephone doesn't stop ringing. The news is quoting ministers' statements from the cabinet meeting.  
Sternhell, while still in the hospital, drew a direct line between the state's surrender to the extreme right rampaging in the territories and the terrorist or organization that tried to kill him.  
"What are those ministers talking about," he asks, when Vice Premier Haim Ramon blasts the government on the television news for fearing "those hooligans," as Ramon called them.  
Sternhell: "Who has to deal with the outposts? Me? You? Who's to blame for the semi-autonomous state in the territories? Groups of settlers do whatever they feel like. Police officers and reserve soldiers go home with broken arms. How did they let things deteriorate to this lack of control in the West Bank? I told my students that not intervening for a weak child who needs help against a strong child is intervening for the strong child. Whoever fails to enforce the law and protect the Palestinians from the settlers who attack them is cooperating with the hooligans and lawbreakers."  
The settlers argue that they are the weak child. Especially since the evacuation of the Gaza Strip.  
"I understand exactly what it's like to be a refugee and I'm sorry the Gush Katif settlers were not allowed to build a new life within the Green Line. [But] every time the government takes a step in the right direction, like pulling out of Gaza, it hastens to console the settlers and promise them this will go no further.  
"I'm suggesting an alternative to exclusive ownership of the land that justifies occupation. It would be based on a rational view of universal rights, especially the right to liberty and dignity, including for the Palestinians. This is the social-democratic approach that shaped 20th century Europe. It would strengthen Zionism, unlike the insistence on exclusivity over all the Land of Israel which rejects the other's rights, undermines the Zionist ideal, and is a proven prescription for disaster."  
Are the extreme right wing and settlers anti-Zionists?  
"Certainly. The right wing advocating the greater Israel is the real post-Zionist body. Whoever supports the occupation, i.e. a binational state, is no Zionist. This could also be said of politicians who drag their feet in negotiations intended to bring about a two-state solution for two nations. They're putting off this solution to the unforeseeable future, endangering the Jewish state's future."  
Will you use the bombing to increase your influence?  
"My job is to criticize. I have no intention of returning to politics. I'm glad my injury shocked the cabinet and Knesset. But what remains of [prime minister Yitzhak] Rabin's murder, which caused a much greater shock? A one-day annual festival.  
The politicians must declare war on the extreme right and occupation - that's the swamp where those mosquitoes breed. Otherwise they won't even be a footnote in history."  
As a member of the Zionist left and a historian specializing in 20th century fascism, are you pleased with the role of the Israeli left in the confrontation with the right?  
"The Israeli left has made no political mark. It has good people, like [MK] Ophir Pines and [Education Minister] Yuli Tamir, but they have no impact on their party. No one is trying to shape the future of war and peace, or of social progress. Instead, the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker, even as the free market's mythology is crumbling around us and begging for state intervention to save it. This is the very moment when the left should rear up and proclaim its difference, remind us that the rightist ideology is a total failure and delivers only political, social and economic disaster. A left-wing party worthy of the name should be shouting from the rooftops by now."  
In an interview with Haaretz six months ago you said your children's and grandchildren's future did not seem secure.  
"I fear that unless an immediate change takes place, in 50 years my granddaughters will have no reason to live here. If we're doomed to be a minority in a multinational state, why live in Tel Aviv rather than California? For that I had to sacrifice so much? Our grandchildren will not understand the justification for the colonial reality here. That's the greatest danger to our society.  
"Despite the difficulties my generation has experienced, we were always accompanied by the hope of a better future. My students don't have the feeling that next year will be better, they feel that tomorrow is not safe. We believed we were going in the right way, that justice was on our side.  
"Today young people's conviction of that is crumbling. Occupation is rotting our society. The terrible violence in the territories is spilling over the Green Line. This is inevitable - different standards and laws for different people cannot exist without affecting all of society. I'm not seeking absolute justice, only an end to building a de facto apartheid, only to ensure the creation of a society that future generations will not be ashamed of."

<title>Pro-peace West Bank radio station closes down due to lack of funding</title>
<date>Mon Aug 11 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
A West Bank radio station that sought to bring Israelis and Palestinians together to the tune of easy-listening rock music has gone of the air because of a lack of funding.
RAM-FM had been broadcasting English-language talk shows and artists like Michael Bolton and Air Supply from a studio in the town of Ramallah since last year. An official from the station confirmed Monday it went off the air last week.
In a statement, the station said it was unable to generate sufficient advertising revenues to sustain its ongoing operation.
Owned by South African Jewish businessman Issy Kirsh, RAM-FM was modeled after a South African station that provided a venue for reconciliation after apartheid. It attracted fans in both Israel and the Palestinian territories. 
This is the second time the Ram FM studio has been closed this year. In April, police temporarily shut it down, citing a lack of broadcast permit.
"We instructed the police to close the station in Jerusalem because they were broadcasting without a permit," said a Communications Ministry official in April. "They interfere with airwaves and endanger airport signals," he added.

<title>Qatar's emir urges Israel to lift 'crippling' blockade on Gaza</title>
<date>Mon Apr 14 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
DOHA - Qatar's prime minister, Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabir al-Thani, on Monday urged Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni to end Israel's "crippling blockade of Gaza due to the difficult humanitarian situation."
Meeting Livni at the 8th annual Doha Forum on Democracy, Development and Free Trade, Sheikh al-Thani also called for the acceleration of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority on a final-status arrangement.
In her speech, Livni declared that Gaza militant groups' ongoing conflict with Israel is frustrating Palestinian ambitions for statehood.
"The situation in the Gaza Strip is not just Israel's problem - Gaza is becoming an obstacle to the establishment of a Palestinian state," Livni said in the keynote address.
Although Israel fully withdrew all its forces from the Gaza Strip, "dismantled all settlements and allowed for Palestinian self-rule in this territory, instead of coexistence, we have received terror in return," she said.
"We are extending our hands in peace. The way to peaceful relations goes through dialogue and mutual recognition," she said.
Livni also called on Arab states not to view the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as the cause of extremism. "We have to understand that our ability to reach peace is dependent on the ability of extremists to prevent us from doing so," she said.
Moments after delivering her address, Livni traded barbs over the nature of Israeli democracy with MK Ahmed Tibi, who attended the conference.
In a question and answer session following the speech, Tibi (United Arab List-Ta'al) asked for an opportunity to respond to Livni's comments, and told her, "Israel is an apartheid state. How can you speak about democracy when you speak about a Jewish state?"
Livni responded that, "If we return to '47, a Jewish state and an Arab Palestinian state [were on the agenda]. Do you also not agree to this? The fact is that you are an MK in Israel, and represent 20 percent of the public, and can say whatever you please. This is the proof that Israel is a democratic state."
Livni spoke of the abducted Israeli soldiers Gilad Shalit, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. "We witness another breach of democracy, while three abducted Israeli soldiers are still held in captivity, for no reason, denied access by the Red Cross or a sign of life. I would like to take this opportunity to call for their release. This is a matter of human rights, not politics," she said.
Livni also made a brief reference to the peace talks currently under way with the Palestinian Authority. "We recognize the fact that Palestinians have legitimate rights and aspirations," she said.
The foreign minister added: "We have no desire to run their lives, and we are committed to the establishment of a Palestinian state that will be the national state of the Palestinian people and a good neighbor of Israel's. We have no interest in wasting time or creating facts on the ground that will prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state."
Livni held separate talks with the leaders of Qatar and the foreign minister of Oman.
The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, hosted Livni for lunch at his palace after holding a formal meeting also attended by his prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem.
Omani Foreign Minister Yousef Bin Alawi Bin Abdulla and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan also attended the lunch.
Livni told the emir that Israel was interested in enlisting the Arab world, and especially the Gulf states, to help the Palestinian Authority advance in the peace process.
"The region is changing," Livni told the emir. "We must show it to the public ... by exchanging the incitement and hatred messages with messages of hope and mutual recognition."
Earlier on Monday, Livni kicked off the first full day of her visit with morning talks with her Omani counterpart, Bin Abdulla. That meeting, which was open to journalists, was the first of its kind between Israel and Oman since relations between the two states were cut off in 2000, after the start of the second Palestinian intifada. Since then, there have been only covert talks between the two countries' foreign ministers.

<title>Religion, geography remain key to Arab politics </title>
<date>Fri Dec 12 03:15:14 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Composng a list of candidates for the Knesset is no small matter and especially when it comes to an Arab list. For example, it is not considered politically correct to talk about this in public and certainly no one from the Arab parties is eager to reveal the matter to the media, but a piece of information of supreme importance in this delicate work is the candidate's religion. Even if he is secular or a Communist, he will be classified by his religion, or more precisely, the religion of the community in which he lives. No protest will avail.  
Even in Hadash they are very particular about this matter, although the movement came into being in order to expand the ranks of the Israel Communist Party, which has a known attitude towards religion. In the term that is now ending, the party had three Knesset members: chairman Mohammed Barakeh who is Muslim by religion, Dr. Hanna Swaid who is Christian and Dov Khenin who is Jewish. In Balad, too, they make a point of variety: The founder of the movement and former Knesset member on its behalf, Dr. Azmi Bishara, is a Christian, the faction chairman Dr. Jamal Zahalka is a Muslim and so is MK Wasal Taha, while MK Said Naffaa is Druze. In the third and largest of the lists, Ra'am-Ta'al, the religious variety is lacking. There all the candidates are Muslims.  
The second most important consideration in a candidate's placement on a list is where he lives: The preferred situation for a list is that it have representation from the three places where there are large concentrations of citizens living: the Galilee, the Triangle and the Negev, and if not from all three of them, then at least from the Galilee and the Triangle.  
At present, Hadash has two representatives from the Galilee (Barakeh is from Shfar'am and Sweid is from Eilaboun) and one from Tel Aviv (Khenin). On the assumption that this will be the opening troika, it is lacking representation from the Triangle. In about ten days there will probably be a competition for fourth place, which according to the polls could be realistic, between two leading candidates: Dr. Afo Ighbariyeh of Um al Fahm and Dr. Thabet Abu Ras, a geographer who lives in Jaffa and is considering submitting his candidacy. Both, incidentally, are Muslims.  
In a conversation with Dr. Abu Ras last week, he enumerated his advantages as a new face on the slate, if he is elected. The first advantage: He is a native of Kalansuwa in the southern Triangle, he lived in Beer Sheva for many years and he is now very active in Jaffa. "I represent three areas," he said, stressing that Hadash has never had a representative in the Knesset on behalf of the southern Triangle: "In my area there are five out of the 11 Arab cities. This region has weight and it should have a representative."  
Abu Ras' second advantage is also geographic: This is his academic field - he is a doctor of political geography. In his youth he worked as a laborer in his father's strawberry and flower fields near the village, but insisted on going on to academic studies. He says that he was expelled from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev for political activity at the start of the 1980s, and he later returned there as a lecturer.  
Abu Ras is planning to harness geographical matters to his parliamentary work as well. Recently he has been engaged in a comparison between the situation of the Arabs in Israel and the situation of other minorities in the world. He has visited South Africa and the Southern Tyrol, a province in Northern Italy that is home to a German-speaking minority that enjoys nearly full autonomy. "There is a lot to be learned from the situation of other minorities in the world," he said. "For example, Austria is just over the border but no one in Italy accuses the inhabitants of Southern Tyrol of not being Italians."  
At the meeting, which was held in the offices of the New Horizon non- profit organization in Jaffa, which he runs, Abu Ras was wearing a shirt from South Africa; a shirt of the sort that became identified with Nelson Mandela. "I get my inspiration for my activities and my thinking from the success stories of other peoples, especially South Africa and Northern Ireland. In Israel there isn't apartheid, but rather a far more sophisticated ethnocratic system. The Arabs are part of the political system and this did not exist there, but if the state doesn't come to its senses we are liable to get there."  
In Hadash, incidentally, there are those who are angry when the party is labeled as an Arab party. MK Dov Khenin is not an Arab, nor are several thousand of this party's voters. At the moment they are scratching their heads in the party over how to translate Khenin's success in the Tel Aviv municipal elections into an expansion of the circle of Hadash voters in the general elections. Abu Ras is also promising to contribute here in his circles of acquaintance and in his positions.  
He says that he can understand how the Jews feel: "There is too much fear of dividing the land. The Jews have a real fear and so do the Arabs. We, the Arabs, have not tried to deal with the Jewish fear. There is a Jewish majority here that has a siege mentality, and in this way the country could be destroyed. It is a job of the Arab population to deal with this and to declare that we don't have a plan to transform the Jews into a minority, but we are demanding full equality. Everything has to be done by agreement."

<title>Report: Ex-U.S. president Carter to meet with Hamas leader in Syria</title>
<date>Wed Apr 09 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
The U.S. news network Fox reported Wednesday that former U.S. president Jimmy Carter is planning to meet exiled Hamas political leader Khaled Meshal in Damascus in 10 days. 
Carter's press secretary Deanna Congileo confirmed the report that the former president is planning a trip to Damascus, first published by the London-based Arabic-language daily Al Hayat, and did not deny a possible meeting with the Hamas leader. 
"President Carter is planning a trip to the Mideast next week; however, we are still confirming details of the trip and will issue a press release by the end of this week," wrote Congileo. "I cannot confirm any specific meetings at this point in time."
The planned meeting between the former president and the leader of Hamas, a militant group classified by Israel and the U.S. as a terrorist organization, has drawn harsh criticism among American officials. Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton criticized Carter's judgment, calling the move "typical" and saying that "to go to Syria to visit Hamas at this point is just an ill-timed, ill-advised decision on his part."
U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack once said of the prospect of meeting with Meshal, "that's not something that we could possibly conceive of," Fox reported. 
In 2006, Carter sparked a heated debate with the release of his book "Palestine Peace Not Apartheid" published by Simon & Schuster. In this book Carter argues that "Israel's continued control and colonization of Palestinian land have been the primary obstacles to a comprehensive peace agreement in the Middle East."

<title>South African rights group says harassed by settlers in Hebron</title>
<date>Wed Jul 09 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
A delegation of South African human rights activists said settlers verbally abused them while the visited the West Bank city of Hebron on Wednesday.
The group is on a mission to Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Former anti-apartheid activists Zackie Achmat and Edwin Cameron are participating in the tour.
"Settlers yelled and cursed at the group," said Avner Inbar, an Israeli accompanying the activists.
Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the activists entered a restricted zone, and three Israelis were arrested for disturbing the peace.
Hebron is home to a holy site revered by both Jews and Muslims and is a frequent flash point for violence.
About 500 Jews live in heavily guarded enclaves in the city, among 160,000 Palestinians.

<title>Tel Aviv documentary film festival tackles tough issues </title>
<date>Fri Apr 04 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
From one soldier's account of the Lebanon war to the tale of an Israeli African prince, the annual DocAviv film festival in Tel Aviv is looking beyond political conflict to examine broader issues of strife and identity in Israel.  
"People associate Israel with hardcore news, with fighting and conflict," said Ilana Tzur, the event's director. "But it's important to see there's such a wide range of other facets to life."  
The films at DocAviv's 10th international documentary film festival, which opened on April 3, tackle meaty political themes such as Israel's conflict with the Palestinians and its 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. But they also examine private and cultural struggle in a young country.  
Tzur said that after years of dissecting Israel's fight with the Palestinians, young filmmakers were telling more personal stories, and turning their focus onto broader issues of identity within Israeli society.  
About one quarter of the 80 films in the festival are Israeli, and several have appeared at international festivals. 
The festival's opener, "My Beetle," traces the history of a young Jerusalemite's 40-year-old car as he fights to keep it in the face of oppposition from his heavily pregnant wife. 
Other films, despite their controversial topics, also offer an emotional connection with the subjects. 
"Brides of Allah" is a surprisingly sympathetic observation of Palestinian women serving jail sentences in Israel for helping plot suicide bombings. 
The Boys of Lebanon, meanwhile, is a touching portrayal of two young sons of a former member of the South Lebanese Army as they try to make new lives for themselves in northern Israel. They, along with their parents and other families of the SLA, fled across the border after the Israel Defense Forces pulled out of southern Lebanon in May 2000. 
Other films on the program include profiles of renowned photographer Annie Liebovitz, seen through her sister's camera, and former U.S. president Jimmy Carter as he promotes his book "Palestine: Peace not Apartheid."

<title>Top UN official: Israel's policies are like apartheid </title>
<date>Wed Nov 26 02:26:09 IST 2008</date>
<content>
NEW YORK - United Nations General Assembly President Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann yesterday likened Israel's policies toward the Palestinians to South Africa's treatment of blacks under apartheid.  
Israel's actions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were like "the apartheid of an earlier era," said D'Escoto, of Nicaragua, speaking at the annual debate marking the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.  
He added: "We must not be afraid to call something what it is."  
Israeli ambassador to the UN Gabriela Shalev in September called D'Escoto an "Israel hater" for having hugged Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a vocal enemy of Israel.  
Meanwhile, other diplomatic attacks against Israel were expected today on the second day of the annual debate.

<title>Top UN official: Israel's policies are like apartheid of bygone era</title>

United Nations General Assembly President Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann on Monday likened Israel's policies toward the Palestinians to South Africa's treatment of blacks under apartheid.
Israel's actions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were like "the apartheid of an earlier era," said Brockmann, of Nicaragua, speaking at the annual debate marking the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.
He added: "We must not be afraid to call something what it is."
Brockmann stressed that it was important for the United Nations to use the heavily-charged term since it was the institution itself that had passed the International Convention against the crime of apartheid.
Israeli ambassador to the UN Gabriela Shalev in September called Brockmann an "Israel hater"
Meanwhile, other diplomatic attacks against Israel were expected Tuesday on the second day of the annual debate.
The event is usually observed on November 29, to coincide with the UN's resolution in 1947 to establish a Jewish and an Arab state in Palestine.
The Palestinians, along with a group of Arab states, intend to use Tuesday's debate, entitled "the Palestinian question and the situation in the Middle East," for a public campaign directed at the international community about the the suffering of the Palestinian people under Israeli occupation. They will also denounce Israel as responsible for the lack of a solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Speakers at the debate are expected to harshly criticize Israel for its policy in the territories, especially following UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's complaint that Israel refused his request to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.
In her address Tuesday, Shalev asked why the UN has turned November 29 into a day of mourning, but does not mention that on this day a resolution to establish two states was adopted with Israel's consent.
"The UN must adopt new content and no longer accept the agenda foisted on it by the automatic majority, which sabotages the peace process' progress in the region," she said.
The two-day event includes several events and ceremonies at the UN headquarters, including movies and photography exhibitions showing alleged Palestinian hardships under Israeli occupation.
The debate is expected to end with the adoption of some 20 anti-Israel resolutions. In the past, these included denouncing Israel for annexing East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in separate resolutions.

<title>Tough love </title>
<date>Thu Mar 20 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Tamar Berger was on the way to another shift with the women of Machsom Watch, the Israeli women's organization that monitors activity at army checkpoints in the West Bank, when she accidentally discovered something in a pile of garbage. It was across the road from the Dahiat al-Barid checkpoint near Ramallah: a small toy car made of cardboard, wrapped in glossy, brown packing tape that had been painted in the colors of the Palestinian flag - black on the bottom, green on the sides, and red on top. Its appearance at that location seemed scripted, turning up right before the eyes of a radical leftist cultural researcher who employs X-ray vision to scrutinize the depths of Israeli space. Berger insists it was merely coincidence, but that the story is true. There is no sense in arguing with facts.  
A friend who accompanied her on that same journey to the checkpoint, artist Relli De Vries, was the first to notice the toy, Berger recalls. She placed it in a shoe box, "like a silkworm, like something very precious." Berger transformed the car into the star exhibit of her new book, "Birevach bein olam vetza'atzua: Al hamodel bitarbut hayisraelit" (In the Space between World and Toy: The Model in Israeli Culture), just published by Resling. A photograph of the toy car, one of the models "lifted from daily, Israeli life," is displayed on the book's cover in a faithful representation of the book's content: a penetrating discussion of the space that surrounds us. "In the Space between World and Toy" comes out a decade after Berger's first, meandering tome, "Dionysus at Dizengoff Center," a journey into the history of Tel Aviv's first mall. That book's exposure of repressed layers of cultural content in the palace of consumerism produced ripples. The Azrieli Mall, dedicated one year later, was the topic of its own recently published Hebrew novel, "The House of Dajani," by Alon Hilu. Hilu's book was undoubtedly inspired by "Dionysus."  
Berger's current book also flows wonderfully from description to narrative, and observation to insight, as it departs the boundaries of its center for the entirety of Israeli space. It employs the same keen vision, while leaving no stone unturned. Only a reading of the book's fine print reveals the glimmer of optimism that occasionally flickers in the edges of a model.  
Berger explains that the model is a special form of representation of an object or concept, but that it cannot be identical to either. It was designed to illustrate or exemplify, but, "the gap between world and toy is always preserved, to employ Rilke's terms." Berger wanders in the Israeli space within that gap, armed with a series of models, "which were not chosen with discrimination, but encountered along the way." They serve as the threshold for detailed descriptions, interpretation and free association. Under Berger's gaze, the toy-model-car at the checkpoint "was transformed into something else - not just another toy or representation of generic vehicles, but a symbol of being Palestinian. And in the context of its reality, that of the Israeli occupation, it becomes an expression and a symbol of the yearning for national liberation."  
The settlement ethos 
Another model in the book, a wall map of Israel from 1951, betrays the fact that "the settlement ethos is already found within it, and in fact has been since the earliest days of Zionism." Or, to paraphrase the right-wing bumper sticker that maintained that all of Israel resembles the political reality in the territories, Yesha really is here.  
For Berger, the Petah Tikva Zoo is another model of Israeliness that sanctifies nature "on Arab lands that were occupied and obliterated." The Mini-Israel park [an Israeli version of Madurodam] - which, had it not existed, Berger would have had to invent to support her critique - is a model that "perverts the picture of reality and realigns it according to accepted industrial standards of Israeliness." And so forth.  
You say that the models were encountered along the way. In other words, everything was tainted regardless of what you encountered?  
"I try to describe what I see, and I see difficult issues that are unresolved. My vision is unaffectionate. I believe one must be critical of everything, but not totally critical in a disingenuous manner that leaves destruction in its path. I am not interested in the Zionist Jewish state. But I am interested in Israeliness, in which I do not deny there is guilt, either as an experience or a culture. It is maddening, violent, outrageous and moving, and despite all my harsh expression, I do not harbor hate. I am crazy about this place. This is my place, and I can only live here."  
Berger was born in 1957 to an affluent family, and she conducts her life between Kfar Shmaryahu, the posh suburb in which she was raised, and Tel Aviv, where she now resides. "I was born into comfort," she says, "but not into a mentality of prosperity and joy." Her father, Ezra Berger, came from the family of industrialists ("right-wing, capitalist, and religious") who founded the Teth Beth Food Industries firm. Her mother, Elinoar Berger, is a translator whom the daughter associates with the "intellectual, socialist" wing of the family. "I was not raised in a place with a clear, unequivocal ideology, and that makes me fortunate."  
She is the oldest child in her family. "The eldest daughter is a model in and of itself," she says. "A bit damaged, because the eldest daughter is subject to the sons. The book is also a declaration that I liberated myself from this model and its inescapable role."  
Berger is married to filmmaker Avi Mugrabi, whose documentary films represent ongoing guerilla warfare against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Without a doubt, they constitute the exemplary radical leftist family. Mugrabi's only film that does not deal with the Palestinians is "August," the story of a director who makes a film about his most hated month of the year. Their oldest child, Shaul, refused to serve in the Israel Defense Forces, "and I am proud of that," says his mother. She explains that open refusal has been replaced by concealed "gray" refusal, "which I prefer because it is more radical." Shaul and his peers were the subjects of Mugrabi's chilling film "Avenge But One of My Eyes."  
The mother is an activist who regularly participates in demonstrations against the occupation and the separation fence, and protests house demolitions in the rundown Tel Aviv community of Kfar Shalem, as well as among the Arab community of Jaffa. Her great political love is the anarchist movement, which distances itself from the political or social Zionist Israeli left. "I am associated with the Yonatan Pollack group, which operates beyond any system," she says. "Not like the leaders of Peace Now, who are connected to cabinet ministers. Anarchists have a different democratic approach. It is a complete ideology. They may be just sons and daughters from 'good homes' who are playing around, but they may truly have a different proposal. They also inspire thought in me."  
Berger is among the pioneers who moved to Tel Aviv's mythological, ultra-hip Sheinkin Street in the 1980s. Her bookstore, The 20th Century, was ahead of its time in its presentation of commercially unpromising merchandise in the form of art, film, archaeology, design and theory and critique books. "No one talked about gentrification then," she explains. "But looking back, it is true that we drove the price of housing in Tel Aviv up with our own hands." Today, her neighborhood is the heart of bourgeois Tel Aviv. From the veranda of the cafe in which we spoke, she pointed to the luxury Akirov Towers, in North Tel Aviv, while castigating the "socioeconomic gaps" that the upscale, residential high-rises represent.  
Doesn't an apartment like your own in a three-story building in the heart of Tel Aviv represent a socioeconomic gap?  
"What can you do if you live in the center of the city? What can you do if you love this place, Israel? I'm guilty, I sinned, but I am also not guilty and I'm free of sin. At least I try to engage in sociopolitical activity. I don't come from a place of implementation and I didn't stand up to the test of action on the ground. I am not an architect, but I would like to believe that my activism will produce something."  
Does your criticism contain some nostalgia for a bygone place?  
"I am free of nostalgia. I have no interest in preservation, and my heart doesn't break when they demolish old buildings. The world was never free of injustice. Everything was always complicated. So I don't long for the past but, perhaps, for the future."  
The thesis for Berger's recently granted doctorate focused on Ben-Gurion Airport, written in a format that recalls her critique of Dizengoff Center. "My proposal was to investigate a place that is also a non-place, a transitional site that represents 'here' and 'there,' which is in fact an axis around which the Zionist project rotates and around which Israeli life now also rotates," she explains.  
After studying literature and philosophy, "My expertise developed in the direction of Israeli space, and it is my luxury to be able to adopt a multidisciplinary approach that permits me to examine space in a philosophical, cultural, and architectural fashion."  
Even Berger's treatment of Ackerstein Industries tiles transforms them from simple, innocently plain surfacing material to "the embodiment of the Zionist ethos, a thriving assembly lime of columns and pillboxes that exalts the apartheid wall, the perfection of derivative ability and a display window of all the unrestrained and undifferentiated filth, artificial Israeliness, flat, violent, and coarse," as she once wrote in an article for a book about Israeli cities.  
A place that remembers its past 
What, in your opinion, is an Israeli place?  
"A place that remembers its past, which must remember its past. And not just its Palestinian past, but our Jewish past, each of us according to his ethnicity. But, once again, not nostalgic. Not a return to what was once, but a processed memory, the ability to contain the past within the present, as in good psychological therapy. Otherwise, you'll always rediscover the deceit that underlies repression and denial. Like Ackerstein paving stones that imitate authentic stone floors, but their entire existence relies on a pressed-together framework, and the minute the framework falls apart, so does the entire sidewalk."

A photograph of the toy car, one of the models "lifted from daily, Israeli life," is displayed on the book's cover in a faithful representation of the book's content: a penetrating discussion of the space that surrounds us. "In the Space between World and Toy" comes out a decade after Berger's first, meandering tome, "Dionysus at Dizengoff Center," a journey into the history of Tel Aviv's first mall. That book's exposure of repressed layers of cultural content in the palace of consumerism produced ripples. The Azrieli Mall, dedicated one year later, was the topic of its own recently published Hebrew novel, "The House of Dajani," by Alon Hilu. Hilu's book was undoubtedly inspired by "Dionysus."  
Berger's current book also flows wonderfully from description to narrative, and observation to insight, as it departs the boundaries of its center for the entirety of Israeli space. It employs the same keen vision, while leaving no stone unturned. Only a reading of the book's fine print reveals the glimmer of optimism that occasionally flickers in the edges of a model.  
Berger explains that the model is a special form of representation of an object or concept, but that it cannot be identical to either. It was designed to illustrate or exemplify, but, "the gap between world and toy is always preserved, to employ Rilke's terms." Berger wanders in the Israeli space within that gap, armed with a series of models, "which were not chosen with discrimination, but encountered along the way." They serve as the threshold for detailed descriptions, interpretation and free association. Under Berger's gaze, the toy-model-car at the checkpoint "was transformed into something else - not just another toy or representation of generic vehicles, but a symbol of being Palestinian. And in the context of its reality, that of the Israeli occupation, it becomes an expression and a symbol of the yearning for national liberation."  
The settlement ethos 
Another model in the book, a wall map of Israel from 1951, betrays the fact that "the settlement ethos is already found within it, and in fact has been since the earliest days of Zionism." Or, to paraphrase the right-wing bumper sticker that maintained that all of Israel resembles the political reality in the territories, Yesha really is here.  
For Berger, the Petah Tikva Zoo is another model of Israeliness that sanctifies nature "on Arab lands that were occupied and obliterated." The Mini-Israel park [an Israeli version of Madurodam] - which, had it not existed, Berger would have had to invent to support her critique - is a model that "perverts the picture of reality and realigns it according to accepted industrial standards of Israeliness." And so forth.  
You say that the models were encountered along the way. In other words, everything was tainted regardless of what you encountered?  
"I try to describe what I see, and I see difficult issues that are unresolved. My vision is unaffectionate. I believe one must be critical of everything, but not totally critical in a disingenuous manner that leaves destruction in its path. I am not interested in the Zionist Jewish state. But I am interested in Israeliness, in which I do not deny there is guilt, either as an experience or a culture. It is maddening, violent, outrageous and moving, and despite all my harsh expression, I do not harbor hate. I am crazy about this place. This is my place, and I can only live here."  
Berger was born in 1957 to an affluent family, and she conducts her life between Kfar Shmaryahu, the posh suburb in which she was raised, and Tel Aviv, where she now resides. "I was born into comfort," she says, "but not into a mentality of prosperity and joy." Her father, Ezra Berger, came from the family of industrialists ("right-wing, capitalist, and religious") who founded the Teth Beth Food Industries firm. Her mother, Elinoar Berger, is a translator whom the daughter associates with the "intellectual, socialist" wing of the family. "I was not raised in a place with a clear, unequivocal ideology, and that makes me fortunate."  
She is the oldest child in her family. "The eldest daughter is a model in and of itself," she says. "A bit damaged, because the eldest daughter is subject to the sons. The book is also a declaration that I liberated myself from this model and its inescapable role."  
Berger is married to filmmaker Avi Mugrabi, whose documentary films represent ongoing guerilla warfare against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Without a doubt, they constitute the exemplary radical leftist family. Mugrabi's only film that does not deal with the Palestinians is "August," the story of a director who makes a film about his most hated month of the year. Their oldest child, Shaul, refused to serve in the Israel Defense Forces, "and I am proud of that," says his mother. She explains that open refusal has been replaced by concealed "gray" refusal, "which I prefer because it is more radical." Shaul and his peers were the subjects of Mugrabi's chilling film "Avenge But One of My Eyes."  
The mother is an activist who regularly participates in demonstrations against the occupation and the separation fence, and protests house demolitions in the rundown Tel Aviv community of Kfar Shalem, as well as among the Arab community of Jaffa. Her great political love is the anarchist movement, which distances itself from the political or social Zionist Israeli left. "I am associated with the Yonatan Pollack group, which operates beyond any system," she says. "Not like the leaders of Peace Now, who are connected to cabinet ministers. Anarchists have a different democratic approach. It is a complete ideology. They may be just sons and daughters from 'good homes' who are playing around, but they may truly have a different proposal. They also inspire thought in me."  
Berger is among the pioneers who moved to Tel Aviv's mythological, ultra-hip Sheinkin Street in the 1980s. Her bookstore, The 20th Century, was ahead of its time in its presentation of commercially unpromising merchandise in the form of art, film, archaeology, design and theory and critique books. "No one talked about gentrification then," she explains. "But looking back, it is true that we drove the price of housing in Tel Aviv up with our own hands." Today, her neighborhood is the heart of bourgeois Tel Aviv. From the veranda of the cafe in which we spoke, she pointed to the luxury Akirov Towers, in North Tel Aviv, while castigating the "socioeconomic gaps" that the upscale, residential high-rises represent.  
Doesn't an apartment like your own in a three-story building in the heart of Tel Aviv represent a socioeconomic gap?  
"What can you do if you live in the center of the city? What can you do if you love this place, Israel? I'm guilty, I sinned, but I am also not guilty and I'm free of sin. At least I try to engage in sociopolitical activity. I don't come from a place of implementation and I didn't stand up to the test of action on the ground. I am not an architect, but I would like to believe that my activism will produce something."  
Does your criticism contain some nostalgia for a bygone place?  
"I am free of nostalgia. I have no interest in preservation, and my heart doesn't break when they demolish old buildings. The world was never free of injustice. Everything was always complicated. So I don't long for the past but, perhaps, for the future."  
The thesis for Berger's recently granted doctorate focused on Ben-Gurion Airport, written in a format that recalls her critique of Dizengoff Center. "My proposal was to investigate a place that is also a non-place, a transitional site that represents 'here' and 'there,' which is in fact an axis around which the Zionist project rotates and around which Israeli life now also rotates," she explains.  
After studying literature and philosophy, "My expertise developed in the direction of Israeli space, and it is my luxury to be able to adopt a multidisciplinary approach that permits me to examine space in a philosophical, cultural, and architectural fashion."  
Even Berger's treatment of Ackerstein Industries tiles transforms them from simple, innocently plain surfacing material to "the embodiment of the Zionist ethos, a thriving assembly lime of columns and pillboxes that exalts the apartheid wall, the perfection of derivative ability and a display window of all the unrestrained and undifferentiated filth, artificial Israeliness, flat, violent, and coarse," as she once wrote in an article for a book about Israeli cities.  
A place that remembers its past 
What, in your opinion, is an Israeli place?  
"A place that remembers its past, which must remember its past. And not just its Palestinian past, but our Jewish past, each of us according to his ethnicity. But, once again, not nostalgic. Not a return to what was once, but a processed memory, the ability to contain the past within the present, as in good psychological therapy. Otherwise, you'll always rediscover the deceit that underlies repression and denial. Like Ackerstein paving stones that imitate authentic stone floors, but their entire existence relies on a pressed-together framework, and the minute the framework falls apart, so does the entire sidewalk."

<title>Tutu meets Hamas leader, raps Israel for barring entry </title>
<date>Thu May 29 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu criticized Israel's refusal to allow him entry to the country, in his role as head of the U.S. special committee to investigate the November 2006 incident in Beit Hanun where 19 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire.  
In a telephone interview with Haaretz after he met with Hamas prime minister Ismail Haniyeh in Gaza, Tutu said he was disappointed that he was not allowed to visit Sderot and meet the victims of the Qassam rocket attacks there.  
The former archbishop of Capetown, South Africa - who won the Nobel in 1984 for his struggle against apartheid - was appointed to head the special committee by the UN human Rights Council in Geneva.   
However, Israel has announced that it will not cooperate with the committee.  
Committee representatives have asked the Israeli delegation to the UN in Geneva a number of times to make arrangements for a visit, but have never received replies. Tutu then decided to settle for a visit in Beit Hanun. He arrived in Gaza on Tuesday after traveling through Egypt, and entered the Gaza Strip via the Rafah Crossing.  
Tutu, 77, expressed his astonishment at Israel's behavior, as he has been invited a number of times to speak in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on behalf of the Peres Center for Peace, where he is a member of the International Board of Governors, along with other Nobel Prize winners.  
Tutu told Haaretz that he made it clear to Haniyeh and other Hamas members he spoke to that there is no difference between firing Qassam rockets on Israeli citizens and Israeli attacks on Gazans.  
"We also say that the people of Sderot suffer from the Qassam rockets. We care about them too," said Tutu.  
He said he expects the Israelis, as those who remember the Holocaust, like the South Africans, to be sensitive to the suffering of the Palestinians. Tutu added that he did not remember the last time he was so deeply shocked as when he met with the families of the victims of the Israeli shelling of Beit Hanun.

<title>UN expert: Palestinian terror 'inevitable' result of occupation </title>
<date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
A report commissioned by the United Nations suggests that Palestinian terrorism is the inevitable consequence of Israeli occupation and laws that resemble South African apartheid - a claim Israel rejected Tuesday as enflaming hatred between Jews and Palestinians.
The report by John Dugard, independent investigator on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for the UN Human Rights Council, will be presented next month, but it has been posted on the body's Web site.
In it, Dugard, a South African lawyer who campaigned against apartheid in the 1980s, says "common sense ... dictates that a distinction must be drawn between acts of mindless terror, such as acts committed by Al-Qaida, and acts committed in the course of a war of national liberation against colonialism, apartheid or military occupation."
"While Palestinian terrorist acts are to be deplored, they must be understood as being a painful but inevitable consequence of colonialism, apartheid or occupation," writes Dugard, whose 25-page report accuses the Israel of acts and policies consistent with all three.
He cited checkpoints and roadblocks restricting Palestinian movement to house demolitions and what he terms the Judaization of Jerusalem.
"As long as there is occupation, there will be terrorism," he argues.
"Acts of terror against military occupation must be seen in historical context," Dugard says. "This is why every effort should be made to bring the occupation to a speedy end. Until this is done, peace cannot be expected, and violence will continue."
Israel's UN ambassador in Geneva slammed Dugard's analysis.
"The common link between Al-Qaida and the Palestinian terrorists is that both intentionally target civilians with the mere purpose to kill," Itzhak Levanon said. "The fact that Professor Dugard is ignoring this essential fact, demonstrates his inability to use objectivity in his assessment."
"Professor Dugard will better serve the cause of peace by ceasing to enflame the hatred between Israelis and Palestinians, who have embarked on serious talks to solve this contentious situation."
Dugard was appointed in 2001 as an unpaid expert by the now-defunct UN Human Rights Commission to investigate only violations by the Israeli side, prompting Israel and the U.S. to dismiss his reports as one-sided. Israel refused to allow him to conduct a UN-mandated fact-finding mission on its Gaza offensive in 2006.
The report will be presented next month at the 47-nation rights council's first regular session of the year. The new body has been widely criticized - even by its founder, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan - for spending most of its time criticizing one government, Israel's, over alleged abuses.

<title>VIDEO / Peres warns evacuation of settlers may lead to civil war</title>
<date>Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
LONDON - President Shimon Peres told members of the British Parliament Wednesday that Israel would have difficulty dismantling West Bank settlements without causing a civil war in Israel.  
On the second day of his state visit to Britain, Peres Wednesday became the first Israeli leader to address members of both houses of Parliament in the House of Lords' Robing room.  
"The State of Israel began to take shape as Great Britain, under the leadership of Winston Churchill, saved the world from the Nazi threat. It was a time when many countries closed their gates to Holocaust survivors," Peres said.  
"My family arrived in Israel when it was still under British mandate. In our pockets were British Palestinian passports. In our hearts was the Balfour declaration. Israel would not have a vibrant democracy if it hadn't been for the British legacy."  
While Peres spoke, some 20 pro-Palestinian protesters called on Britain not to maintain ties with the "apartheid state" Israel and the "war criminal" Peres.  
A larger demonstration was held outside Oxford University's theater on Tuesday, when Peres' speech on 'Peace and Globalization" was disrupted by some 150 anti-Israel protesters.  
Some of the demonstrating students entered the lecture hall, which was open to all students, and interrupted Peres' speech repeatedly, protesting Israel's conduct in the territories.  
The protesting students were removed, except for one who approached the president, but were silenced by a majority of the audience while the president carried on with his speech.  
In his address to the parliament members, Peres said he "responded positively" to the Arab peace initiative. "However, it should be clear that agreement can not be achieved by a simple 'take-it-or-leave it' offer. We couldn't accept all the articles of the Arab Initiative. The truth is that it's hard to answer all demands at a time when some parties in the region reject peace. Hamas violently rejects compromise. It continues to fire rockets at Israeli civilians. We can understand land for peace but will not accept land in return for rocket fire."  
Peres also said he believed an agreement could be reached with Saudi King Abdullah but was not sure Abdullah was ready to push for peace, at this time, with all the force of his kingdom.  
Peres is scheduled to visit Buckingham Palace Thursday and meet Queen Elizabeth II, who will bestow an honorary knighthood on him. He will also meet with Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

<title>Video / Prof. Avi Shlaim: Settlements turned Israel into apartheid state</title>
<date>Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
British-Israeli Professor Avi Shlaim joined a handful of academics in London earlier this month to debate the future of Zionism, in a panel entitled "Israel at 60: What happened to the Zionist dream?"
Shlaim, a historian of the Arab-Israeli conflict at Oxford University, made headlines last year when he decided to speak at an Oxford Union debate in favor of the motion, "This house believes that one state is the only solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict."
But Shlaim, an opponent of campaigns pursued by some of his British colleagues to boycott Israeli universities, has always been a fervent supporter of the two-state solution, a stance he repeated in this month's event, which was organized by the Institute of Ideas. 
He continues, he said, to believe in Israel's legitimacy to exist within its pre-1967 borders, but "rejects uncompromisingly the Zionist colonial project beyond the Green Line."
In his talk, entitled "Obsession with Territory Post-1967," Shlaim blasts the settlements, which he says have turned Israel into an apartheid state, as the primary source of failure for peace efforts with the Palestinians. 
Shlaim believes Zionism was derailed from its course after the Six-Day war, when its universalist principles were replaced with "religious messianism and secular nationalism." Israel must give up land, he says, not just as a concession to the Palestinians, but because "a people that oppresses another cannot itself remain free."

<title>VIEWPOINT / The Down with Israel Syndrome</title>
<date>Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Each year, in preparation for Israel's birthday, American newspaper editors feel an urge to invite Arab writers to tell us why Israel should not exist. Typical this year were the Los Angeles Times (Opinion, May 12 "Forget the two-state solution", by Saree Makdisi) and the Christian Science Monitor (Ghada Karmi "A One-state Solution for Palestinians and Israelis", May 30, 2008), where the elimination of Israel were advanced under the usual euphemism of a "one-state solution."
I presume this exercise gives editors some satisfaction, of the kind one would get in inviting officials of the Flat Earth Society to tell us why the earth should not be round, and do so precisely on Earth Day, lest the wisdom would escape anyone's attention.
Undoubtedly, the banalization of absurdity has its kicks. It is sporty, admirably "out-of-the-box-ish" and, if only it did not involve a dangerous experiment with the lives of millions of human beings, could be considered mighty cute.
But this practice is adult matter, and the result is a depressing Kafkaesque choreography, in which Israel is put on trial for its very existence, while less radical commentators, if they are invited, deal with Israel's future, difficulties and achievements, but leave the accusations unanswered.
There is some wisdom to ignoring insults and unfounded accusations. By answering one tacitly bestows credence, however minimal, upon the arguments that put you on the accused bench -- the last bench that a birthday celebration deserves.
So, perhaps it is wise to write chapter and verse about Israel's achievements (as Bill Kristol did May 12, and Tom Friedman did June 8) and let the "colonial" and "apartheid" accusations hang there, unanswered, as living testimonies of the Orwellian mentality of the accusers?
I am not totally convinced.
I am concerned about the possibility that a non-negligible percentage of American readers, especially the novice and the hasty, would interpret the publication of opinion articles calling for the dismantling of Israel as evidence that the arguments and conclusions presented are deemed worthy of consideration in the eyes of editors whose judgment the public has entrusted to protect us from Flat-Earth type deformities.
This concern becomes especially acute when news reporters too begin touting the "one-state" slogans, with unmistaken sympathy, under the cover of "World News."(e.g., Richard Boudreaux and Ashraf Khalil "For some Palestinians, one state with Israel is better than none," LA Times, World News, May 8 )
I am concerned because evil plans begin with evil images. Once the mind is jolted to envision deviant imagery it automatically consructs a belief structure that supports its feasibility and desirability. The first phase of Hitler's strategy was to get people to envision, just envision, a world without Jews -- the rest is history.
Today we are witnessing a concerted effort by enemies of co-existence to get people to envision, just envision, a world without Israel - the rest, they hope, will become history.
The American press seems to fall for it.
In fairness to the editors of some newspapers, articles calling forthe elimination of Israel are often balanced by articles discussingthe prospects for a peaceful settlement of the dispute. But, ironically, this "balance" is precisely where the imbalance cries out loudest, for it gives equal moral weight to a provocation that every Jew in Israel considers a genocidal death threat, most Jews view as an assault on their identity as people and most Palestinians view as an incentive to undermine or forestall peace negotiations. 
Balance has its norms, logic and responsibilities, mirrored and shaped by sound editorial judgment. We do not rush to "balance" each celebration of Martin Luther King Day with articles by white supremacists, and we do not "balance" a hate speech with a lecture on breathing technique; a hate speech is balanced with a lecture on the evils of hate.
A true, albeit grotesque, moral balance would be demonstrated only if for every "down with Israel" writer the newspaper were to invite a "down with Palestinian statehood" writer.
But editors seem to have strange takes on morality; for some, questioning the legitimacy of Israel's existence is a mark of impartiality, while questioning the legitimacy of Palestinian aspirations is a moral taboo. Decency should somehow inform these editors that both "down with" calls are morally reprehensible and insulting to readers' intelligence, hence, both should be purged from civil discourse and marginalized into the good company of white supremacy and Flat-Earth rhetoric.
But until decency reigns, we can be sure to see them again at Israel's birthdays, the predators of peace, paraded by the press, demanding their annual prey: once more to envision, just envision, a world without Israel.
Ironically, Arab commentaries published around Yom Haatzmaut can actually be of some service to Israel, for they provide a faithful mirror of the prevailing sentiments in the elite ranks of Palestinian society and thus gauge how ready this society is to accepting a peace agreement, whatever its shape, as permanent.
This year, the LA Times (May 11), The Nation (May 26)  the New York Times (May 18) the Washington Post (May 12) the Christian Science Monitor (May 30) and others lured an impressive group of Arab intellectuals into unveiling their worldview to American readers.
Highly educated, mostly secular, champions of modernity and masters of communication, these authors are keenly attuned to grass roots sentimentsand, enticed by the limelight, revealed the naked landscape of the Palestinian mindset.
Sadly, what they revealed in 2008 is not what Mahmoud Abbas and public opinion polsters would like us to believe. They revealed what we feared all along but were afraid to admit: the notion of a two-state solution never began to penetrate the surface of Palestinian consciousness.
In vain would one search these articles for a shred of an idea that morally justifies a two-state solution, or that acknowledges some historical ties of Jews to the land, or that makes an intellectual investment contrary to the Greater Palestine agenda.
One by one, the articles depict Israel as a temporary outpost of Western imperialism, a entity to oppose not to neighbor.
This does not mean that the two-state solution is dead - after all, it is the only proposal worthy of the word "solution" - but it means that the current efforts to reach a peaceful settlement should begin to address one key obstacle: the ideological landscape as revealed to us by our Arab brethren on Yom Haatzmaut.

<title>Web site seeks ex-Swedish volunteers to act as goodwill ambassadors  </title>
<date>Mon Mar 24 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Last year, Kiki Toledano, a member of Kibbutz Massada in the Jordan Valley and a lecturer of English, was invited to speak on a radio station in Sweden. "It was a program where the host raised issues close to his heart," said Toledano. "I spoke about Israel as an Israeli citizen, and I then understood how difficult our situation is." 
She also said that, in her discussions with the listeners, they described the country as a conqueror, and acting with cruelty toward Palestinians.  
"It hurt me to hear what they were saying about us," said Toledano, who arrived at Kibbutz Massada in 1982 as a volunteer and married a member of the kibbutz. "Israel's public relations in Sweden are in a sad state." 
The Web site recently launched by the Israeli embassy in Sweden is trying to change the situation Toledano described. The site (www.kibbutz.nu), was designed to attract Swedes who had spent time volunteering on kibbutzim in Israel, and spur them to act as "ambassadors" and spokesmen for the state overseas. 
The Web site, which includes content on Israel and on kibbutzim, invites former volunteers to join a social network to help Israel's public relations. The embassy estimates that about 40,000 Swedes have spent time as volunteers in Israel since 1967. 
"It is a waste not to take advantage of former volunteers," said Rina Keren, head of the volunteers department in the Kibbutz Movement. "These people are ambassadors of goodwill. About 400,000 volunteers have spent time on kibbutzim since 1967, and the vast majority have nothing but good things to say about Israel. Making good use of these people will give Israeli PR a decisive advantage." 
"We don't have an oversupply of support, and for the past two years we have been considering the best way to reach our target audience," explained Israel's Consul in Stockholm, Kobi Shoshani. "This is another common thread among 30-50 year olds, many of whom spent time on kibbutzim. Their eyes light up when they speak about this time. Anyone who has been a volunteer in Israel knows that it's not all war, it's also kibbutz, volunteers, and other things." 
"There is a community of people in Sweden who can do a lot for us," noted Keren. "Some have been appointed to powerful positions in government and embassies. When former Shin Bet chief Carmi Gillon was appointed Israel's ambassador there, he had a difficult start (criticism of the Shin Bet's activities toward Palestinians, etc.). He wrote that one thing that helped him was the fact that a third of the Parliament had been volunteers on kibbutzim." 
Toledano fondly recalls coming to Massada as a young woman of 19. 
"There was an ideological element to it," she said. "In the 1970s and 1980s, living on a collective, together, in cooperation, was a very strong motif. Life today has become very individualistic." 
But the most obvious change she sees is in the attitude toward Israel. 
"Now they compare us to South Africa, present us as an apartheid regime, and Arafat as a hero and freedom-fighter," she related. "A student of mine was killed in the terror attack on the Maxim restaurant in Haifa, and what do the Swedes see? A display of a pool of blood with an image of a terrorist. When the ambassador destroyed the display, the thing that is remembered in Sweden is the so-called crazy ambassador, and not the story about the terrorist attacks. 
"Anyone who knows the truth is someone who is very interested, and many of these are former volunteers, who see a different reality."

<title>Yishai to Carter: Tell Meshal that I want to discuss prisoner swap </title>
<date>Fri Apr 18 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Deputy Prime Minister Eli Yishai asked former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to tell Hamas leaders, including Khaled Meshal, that he would like to meet in order to expedite a prisoner exchange that would bring home kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit.  
Yishai relayed his message to Carter during a meeting on Monday. The meeting was held at the request of the former president, who wanted to meet with Israeli political leaders from across the political spectrum. The meeting was arranged through the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.  
Yishai's bureau said he did not ask Prime Minister Ehud Olmert for permission to hold the meeting, nor did he tell Olmert what he discussed.  
Yishai said other Israeli officials erred in boycotting Carter. During the meeting, he told Carter that he opposed the former president's use of the term "apartheid" in his book about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Yishai said Carter told him that the interpretation of his use of the word was fundamentally wrong.  
Yishai told Haaretz that in order to redeem prisoners, he was prepared to meet with anyone who could help move things ahead, including Hamas leaders. He said this did not contradict Israeli government policy, since he did not intend to discuss diplomatic issues or a cease-fire.  
After Carter visited Sderot this week, he pledged to help arrange a cease-fire. Carter also met with Shalit's parents, and said he would address Shalit's release when he spoke to Meshal.  
Shalit was kidnapped during a raid on an Israeli army post near Gaza in the summer of 2006, and is being held in the coastal strip.  
"I am ready to meet with all necessary Hamas members and with Shalit's captors, and I would be pleased if you can help," Yishai told Carter at their meeting on Monday. "I am volunteering myself for the task, and I ask you to convey a message: They also have prisoners and I am sure they want to see them released, and therefore it is proper to expedite the negotiations."  
Yishai thanked Carter for his willingness to assist in finding out the fate of missing soldiers Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser, whose kidnapping in 2006, days after Shalit's, sparked the Second Lebanon War.  
Carter promised to pass along the message and to meet with Yishai again when he returns to Israel next week, after visiting other countries in the region.  
Yishai opposes negotiating with the Palestinian leadership, led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, over a permanent-status arrangement, especially regarding Jerusalem.  
A source in Shas said Thursday that if talks with Hamas led to calm, especially around the Gaza Strip, this could lessen pressure to reach a final-status agreement, which could lead to a coalition crisis with Shas.  
Yishai placed his request as Israeli and American officials were protesting Carter's intention to meet with Meshal, the leader of an organization that Israel and the United States consider a terror group. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert did not make time to meet with Carter, and Haaretz has learned that after the press mentioned Carter's plan to meet Meshal, Defense Minister Ehud Barak cancelled a meeting that had been scheduled for Monday. Barak's bureau said the meeting had been cancelled due to scheduling conflicts.  
Carter told Haaretz this week that before he arrived in the region, his staff informed the U.S. government of all the meetings he had planned for his Middle East visit, including the meeting with Meshal. Carter said that until his plans became public knowledge, no U.S. officials objected to them.

<title>Zahar: Gazans can do 'no less' than rise up like Warsaw Ghetto Jews</title>
<date>Thu Apr 17 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Senior Hamas official Mahmoud Zahar writing in an opinion piece published Thursday in the Washington Post stated that Gazans can do 'no less' than rise up against Israel like Jews in the Warsaw ghetto did against the Nazis.
"Sixty-five years ago, the courageous Jews of the Warsaw ghetto rose in defense of their people. We Gazans, living in the world's largest open-air prison, can do no less," Zahar wrote in the newspaper.
The Gaza-based Hamas leader later decried Judaism as having "corrupted itself in the detour into Zionism, nationalism and apartheid."
In the Washington Post opinion piece, Zahar also denounced Israel as waging a "total war" against the Palestinian people, which he cited as an explanation for last week's attack by Gaza militants on the Nahal Oz fuel depot, declaring that resistance was the only option left to the Palestinians.
Zahar further stated that United States policy in the Middle East had reached a dead end, while praising former U.S. president Jimmy Carter's "sensible plan to visit the Hamas leadership" as bringing honesty and pragmatism.

<title>Combating ‘Israeli apartheid’ or preaching to the converted?</title>
<date>Fri Mar 02 11:37:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	This week, I had the pleasure of meeting several bright and articulate students during an event staged by the pro-Israel campus group Hasbara Fellowship, “Israel Peace Week”. They tabled at a local university and distributed flyers about pro-Israel advocacy and events with the goal of combating Israeli Apartheid Week. Hasbara’s motto was that Israel wants peace and has made many large sacrifices in pursuit of that goal. Many of the students further explained that they sought to reach out to the broader campus community and attract students that only know about Israel “from what they watch on the news.”
	But while the students had the best of intentions, it seemed they were preaching to the converted - that is, only attracting students already intricately familiar with Israel.
	The students set up their table on a busy corner of the campus, colorfully decorated with an Israeli flag, an American flag and glossy brochures about everything from the Israel Defense Force’s humanitarian missions to Israel’s contribution to green technology. All the material was well written and persuasive. However, these are the same types of flyers I saw on my own college campus more than six years ago - which were woefully inadequate back then at persuading students - and seemed like “old news” to those familiar with pro-Israel marketing materials. Passing out flyers like these on a busy campus is often similar to passing out flyers outside a restaurant - some people take them, but most don’t.
	While the event set out to combat Israeli Apartheid Week, it seemed to fail to attract the same audience. Many of the students who approached the table were obviously already involved with pro-Israel organizations on campus – they knew the tabling students’ names and were familiar with the materials being presented. Others looked uncomfortable approaching the table, let alone taking a flyer. And while the few students who did approach the table inquiring as to the nature of the event were met with exuberant and patient responses by the tabling students, I couldn’t help but wonder how Israel Peace Week could fulfill its mission without attracting the same audience as Israeli Apartheid Week, in order to present the “other side of the story.”
	There were also points of conflict among the tabling groups. Several organizations were present, but were hesitant to release their affiliation with “Israel Peace Week” as they didn’t want to be seen as directly opposing Israeli Apartheid Week, which was going on at the same time. In addition, they had their own Israel events coming up in the next month and didn’t want to confuse students. The multiplicity of affiliations and their lack of desire to be named alongside “Israel Peace Week” added levels of complexity that were unnecessary. While it is noble that these students are ambitious and want to host many events, are they all truly effective?
	Two prominent pro-Israel speakers who are formally associated with one of the most famous Zionist organizations in the United States spoke at the campus I visited. I can't help but wonder whether an event with a staunch pro-Israel speaker would really attract new students who have had limited exposure to Israel. Wouldn’t it be far more effective to have a strong debate between two varied speakers?
	I understand that I am probably biased. For one, I have studied the Middle East for more than eight years as well as Arabic and Islam. I have seen many, many speakers and flipped through many, many flyers - there is little that surprises or challenges me anymore within the realm of Israel advocacy. But I still believe there is room for innovation and recruitment in the world of Israel activism, like challenging preconceptions of Israel by showing images of Israel old and new, describing historical facts in a non-political way, and hosting cultural events.
	As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in his impassioned speech to Congress in 2011: Israelis don’t need to persuade those who are already believers, rather, they need to convince the skeptics. Former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat’s historic visit to the Knesset was a prime example of this: show the unbelievers your truth, and it is possible to sway even the most strident of critics.
	But while I felt that Israel Peace Week was preaching to the converted, I couldn’t entirely dismiss the event as a failure. There were absolutely some bright spots too. Meeting the students associated with the event was a highlight. They espoused publicly the desire to be “non-reactionary” to events like Israeli Apartheid Week, and showed great initiative in arranging events outside the structure of Hillel, the main Jewish campus organization, in order to attract students from non-traditional Israel advocacy backgrounds. Many expressed their efforts in creating events with other groups on campus, including the Ethiopian students and the Martial Arts community, as well as having logistical difficulties arranging events with groups that are not pro-Israel.
	With such passionate and capable students, pro-Israel organizations need to go further. Innovative programming that brings together students with varied political opinions is the best way to prove that Israel is a democratic country where diverse opinions are appreciated and accepted.
	It’s time we look to alternative ways of wowing our audiences and showing them the capable democracy that Israel is. As Sadat said at the Knesset, “We opened our heart to the peoples of the entire world to make them understand our motivations and objectives and actually to convince them of the fact that we are advocates of justice and peacemakers.” It’s time our pro-Israel efforts do the same.

<title>Frankfurt ripped for honoring Jewish-American scholar who backs Israel boycott</title>
<date>Fri Sep 07 10:24:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Protests are mounting against plans by the city of Frankfurt to honor Jewish-American scholar Judith Butler, a staunch critic of Israel.
	The Central Council of Jews in Germany and the political activist group Scholars for Peace in the Middle East are among groups that have slammed the city for choosing to honor Butler with its Theodor W. Adorno Prize on Sept. 11. The $63,000 prize is awarded every three years for “outstanding performances in the fields of philosophy, music, theater and film.”
	Butler is a supporter of the United States Campaign for the Academic & Cultural Boycott of Israel and also participated in the Canadian Israeli Apartheid Week in 2011.
	Stephan Kramer, general secretary of the Central Council, reportedly called the choice of Butler, whom he said supports boycotts against Israel but considers Hamas and Hezbollah legitimate social movements, "outrageous."
	But Frankfurt Deputy Mayor in Charge of Cultural Affairs Felix Semmelroth, a member of the board that decided last week to honor Butler, said in a recent statement to JTA that the board of trustees at its May 30 meeting was "of the unanimous opinion that the Adorno Prize should go to Judith Butler for her comprehensive work on gender theory."
	Semmelroth wrote that "the incriminating statements that are now coming out were not the subject of discussion [by the trustees] and were clearly unknown to them; and they also don't change anything regarding the importance of the work of Judith Butler."
	Planners of a protest demonstration called for Sept. 11 in Frankfurt also circulated a petition in which they noted, among other things, that Butler boycotts universities in Tel Aviv - an official partner city with Frankfurt - "but has no problem delivering lectures at the Bir Zeit University, which evidence shows is dominated by supporters of Hamas and Hezbollah."
	Butler defended herself in a Sept. 1 editorial published in two German newspapers, saying that she did not take attacks from German Jewish leaders personally. Rather, she wrote, the attacks are "directed against everyone who is critical against Israel and its current policies."
	Frankfurt's mayor, Peter Feldmann, the city's first Jewish mayor since 1933 and a member of the Social Democratic Party, was not involved in the decision to honor Butler. His predecessor, Petra Roth, of the conservative Christian Democratic Union Party, was on the board that chose Butler.
	Theodor W. Adorno (1903-1969), for whom the prize is named, was the son of a Catholic mother and Jewish father. He survived the Third Reich in exile and returned to become one of Germany’s foremost sociologists, philosophers and art critics, particularly known for his criticism of fascism and for his writings on the Holocaust.

<title>IDF soldiers instructed to bar non-Jewish citizens from settlement</title>
<date>Wed Sep 19 18:22:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Soldiers guarding Bat Ayin were instructed by the West Bank settlement's military security coordinator not to allow any non-Jew – even ones with Israeli identity cards -- through the settlement gate.
	One of the soldiers stationed at the settlement said that the request from the coordinator, who is their professional superior, was clear and explicit:
	“It was specific -- only to allow entry to Jews with blue [Israeli] identity cards. Let’s say a Druze or a Bedouin with a blue ID [would try to enter], someone coming to clean the bathrooms – no.”
	The soldier said he had mixed feelings about the order. “It felt just like apartheid, or things that recall dark times and the Holocaust – that you allow someone entry to a specific place based only on his religion.”
	Following a Haaretz query to the army, it was made clear to the Bat Ayin security coordinator that forbidding entry to non-Jewish Israeli citizens is outside the guidelines for settlement security coordinators. Nevertheless, soldiers will be required to report to the local security coordinator any time a non-Jewish Israeli citizen is admitted, to ensure they be accompanied while they are in the settlement.
	Every IDF career army service officer is required to do a week of “securing communities” – a routine tour of duty to maintain security in communities on the West Bank, the Jordan Valley and the area around Kerem Shalom in the south. The local security coordinators, who are professionally subordinate to the IDF Central Command, draft the soldiers’ orders.
	The IDF issues guidelines – including those concerning orders to open fire -- on a regular basis to security coordinators in the West Bank and Jordan Valley.
	Regional defense brigades in these areas have a district defense officer, whose job is to maintain contact with settlement security coordinators. Salaries of the security coordinators are paid through local authorities and there is close cooperation between local officials.
	The IDF says that there are 265 security coordinators stationed along all the confrontation lines, including communities near the Gaza border and in the Kerem Shalom salient. The budget for training, equipping and paying the security coordinators comes to NIS 38 million.
	The local security coordinator has broad authority, including the right to ask a person to identify himself and to detain him if necessary until the arrival of army or police officers. There have been incidents in which security coordinators acted as local “sheriffs,” harassing and threatening Palestinians.
	The IDF Spokesman confirmed the instruction to bar non-Jews is illegal. “The IDF instructs the ongoing security coordinators in the communities in security procedures, and naturally there exists no instruction to forbid the entry of citizens who are not Jews.
	“In response to the query by the report, the incident was investigated, and indeed such an order was issued by the [Bat Ayin] security coordinator. As a result, it was clarified in the IDF that this is an illegal instruction.
	“Similarly, because at issue is a complex and sensitive issue, and to prevent possible confrontations, an order was issued to inform the security coordinators when non-Jewish Israeli citizens enter, so they can be accompanied during their entry to the community.”

<title>Is Batman the most Jewish superhero?</title>
<date>Sun Aug 05 13:32:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
In Batman Begins, the first of Christopher Nolan’s Batman films, a young Bruce Wayne falls into a well and is rescued by his father, Thomas. As Thomas carries Bruce to safety, he reassuringly tells him, “Why do we fall, Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.” Nolan’s films are, essentially, meditations on – and vindications of – this wisdom, that trauma can strengthen us, that falling can help us learn to rise.
Consider the story arc of Nolan’s Batman: a young boy’s parents are murdered in front of him. Years later, the boy, now grown up, becomes a vigilante so he can help rid the city of the corruption and crime that led not only to the death of his parents but also contributes to the suffering of millions. He believes that his combination of wealth, intelligence, and training uniquely positions him to redeem Gotham. In so doing, though, he suffers many additional traumas: a sociopath murders the love of his life; a terrorist physically and mentally tortures him. These devastate Bruce, and even incapacitate him for a time. But his response is always to rise again as Batman, each time a better, smarter, more connected, more emotionally mature iteration of himself. When he falls, Bruce reflects on the meaning of those setbacks; he seeks guidance from wise mentors; he meditates about his purpose; he believes, despite the darkness he faces, that things can be better.
According to psychologist Robin S. Rosenberg, Nolan’s Bruce Wayne exemplifies a phenomenon that University of North Carolina researchers have termed “Post-Traumatic Growth.” According to recent studies, some, after a major crisis or traumatic event, bounce back to “normal.” Others develop disorders (like PTSD) or even engage in antisocial or hostile behavior. But many experience positive change. These people grow to see new life opportunities, develop closer relationships, connect more deeply with others who suffer, feel stronger and more self-confident, appreciate life more fully, and/or become more spiritually awake. For example, when a cancer survivor vows to hold his loved ones closer and to live each day more fully, that’s PTG.
PTG can also be marked by a turn to social activism, a passion for saving the world. Candice Lightner, for instance, founded Mothers Against Drunk Driving after a drunk driver killed her daughter, and Nelson Mandela organized South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission after being brutalized under apartheid.
Interestingly, research shows that we can, in a sense, inoculate ourselves to grow after a trauma, train ourselves to rise from the ashes. Taking time to think and permitting oneself to be pained increases the likelihood of PTG. Additionally, it helps to confront one’s feelings with some process of self-disclosure (like writing, talking, or praying). Social support is also crucial. Finally, religious faith is a powerful tool. It can help cultivate a necessary optimism, a belief that life is worth living, and a hopeful conviction that things can be made better. Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania is currently helping American troops cultivate these skills to immunize them against PTSD. We can adopt them, too.
All of this should be fairly obvious to practicing Jews.
These inoculating practices are integral to the process of Jewish mourning. Shivah, the seven-day period following the death of a close relative, involves many of these components: the mourner is supposed to be free of mundane distractions like cooking and cleaning so they can focus on confronting and reflecting upon their pain. Community members are expected to visit the mourner, offering support, comfort, and an open ear to listen to the mourner’s self-disclosure. The mourner is given additional opportunities for self-disclosure through prayer, and is invited three times a day to recite the Kaddish, a prayer that optimistically reaffirms the orderliness and purposefulness of life.
Individuals renew this process several times a year during the Yizkor, or memorial service. Yizkor gives the mourner the opportunity to recall the pain of the loss, to ruminate over the emotions the loss elicits, and, ultimately, to pledge to give to charity in memory of the deceased. In Yizkor, we declare that the appropriate response to trauma is working to make the world a better, more just place.
We also do this communally. Take Tisha B’Av, the saddest day on the Jewish calendar, for example. We observe this day by fasting to confront and reflect upon our collective pain. We self-disclose by praying, chanting Lamentations, and singing dirges. We gather with community, offering each other support and comfort. And, most importantly, we annually reconstruct a narrative: Destruction results not because of physical weakness but because of moral decay; while devastation and exile makes the world appear bleak, such a state of affairs is only temporary, and a new dawn will rise; we can accelerate redemption by turning back to God. This narrative carries us from Tisha B’Av through the High Holy Days. During those seven weeks, we read selections from the prophets in synagogue that offer words of consolation and hope, reminding us that redemption will be at hand if only we would turn our lives around to invite it.
In recent weeks, the horrific bombing of Israeli tourists in Bulgaria, the massacre of civilians in Syria, and the tragic slaughter of innocent moviegoers in Colorado, have left many of us feeling traumatized. But scientific discovery and the Jewish tradition remind us that when we fall, we can learn to pick ourselves up. We can experience trauma, and, afterward, grow.

<title>Jewish students should take Israeli Apartheid Week with a pinch of salt</title>
<date>Mon Feb 27 10:49:48 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	As the eighth annual Israeli Apartheid Week is gearing up at colleges around the world, anti-Semitism on campuses is, once again, a hot topic. Every Jewish campus organization throws their lot in with Israeli Apartheid Week, using it to highlight what they see as the victimhood of Jewish students. They are, however, missing the point.
	That Israeli Apartheid week is hateful, ignorant and just plain stupid is beyond doubt. It's a gross exaggeration of the flaws of Israel with no regard paid to the good, and it alienates many students, polarizing campuses and, sometimes, causing confrontation. But isn't that what college is all about?
	College is the birthplace of exaggerated emotions and extreme ideologies. Thankfully, it is also normally their graveyard. It's the place where people go to learn that ideas exist, and it normally takes them nearly all of their time there to realize that most of those ideas are only any good if, like beer and whisky, they are taken in moderation. If not, then you just get drunk on them and do stupid things. Since getting drunk on beer and whisky and doing stupid things is pretty much the hallmark of most people's college experiences (especially in the progressive, predominantly liberal-arts schools where Israeli Apartheid Week takes place) then why do we get so upset when they do the same thing with their ideas as they do with their Bud Light?
	Sure, it creates a hostile environment for Jewish students, but college is a hostile environment for any student denomination, especially if you ask them. My work on college campuses as well as my own, admittedly scant, time studying on them, has shown me time and again that absolutely everybody feels discriminated against; Jewish students think everyone's an anti-Semite, Muslim students complain that everyone thinks they're terrorists, feminist students complain about patriarchy, while white male students complain that the “reverse racism” of affirmative action means they can't get ahead. A good friend of mine is still annoyed by his university's refusal to fund his “Students of Irish Heritage” club.
	"All we needed was $800 for Jameson, a Guinness keg and a dartboard," he told me, "but they denied our right to cultural self-expression."
	The thing is, they are all justified in what they say, except for my Irish friend, who (I hope) is joking, and the white males; they really do have it easy.
	Yes, Jews can have a tough time on campus, and Israeli Apartheid Week is a part of that. Students shouldn't be forced to feel uncomfortable about their ethnic origins and anti-Semitism is, on principle, unacceptable. However, everyone is discriminated against, racism is real, and it's alive and well on college campuses. It's not just aimed at Jews.
	Anyway, if it's that bad, why not just move to Israel? Sure there are quite a lot of wars and some terrorism, and the Iranians might bomb you at any given moment, but I promise you that you won't be made to feel uncomfortable by some ignorant and self-important student during Israeli Apartheid Week.

<title>Planned Upper Nazareth road would allow Jewish residents to avoid driving through Arab town of Kafr Kana </title>
<date>Wed Jul 11 03:52:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	The Transportation Ministry has begun planning a road to connect Upper Nazareth directly with the Golani Junction, so that residents no longer have to drive through the Arab town of Kafr Kana.
	The Upper Nazareth municipality has been trying for some time to persuade the ministry to build the road, which Mayor Shimon Gapso defines as an "existential issue" for the town's primarily Jewish residents. Now the ministry has agreed to have the Israel National Roads Company plan and build the road.
	The Golani Junction is a key intersection on Route 77, a major traffic artery in the Galilee. The new Route 6500 linking it to Upper Nazareth will be built mainly on state lands, but some land will have to be expropriated from Arab residents of the area. Gapso said the new road will not be accessible from Kafr Kana, but insisted its residents will benefit anyway. If Upper Nazareth residents use the new road, "that will reduce traffic in Kafr Kana," he said. The ministry said it hasn't yet decided whether to link the new road to Kafr Kana.
	Route 6500 also has "strategic importance," Gapso said, because Israeli-Palestinian violence frequently prompts demonstrations in Kafr Kana that result in the closure of the existing road. Now, he said, "Upper Nazareth won't be shut in" every time a demonstration occurs. "This isn't a road for Jews," he insisted, but as "the largest Jewish city in the Galilee," Upper Nazareth needs its own link to the rest of the region, he maintained.
	While admitting that the new road would be devastating for Kafr Kana's merchants, Gapso said this was outweighed by the time residents of his city would save. "It takes 20 minutes to drive two kilometers in Kafr Kana, and 30 to 35 minutes on weekends," he said.
	Prof. Rassem Khamaisi of Haifa University, in contrast, said the new road would create a system of "apartheid roads."
	"There will be one road for Jews and another for Arabs," said Khamaisi, past president of the Israel Geographical Society who himself lives in Kafr Kana. He termed the decision "harmful, tension-increasing and racist," but said it was also wrong from a strictly professional standpoint, as it would sever both Upper Nazareth and Kafr Kana from their respective neighbors.
	Kafr Kana currently has 20,000 residents, and is expected to grow to 35,000 by 2025. Its main road, Route 754, is indeed badly overcrowded, as all the region's residents - including Upper Nazareth's 50,000 people - currently use it to get to and from Route 77. During most of the day, it is one long traffic jam.
	Previous plans for solving the problem called for building a ring road around Kafr Kana to which multiple towns in the area would have access. A road that will instead help only one community, Khamaisi said, is "mistaken and outrageous."
	But Gapso said Route 6500 is needed primarily to keep his town from being besieged as it was during the Arab riots of October 2000, when rioters blocked major roads throughout the Galilee and assaulted and seriously wounded a Jewish driver at nearby Beit Rimon Junction.
	In 2010, Gapso noted, demonstrators commemorating the anniversary of those riots blocked Route 754, and some again stoned passing cars. That was when he decided the new road was an "existential issue."
	Ironically, the national road company is currently working on a different plan, Route 786, which would bypass Kafr Kana to the west, instead of to the east, as Route 6500 would. But Khamaisi doesn't like that plan, either. What is needed, he said, is a road to serve "all the region's residents," not one that would come "at Kafr Kana's expense" and could hurt its development.
	The company said it is currently examining nine possible routes for Route 786, which is meant to serve Jewish and Arab residents of the region alike, and is to be guided solely by professional considerations. But it stressed that Route 786 isn't an alternative to Route 6500 - the two serve different functions based on their different locations, it noted.

<title>Stevie Wonder to pull out of IDF fundraiser</title>
<date>Thu Nov 29 08:59:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Stevie Wonder is set to pull out of a performance at a fundraiser for the Israel Defense Forces, a source told JTA. 	Wonder's representatives will claim that he did not know the nature of the group, the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, and that he believes such a performance would be incongruent with his status as a UN "Messenger of Peace," according to a source who has read email exchanges between Wonder's representatives and organizers of the event. 	Wonder was scheduled to headline the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces annual gala in Los Angeles on Dec. 6. The event raises millions of dollars annually to support the Israeli military. 	An official of Friends of the IDF, reached at its Los Angeles office, had no comment. Wonder's agent at Creative Artists Agency did not return a request for comment. 	The spokesman for the UN Secretary General also had no comment on the matter. 	The United Nations does not impose restrictions on its goodwill representatives. Wonder most recently performed at a UN concert commemorating its 67th anniversary. Elie Wiesel, the Nobele Peace Laureate and Holocaust memoirist who is also a staunch defender of Israel is also a UN Messenger of Peace. 	Wonder had come under intense social media pressure to pull out of the event. An online petition calling on him to cancel his performance had garnered more than 3,600 signatures. 	The petition was launched more than a day ago on the change.org website. 	"You were arrested in 1985 protesting South African Apartheid, now we ask you: please remember that apartheid is apartheid, whether it comes from White Afrikaaner settlers of South Africa or from Jewish Israelis in Israel," the petition reads. "Desmond Tutu has recognized that Israel’s Apartheid is worse than South Africa’s -- will you stand with us against apartheid and cancel your performance at the IDF fundraiser." 	A second petition, launched by the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, calls on Wonder to "(p)lease continue your legacy of speaking out for the oppressed. Please be a 'full-time lover' of justice by standing on the right side of history and canceling your performance for the Israeli army." 	Wonder performed at a 1998 gala honoring Israel's 50th anniversary.

<title>U.S. Jews battle apartheid charges made against Israel</title>
<date>Thu Feb 16 03:38:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
This is a busy time in the calendar of an Israeli journalist in the United States. AIPAC and J Street are holding their annual conferences, Washington think tanks are discussing the Arab Spring, Iran and Syria. And then there is the 8th annual Israel Apartheid Week coming up  (February 26 - March 3) with the usual discussions, films and photo exhibitions, flashmobs and an apartheid poster contest offering a $400 dollar prize. For the most part, the pro-Israeli community hasn't yet figured out the best way to deal with this event, and so they opt to ignore it.
But there are a few exceptions. Among those who have chosen to confront the apartheid events are 75 universities across North America  (up from 50 last year) that are holding "the Israel peace week," where they will try to convey the message that "Israel wants peace and has demonstrated its willingness to make painful sacrifices for peace."
"You refer to 'pro-Palestinian activists' but most of those aggressive people are anti-Israel, not pro-Palestinian," says Natalie Menaged, education director of the independent NPO, the Hasbara Fellowships, which trained the Jewish student organizers of the "Israeli peace week."
"I have yet to see them organize a national campaign to teach about Palestinian culture or plans for peace. They are only interested in propagating hatred of Israel. Our campaign, Peace Week, is more pro-Palestinian than anything the anti-Israel organizers are doing because we are actually discussing solutions."
Menaged says the idea of "Israel peace week" - which will run from February 20 to March 9 - is "to engage the people in the middle, not the anti-Israel movement." The campus organizers vary, and in many instances, are a combination of Jewish and non-Jewish students, who developed the concepts of the event on their own. The organization, however, provided them with print materials, films and speakers, if requested. This year's materials include quotes of each Republican candidate, as well as President Obama, regarding their positions on Israel.
Menaged believes that this approach has proved successful. "At places like Berkeley or Rutgers University or Carleton University  (Ottawa ), which have a history of anti-Israel activity, supporters of Israel have been able to change the conversation to one about what needs to be done for peace. And at the majority of schools, which don't have a lot of anti-Israel activity - schools like Boston University, University of Illinois, Ohio State University, Johns Hopkins University - it is an excellent way to start the conversation", she says.

The J Street approach 
J Street executive director Jeremy Ben-Ami has a different approach to Israeli Apartheid Week. When asked what the activists of J Street U, the leftist lobby's campus network, are planning in response, he says: "I think there is more interest in it in media than on college campuses. We condemn it, but there is no purpose in organizing around something that is so marginal. A handful of students attend those Israel apartheid events.
"I think the majority of Jewish students want to support Israel in a way that allows them to ask questions or criticize Israeli or American policy when they feel it's appropriate, but to do it in a context of loving Israel. They don't relate to boycotts," says Ben-Ami. "We have over 750 students this year in our national conference, up from 500 a year ago, and we now have chapters in over 40 college campuses, which is double what we had last year. So we are seeing the formula of pro-Israeli and pro-peace as far more attractive for the Jewish American students than either the hard-line Israel right, or the "Israel is always wrong" approach of folks who organize the Israel apartheid week."
Ben-Ami says he regrets the near absence of talk about the peace process in the presidential campaign. "The U.S. presidential election year is not going to be a year for significant American leadership towards diplomacy and peace. It's J Street's hope that whether President Obama wins the reelection, or someone else wins the election, in 2013 we'll return to a serious discussion of what is actually in the best interest of the U.S. and the Middle East. In the campaign year, this is not a serious discussion. It's a deep shame for Israel and the U.S.
Who's pro-Israel? 
"There are certain Republican candidates", Ben-Ami continues,"Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, some of the others who dropped out, who are using the term 'pro-Israel,' but promoting policies that are clearly not in Israel's long-term interests. Most Israelis would agree that the annexation of the territories, the notion that the Palestinian people don't exist - these are policies that to my mind are simply outside the frame of the debate in Israel," he says. Ben-Ami draws a distinction between candidates like "Newt Gingrich who say the Palestinian people are an invented people" and President Obama who "talks about Israel's survival and long-term security as being dependent on the two-state solution.
"The president is very clearly committed to a two-state solution, and some of the Republicans are essentially abandoning decades of bipartisan American foreign policy, and moving in a completely different direction. I don't include Mitt Romney in that - I didn't hear him saying anything policy-wise on that."
Regarding the Arab Spring, Ben-Ami paraphrases a metaphor used by Ami Ayalon, a former MK, navy commander and Shin Bet security service chief."When you are a captain of the ship, and you see really bad weather rolling in, there is nothing you can do to change the weather. But you are in charge of the course of your ship. So the weather in the Middle East - whether it's the results of the elections in Egypt or Iran or the chaos generally - is not good. But decisions about what the Israeli policy should be, or the American policy should be, are in Israeli hands. And the wise thing for Israel and the U.S. would be to find a long-term peace and long-term acceptance into the region, by working towards diplomatic resolution of the conflict that results in two states. So the circumstances are not good, and the security situation is deteriorating, but this is the time to pursue serious diplomatic efforts with Iran. Military action is not necessarily going to be effective, and it only deepens the conflict."

<title>Wayne Firestone stepping down as CEO of Hillel</title>
<date>Sat Sep 22 15:54:46 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
After seven years as chief executive at Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life, Wayne Firestone will be stepping down from his post in June 2013.
Firestone, who has worked at Hillel for more than a decade and served as its CEO since 2005, spent Thursday and Friday informing the organization’s top board leaders and staffers about his decision to resign as the head of the international campus organization. He took over Hillel after the much-heralded tenure of Richard Joel, who left to become president of Yeshiva University, and Avram Infeld, who guided the organization through the transitional period after Joel's departure.
“The organization is poised to grow to a new scale, in order to accommodate the rapid growth in student participation in the United States that we have driven over the past several years (from 33 percent to 45 percent student involvement from 2005 to 2012, according to a formal study),” Firestone said in a statement to Hillel leaders and staff. “This effort will require strong senior leadership and new financial resources.”
Firestone said he is not sure what he will do next but that he wishes to remain active in Jewish affairs.
In recent years, Firestone has pushed for more programming aimed at Jewish students who don't venture into their campus Hillel buildings, with an emphasis on peer-to-peer outreach, and organizing and supporting activities at other venues.
Firestone’s tenure coincided with the rise of the pro-Palestinian campaign to get universities to divest from Israel and paint its government as an apartheid regime. Arguing that exposure to Israel and Israelis is the most effective response to efforts to demonize the Jewish state, Firestone has attempted to position Hillel as an unapologetic defender of Israel’s democratic character and of Israel's vital importance to the Jewish people. At the same time, he has argued for the need to provide students with space to engage in open and critical dialogue about Israel and Israeli policies, and warned that today’s students would reject efforts to indoctrinate them on how to think about Middle East issues.
Thomas Blumberg, chairman of Hillel's board of directors, praised Firestone’s support for innovative programs, but he said that this moment is an appropriate time for transition.
“By every measure, the innovative peer-to-peer approach he championed has resulted in higher student involvement with Hillel than we have seen in decades, and in many more students seeking to deepen their Jewish identity and skills,” Blumberg said in a statement.
“Wayne led Hillel during a period of extraordinary innovation. Now that much of that innovation has borne fruit, we will - following the roadmap in our recently passed five-year strategic plan - move to a phase of bringing the new engagement approaches to more campuses and students and deepening them where they have already succeeded,” he added.
Edgar Bronfman, a one of Hillel’s leading philanthropic supporters, was also quoted as praising Firestone. “He has led nothing less than a historic transformation,” Bronfman was quoted as saying in the Hillel statement.

<title>Absorption Minister: Ethiopian immigrants should be grateful to Israel</title>
<date>Wed Jan 11 15:44:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Immigration Absorption Minister Sofa Landver responded Wednesday to recent protests against discrimination of Ethiopian immigrants, and said that they should be grateful for what they have received from Israel.
About 2,000 people gathered on Tuesday to demonstrate against racism in Kiryat Malakhi, after members of the Ethiopian immigrant community said that local homeowners' committees refuse to sell them apartments. They were joined by hundreds of people who came from around the country to support them.
Knesset members from various parties gathered with representatives of the Ethiopian community on Wednesday for an emergency discussion on the topic.
After one of the Ethiopian representatives, Gadi Desta, told the MKs that "apartheid" was taking place, Landver said, "You need to be grateful for what you have received."
Earlier, Desta said that he has no complaints against the residents of Kiryat Malachi, but he does against the Knesset members, who he called "hypocritical."
"The gap between Ethiopian immigrants and the rest of the citizens is years apart – but the State of Israel is doing everything to absorb them in the best possible way – be grateful for what you received."
The Coalition Against Racism in Israel, which organized transportation to the Kiryat Malakhi protest from a few locations around the country, partnered with local residents who began planning the demonstration last week, along with organizations representing the Ethiopian community.
"Racism harms us all, and it is impossible to separate the discrimination against Ethiopians in Israel from the discrimination against Arabs or Russian-speakers," said Rabia Elsagir of Shfaram, a coordinator for CARI who came to the protest with a small number of Israeli Arabs.
The Association for Civil Rights in Israel issued a statement condemning discrimination against the Ethiopian community. The organization said the extraordinary session of the Knesset Committee for Immigration, Absorption and Diaspora Affairs convening tomorrow to discuss the issue should put forth legislation prohibiting discrimination in housing.
"The authorities must clearly state that they do not accept displays of racism and discrimination, and are taking clear and decisive steps to eradicate them," ACRI said in the statement. The organization is seeking a legal amendment that would give the Real Estate Registrar the authority to suspend or even cancel the license of a real estate agent who discriminates against clients on the basis of their ethnic origin.
The association said that real estate agencies in Kiryat Malakhi that allegedly engaged in discriminatory practices could face fines of up to NIS 150,600 for violating the law prohibiting discrimination in regard to goods and services.
"I'm tired of hearing all the time about such cases. This time it reached our door so we decided to raise our voices, but we're protesting on behalf of the entire society, not just the Ethiopian community," said Shay Wanda, 31, a captain in the army reserves who has lived in Kiryat Malakhi since 1994.
"It's the first time we young people are joining with the older people and going out together to protest against racism in Israeli society," Wanda said. "I was in the standing army for three years, I lost friends in military operations, and I am part of this country. At the end of the day we all have the same blood - skin color isn't what counts," he said.

<title>French parliament report accuses Israel of water 'apartheid' in West Bank </title>
<date>Tue Jan 17 01:20:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
The French parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee published an unprecedented report two weeks ago accusing Israel of implementing "apartheid" policies in its allocation of water resources in the West Bank.
Want updates on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Join Haaretz.com's official Facebook page
The Israeli Embassy in Paris had no foreknowledge of the report and thus did not refute it or work to moderate it. Foreign Ministry officials called the incident "a serious diplomatic mishap."
The report said that water has become "a weapon serving the new apartheid" and gave examples and statistics that ostensibly back this claim.
"Some 450,000 Israeli settlers on the West Bank use more water than the 2.3 million Palestinians that live there," the report said. "In times of drought, in contravention of international law, the settlers get priority for water."
The author of the report was Socialist Party MP Jean Glavany, who in the past served as agriculture minister under French President Lionel Jospin and as cabinet secretary for President Francois Mitterrand.
The Foreign Affairs Committee had assigned Glavany to report on the geopolitical impact of water in confrontation zones throughout the world. He visited Israel and the Palestinian territories on May 17-19 of last year and met with several senior government officials, including Energy and Water Resources Minister Uzi Landau and Water Commissioner Uri Shani.
Both the Foreign Ministry and the embassy in Paris were aware of the visit and knew that Glavany planned to write a report. But Israeli Ambassador to France Yossi Gal did not follow up on Glavany's work.
No one in the embassy attempted to get a draft copy of the report so as to ensure that its conclusions were not overly harsh. Nor were Israel's allies on the French Foreign Affairs Committee contacted to ascertain whether the report could be moderated.
The embassy only learned about the report a few days after it appeared on the French parliament's website, when the Foreign Ministry's European desk in Jerusalem, which heard about it from an outside source, informed the embassy.
The report states that water is not allocated fairly to West Bank Palestinians and that Palestinians have no access to the territory's underground aquifers. Glavany said Israel was perpetrating a "water occupation" against the Palestinians.
"Israel's territorial expansion is seen as a 'water occupation' of both streams and aquifers," the report said.
It also said that "the separation wall being built by Israel allows it to control access to underground water sources" and to "direct the flow of water westward."
The report accused Israel of "systematically destroying wells that were dug by Palestinians on the West Bank," as well as of deliberately bombing reservoirs in the Gaza Strip in 2008-09. It also claimed that "Many water purification facilities planned by the Palestinian Water Ministry are being 'blocked' by the Israeli administration."
Senior Foreign Ministry officials said the Paris embassy had been asleep at the switch.
"This report is a serious mishap that has caused diplomatic damage and has seriously damaged Israel's image in France," one senior official said.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said Glavany had inserted extreme terms into the report on his own, at the last minute, without consulting other members of the report's working group.
"These unacceptable remarks surprised his colleagues in the working group, who were shocked to find them in the final version after it was published, after Israeli diplomats called their attention to them," Palmor said.
The report, he continued, "was loaded with the language of vicious propaganda, far removed from any professional criticism with which one could argue intelligently." Moreover, the report's author omitted numerous facts and acted "with blatant tendentiousness."
"After embassy staffers pointed out the exceptional seriousness of the wording ... all the working group members disassociated themselves from [the report], including the chairman, who sent an official letter to the ambassador renouncing responsibility for the report's anti-Israel expressions," Palmor added.

<title>If there are no Palestinians, there's no Israeli occupation </title>
<date>Tue Jul 10 02:36:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	The Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits occupying powers from settling their own populations in occupied lands. But that's not a problem for Israel, according to the committee set up by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman to examine construction in the West Bank, because Israel is not a "military occupier" in the territories.
 The panel said it based its finding on the fact that the area was conquered from Jordan, which it said never had a solid legal claim and has since forfeited any interest in the land. In any case, the committee has decided that the Geneva Convention's prohibition is not relevant to Jewish settlement in the West Bank, given the Balfour Declaration and the British Mandate, whose documents referred to a national home for the Jews in Palestine and did not mention any national rights of the Arabs.
	In the eyes of the committee, headed by former Supreme Court Justice Edmond Levy, the West Bank is part of the area meant to serve as the Jewish national home; Israel never committed itself to observing the Geneva Convention in these lands and has allowed Israelis to live there. The reliance on the Balfour Declaration demonstrates that the Netanyahu-appointed committee appears to be living in colonial times, during which Britain had the authority to determine the future of a territory, and isn't aware that nowadays we recognize the rights of peoples to self-determination.
	These declarations, of course, ignore the existence of a Palestinian population in these areas and the fact that when we talk today about the occupation, we are speaking first and foremost about the occupied population, which is being denied its right to self-determination.
	It must be noted that the committee's declarations aren't exactly news. After 1967, Israel took the official position that since the territories had not been captured from a country that was sovereign there, they aren't exactly occupied territory, so the Geneva Convention doesn't apply to them. Moreover, the prohibition against an occupying country transferring its population to an occupied area is irrelevant if people move there of their own accord.
	Still, Israel had not categorically denied is status as occupier, and did agree to take on a different aspect of an occupier's legal obligations, as laid out in the Hague Convention. Practically speaking, the whole legal structure of Israeli control over the territories was based on this differentiation, backed by ostensibly formal arguments that distinguish between the two conventions.
	Thus, since 1967, Israel has been trying to have it both ways. On the one hand, it accepts the authority vested in the army that controls the conquered area, as per the Hague Convention, while on the other hand denying its obligations to the residents of the occupied area and denying their rights as laid out in the Geneva Convention. Thus there was a blurring of the legal status of the territories, as occupied or not occupied, that for all these years has been the heart of the occupation's legal structure.
	The Levy Committee seems to be taking this a step further, in that it says that these territories are not occupied territory at all, in order to reject the argument calling for application of the Geneva Convention. But in doing so, the committee totally ignores the ramifications of such a declaration on the legality of exercising the Israel Defense Forces' authority in the territories, which were based on the Hague Convention.
	In hundreds, if not thousands of rulings made by the High Court of Justice, the court accepted the state's position that the army is permitted to seize Palestinian lands for military purposes (for example, to build the security barrier ), based on the authority of the military commander in an area under belligerent occupation, or, in other words, military occupation.
	The Levy Committee's conclusions, therefore, are very helpful in piercing the veil of legal hypocrisy behind Israeli control in the territories: If it's an occupation, then the whole body of occupation law applies, making all the settlements - and here there is no distinction between "settlements" and "outposts" - illegal. On the other hand, if we're not talking about an occupation, then everything the military commanders have been doing all this time was unauthorized and it must thus return to the Palestinians any and all lands that were seized.
	What is left after the piercing of the veil? The Levy Committee does not give an answer.
	Unlike the committee's conclusions, the territories – as determined by Israel's High Court of Justice and the International Court of Justice – are occupied; however, it is true that for a long time now Israel does not rule them the way occupied territories should be ruled.
	What would you call an occupation where the occupying state inhabits its citizens while exploiting its ground, water and other natural resources? And what would you call a regime where two populations live under different law, applied according to their nationality? If any good could come out of the Levy committee, is the unveiling of the hypocrisy that under the perception of occupation lays a regime which better resembles a combination of colonialism and apartheid.

<title>Israeli parents urge minister to cancel school trips to West Bank</title>
<date>Wed Jan 04 01:28:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Hundreds of parents have signed a petition over the past two days refusing to allow their children to attend school field trips over the Green Line.
The petition, signed by 500 parents as of Tuesday night, was started after Education Minister Gideon Sa'ar announced recently that school trips would now visit the archaeological site of Shiloh in the northern West Bank. Some months ago, Sa'ar made the controversial decision that school children would be taken to visit the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron.
"Your political agenda is clear to us and it should be said in your favor that you do not bother to hide it. But your political positions are different and in fact in opposition to ours and therefore we cannot allow our sons and daughters to take a trip to Hebron, Shiloh or the rest of the sites and settlement beyond the agreed-on borders of Israel," the petition states.
The petition was signed "Concerned Mothers and Fathers throughout the country."
The petition also called on Sa'ar, as "education minister of all Israelis" to "direct school trips to areas that our children can visit. If you do not, our children will be excluded from an important social and educational experience."
Jerusalemite Tamar Verta started the petition. "If we don't inform the school administration that they must plan trips within the Green Line, we will find our children visiting Yitzhar and Havat Ma'on," she said, referring to two Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
One parent, Ehud Inbar of Modi'in, said he did not oppose trips to Hebron and the Tomb of the Patriarchs, "but only after a Palestinian state has been established with which we have a peace treaty. Then the children can visit there the way people visit Egypt or Jordan. I oppose holding trips like this under the current situation where there are citizens 'grade b or c' there."
Inbar also said he would consider changing his mind about the visit to Hebron, "if the Palestinians were at least allowed to present their side. But these trips are not innocent. They are intended to strengthen students' relationship to places that, to me at least, it's clear won't remain under Israeli control."
Rafi Getenyo, a father of two from Rishon Letzion, said he saw two problems with the trips.
"The first is security and the second is moral," he said. "I don't think a face of normalcy should be given to the occupation, and that is after all the intent of the organizers of these trips."
Getenyo said he thought the children were being cynically used for political purposes.
"I don't want my children to be taken on apartheid roads, with a jeep in front and a jeep behind, and for them to feel that this is totally normal," he said, referring to a military escort.
Getenyo said his children understood his position, but did not always agree. He said when other parents allow their children to go "with their eyes shut to institutional reasons, that places a bulldozer of pressure on me. They feel different and they don't like it," he said.

<title>Israeli society is tainted by racism</title>
<date>Fri Jan 20 01:18:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	I hate writing about racism. It is such a heavy and deadening word, though people seem to glibly toss it around. I feel that accusing a person of being a racist, or ascribing racism to entire groups and societies, is such a terrible charge that it does not allow us to carry on a rational debate once it has been made. It just taints everything and everyone, and the moment it is out there, we can't trust ourselves to say or even think freely, lest we be associated and tarred by the same brush.
	We don't think of ourselves or the ones we love as racists. If a friend or family member lets slip an ethnic slur or bigoted remark, we make up some kind of excuse in our mind. It was just a careless utterance, we say to ourselves; she's a bit old-fashioned and not entirely aware of today's sensibilities; he just expressed himself badly, that wasn't actually what he meant.
	Of course we can't be close to a racist. Even when it's not people we personally know, if they resemble us at all - not members of a closed and blinkered community or citizens of some other backward country, but just ordinary people - we don't want to believe they are racists. Racism is a heinous crime, like being a murderer. Only twisted and depraved individuals are capable of it, not people like you and me.
	The very idea that 120 homeowners in Kiryat Malakhi, ordinary mainstream Israelis, signed a secret undertaking not to sell or rent their apartments to Israeli-Ethiopian families - as reported by Channel 2 last week - is so awful that I really want to believe the denials, as faint as they are. A few residents who were prepared to voice crude and vulgar opinions on screen can be explained away as ill-educated misfits, but 120 of them? But the fact remains, not one Israeli-Ethiopian lives in those four new apartment towers, though some have tried to rent there. And this in a town with a sizable Ethiopian community that suffers housing shortages.
	What makes this story even more awful is that, since I can't fathom every one of those 120 owners being racist, I start making excuses for them in my mind. They are not to be blamed for the housing market, after all. Is it their fault that when large numbers of Israeli-Ethiopian families move into a neighborhood, the apartment prices are driven down? After all, these apartments are their main asset: If the value goes down by ten or twenty percent, or even more, is it their responsibility to suffer a severe financial penalty for the cold real-estate realities?
	How many of us can say without hesitation that we would jeopardize our property and fortunes so as not to be part of a racist agreement? Most of us live in neighborhoods where we will not be confronted with that dilemma. But does a racial current running through the property business mean that an entire society is racist? That depends on our definition of a racist. Does remaining silent qualify? What about the fact that hundreds of thousands of middle-class Israelis took to the streets last summer to protest against the tax burden and the high prices, but last week in Kiryat Malakhi only a couple of thousand protestors, mainly Israeli-Ethiopians, turned up. That doesn't make those who marched on Rothschild Boulevard racist, but they did not make the short drive down to support the protest in Kiryat Malakhi.
	Israelis are extremely sensitive to having their society branded as racist. And in many ways that sensitivity is justified. The state was founded by the survivors of the worst racist crime in history, and many of those who arrived from Arab lands were also the victims of a racist forced expulsion. The countries around us are much more sectarian, while many other western societies suffer from similar ills, yet the international media does single Israel out to a disproportionate degree.
	Israel frequently gets called an apartheid state, a comparison that is not only historically erroneous but also counterproductive when used to describe the situation of Israeli Arabs and Palestinians under occupation. Arabs are discriminated in Israel and the Palestinians should have their own state, instead of being occupied, but the racist tendencies on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are symptoms, not root causes. A state for the Jews in the historical land of Israel was a necessary creation and can still be a noble enterprise, not a racist concept.
	But while you can oppose the two-state solution for legitimate and nonracist reasons, discrimination of Israeli-Ethiopians has no political or national basis. It can stem only from racist feelings. And since almost none of us do anything about this, we are all at least tainted by racism.
 Tenuous connection 
	There are different theories and opinions regarding the actual historical connection of the Beta Israel to the Jewish people. From what I have read and seen, I think this was tenuous at best. After covering this issue closely, I don't think the Falashmura still in Ethiopia have any claim to Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return. And on a totally different level, after eating at Ethiopian restaurants in Israel, the United States and Ethiopia, I have to say that it is one of my least favorite cuisines.
	But while these opinions and culinary dislikes are based on my research and personal palate, I write them with trepidation because they resemble racist tropes that you can hear today around Israel. What if I am unwittingly giving succor to racists? And looking within myself, can I be totally certain that I am writing without a gram of racism of my own? It is, after all, a human emotion.
	Israel has adequate legislation against racist discrimination, and occasionally this is implemented effectively. But we must acknowledge that racism is prevalent on a local level - and not only in the low-income areas, where access to education, employment, decent housing and social services is relatively limited and Israeli-Ethiopians lose out to other communities with better connections and more resources. The indifference of ordinary Israelis to this situation may not make them racists themselves. But by hiding our heads in the utopian sand, we are willing accomplices to racism.

<title>Israel Police open probe into alleged racism against Ethiopian immigrants</title>
<date>Wed Jan 11 17:47:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Police have opened an investigation into suspected incitement to racism on the part of local homeowners' committees in Kiryat Malakhi that allegedly refused to rent apartments to members of the Ethiopian immigrant community.
In a letter sent by Attorney General Yehudah Weinstein to Minister Limor Livnat, Weinstein wrote that a police investigation into the alleged racist practices by the committees was opened several days ago.
"A democratic society cannot tolerate expressions of humiliation, resentment or hostility caused by a person's skin color or ethnicity," Weinstein wrote.
On Wednesday morning, Immigration Absorption Minister Sofa Landver responded to recent protests against discrimination against Ethiopian immigrants, and said that they should be grateful for what they have received from Israel.
About 2,000 people gathered on Tuesday to demonstrate against racism in Kiryat Malakhi. They were joined by hundreds of people who came from around the country to support them.
Knesset members from various parties gathered with representatives of the Ethiopian community on Wednesday for an emergency discussion on the topic.
After one of the Ethiopian representatives, Gadi Desta, told the MKs that "apartheid" was taking place, Landver said, "You need to be grateful for what you have received."

<title>Jimmy Carter to visit Israel, Egypt</title>
<date>Thu Oct 18 22:18:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Former United States President Jimmy Carter will travel to Egypt and Israel next week, where he will advocate for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
	A group of past heads of state that advocates for peace called The Elders announced the visit Thursday.
	Its news release says Carter will be joined by former Norway prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and ex-president of Ireland Mary Robinson. The three belong to The Elders.
	Carter wrote the 2006 book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid."
	He said, "Israel's continued control and colonization of Palestinian land have been the primary obstacles to a comprehensive peace agreement in the Middle East."
	This summer, Carter said publicly that U.S. government influence in the Middle East is as weak as it has been since Israel was established as a nation-state in 1948.

<title>Jordan's Abdullah: Israel realizes need to revive Mideast peace talks immediately</title>
<date>Tue Jan 17 09:11:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
The recent parliamentary vote in Egypt proved to Israel that it cannot afford to delay peace talks forever, Jordanian King Abdullah II told the Washington Post late Monday, adding that he was "cautiously optimistic" of the progress achieved in recent low-level talks.
Abdullah's comments came after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was ready to negotiate with the Palestinians immediately and has given the Palestinians a position paper earlier this month containing 21 points on which there is domestic political consensus, as a prelude to potential talks.
"I'm ready to get into my car at any time and go to Ramallah, even if it's more than a small headache for my security guards, but Abu Mazen isn't ready," said Netanyahu, referring to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.
Speaking with the Washington Post following his meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington on Tuesday, Abdullah spoke of "baby steps" taken toward a renewal of direct talks, adding that  he was “cautious about saying that I’m cautiously optimistic.”
According to the Jordanian king, talks between Netanyahu's envoy Yitzhak Molcho and top Palestinian negotiator discussions have been “both good and tough,” and that there was a change sides would "start throwing initial passes at each other” to setup direct talks.
The Jordanian king added that both sides were interested in moving things ahead, citing Egypt's recent parliamentary elections, in which Islamist parties won an overwhelming majority, as a measure against Israeli foot-dragging.
"The more the Israelis play with kicking this down the line, the more they are in danger of losing what they think is the ideal future Israel,” Abdullah told the Washington Post, adding that "waiting is the worst mistake the Israelis can make."
"It wasn’t until the elections in Egypt that suddenly Israel awoke. . . . Now I think there has been a big shift in the way the Israelis look at the issue, and it is imperative for them . . . [to] get the Israeli-Palestinian issue off the menu," Abdullah said.
The Jordanian king warned the two sides of the possible ramifications of missing the chance for peace, saying that if "we haven’t crossed that line, we’ll cross the line sooner or later where the two-state solution is no longer possible, at which point the only solution is the one-state solution."
"And then, are we talking about apartheid or democracy?" Abdullah asked.
Finally, the Jordanian king said he was aware the time was not right for a significant American peace talks push, adding all sides can’t expect for the Americans to wade in, full-weight, unless we have enough of a package where the outcome is somewhat predictable."
On Monday, British Prime Minister David Cameron told the visiting Palestinian Mahmoud Abbas that the United Kingdom would do everything in its power to promote Jordanian-backed efforts to restart the peace process, for which he said time was running out."We think that time, in some ways, is running out for the two-state solution unless we can push forwards now because otherwise the facts on the ground will make it more and more difficult, which is why the settlement issue remains so important," said Cameron.
Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg condemned Israeli settlements Monday as "deliberate vandalism" of efforts to establish a Palestinian state, some of Britain's strongest comments yet on the Israeli-Arab conflict.Israel criticized Clegg's remarks as "gratuitous bashing."

<title>Labor leader snubs Socialist International, leaving Palestinians to dominate </title>
<date>Mon Sep 03 00:46:47 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
 As a founding member of Socialist International, the Israeli Labor party has long been an active player at SI conventions. Those days, however, have passed. Not only did Labor Party leader MK Shelly Yacimovich not send a representative to SI's meeting in South Africa this past weekend, she even instructed former MK Colette Avital not to fly to Cape Town, despite Avital's willingness to cover her own expenses. 
  Because of Labor's absence, Meretz members were the only Israeli representatives at the convention, and could do little to soften a resolution highly critical of Israel's policies. 
  The Socialist International is an organization that unites parties with similar platforms, such as the British Labor Party, the French Socialist Party, the German SPD, and other western social democratic parties. The Cape Town convention was attended by 120 parties from 80 states. 
  A Labor Party source, who asked to remain anonymous due to the political sensitivity involved, told Haaretz that Yacimovich was invited, but, originally had no interest in attending the convention. Following pleas, she changed her mind and decided she would fly to Cape Town after all, only to make another U-turn, opting instead to visit Paris, where she met French President Francois Hollande. 
  Colette Avital, who serves on SI's Middle East committee, said she would fill in for Yacimovich. Avital agreed to help cut party expenses by paying for her own flight. Meanwhile, senior Foreign Ministry officials contacted various Labor officials to emphasize the importance of attending the convention, so that Palestinian and Arab representatives will not dominate. These officials also believed it would be an opportunity for Israeli representatives to meet South African President Jacob Zuma, who has not met with many Israelis recently. This could have been a good chance to ease some of the tension between the two states. 
  But for some as-yet unknown reason, Yacimovich opted to veto Avital's participation a mere 36 hours before her planned flight to South Africa. While in Paris, Yacimovich called Labor Party secretary general Hilik Bar and told him to instruct Avital not to board the plane. 
  Yacimovich's current stance continues a trend that began a decade ago, when the party stopped paying its membership fees to SI, which caused it to be demoted to observer status. Meretz, who opted to continue paying the fees, remains a full-fledged member. 
  In practice, Israel was represented at the convention by former Meretz MK Avshalom Vilan. Vilan said that Fatah's Nabil Sha'ath and Mustafa Barghouti of the Palestinian National Initiative led an extremist line, demanding that the Israeli-Palestinian resolution include the assertion that Israel is an apartheid state. The proposed resolution further supported Palestine's claim to be accepted as a UN member, and called for a boycott of all products of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. 
  "The Palestinians said that their condition in the West Bank is worse than what the blacks suffered under apartheid," Vilan said. "I told the participants that there is settler violence, and there is an occupation against which the Israeli peace camp is battling, but there is no apartheid. I said that categorically, this kind of talk cannot be accepted, even by Meretz people." 
  Vilan appealed to the SI chairman, former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou. "I told him that they're shooting themselves in the foot, and that we will leave the convention if the word apartheid is mentioned in the resolution." Since all decisions must be accepted unanimously, Papandreou began searching for a compromise. Eventually, the term was dropped, but the Palestinians insisted that the call to boycott settlement products remain in the resolution. 
 Vilan said the Labor Party abandoned the political arena. "Prime ministers and foreign secretaries arrived from all over the world, and they all asked me: 'Where is the [Israeli] Labor Party?'" 
  Foreign affairs, settlements and Palestinian-related issues are notably Yacimovich's weak point. She has almost no international experience, and shows little interest in these issues. Labor sources say she avoids meeting vising foreign officials and prefers to concentrate on social and economical issues. 
 Yacimovich's trip to Paris, held 10 days ago, was her first political meeting abroad. She prepared for it secretly, as if it was a military operation. Most of her party's MKs first heard about the meeting with Hollande in Paris when it was reported in the media. 
  Secretary general Bar denies that international affairs are foreign to Yacimovich. He said the Labor Party attaches immense importance to SI, and that Yacimovich has ordered that the party begin to repay past debts, to regain full membership status. He said that she "returned from an important convention of the French Socialist Party, and that in the near future, she will fly to Brussels, where she will meet senior officials from throughout the world. He also pointed to meetings she's had with Australian politicians and the chairman of the German SPD, Sigmar Gabriel." Hilik said Labor's absence from the convention was part of an attempt to cut costs.

<title>Landver: You should thank the state, not complain about it </title>
<date>Thu Jan 12 01:03:00 IST 2012</date>

Ethiopian immigrants should be grateful to the state for what it has given them instead of complaining, Immigrant Absorption Minister Sofa Landver told the Knesset Immigration Committee yesterday.
"The gap between people of Ethiopian origin and other Israelis is a gap measured in years, but the State of Israel has done everything to absorb them in the best possible manner," she said. "So say thank you for what you have received."
"In 2010, my ministry gave NIS 1 million for the needs of the Ethiopian community," she added.
Gadi Yeverkin, head of an advocacy organization for Ethiopian immigrants, accused the Knesset of hypocrisy: MKs lined up to denounce Haredi  (ultra-Orthodox ) discrimination against women, but "you've developed apartheid here, and no Knesset member has condemned that."
MK Moshe Gafni of the Haredi United Torah Judaism party responded: "I wish I were Ethiopian. If I were, I'd at least get some defense here. They attacked the Haredim for weeks in the media; did anyone convene a [Knesset] committee for them? Or utter a peep on their behalf?"
"We all condemn racism," Landver added.

 Authors from abroad are being asked to boycott an Israeli writers festival in May so as not to "partake in celebrating apartheid Jerusalem." The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel appealed on Saturday to nine confirmed participants in the Third International Writers Festival, scheduled to take place May 13-17 in the Mishkenot Sha'ananim conference center in Jerusalem. Mishekenot Sha'ananim director general Uri Dromi yesterday called for separating literature from politics and confirmed that some participants have told him they are being pressured to back out.

 About 20 social activists were removed from the audience of the Israeli version of "Big Brother" this week after interrupting a live broadcast. The protesters shouted "The people demand social justice" and other slogans, and waved signs reading "Social revolt." Many audience members joined in during the Sunday afternoon disturbance, but within a minute the protesters were hustled away by security guards and the broadcast went to a commercial break. Show producers said afterward that they were informed in advance of the protest plans and had set aside a place for them at a distance from the studio itself. They said the protesters were removed without violence.  (Emilie Grunzweig ) 
 Local filmmaker Avigail Sperber  ("The Hangman" ) will direct a new documentary series about the very varied worlds of her Orthodox parents and their 10 children, and her upbringing in the Old City of Jerusalem. Sperber is the founder of the religious lesbian organization Bat Kol, and her siblings include a settler, a sister who left Israel, a brother who left Orthodox Judaism and an adopted sister who is in prison. Their parents are Rabbi Daniel Sperber, a recipient of the Israel Prize in Talmud Studies, and Phyllis  (Hannah ) Magnus, a couples therapist originally from Highland Park, Illinois.

 Artist Gilad Ratman has been selected to represent Israel in the 2012 Venice Biennale, Haaretz has learned, in advance of the official announcement by The Culture and Sports Ministry. Ratman, who was born in 1975, will be one of the youngest artists to represent Israel at the prestigious event. He creates site-specific installation and video pieces that address social issues and the need for community. He has participated in dozens of group shows at venues such as MoMA PS1 in New York and Moscow's Garage Center for Contemporary Culture, and has received several prestigious Israeli awards.

 The first Israeli ambassador named to Egypt since Hosni Mubarak was toppled a year ago officially took office in Cairo yesterday, an Israeli official said, in a step suggesting continued normal ties between the two countries. The envoy, Yaacov Amitai, was named last year to replace Yitzhak Levanon, who left the Egyptian capital in September when rioters stormed the Israeli embassy in protest of a deadly border shooting incident. The Foreign Ministry said the Israeli national anthem was played at a Cairo ceremony at which Amitai met Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, head of the military council ruling Egypt.  (Reuters )  
 Thai police said yesterday they were questioning another Iranian in connection with explosions in Bangkok this month that have been linked to an attack on the wife of an Israeli diplomat in India. Iran has denied involvement but Israel has said the Quds Force, a covert arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, was behind the bombings. Thai immigration police told Reuters that Madani Seyed Mehrded, 33, had been arrested and was being questioned for links to the bombing. Police told Thai media they had discovered call logs showing Mehrded regularly communicating with two of the other suspects, both Iranian: Saeid Moradi, who lost his legs on February 14 when a bomb he was carrying exploded in Bangkok, and Mohammed Khazaei, who was arrested at Bangkok's main airport. Police also said Mehrded had been waiting in front of the building housing the Israeli embassy on the day of the blasts.  (Reuters )

 Record numbers tune in for swan song of Channel 10 anchorman
	Channel 10 anchorman Yaakov Eilon’s final broadcast set a viewing record on Sunday, with 750,000 people tuning in for his farewell appearance on the evening news. The figure represents a record for a news program − 17.3% of TV viewers watched Eilon, the largest share ever recorded by a news broadcast in Israel. Eilon anchored Channel 10’s news program for a decade, since the channel originally went on the air. Eilon’s former Channel 10 partner, Mickey Haimovich, had held the ratings record for a news presenter − her final broadcast, last June, snagged a 16.1% rating. (Gili Izikovich)

 Irish folk music group Dervish pulls out of concerts in Israel
	The popular Irish folk music group Dervish has canceled three performances scheduled for Jerusalem at the end of June. The producers said the show was canceled due to “an organized and venomous online campaign” in the past week by anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian activists in Ireland, urging the group to cancel concerts in “the apartheid state of Israel.” Dervish said in a statement on its Facebook page, “At the time we agreed to these performances, we were unaware there was a cultural boycott in place. We now feel we do not wish to break this boycott.” The producers said the group was also pressured by Irish musicians not to perform in Israel. ‏(Uri Zer Aviv‏)
 Bahrain orders retrial for hunger striker, protest leaders 
	A Bahraini court has ordered a retrial for jailed hunger striker Abdulhadi al-Khawaja and 20 other men convicted of leading an uprising last year, but an opposition leader said the gesture was not enough to defuse resurgent unrest. The turmoil threatens the stability of Bahrain, an ally of Saudi Arabia and the United States in their stand-off with Iran, and sparked Saudi calls for a union of oil-exporting Gulf Arab states to keep Tehran and regional protest movements at bay. Khawaja has been refusing food for nearly three months and is at risk of dying, according to his family. (Reuters )
 Bomb hits police convoy in eastern Nigeria, kills 11 
	A bomb blast struck a police chief's convoy in eastern Nigeria on Monday, killing 11 people, a witness and an official said, a day after attacks in other areas killed at least 19. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing in the town of Jalingo but Islamist sect Boko Haram, which wants to carve an Islamic state out of Nigeria, has been blamed for many such previous attacks. A string of bombings and shootings in the last five days has dampened hopes that arrests and killings of Boko Haram members by the military in recent weeks had stemmed its ability to carry out large-scale attacks in Africa's largest oil producer.

 Suu Kyi's party ends boycott of Burma's parliament 
	Burma's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi agreed on Monday to end her party's boycott of parliament, setting aside her first major dispute with the government since winning by-elections and clearing the way for what could be an acceleration of reforms. Suu Kyi and her party will make their historic debut in the assembly tomorrow backing down over the wording of an oath for new members of parliament. She agreed to swear to protect a constitution drafted under military control that she says is undemocratic and needs to be amended. (Reuters)

<title>November sweeps? How Roseanne Barr could sway the U.S. election</title>
<date>Sun Nov 04 01:34:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	On October 23, the day after the foreign policy debate between President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and Mitt Romney, a Republican, an additional debate between the candidates for the presidency of the United States was held in Chicago. The participants were four candidates from smaller and less well-known parties, none of which has enough support to get into the White House.
	"These people deserve a lot of credit," said the moderator of the debate, veteran broadcaster Larry King. "They're the ones coming forward. It's easy to sit back and watch. These people stand up. They may not be counted on November 6, but they're counting today, and they deserve to be heard." The four candidates have divergent worldviews, but throughout the debate they agreed on one thing - the United States needs an alternative to Obama and Romney.
	The presidential election is not determined by the popular vote. Instead, there is an Electoral College process whereby the candidate who receives the most votes in a given state wins all its electors. This has led to the establishment of a system of two large parties - Democratic and Republican. representatives of third parties for the most part do not manage to present their candidacy in all the states. However, they are able to bring to the agenda issues the major parties ignore, and are sometimes able to tilt the outcome of an election in states where the race is particularly close. That was the case in 2000, when modest support for Green Party candidate Ralph Nader eroded support for Democrat Al Gore, assuring George W. Bush's victory. In Florida, where Nader won 97,000 votes, Gore lost to Bush by a mere 537 votes, leading some to say that this is what determined the national election.
	The best-remembered candidate in recent years who did not belong to either of the big parties was Ross Perot, who ran as an independent in 1992, and managed to win 19 percent of the popular vote - largely because of his money - but not a single elector.
 Johnson: Progressive social agenda, spendthrift economic platform
	The candidate who is causing the biggest headache for the Republican Party is Libertarian Gary Johnson, who won loud applause at the Chicago debate.
	Johnson, 60, served two terms as governor of New Mexico, during the course of which he vetoed 750 pieces of legislation, a national record, and left his state with a surplus of $1 billion. He ran initially in the Republican primaries and participated in two of the party's debates, but moved to the Libertarian Party after failing to garner enough support. Johnson supports cuts in taxes and government expenditures. According to him, "The biggest threat to our national security is the fact that we're bankrupt. He is opposed to American involvement in international conflicts - including the possibility of an attack on Iran - and he has called for the cessation of aid to foreign countries. Johnson promised that if he were elected he would cut military spending by 43 percent.
	He is a veteran supporter of the legalization of marijuana, pro-choice with respect to abortions, and in favor of gay marriage (he notes that the issue has to be resolved at the national level and attacked Obama for having passed this question along to the states ). Johnson also attacked the economic program of Romney and his candidate for vice president, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.
	"When Romney says we need to balance the federal budget but also need to spend money on military and hold Medicare in check, that doesn't add up," he said in an interview to Politico. "You can't balance the budget without cutting both."
	A CNN poll at the beginning of October gave Johnson 4 percent support among Americans who are expected to vote - and in some states it was as high as 6 percent. In recent weeks, it has been increasingly suggested that he might cause a "Ralph Nader effect" - especially in Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire.
	In poll conducted on October 14 by Suffolk University in New Hampshire, Johnson won 2 percent support - with Romney and Obama each at 47 percent. Another poll by Public Policy Polling in Nevada toward the end of October gave 3 percent to Johnson in that state, where Obama is ahead by 49 percent to Romney's 47 percent. In such a close race, 3 percent could be crucial. And indeed, in Pennsylvania, the Republicans have gone to court with the claim that 40 percent of the signatures he obtained were forged or duplicates.
	A press release issued by the Republican Party in Pennsylvania claimed that not only were the Libertarian Party's papers riddled with errors, duplicate signatures and blatant fraud, they raise concerns that President Obama and the Democratic Party are trying to add more candidates to the ballot because they know the vast majority of voters are looking for a new direction."
	Ultimately, Johnson is running in every state except Oklahoma and Michigan, where it will nevertheless be possible to vote for him even though his name is not on the ballot, because he submitted his candidacy forms three minutes late.
 Stein: End Israeli apartheid; create a green White House, cut defense spending in half
	A CNN poll at the beginning of September found that the small party candidates are more damaging to Romney than to Obama. The poll (which was conducted before the presidential debates ) gave Obama 52 percent of the vote and Romney 46 percent if they were the only candidates whose names are on the ballot.
	However, when the possibility of voting for Johnson or for Jill Stein's Green Party was added, support for Romney plummeted to 43 percent while Obama lost only 1 percent. Last week, pollster Scott Rasmussen told CNN that if the race is close enough, even 100 votes could be significant. This year, Dr. Jill Stein, a 62-year old Jewish doctor, tops the Green Party ticket, which ran Ralph Nader in 2000. A CNN poll from the beginning of October pegged support for her at 3 percent. Among her supporters are controversial linguist Noam Chomsky, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges. Stein will have her name on the ballot in 38 states, and it will be possible to vote for her in nine more.
	"We are all realizing that we, the people, have to take charge because the political parties that are serving the top 1 percent are not going to solve the problems that the rest of us face, we need people in Washington who will refuse to be bought by lobbyists and for whom change is not just a slogan," said Stein last year at the press conference launching her campaign.
	She and her candidate for vice president were arrested on October 6 outside Hofstra University, where the second debate between Obama and Romney took place, protesting against the absence of small-party candidates from the official debates (as of 2000, only candidates who have more than 15 percent support in national polls are able to participate in debates ). Stein ran against Romney in the race for governor of Massachusetts in 2002. She is calling for implementation of a "green New Deal," a plan that would create 25 million new jobs, along with the establishment of more environmental communities encouraging use of green energy and relying on local organic agriculture. She is also calling for cutting half the military budget and using the money to support free higher education. On her Internet site, Stein writes that the American government must take more meaningful steps to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She proposes conditioning future financial aid to Israel or the Palestinian authority on maintaining human rights, and supports the imposition of sanctions if these are violated. She calls for "an end to the discriminatory apartheid policies within the state of Israel, the removal of the Separation Wall, a ban on assassination, movement toward denuclearization, the release of all political prisoners and journalists from Israeli and Palestinian prisons, disarmament of non-state militias, and recognition of the right of self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians." According to her, "In this way, U.S. policy will begin to become consistent with its practices regarding other violators of human rights and international law in the region."
 Goode: No campaign contributions above $200; Anderson - opposes the Electoral College
	Another candidate who could be damaging to Mitt Romney is Virgil Goode, 66, running on the conservative Constitution Party ticket, who defines himself as a representative of the "ordinary people." He represented the 6th District of Virginia in the Unites States House of Representatives from 1997 to 2009 - first as a Democrat and later as a Republican. He says that Washington is ruled by the elite and big money - and has refused to accept contributions from political action committees or from individuals of more than $200.
	Goode's platform includes the immediate balancing of the budget and a total stop to immigration to the United States until such time as unemployment falls below 5 percent. The Republicans' big anxiety is that Goode will affect the results of the elections in his home state of Virginia, where he might win 1 to 2 percent of the votes, while most polls are predicating that the two mainstream candidates are neck in neck or a slight lead for Obama. The Republicans tried to disqualify Goode's candidacy in Virginia, but unsuccessfully. Goode's name will be on the ballot in 26 states and it wil be possible to vote for him in 10 others.
	The mayor of Salt Lake City from 2000 to 2008, former Democrat Rocky Anderson, is also running for president on the ticket of the Justice Party he founded a year ago. In the past he was an active human rights lawyer and a supporter of the Occupy Wall Street movement, and he is considered a vehement opponent of the American electoral system, which he says leads to too much involvement of economic considerations in Washington. He is calling for universal health insurance and believes that global warming is the greatest danger to humanity. According to Goode, American politicians are avoiding taking action in favor of a transition to green energy because of their indebtedness to the tycoons. "Our government is run by and for the benefit of monstrous corporations rather than in the interests of the people of this country," he said in the Chicago debate. "Obama and Romney have refused to discuss the corrupting influence of money, flowing from Wall Street banks, from the insurance companies, pharmaceutical industries or military contractors because they are the recipients of that corrupting money."
	And there are more than 10 other candidates for the presidency from very small parties for whom it will be possible to vote in a few states. The best-known of these candidates is television star Roseanne Barr, who did not get the Green Party nomination she wanted and is running as the nominee of the Peace and Freedom Party. There is also the American Independent Party founded 40 years ago, which is running Thomas Hoefling of Iowa, and there is the Party for Socialism and Liberation, which is running the youngest candidate in the race - 28-year-old Peta Lindsay, who, even if she were to win, would not be able to serve as president because the Constitution of the United States requires a minimum age of 35 for the position.

<title>Obama promises to consult Jordan on Israeli-Palestinian peace talk issues </title>
<date>Wed Jan 18 02:32:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
The United States will consult closely with Jordan to encourage Israel and the Palestinians to negotiate in a "serious fashion" to find peace, U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday.
Speaking in the Oval Office alongside Jordan's King Abdullah II, Obama said he appreciated Jordan's leadership on the stalled peace effort.
After the meeting Abdullah told reporters the talks were in their early stages and that "we have to keep our fingers crossed." Abdullah told the Washington Post in an interview that, because of the elections in the United States, "we can't expect for the Americans to wade in, full-weight, unless we have enough of a package where the outcome is somewhat predictable."
Abdullah also said that "the presidential card can only be played once, and we are nowhere near the position at this stage where the presidential card can be played. It is up to us to do the heavy lifting, not the president."
With regard to progress on the first three meetings that have been held since early January in Amman, Abdullah reported there had been "baby steps."
"Waiting is the worst mistake the Israelis can make. It wasn't until the elections in Egypt that suddenly Israel awoke ... Now I think there has been a big shift in the way the Israelis look at the issue, and it is imperative for them [to] get the Israeli-Palestinian issue off the menu."
Abdullah said that sooner or later a line would be crossed where the two-state solution is no longer possible - if it has not been crossed already, "at which point the only solution is the one-state solution. And then, are we talking about apartheid or democracy? The more the Israelis play with kicking this down the line, the more they are in danger of losing what they think is the ideal future Israel," the king said.
The next meeting between the parties is scheduled for January 25. Although the Quartet has set January 26 as the deadline for the presentation of concrete proposals on issues like borders and security, sources in the U.S. State Department said that focusing on the deadline will only sabotage the atmosphere of the talks and that what is important is that the parties are talking directly to each other.
Abdullah said in the short term the Jordanians were trying to get the Palestinians and Israelis to talk about security and borders, and added, "I think once you've defined the issue of borders, then you've solved the issue of settlements, and you can go straight into security talks."
Abdullah is scheduled to meet Wednesday with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Meanwhile, two issues are causing some tension in relations between Israel and the United States. Officials in Israel said they were unhappy with American leaks ahead of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman's expected visit in early February that some senior U.S. administration officials did not want to be photographed with Lieberman. "That is not an insult to Lieberman, it is an insult to Israel," an Israeli official said. Washington did not respond officially to reports from Israel but noted that arrangements such as joint photos were made shortly before meetings and that the visit was still under preparation.
The second issue was with regard to who specifically had canceled the joint U.S.-Israeli military exercise that was to have been the biggest in the history of ties between the two countries. The Israelis say the Americans canceled it, while according to The Atlantic Magazine, sources in the U.S. administration said Defense Minister Ehud Barak had called Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and asked to cancel the exercise, which worried the Americans as it could appear to the Iranians to signal preparations for an attack on Iran.
The Israeli Embassy responded that a joint decision was made to postpone the exercise to the latter part of this year. "The decision, taken jointly by the European Command (EUCOM) and by the IDF, stemmed solely from technical issues," Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren said in a statement Monday, adding, "Such postponements are routine and do not reflect political or strategic concerns."
"The United States and Israel remain committed to holding the exercise - code-named Austere Challenge 12 - the largest and most robust in their historic alliance," he said.

<title>Palestinians: Peace talks require halt to Israeli settlement construction </title>
<date>Mon Jan 02 13:09:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Monday that he believes his meeting with Israeli envoy Yitzhak Molcho on Tuesday will only bear fruit if Israel agrees to halt settlement construction.
Erekat and Molcho are set to meet in Jordan on Tuesday in a bid to get peace talks restarted. Negotiations have been stalled since September 2010.
Erekat told reporters in the West Bank on Monday that he does not expect any breakthroughs unless Israel agrees to halt settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. He also said Israel must accept its 1967 lines as the basis for a future border.

Israel took control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Six Day War. Israel rejects the Palestinian demands and says peace talks should resume without preconditions.
The meeting in Jordan comes as the Palestinians are preparing a diplomatic campaign that aims to put Israel under "a real international siege."
The diplomatic offensive the Palestinians are planning to launch later this month could include pushing the UN Security Council to pass a resolution condemning settlement construction and urging the International Criminal Court to try Israel for war crimes related to its 2008-2009 incursion into the Gaza Strip.
2012 "will be the start of an unprecedented diplomatic campaign on the part of the Palestinian leadership, and it will be a year of pressure on Israel that will put it under a real international siege," said Fatah Central Committee member Nabil Sha'ath, according to an Israeli Foreign Ministry document. "The campaign will be similar to the one waged against apartheid in South Africa."

<title>Palestinians plan diplomatic steps to put Israel under 'international siege'</title>
<date>Mon Jan 02 00:46:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's envoy Isaac Molho will meet with top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in Amman Tuesday for preliminary talks aimed at setting an agenda for peace negotiations, even as the Palestinians are preparing a diplomatic campaign that aims to put Israel under "a real international siege."
Among those who have been pushing hard for the meeting Tuesday, the first official meeting between Israeli and Palestinian representatives in several months, are Jordan's King Abdullah and Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh and the Quartet's Mideast envoy, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Senior Israeli officials said there was very little chance that the meeting would lead to the renewal of negotiations.
The diplomatic offensive the Palestinians are planning to launch later this month could include pushing the UN Security Council to pass a resolution condemning settlement construction and urging the International Criminal Court to try Israel for war crimes related to its 2008-2009 incursion into the Gaza Strip.
2012 "will be the start of an unprecedented diplomatic campaign on the part of the Palestinian leadership, and it will be a year of pressure on Israel that will put it under a real international siege," said Fatah Central Committee member Nabil Sha'ath, according to an Israeli Foreign Ministry document. "The campaign will be similar to the one waged against apartheid in South Africa."
According to information that has reached Israel, the Palestinians are considering several steps as part of their campaign:
* Asking the UN Security Council in February to pass a resolution that would condemn settlement construction and impose international sanctions on Israel. If a resolution were brought to a vote, all Security Council members other than the United States would be expected to vote in favor.
* Urging the International Criminal Court in The Hague to try Israel for war crimes related to Operation Cast Lead. If that fails, Palestinian officials are likely to encourage Palestinian citizens to file lawsuits against Israel in Western courts.
* Pushing for the implementation the articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention that ban the construction of communities and transfer of populations in occupied territory. The Palestinians have been trying for some time now to persuade the Swiss government to convene the signatories on the document for a special debate on the subject of applying the Geneva Convention in the West Bank.
* Asking the UN General Assembly or the UN Human Rights Council to send an international fact-finding committee to look into the settlement issue.
* Renewing efforts in the UN Security Council to secure full-membership status for Palestine, or asking the UN General Assembly for status as a nonmember state. A similar move was suspended last October after UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural agency, accepted Palestine as a member, in response to which Israel froze Palestinian tax revenues.
* Organizing mass rallies against Israel in the West Bank, as part of a non-violent popular uprising. In reconciliation talks between Hamas and Fatah, the head of the Hamas political bureau, Khaled Meshal, said the two movements would focus their activities on a popular uprising in an effort to draw international attention to the Israeli occupation.
The diplomatic campaign is expected to begin January 26, which marks the end of the three-month period the Quartet alloted to Israel and the Palestinian Authority for resuming talks and presenting substantive proposals on borders and security arrangements.
The Palestinians agreed not to take any unilateral steps in international forums before that date.
No breakthrough in Israeli-Palestinian talks is expected before then, according to an Israeli source who met recently with several senior Palestinian officials.
In an interview Saturday with Palestinian television, PA President Mahmoud Abbas said that if the Quartet failed in its efforts to renew talks between Israel and the Palestinians before January 26, "all options will be open" as far as the Palestinian Authority is concerned.
Speaking about tomorrow's meeting between Molho and Erekat, senior Israeli officials said there is a deep mistrust on both sides and that the Israelis and Palestinians are each trying to convince the Quartet to hold the other side responsible for the failure to resume peace talks.
The meeting does not mark the resumption of negotiations, just a run-up to them that involves deciding on the agenda for future peace talks and the principles on which they would be based.
"We're talking about negotiations on holding negotiations," said a senior Israeli source.
Blair and Judeh will sit in on the first part of tomorrow's meeting between Molho and Erekat, as will representatives of all the parties that make up the Quartet: the United States, United Nations, Russia and the European Union. In the second part of the meeting, Judeh will hold discussions with Molho and Erekat.
In a statement from the Prime Minister's Bureau, Israel thanked Abdullah and Judeh "for their initiative in convening the sides in keeping with the Quartet guidelines."

<title>Pro-Palestinian protests mar Israel celebration in Melbourne</title>
<date>Thu Jun 07 16:31:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	SYDNEY, Australia (JTA) – A crowd of angry pro-Palestinian demonstrators in Melbourne marred the annual celebration of Israel's independence.
	Attendees at Tuesday night's high-profile gathering of politicians, diplomats, bureaucrats and Jewish leaders were forced to walk past the 100-strong crowd who were held back by police, the Australian Jewish News reported.
	Among the banners brandished by the protesters were "Israel – an apartheid state" and "Free Palestine." At one point the protesters burned an effigy of Victorian Premier Ted Baillieu.
	Inside the hotel, Victoria's leader defended the protesters' right to express their views, but retorted by saying: "The wonderful thing in this country is that you can have your view. The even better thing is I can stand here and say, 'You're wrong'."
	BDS, an acronym for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign, should be re-named "Bigoted, Dangerous and Shameful," the newspaper quoted Baillieu as saying.
	His counterpart, Labor's Daniel Andrews, said of the protests outside: "If we have to come through those scenes again [next year], then we'll all do it with pride."
	In his address, Israeli Ambassador Yuval Rotem offered an olive branch to the Palestinians: "We want to live with you and not die with you," he said. "We want to respect you as good neighbors and not fear you as a dreaded enemy."

<title>Soccer / Euro Women / Anti-Israel protesters ejected from Wales match </title>
<date>Thu Jun 21 06:24:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	The Israeli women's soccer team played its Welsh counterpart last night amid protests from both pro-Palestinian and Zionist activists. Wales beat Israel 5-0 in the Group 4 Euro Women qualification match held at the Racecourse Stadium in Wrexham, Wales.
	Several activists were ejected from the stadium, and many were not allowed to enter at all, Liam Randall, a local journalist, told Haaretz, based on information he gathered on the ground.
	The protest was part of an ongoing campaign by pro-Palestinian groups against Israel's hosting next year of the UEFA under-21s tournament - protesters also demonstrated at the Israel-Scotland match on Saturday night.
	Demonstrators, including the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, have been protesting claims that Palestinian athletes and teams from the West Bank and Gaza Strip are not granted visas by Israel. They also drew attention last night to the plight of Palestinian soccer player Mahmoud Sarsak, who has been detained in Israel without charge or trial. Israeli authorities say Sarsak, who has been on a hunger strike since March 19, will be released next month.
	The Zionist Central Council of Manchester also called on Israel's supporters to rally in a counter-demonstration outside the game, sending a bus full of activists to the event. The council urged supporters "to head to the Racecourse 'with Israeli flags to show your support for the Israeli women's football team,'" and to "'send the Palestine Solidarity Campaign a message that Israel is not an apartheid country, but rather a country that has brought major advancements in technology and health care to the rest of the world,'" the local website Wrexham.com reported.
 Better than in Scotland 
	Diana Redman, a member of Israel's soccer team, told Haaretz last night: "They did a great job of not letting in anyone that was related to the protest, and if anyone tried to pull out a flag or start chanting they were immediately thrown out of the stadium. Much better than Scotland. As a player, I really appreciate the effort by the Welsh organization."
	There have been warnings that Israeli participants in next month's London Olympics will face protests and potential disturbances. However, embassy officials this week said that security arrangements around the Olympic village and the games would not allow for any disruption whatsoever.
	A spokesman for the Israeli embassy in London said: "It is shocking that in the homeland of football, there are those whose hatred for the Jewish state is greater than the love for the game. On the eve of the Olympic games, every sports fan should condemn deluded protests against guest athletes."

<title>The man who turned opportunism into an art form</title>
<date>Tue Jul 24 03:35:00 IDT 2012</date>

	Tzachi Hanegbi, who is leading an exodus of Kadima MKs to Likud, has been working overtime the last few years to get rid of his image as the hooligan of Israeli politics. On his slick website, he wrote that his experience, the positions he filled and the wisdom that comes with age contributed to the changes he has undergone since his days as the "vocal student protester on top of the monument in Yamit railing against the government's decision to evacuate the communities in the Sinai." Indeed, Tzachi has adopted a quiet manner of speech and a broad smile. He dropped the extreme right-wing talk he learned from his mother, Geula Cohen, and replaced it with a song of praise for peace.
	In exchange for the big prize he had been given as an opposition Kadima MK - the chairmanship of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee - Hanegbi adopted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's version of events according to which President Mahmoud Abbas is the one sabotaging the peace negotiations. "Abu Mazen's [Abbas'] rejectionism is surprising," Hanegbi said on the London and Kirshenbaum program in February 2010. His removal from the committee chairmanship and ejection from the Knesset following a conviction for giving false testimony turned Hanegbi into the new hero of the Zionist left. Together with the opposition leader at the time, Tzipi Livni, he advocated a permanent arrangement with the Palestinians, urging Netanyahu to include Kadima in the government and entrust the negotiations to Livni.
	Last August, Hanegbi went all the way to the University of Pittsburgh to attend a closed meeting with Palestinian activists. He sat next to diehard leftists, including former cabinet minister Ophir Pines, Brig. Gen. (res. ) Yisraela Oron (from the Geneva Initiative ) and Boaz Karni (from the Economic Cooperation Fund, established by Yossi Beilin ), in sessions on a permanent arrangement based on the 1967 borders and the division of Jerusalem.
	In November 2011, Hanegbi went with Livni to Amman to meet and be photographed with Abbas (and here it should be noted that outgoing opposition leader Shelly Yacimovich did not ask to meet with the Palestinian leader ). Suddenly, Netanyahu became for Hanegbi someone who opposes negotiations; in an article published in The Jerusalem Post in May in response to the uproar sparked by Yuval Diskin three months ago, Hanegbi wrote that the Shin Bet head was right - that the government has no interest in talking to the Palestinians and that if Israel does not try to promote dialogue with the pragmatic camp headed by Abu Mazen, the alternatives will be a lot worse.
	The problem is not that Hanegbi is jumping from the ranks of one party into the government of its rival. A politician, just like anyone else, can change his outlook and adopt a new one and join a party that reflects this. The problem is that the outlook remains where it was and only the backside changes places. The other problem is that Hanegbi is not alone. The diplomatic-security cabinet has for the last three years included two ministers whose ideologies are totally unconnected to the government's policies (or lack thereof ). Ehud Barak said in 1999 that if we continue holding onto the territories and allow the Palestinians to vote, Israel will turn into a binational state. He said in 2010 that if we do not allow them to vote, it will be an apartheid state. What has changed since then?
	Dan Meridor said a decade ago that of all the questions - security, economic policy and others - the demographic-democratic issue is the imminent threat we will be unable to evade. What has changed since then?
	And what has changed since spring, when Hanegbi argued that Netanyahu has no interest in conducting negotiations with the Palestinians?
	Ron Prosor, Israel's ambassador to the UN, will have to take time away in the coming months from his much-covered campaign against the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA ), which dares expose Israel's actions in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority leadership is determined to ask the UN General Assembly to upgrade the status of Palestine. The only question is whether to do this before the U.S. elections or on a symbolic date - November 27, the 65th anniversary of the UN vote on partition. As a prelude to the storm, the UN Committee Against Torture recently presented Israel with a list of 57 incidents involving suspected violations of the international Convention Against Torture.
	Thirty-seven of the questions asked of Israel were raised in the joint report presented to the UN committee by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, Adalah - the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and Physicians for Human Rights in Israel (New Israel Fund, get ready to be attacked ).
	The report of the Israeli organizations presents a harsh picture of the policy of torture, abuse and humiliating treatment in security interrogations, at detention facilities and in the occupied territories in general, which include arrests without trial; difficult incarceration conditions; trials based on improperly submitted evidence; granting of immunity to interrogators; and no investigation or review of complaints about torture.
	The UN committee is asking for information on several Palestinian detainees who have been questioned since 2002 under the "ticking bomb" designation; there have been some 700 complaints of abuse during Shin Bet questioning. The committee noted that even though Israel is among about 150 countries that have signed the Convention Against Torture, and committed to take every possible step to prevent torture from taking place in its sovereign territory, it is refraining from including torture in the legal code, as the convention requires.
	The questions raised by the committee address, among other things, the travel restrictions that prevent Gaza Strip residents from having access to health services. In any case, it would be worthwhile for the committee to ask the Hamas government in Gaza if the dispute with the government in Ramallah should bar critically ill persons from seeking treatment in hospitals in Israel and occasionally sentence them to death by torture.

	The military wing of Hamas fired rockets toward Israel overnight Monday and on Tuesday. There were no reported casualties or damage. The rocket fire marks an unusual move for the group, which has been avoiding launching rockets toward Israel for many months now. Following the attack, communities near the Gaza border were put on heightened alert.
	Sephardic Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar sent a letter to hundreds of Orthodox rabbis in Israel calling on them to object to the state's intention to recognize and fund Reform and Conservative rabbis in towns around the country. Amar's goal is to persuade Israel's political leaders to foil implementation of the High Court's ruling on the matter.
	Iran warned on Tuesday that Western sanctions against the country's oil exports must be lifted and that their right to a civilian nuclear program recognized, or else Tehran could break off negotiations. Iran's delegation to the nuclear talks said a negative response would mean "the end of the negotiations in its current configuration." 	Syria's government said Tuesday it was ready to act on a UN call to evacuate civilians who are trapped in the rebellious central city of Homs for over a week, but blamed rebels for obstructing efforts to do so. Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, chief of the UN observer mission in Syria, asked both sides to allow safe passage to women, children and sick people.
	Author of “The Color Purple” Alice Walker refused to authorize a Hebrew translation of her prize-winning work, calling Israel an "apartheid state." Walker said she supported the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement and offered her hope that the BDS movement “will have enough of an impact on Israeli civilian society to change the situation.”
	A mosque in the West Bank village of Jab'a, located south of Ramallah, was set on fire and vandalize in a suspected "price tag" attack early Tuesday morning. A joint investigation by Shin Bet, Israel Police and the IDF had begun. 	The National Building and Planning Council will consider exempting the construction of refugee camps in the south from almost all planning regulations. The Defense Ministry says the move, together with other proposed changes in the plans, are intended "to meet the tight schedule to implement the cabinet's decision" to build the camp for African refugees crossing the Egyptian border into Israel.
	A Palestinian prisoner who has been on hunger strike for 88 days ended his fast Monday, after the Israeli authorities agreed to release him on July 10, Palestinian Minister of Prisoners Affairs Issa Qaraqi said.

<title>U.S. Presbyterian Church committee votes in favor of Israel divestment resolution</title>
<date>Tue Jul 03 21:23:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Following a lengthy and heated debate, committee 15 of the 220th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States voted in favor of a motion calling for divestment from three companies that "profit from nonpeaceful pursuits" in Israel.
	Whether or not the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israel is gaining traction is one of the hottest questions being asked among the most politically active members of the Jewish community – as many people take the issue to heart.
	Israel supporters claim that the numbers of participants in the annual "Israel apartheid" week have not grown significantly, and that the American Methodist and Presbyterian Churches, despite regularly raising the topic of divesting from companies that "profit from Israeli occupation," generally end up voting against it.  The discourse is shifting – and not in Israel’s favor.
	In 2008, the United Methodist Church (UMC) rejected an Israel divestment resolution. On May 2, the UMC general conference did it again, rejecting a resolution calling for divestment from three companies doing business with Israel (although the conference did adopt a measure recommending a boycott of products made in Israeli settlement).
	This week, the topic was raised again in Pittsburgh, at the general assembly of the Presbyterian Church. Last time, the resolution didn't even pass the committee level, let alone the general vote.
	This time, something different happened. Committee 15 of the 220th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church voted in favor of a motion calling for divestment from  Motorola, for providing surveillance equipment for Israeli settlements, Caterpillar, for providing bulldozers used for demolishing Palestinian houses, and Hewlett-Packard, for selling hardware used by Israel in its naval blockade of Gaza.
	The motion also called for the church to increase investments in companies promoting peaceful pursuits. The final vote is expected at the general assembly later this week.
	Rev. Dr. Walt Davis, Co-Chair of the Israel/Palestine Mission Network, called the decision "an encouraging step".
	 "We hope plenary voters will follow the lead of Committee 15 and the recommendations of the Mission Responsibility Through Investing committee and support divestment from these companies that are profiting from Israel's violations of Palestinian human rights. It’s been a long and thorough process and it’s finally time for the church to stop profiting from the suffering the peoples of the Holy Land,” said Davis.
	But during Monday evening's debate, there were also concerns expressed over the possible impact of the decision on the relations with the Jewish community - and other sectors of the American Christian community.
	Weeks before the general assembly opened on June 30, the proposal drew sharp criticism and warnings from Jewish American organizations, with the exception of those on the far left, such as the Jewish Voice for Peace. Over 1,300 Rabbis and over 12,000 American Jews signed letters to delegates of the biennial Presbyterian Church General Assembly, calling them to reject the "counterproductive" resolution.
	In response, the Anti-Defamation League warned of the negative effect on the Jewish and American Christian relations. The American Jewish Committee called the resolutions generally put to votes every two years at the Presbyterian Church gatherings "an unfortunate tradition" meant to vilify Israel and adopt positions of “non-representative" Palestinian leaders.
	Even Jeremy Ben-Ami, President of the leftist pro-Israeli lobby JStreet, wrote an article titled “Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Put Allies at Odds."
	"In our view, the one-sided, extreme rhetoric that accompanies the global BDS movement makes a mutually agreeable solution more difficult to achieve, not less" wrote Ben-Ami, stressing that he hopes that PCUSA "will avoid this unproductive path,"
	Ben-Ami added, "even the limited divestment approach under consideration by PCUSA falls under the rubric of larger BDS efforts to place blame entirely on one side of the conflict. Such an approach encourages not reconciliation, but polarization.”
	Some members of the general assembly committee that discussed the motion in Pittsburg said they do not understand why the resolution is interpreted as a threat - they insisted it's a moral issue, certainly not an anti-Semitic one, to stop pouring resources “into hurting people in another country."
	"There's violence happening here. Someone is profiting from it. And we need to not be a part of that," said one of the Committee members.
	It's not that Israel is running short of supporters among the American Christian community; in about two weeks, Christians United for Israel, a large Evangelical pro-Israel organization, will run its annual gathering in Washington DC. It's likely that the Presbyterian divestment motion will draw quite a bit of criticism there.
	Dr. Nahida Halaby Gordon, moderator of the National Middle Eastern Presbyterian Caucus, told "Haaretz" she feels there is a good chance for the vote to pass.
	"Sometimes the plenary votes contrary to the vote in the committee, but the numbers in the committee vote in favor of the divestment were high in favor of the divestment (36 members of the committee voted in favor, 11 against NM) - almost three to one, I feel there is a big support for this." If the vote fails, she says, she intends to come with other activists with the same message to the next GA. She stressed the decision "is not intended to demonize or delegitimize either Israel or Jewish community in this country."
	As for the possible result of the divestment decision - she says it's not the hope it will seriously hurt these companies profits, but the message it sends.
	"We are a small church, we don't own that many stocks and the divestment will probably occur over a year or two - it's not that we'll sell tomorrow all our stocks. But it's a moral message to these companies that you should not profit from the occupation."

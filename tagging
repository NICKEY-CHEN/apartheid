# I used Unix terminal window in Bitvise to tag the corpora.   
# I downloaded the program Tree Tagger to tag the corpora. The TreeTagger is downloadable from http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/
for annotating text with part-of-speech and lemma information.

# I deleted the punctuation, tagged as "SENT".  

cat ALL.txt | cmd/tree-tagger-english > ALL_margendatud_oige.txt

# I marked tabs with #, so I can later delete them.
# I then deleted the first, original word form.
# I sorted the results by numeric appearance.

cat ALL_margendatud_oige.txt | tr '\t' '#' | sed 's/^[a-z]*[^#]*//g' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | less

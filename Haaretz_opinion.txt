<title>Abu Tir or Abu Tur</title>

Israel does not remain silent in the face of terror attacks: In a consultation of ministers in the Prime Minister's Office, it was decided to respond to the attack in Tel Aviv by "stripping the residency" of three Hamas members of the Palestinian parliament who reside in East Jerusalem. In simple language, this is called expulsion. The attorney general, Menachem Mazuz, was quick to certify this abomination as "kosher." In this case, he did not need time to reach a decision, despite the fact that it constitutes collective punishment - only because "Hamas leaders failed to denounce the attack" and "some even justified it." 
The fact that this not only entails the expulsion of innocent people, but also a serious violation of freedom of speech did not arouse any special interest. Several Arab MKs who met with the three candidates for expulsion were widely condemned, instead of receiving support from Jewish MKs, advocates of human rights. Because this is the essence of freedom of speech. It is measured at those very times when distasteful words are sounded, and it also applies to elected Palestinian officials. The poor policemen in Jerusalem are at their wits' end: One day they are instructed to prevent Palestinian elected officials who live in the city from traveling to the territories, and the next day they are told to expel them from the city to the territories. This is how Israel's consistent policy looks. 
But the ridiculous Israeli response of "stripping residency," which was concocted by the "moderate" and "enlightened" foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, constitutes an insult to the intelligence of even those Israelis who wish to see their government "do something" against terrorism. A much more profound question arises: What exactly do we want in Jerusalem? Do we want to annex its occupied sections and pay the heavy political and demographic price of this step, or do we plan to give to the Palestinians what belongs to the Palestinians and to the Jews what belongs to the Jews? 
Jerusalem, including its occupied sections, will either be an inseparable part of the State of Israel, and all of its residents (including those who voted for Hamas in the Palestinian Authority's democratic elections) will enjoy all of the rights accorded to the general public, or Israel will separate from the occupied part of the city and transfer it to the Palestinians. You do not want Hamas in Jerusalem? So, please separate. Even in Jerusalem, you cannot have your cake and eat it too. 
This is even truer because it has already been a rearguard battle for some time. The future of Jerusalem has been decided and any reasonable person can see that the city will indeed be divided, despite the annexation efforts of Israel, which reached a peak during Ehud Olmert's days as mayor. Every extreme nationalistic organization, every delusional NGO and every eccentric yeshiva that aspired to invade more and more Arab homes in the capital received Olmert's support, and yet the city remained clearly binational. 
Even 1,000 officers from the Jerusalem Police on duty in the soccer field of Zur Baher to prevent Hamas from staging rallies will not convince residents who support and voted for the organization to stop supporting it. Just as the repeated summoning of the Jerusalem representative in parliament, Mahmoud Abu Tir, to the police station (under suspicion of violating an order prohibiting the convening of the rally in Zur Baher) will only enhance the influence of the red-bearded man, who until recently was unknown to most Palestinians. Just as the bombastic closing of Orient House in its day did not reduce the support of most residents for Fatah. 
And what did we get after we closed Orient House? The Hamas soccer field. We can only look back longingly to Orient House now - not only because of its stylish architecture, but mainly due to the fact that inside its walls a real discussion was conducted about negotiating with Israel and achieving peace. At the soccer field in Zur Baher, other voices - much more extreme - would have been sounded had the rally been held. And perhaps these extreme voices would not have arisen had Orient House not been closed. 
A quarter of a million Palestinians live in Jerusalem, comprising about a third of the city's residents. The underlying Israeli aspiration to hold onto the occupied territory without its residents is unrealistic. The aspiration to perpetuate an apartheid regime in the city is also out of the question. Those who should have been first to call for dividing the city are the ones who yearn for "a Jewish majority" and sow fear of "the demographic danger." 
In a flash, Israel could have "rid itself" of a quarter of a million Palestinians, whose percentage of the city's population will only increase. But Israel chooses to continue the annexation of East Jerusalem, and this comes with a price. It is impossible to go "with" and to feel "without." United Jerusalem is a Jerusalem with Abu Tir as an authentic representative of the residents, and with a Hamas rally at one of its soccer fields. Ehud Olmert must finally give a truthful answer: Abu Tir or Abu Tur.

<title>A commission to investigate the occupation</title>
<date>Mon Sep 04 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
During the past two months, July and August, 251 Palestinians were killed in Gaza and the West Bank, all of them by Israel Defense Forces fire. About half of them were civilians, including women, children and the elderly. More Palestinians than Israelis were killed during the war in Lebanon, even though the Palestinians did not participate in the war and were not subjected to Katyusha fire. 
There has been a total freeze in the diplomatic process between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The road map has not been mentioned for a long time. There is no disengagement and no realignment. There are no unilateral moves, and certainly no negotiations between the two sides. Occasionally, low-level officials meet to discuss essential everyday issues. And there have apparently been indirect contacts about releasing Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. But the only area in which Israel and the Palestinians currently maintain relations is the violent conflict: raids, shootings, shellings, terror attacks, arrests, roadblocks, expropriations. Killed and wounded. 
There ought to be a state commission of inquiry about what is happening in the Palestinian territories. For all its importance, and all the shock in Israel over what happened in the Lebanon war, this war cannot be compared to what has been happening for almost 40 years in the territories occupied by Israel during the Six Day War. Whatever inquiry is conducted into the Lebanon war, it will at most find that the prime minister made a mistake one day, and that the defense minister and the chief of staff made incorrect decisions on another day, and that one general and several brigade commanders did not understand what was happening in the field on a certain night, and that food and drink did not arrive in time. There is no comparison at all between mistakes of that kind and the fateful failures of all Israeli governments since 1967 with regard to the West Bank and Gaza. These involved erroneous decisions of historic magnitude. 
The state commission of inquiry into the disasters engendered by the Israeli regime in the territories should include historians, social psychologists, sociologists and scholars of culture and religion, and not necessarily former generals and Supreme Court justices. Such a commission would probably discover that there is a strong connection between the wars in Lebanon and what occurred between us and the Palestinians during those years, and that our control over the West Bank and Gaza contributed quite a bit to the continuing deterioration in the north. 
Over time, the number of those who remember what happened in the Palestinian territories after 1967 is gradually declining. Who remembers, for example, that due to Israel's belief that Arab leaders were purposely leaving the refugees in wretched situations in the camps in order to incite them against Israel, Israeli governments decided to solve the refugee problem in Gaza through reconstruction? For a while, Israel took several steps in that direction. But they turned out to be divorced from reality, and were halted. Who remembers that the basic principle articulated by then defense minister Moshe Dayan was to allow full freedom of movement for Israelis and Palestinians from Dan to Eilat, and that for over 20 years, there was not a single checkpoint between the territories and the State of Israel? Who remembers that Dayan also gave an order to reduce the official Israeli presence in the territories to a minimum: no flags, no patrols and of course, no settlements near Arab communities? 
There were terror attacks then, too, but with no comparison to what began during the intifada years. There were years when fewer than five administrative detainees from the territories were in Israeli prisons. Today, as we know, there are thousands. 
What happened during the 20 years that have elapsed since then? During the earlier period, were the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza fond of the Israeli regime? Of course not. So how did we get to where we are now? Does the blame lie with the settlement enterprise, which created a blatant apartheid regime in the territories and led to feelings of bitterness and deprivation, a sense of being robbed? Or perhaps the decisions made about East Jerusalem were mistaken? What resulted from the mistakes in the Oslo Accords? And where is the separation fence leading? All this is far more important than what happened just now in Lebanon, and it is this situation that should be the subject of a state commission of inquiry.

<title>An endangered state</title>
<date>Sun Sep 03 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
It is hard to believe, but only 60 years after the Holocaust the Jewish people is once again in danger of being destroyed - at least in its own state, where 40 percent of the world's Jews are concentrated. Evidence of the severity of the danger can be found not only in the explicit threats by Iran's president, which are backed up by an arms program that would provide the means to carry them out. It can also be found in recent articles in the European press that discuss the possibility of Israel's 'disappearance' as a reasonable 'working assumption.' Additional evidence regarding the threat level exists in the fact that not only is Israel the only country in the world that is threatened with destruction, it is also the only state whose right to exist is the focus of international polls, with many respondents answering negatively. That is an honor that even Iran, North Korea and apartheid-era South Africa were never granted. 
The high degree of danger places before Israel a challenge no less serious than that facing the Jewish people in the 1930s. To face it, we must depart from the routines of hedonistic Western society. As a layman, I will not make recommendations in the area of security, but will instead relate to the general nature of public debate: first of all, there must be a focused agenda. The public, and in particular diplomatic and military officials, must put this threat at the top of their priorities, even at the expense of issues that during normal times would be the focus of attention. 
Personal interests must be put aside in favor of concentrating all the forces of good in Israel, the Jewish people and its supporters worldwide. One practical conclusion might be to create an emergency government in Israel, or at least to invite the opposition to participate in decisions on the Iranian issue. Another possible conclusion is that 'making heads roll,' for example in the wake of this summer's war, is a means and not an end, and should be considered a waste of energy and avoided unless absolutely necessary. In the event that it is necessary to restore public trust, which currently appears to be the case, then it must be done without hesitation. 
The same principle holds for the structure of the various committees of inquiry into the war: The goal is not to make heads roll but rather to learn lessons for the future. Thus it is preferable to create a two-stage process. In the first stage, the committee should not punish individuals, but rather make recommendations and draft an implementation schedule. In the second stage, the committee should check whether the recommendations have been carried out and only then fire those who were negligent in their implementation. 
Complete openness of thought is required, from extreme hawkishness to extreme dovishness. The threat to the very existence of Israel demands that any means to preserve it should be adopted, without giving in to ideological assumptions. If hesitating to hurt Lebanese civilians in response to attacks on us could send Iran the message that we will hesitate to hurt civilians if Iran strikes us, then we must not be deterred. If making peace with Syria, even if it entails evacuating communities, could damage the new 'eastern front,' then we should do that. Here it is worthwhile to note another step that appears even more important than peace with Syria. One of the reasons Iran can threaten to destroy Israel with impunity is Israel's image as a Jewish 'weed' combined with the tendency to ignore Israel's 1 million Arabs, who would also be affected by a nuclear attack. Israel's Jews and Arabs thus have a shared existential interest in strengthening their partnership. It is also necessary to drive home to the Arab world the fact that a leader who is neither Arab nor Sunni is willing to destroy not only millions of Jews but also hundreds of thousands of Muslim Arabs. 
Calmness is necessary: the threat level is high enough to warrant panic, but precisely because of the seriousness of the situation, various solutions should be examined with cool objectivity. For example, is it true that peace with Syria would dissolve its alliance with Iran, or would it only reinforce its militancy? 
The need to shape policy relatively quickly must not lead to hurried decisions taken without regard for consequences. The very degree and urgency of the threat reduces the room for error as well as the need for precise solutions.

<title>A ridiculous war against the gaps</title>
<date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The eyes of those sensitive to discrimination against the Arab population brightened when they saw the headlines announcing an unbelievable development: the World Zionist Congress decided to include Israeli Arabs in the development plan promoted by the Jewish Agency. Just as the Israeli government decides to extend an emergency order that harms the right of Arabs to marry whomever they want, the "Zionist parliament" says that "reducing gaps, coexistence and dialogue" are important Zionist goals. 
At the Caesarea Conference, a devastating report was revealed proving that discrimination against Arabs in education, the establishment of industrial zones, investment aid, and wage levels has led to poverty among Israeli Arabs that is three times greater than the Jewish population. And as if in response to that, the Jewish Agency now is purporting to "promote Arab welfare and education." 
It's very surprising since it's well known that the "national institutions" - the Jewish Agency and Jewish National Fund - primarily exist to enable institutional discrimination based on ethnicity while clearing the state from accusations that it deviates from universal norms common to liberal democracies. Indeed, the people most surprised were the Agency functionaries, who called the decision "illogical," because "the basic principle of the national institutions is to take care of Jews." 
For too many years, they got used to implementing discriminatory policies based on the supremacy of extra personal and collective rights granted to the Jewish community - in the name of Zionism. No Jew with an inferiority complex in the Diaspora and with leftist-liberal tendencies is going to make them serve "Arabs, Druze and Circassians." But the opposition was minor, and even unequivocally right-wing circles, for whom Zionism is a nationalist battle cry, didn't get upset. They noticed that the decision might sound pretty, but it has no practically validity. 
The decision is another one of many made in recent years to deal with the tensions among the principles of the Jewish state, Zionism and democracy. These decisions include seemingly brave positions against discrimination, but, in effect, strengthen it, because either they deal with the margins of the problem or they cannot implement the suggested solutions. The decisions mostly strengthen the illusion that painful decisions indeed were made, thereby cleaning the conscience and enabling people to feel that justice was done. 
A classic example is the High Court of Justice's decision regarding the Kada'an family, which was perceived at the time as dealing for the first time with the principle of equality, confronting the Zionist principle of "redeeming the land," and presenting a victory of democracy over the apartheid inherent to the national institutions' land distribution policies. Those institutions quickly learned how to "minimize the damage" and continue with their discriminatory policy. 
Attorney General Menachem Mazuz made another "historic decision" in early 2005, when he forbade the Jewish National Fund from issuing tenders for Jews only. And once again, a way was found to circumvent the decision through "land swaps," which only strengthened the JNF as a discriminatory institution with racist policies. 
The sharp debate that sprang up whenever there was a threat to the "Zionist" discrimination allows living at peace with discrimination in all the other areas - the economy, planning, education and more - since they do not clash with "the basic principles of Zionism." 
The fact that the World Zionist Congress' decision did not spark any debate is perhaps proof that the trick of inflating positions against discrimination, with no practical results, has exhausted itself. If indeed, liberal Jews want to contribute to the campaign against discrimination against Israeli Arabs, they would best enlist in the effort to shut down the "national institutions," whose very existence is the basis for such discrimination. The attempt to harness the Jewish Agency into a war against the gaps is ridiculous.

<title>Between immigrants and natives</title>
<date>Thu Jun 01 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
It's been less than two weeks since the High Court of Justice issued its ruling maintaining the deprivation of the rights of Palestinians to reunify their families, and we already have the decision that Palestinian MPs from Hamas, living in Jerusalem, will be expelled if they don't resign within 30 days. 
The suspicious will find a connection between the two decisions and wonder if the government is deliberately attempting to try the public and legal system's patience for evil acts bordering on racism, as preparation for even more brutal steps. According to the reactions so far, there have been no firm demands for an end to this cruelty and the government can continue on its merry way; the security excuse serves as an effective fig leaf from any domestic criticism and foreign criticism can always be rejected as forms of anti-Semitism. 
Seemingly, there is no connection between the prevention of family unification and the threat of expulsion; but the two matters touch on basic perception of the status of Palestinians in their homeland: It's no accident that both issues fall within the realm of "entry to Israel," whether preventing it or stripping it. 
The Israelis, children of immigrants, who in the best case are only separated by a generation from the status of refugees - uprooted and expelled - impose on native Palestinians the status of foreigners, of living in a country to which they do not belong, forcing them to fight for the right to live in their home, and exposing them to an expulsion decree or banning their "entrance" on the grounds that they "do not belong." 
Not many years have lapsed since the Jewish yishuv fought for its legitimacy and was forced to defend itself from the argument that it was a collection of immigrants taking over a country they did not own, until the situation was reversed; now it is the Palestinian nation that has to fight for the collective legitimacy that this is their homeland and that they are not some collection of foreigners breaking into a country that is not theirs, and nothing but a gang of terrorists. 
The Palestinians seeking family reunification and the right to live in Israel are rejected because they are aliens and their presence here "could change the face of Israeli society." The Jerusalemite MPs, like all the Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, never asked for their status as permanent residents; it was imposed on them. 
In 1967, Israel conquered East Jerusalem and sought to annex the territory without annexing the inhabitants. The legal trick invented for the purpose imposed on the 70,000 Arabs of East Jerusalem the status of "permanent resident" as if they were new immigrants who had not yet been naturalized as citizens. But in this case, it wasn't the Arabs who emigrated to Israel, but Israel that emigrated to them. Under the conditions that prevailed at the time, it was a liberal approach, even if it was a contravention of international law, since on the one hand, their status as Jordanian citizens was not stripped from them - and it was important to them since the Jordanian kingdom was their economic, administrative, family and educational centers - and on the other hand, the "permanent residency" gave them the right to enjoy the benefits of Israel's welfare system, freedom of movement and relatively broader freedom of speech than existed in the occupied territories. 
It wasn't a favor being done by the Israeli occupiers, because the alternative - granting them Israeli citizenship as happened to the Arabs of the Triangle annexed in 1949 - was worse; and leaving them without any status in Israel would contradict the pretensions of "unifying the city" and would have perpetuated the occupation in it. 
Therefore, the interior minister's bragging that he is doing a favor by paying them National Insurance Institute payments, child allotments and health insurance, is hollow and patronizing. This arrangement, after all, is 40-years-old, and enabled people like Ehud Olmert and Ronni Bar-On to take pride in the "unification of Jerusalem" and to condemn "the leftists who neglected East Jerusalem because they wanted to divide the city." 
The suspicion sneaks in that the emphasis on denying permanent residency (and the denial of the package of rights that accompany that residency) is preparing the groundwork for similar steps toward thousands among the 230,000 Palestinian residents of the city who were imprisoned on the western side of the separation wall. If the election of a person in democratic elections and according to a published platform can be an excuse to strip them of a "permanent status," meaning expulsion from their home, and if the definition of every Palestinian is as an "alien" and an "enemy subject" strips them of their right to "permanent residency" - what does that mean for all the inhabitants of East Jerusalem? 
Is this the message the government wants to send - we are capable of denying the right to live in Jerusalem - a message that means expulsion or stripping of the rights that have been granted and procedures that have existed for nearly 40 years? And then we're shocked by the rising protests overseas, condemning Israel as an apartheid state. Those who plot to expel Mohammed Abu Tir from his home justifiably earned the condemnation and disgust.

<title>Charge or release the detainees</title>
<date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
Friends told me that H. was in detention with other Palestinians in a prison near Mitzpeh Ramon. Startled, I asked why. "He was told that it's a secret file," they said. H. had been given a piece of paper saying he was under four months' administrative detention, and this was later reduced to three months. It has since been extended for another three months. 
H.'s lawyer, an Israeli, says that he has been given only generalized statements: that there is specific information about specific things and that H. "poses a danger to the security of the area." But no details or evidence. An appeal is to be heard by a military court. 
I feel I have gone back years into the past, when I was a journalist in apartheid South Africa. The Afrikaner Nationalist government used detention without trial on a huge scale as a weapon to attack opposition. Thousands were arrested, many were tortured. I was deeply involved in investigations into the plight of detainees and wrote ceaselessly against it. 
Because detention without trial was common in apartheid South Africa and is widely used in Israel today does not mean that Israel is an apartheid state. It has nothing to do with apartheid. What is the same, for Israel, South Africa and worldwide, is the questionable use and abuse of state power, and the harm done to individuals and to society by eroding the rule of law. The rule of law is a precious concept which safeguards the liberties of each one of us. If anyone has transgressed the law, then he or she must be brought to open court and charged as soon as possible. 
I know that in this era of terrorism, and especially in Israel which is under such direct attack, it can be difficult to insist on consistent adherence to basic principles of freedom. In dealing with the new terrorism, the world's democracies have enacted laws and adopted tactics which seriously detract from freedom and which would have been unthinkable only five years ago. The United States, for example, is flagrantly, and tragically, undermining its own constitutional beliefs by its treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Yet without the rule of law we are all at the mercy of faceless officials who can do as they please. We have to be vigilant. 
I watched, and reported, as South Africa slid down the slippery slope of repression. Always there was government justification for harsher laws and greater power to detain people. The authoritarian state became entrenched. 
I have known H. for more than seven years. I first met him when he was a tour guide with a Palestinian organization. I arranged tours by Israelis to Palestinian areas and H. was one of the guides. He was friendly and imparted information in a straightforward way. He lost his job soon after the intifada started. We kept in touch. We phoned each other from time to time and he visited me. He told me he was working in his village: He was the secretary of the medical clinic. He had a large family to support. 
He said the Israel Defense Forces had put up an earth barricade around the village so that no cars could enter or leave. The half-hour drive to Bethlehem now took up to two hours: Villagers had to climb over the barricade, take a taxi to the next barricade, climb over and so on. It meant about four taxi rides, including of course for the young, the old and the infirm. The barricade was removed after a few years. He repeatedly invited me to visit his village and to look at the clinic's work. I was unable to get there so could not check what he told me. 
Now H. is in prison with many hundreds of others. I asked another Palestinian friend about H. He laughed and said the village clinic was probably funded by Hamas, and that could be the link with H.'s detention. There have been many arrests in the West Bank, he said. 
I do not know whether H. is a terrorist intent on killing Israelis, or a decent man caught up in circumstances where he was trying to make a living and also help his people. I would be surprised to find that he is a would-be killer. I have always found him talking in terms of peaceful coexistence between Jews and Arabs. I remember his work as a tour guide in furthering good relations. 
His detention without trial also resonates with me in a very personal way. After the fall of apartheid, I was able to gain access to some of the South African Security Police files on me. I found reports that stated that I had attended social parties of extreme left-wing people. There were lists of these parties. In fact, I had never been to a single one. I was similarly wrongly described as having attended sundry left-wing meetings. 
I learned that on at least two occasions, a "banning" order had been considered for me. This was an administrative decree which would have severely curtailed my personal liberties. The banning decision would have been taken in secret on the basis of secret information, which I would not have known or been able to challenge. 
That is why I am concerned about H., and others held without trial, for months and even years. It is wrong, and dangerous, for all of us. The same cry that I repeatedly uttered in South Africa is relevant and needed in Israel: charge or release. 
Benjamin Pogrund was deputy editor of The Rand Daily Mail in Johannesburg. He was prosecuted for his reports exposing ill treatment of prisoners in South Africa.

Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni says that today's UN would not pass the November 29, 1947, decision that called for the partition of the Land of Israel and the establishment of the state of Israel. Livni is pointing to a genuine problem: Israel is struggling to maintain its existential legitimacy as the Jewish state. The question is what the foreign minister and her colleagues in the government are doing in the face of the danger. 
The British Guardian published two lengthy articles this week comparing Israel to the former apartheid regime in South Africa. It was not pleasant reading, a listing of Jewish Israel's sins against its Arab citizens and the Palestinians in the territories: discrimination, separation, hatred and occupation. The troubling problem is not the presentation of the facts but the unwritten message: if Zionism is the same as apartheid, than it can be deemed as worthy of eradication as apartheid. 
In 2006 an ideological alliance has emerged between liberal circles in Europe and the conservative, fire-breathing Iranian president. Both describe Zionism as a European effort to get rid of the hated Jews of the old world at the expense of the Palestinians; both accuse Israel of exploiting the European Holocaust (which Mahmoud Ahmadinejad denies ever took place) to oppress the Arabs; and both would like to see it eliminated. The only difference is that the Iranian president proposes to the Europeans that they take back the Jews, and the European liberals prefer a Jewish minority in an Arab Palestine (as "a state for all its citizens"). 
Israel usually writes off such views as expressions of anti-Semitism. But even if that is true, the problem remains just as bad: Israel is losing its grip on important, influential parts of public opinion in the West, and is being shoved into the corner with rightist, Christian groups that preach in favor of a war of civilizations with Islam. 
As a result, there is a growing gap between the Israeli interpretation of reality and the way Israel is perceived in the world. Moves that appear to Israelis as withdrawal and compromise - starting with the separation fence and the disengagement from Gaza - are interpreted overseas as exercises in perpetuating the occupation and annexation. The boycott the Olmert government has declared against the Palestinian Authority in response to the Hamas victory is presented as a defensive measure against a murderous enemy. But overseas it will be perceived as subversion of democratic elections, with the goal of avoiding negotiations and expanding settlements. The BBC will show Olmert touring the fence and promising to annex the settlement blocs and Jordan Valley, juxtaposed against Hamas leaders' proposals for a cease-fire, and images of the growing distress in the territories as a result of closed border crossings and the freeze in fund transfers. 
David Ben-Gurion said that Israel's fate is dependent on two things: its strength and justness. His heirs believed strength was enough. In the current election campaign as well as those in the past, the candidates are competing over who will annex more territory and hurt the Palestinians more. None are speaking of Israel's legitimate problems and saying what must be done to fix them. 
Olmert once warned that the occupation would turn Israel into a leper, but when he reached the leadership position he forgot and returned to the solutions of force. His rival, Benjamin Netanyahu, who spoke as finance minister of the "tsunami of the markets" that neutralize independent governments and bend them to the demands of the global economy, apparently believes that globalization doesn't apply to political life, so Israel can put up fences and settle and ignore the international community. 
Force is a necessary condition for the state's existence, but it is not a sufficient condition on its own. The time has come to change priorities, and to give some importance to Israel being just. That doesn't mean getting up and running out of all the territories. Even after such a withdrawal, there will be things that Israel will be blamed for and accused of. But the next government must place the problem of Israel's legitimacy in the forefront and invest every possible effort to improve Israel's image in the world.

<title>Israelis' feeble enlightenment </title>
<date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
In general, when controversy rages, when the newspapers are full of arguments - and every lawyer knows how many arguments it is possible to find for and against any issue - and when many (organizers, police, opponents, politicians, publicists) are involved in a decision or action, the real nature of the event gets lost in the images of how its supporters, or opponents, want to present it. Therefore, it is worth asking a few leading questions in order to understand the nature of the Gay Pride parade, and clarify what does not belong in the debate over it.  
Is the parade meant to emphasize that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel? If not, why is it specifically taking place in Jerusalem? Should the parade only go through West Jerusalem, or through the entire city? For if we are talking about united Jerusalem, why not also bring the tidings of sexual liberation to East Jerusalem, closed off within its wall, so that the march could also be seen as a parade about Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem, thereby reflecting the consensus? Incidentally, is it not also worth asking such a question about the necessity of marching through Jewish neighborhoods that see the event as not only a "parade of perverts," but also a "parade of the secular rulers?"  
And other questions should also be asked: Is it important to march in Jerusalem because there are many liberated homosexuals there, or because there are many oppressed homosexuals there? If it's because there are many oppressed homosexuals, it could very well be that it would be even better to march in Be'er Sheva, where there are apparently far more oppressed homosexuals. Or why not organize a Gay Pride parade in Yeruham or Sderot or Hatzor Haglilit? They say that it's harder to be a homosexual in those places than it is to be an ultra-Orthodox homosexual in Mea She'arim. Who says so? Among others, Haredi homosexuals, enjoy themselves quietly, without making a big fuss, in Jerusalem's gay entertainment venues. Incidentally, religious lesbians in Jerusalem also have public meeting places, and no one has ever made a big deal about it.  
It's doubtful that the parade's organizers have ever been interested in Jerusalem's human mosaic. Parades - even in the name of an "oppressed minority" - tend to ignore the human mosaic, with all its contradictions and griefs. There is no doubt that now, Haredi homosexuals have been trapped along with their community, which is under attack - because the decisive issue ever since the debate over the Gay Pride parade in Jerusalem began has not been the right to march, but the Haredim as "the enemies of enlightenment."  
It is possible to ask a few more questions in order to examine the real nature of the parade: Should its slogans be limited to equal rights for homosexuals, or should it also raise the banner of support for other oppressed minorities, such as the Arab minority in Israel or the Arab Palestinian nation? This question is meant not to detract from the homosexuals' right to march, but to argue that this parade does not have the significance that all kinds of human rights defenders have bestowed on it. This parade channeled itself from the start into the most "convenient" arena in Israel for the "unenlightened enlightened": the one in which "enlightened" means "anti-Haredi."  
For decades, the enlightened Israeli has freed himself of any obligation connected to human or civil rights - for instance, any thorough discussion of Israel's unwritten apartheid constitution - by means of a single battle cry: "The Haredim are to blame." There are two salient examples of this. It is not the religious who are responsible for the situation in which we are obligated to marry and divorce through the rabbinate. The state created this separation fence upon its inception. But it's convenient to blame the religious parties, who are the fence's subcontractors in this reactionary situation.  
An even better example is Israel's lack of a constitution. For years, Israelis have ascribed this lack to religious opposition to a written constitution. They forget that a constitution is impossible because the State of Israel, that unenlightened enlightened state, does not want to open the constitution with a declaration of full equality for all its citizens, and particularly not regarding property rights.  
None of the above absolves the religious parties, which are subcontractors that profit from the role assigned to them by the state. None of the above absolves the religious community of persecuting homosexuals. All of the above are meant only to point out that the present confrontation, which the homosexuals are hastening to celebrate as a victory over their persecutors, or as a defeat at the hands of their persecutors, is no different from the old, familiar battle over a "universal draft," in which all kinds of leftists - liberal publicists and "leftist" politicians - find themselves acting as the army's recruiting agents and Ehud Barak's soldiers.  
The homosexuals, through the Gay Pride parade, are happy to be "part of the majority" for a moment, and they thereby erase the sensitivity that they had intended to promote: sensitivity toward minorities. Minorities never all fit into the same basket. That's why they need sensitivity. The ruling elite - Ashkenazi, secular and enlightened to a limited degree - will not suddenly become fans of homosexuals as of tomorrow. The secular Ashkenazi majority, which delights in defining itself for the umpteenth time as "enlightened," will not really become enlightened through this struggle. The opposite is true. Israeli enlightenment is being built, as always, in the most primitive fashion, through incitement a la Tommy Lapid: "We are not Haredim." In other words, we have left the ghetto, and therefore we are free people - just like in Europe.

<title>Israel, South Africa and Hamas</title>
<date>Fri May 05 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki has accepted a Palestinian invitation to visit Ramallah, and wants to use it to take up an "open invitation" to visit Israel. He is eager to come because he sees himself as a peace broker in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, say sources in South Africa. But it is unlikely to work out. Mbeki will go to Ramallah to reciprocate the visit to South Africa last month of Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen). He also wants to meet Hamas leaders. 
Therein lies the problem. He will not be able to meet Hamas and also visit Israel, at least not as an official guest. That is clear from Israel's declared policy of refusing to talk to anyone who talks to Hamas. So even though Mbeki will be a mere 15-minute drive from Jerusalem, he will not be given any appointments with Israeli leaders. 
Whether he will be allowed to visit Israel privately, should he wish to do so, remains to be seen. Whether he will get to Ramallah via Ben-Gurion airport, or fly in via Amman, entering Israel through the Allenby Bridge, also remains to be seen. 
Mbeki reaffirmed South Africa's policy two months ago when he told his parliament: "We hold the firm view that the road to an independent Palestinian homeland is through the prescripts of the Oslo agreement as well as the principles contained in the road map for peace. Key among these principles is the two-state solution to the Palestine-Israeli conflict, the outcome of which must be the creation of a viable Palestinian state coexisting side by side in peace and security with an independent Israel." 
South Africa occupies a relatively influential place in the world. It still holds the moral high ground, 12 years since the victory of democracy. It is a powerful member of the African community and enjoys  considerable stature among developing nations. 
Mbeki has invested time and money in offering his mediating services for Israelis and Palestinians. He believes South Africa's experience in ending apartheid is a lesson for peace here. But thus far he has achieved little success. He began several years ago with what was called the "Spier process," named after the wine estate in the Cape Town area to which he invited Palestinian cabinet members and Israelis for several days of discussions. He invited the Palestinian ambassador, but not Israel's ambassador. He took part himself and so did members of his cabinet. 
The Israeli participants were members of left-wing opposition parties and people who had previously had some influence in Israeli politics. That was the problem: Mbeki was talking to the wrong people and his peace-making effort was viewed with derision in Israeli official circles. It was also a cause for irritation because Mbeki seemed to go out of his way to bypass the Israeli government. 
He went on in the same way to invite a group of army refuseniks. There was also an attempt to bring a delegation of South African Christian, Muslim and Jewish religious leaders to come and talk to Jews, Muslims and Christians in Israel. It failed amid astonishment that it was even tried because, inside South Africa, leaders in the Muslim religious council were refusing even to meet leaders of the Jewish Board of Deputies and the government wasn't known to be  doing anything to remedy this. 
Mbeki must have realized that he wasn't getting anywhere. Ehud Olmert, then minister of trade and industry, was a guest in 2004. It is believed that he and Mbeki got on well personally and have been in touch since then. Last year, Mbeki invited members of the Likud, who were then in government. 
Mbeki is well-intentioned. But critics say he is ill-informed. He is trying to replicate the model of what happened in South Africa during the struggle against apartheid: White leaders inside South Africa went abroad for meetings with the exiled leaders of the African National Congress. That was the start of contacts which finally led to negotiations for the end of apartheid. But the example is inappropriate: Mbeki went wrong by inviting members of the Israeli opposition. In this part of the world, Israeli and Palestinian leaders have been  meeting, however haltingly, since the early 1990s. 
The real lesson that could be offered is the basic fact of the interracial dialogue which happened both outside and inside South Africa. That example of  contact could be of immense help to Israelis and Palestinians now divided by mutual fear, hatred and mistrust. 
However, South Africa's further attempt to relate its apartheid past to conditions in today's Israel causes anger. Israel rejects any comparison and is thus skeptical about peace efforts drawing on South African  experience. 
Mbeki has also undermined his credibility as a peace broker by remaining silent about the call to "wipe out" Israel by the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It should also be noted that South Africa continues to back criticisms of Israel in international forums in instances which Israel regards as unfair. Statements condemning suicide-bomb attacks against Israelis are usually qualified by ifs and buts. 
Immediately after Hamas entered the Palestinian Authority government, South Africa extended an invitation to its leaders to come and talk. Mbeki told his parliament: "It's important to respect the will of the Palestinian people, they elected Hamas." Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said South Africa wanted to share its experiences in the transformation from apartheid to democracy with Palestinians and Israelis. Hamas leaders have apparently not yet been there. Instead, Pahad, together with the minister of intelligence, Ronnie Kasrils, was due to visit here to meet Hamas. That would not have gone down well with Israel: Kasrils, born Jewish, condemns Israel in extreme terms and urges worldwide total boycotts. 
Mbeki has, however, pushed them aside and has personally taken charge of trying to help the peace process. Pahad and Kasrils might, it is understood, come ahead of him as an advance party, but he will be the man. Pahad has said that Mbeki will come only once both the Palestinian government and the new Israeli government are formed.  The first was sorted out a month ago, and the second is likely to be in place quite soon. So a Mbeki visit could be imminent. 
What South African lessons might Mbeki read to Hamas? That they must embrace dialogue and be willing to talk to Israel? That they must follow the path of the African National Congress which, in 1961, turned to armed resistance against the white rulers, but also pursued a policy, for reasons of principle and strategy, of not killing civilians? That had a decisive effect later in persuading whites to end apartheid rule. 
If Mbeki does this, and succeeds in influencing Hamas, he could end up as a welcome guest in Jerusalem. This happy outcome does, however, seem remote. Instead, Israel and South Africa could be heading for a diplomatic impasse.

<title>It's not a tic, it's a wink</title>

In formulating the High Court of Justice's ruling on the Nationality and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order), a ruling that makes it possible to deny Arab citizens the rights that Jews have, Justice Mishael Cheshin wrote: "If someday the Knesset legislates an immigration law whose purposes include preserving the Jewish majority in the state of Israel, it is possible that the court will have to examine the demographic consideration in-depth, and the court will take up the matter and vanquish it. However, this is not the case with the matter at hand, as we have not been asked to examine this issue." 
But even this loquacious formulation cannot remove the large shadow that was cast yesterday over the Supreme Court, the shadow of Yisrael Beiteinu Chairman Avigdor Lieberman. It is very doubtful that the High Court is capable of protecting Israel's Arab minority against further racist legislation. 
"The demographic issue" reverberates through long pages of the court ruling, especially in the form of denial. This ruling must be deemed a masterpiece of denial. Although Justice Ayala Procaccia, one of the minority justices, wrote of the demographic consideration: "Even if it cannot negate the truth of the security consideration, it may affect its weight and strength" (Justice Salim Joubran also wrote in this vein), the bulk of the denial came from Supreme Court President Aharon Barak, who insisted on writing that the matter of the "Jewish majority" is not what motivated the legislator to amend the law. Why did Barak insist on integrating denial of the demographic motive into his opinion? 
Perhaps this is the Supreme Court president's contribution to rebutting possible criticism of the court by the legal community abroad. Perhaps he was trying to ensure that the ruling does not afford the legislator a legal basis for continuing to deepen the apartheid legislation. After all, ever since the state's establishment, the security justification has served as a front behind which other considerations stood. The very identification of "the state's security" with "the Jewish majority" is due to this long-standing tradition, which can be seen in the legislation on land ownership. Here, too, the words "the state's security" are camouflage for assuring extra rights for the Jewish majority. The Supreme Court can no longer boast of clean hands. Moreover, the public debate about the law, and the fervent statements in support of it that related precisely to "preserving the Jewish majority," cannot be erased with the sweep of a decision. 
Yesterday's ruling mixes the issues of "the Jewish majority" and "the state's security" and places both under the formalistic facade of "immigration policy," making disingenuous use of European legislation against immigration from Third World countries. To this end, Cheshin made use of an article written by Professor Amnon Rubinstein and Liav Orgad ("Human Rights, State Security and the Jewish Majority - The Case of Immigration for Purposes of Marriage"), which was published earlier this year in the Israeli legal journal Hapraklit. Even the article's title points to the connection between "security" and "the Jewish majority." 
Cheshin wrote: "Beyond this stands the state's right not to allow residents of an enemy country to enter its territory during time of war." However, Palestinians who live in the occupied territories are not "inhabitants of an enemy state." They are not inhabitants of any state. They have been subjects of the Israeli occupation for over a generation. Moreover, they have no other country, and Cheshin, when he suggested that the petitioners "go to Jenin" during a hearing on the petition in February, knew very well what he was decreeing for Palestinians in the territories, as well as for Arab citizens of Israel: to be squeezed into the place offered to them; to live alongside Jews who come in their tens of thousands from every country in the world; to accept the fact that among the million who came during the past 15 years, one-third are not Jewish, yet they do not endanger "the Jewish majority" - not because they are not "part of an enemy country," but because they are not part of the Palestinian people. 
No formalism can force the Palestinian question into a disingenuous formula of "immigration to a European country" or "immigration from an enemy country (we are not, after all, talking about immigration from Syria). We are talking about the life of a single community, part of which lives in a country that discriminates and the other part of which lives, defenseless, under prolonged occupation. The only comfort a fair-minded person can draw from this ruling is the wise words written by Barak: "It is not possible to maintain a sharp distinction between the status of human rights during wartime and their status during peacetime. The line between terror and calm is fine. It is thus everywhere. It cannot be maintained over time. We must take human rights seriously, both during wartime and during times of calm." And he added: "We must free ourselves from the naive belief that when the terror ends, it will be possible to turn the clock back." On the other hand, who could continue to hold this naive belief in light of this ruling?

<title>Know the boundaries</title>

Prospects for peace, already dire since the collapse of the Oslo process, are deteriorating still further. The open anti-Semites of Hamas seem likely to win a significant mandate in Palestine, and those who oppose a Palestinian state still persuade a significant proportion of Israelis. Kadima's project of unilateral disengagement, even if implemented fearlessly, is unlikely to lead to a just settlement of the conflict. We will see more terrorist attacks worldwide, and an intensification of the "war against terror." This context may accelerate the polarization of opinion in the United Kingdom between those who demonize Israel and Jews on the one side, and those who demonize Palestinians and Muslims on the other. We oppose both of these ways of thinking. 
The Palestine solidarity movement in the U.K. is dominated by campaigns to boycott Israel. These campaigns divide those who want a just peace, and they portray Israel as a racist pariah state like the old South Africa. For five weeks last year, our union, the Association of University Teachers (AUT), held Israeli academics responsible for the actions of their state in a manner in which it did not propose holding anybody else in the world responsible. 
The boycott policy was advocated by people who argue that Israel is the only "illegitimate" state in the world; that Israeli nationalism is essentially different from other nationalism; that Zionism is a form of racism, apartheid or Nazism; that Israel plays a pivotal role in global imperialism; that the Zionist lobby has huge, covert and illegitimate influence; that Israel is guilty of genocide. Some academics, who rightly wanted to do something to help Palestinians, naively went along with this campaign. The boycott campaign discriminated against Zionist Jews and relied on hate-filled generalizations about Israel and Zionism. The boycott campaign amounted to a singling out of Israeli academics, without any politically or morally relevant reason, for special punishment and particular abhorrence. 
We forced a full, informed and democratic debate in our union, and the AUT membership overturned the boycott. We will continue to oppose an academic and cultural boycott of Israel, whether the boycotters pursue it openly or covertly. We will oppose ways of thinking that risk licensing an anti-Semitic movement in the U.K. But we will not do so on the basis of a hypocritical defense of academic freedom that stays silent about the impact of the occupation on Palestinian academics and students, or by muting criticism of the wrongful actions of the Israeli state. 
One reason that the loathing of Israel is becoming respectable in British society is that the Israeli state often acts wrongly. Israel still hangs on to the West Bank, encourages Jews to build settlements there, and rules it as a colony. The Israeli government acts as though it plans to annex a significant proportion of the West Bank to Israel. Within pre-1967 Israel, there is still discrimination against Arab citizens, some of it formalized in law. Because Israel is the occupying power, and because it is vastly more powerful than Palestine, it must accept a major share of responsibility for squandering the opportunities for peace in the 1990s. 
Anti-Zionists often talk about Zionism as though it was a monolithic entity. It is portrayed as one single project from the 19th to the 21st century, and the different political traditions within Israel are air-brushed out of history. Hostility toward Israel, in any form, is thought of as nothing but a response to so-called Zionist crimes. This mirrors the way that Israel's maltreatment of Palestinians is sometimes portrayed merely as a legitimate response to those who seek to "wipe Israel off the map." 
The term, Zionist, has become a term of abuse that denotes an evil and racist ideology. It is thrown venomously at anyone who thinks Israel has the right to exist. The collapsing of Israeli and Jewish opinion into Zionism holds Israelis and Jews collectively responsible for the worst excesses of Israeli nationalists. Some people reserve particular venom for the crimes of "the Zionists" that they do not use when talking about other crimes. The genocide in Darfur is currently intensifying and is an incomparably bigger event in terms of human rights abuses than the conflict in the West Bank, but the actions of the Janjaweed do not make the blood of the average British liberal boil in the way that the crimes of "the Zionists" do. 
For many on the left in the U.K., Israel has come to symbolize global US-centered imperialism just as, for some, Jews once symbolized the evils of capitalism. Palestine is often treated as a universal victim that stands for all the victims of imperialism. In this way, actual events in the Middle East are sometimes subsumed into a symbolic struggle between good and evil in the left's imagination. 
We need a movement in the U.K. for a just peace, one that campaigns in solidarity with the Palestinian and Israeli peace camps. Such a movement has to be conscious of where the boundaries lie between reasonable criticism of Israeli and Palestinian actions on the one hand, and the demonization of Israel, Jews, Palestinians and Muslims on the other. We need to resist those who try to force us to choose between one camp and the other. We need to work for the politics of peace and reconciliation within both Israel and Palestine.

<title>Letters to the Editor</title>
<date>Thu Jun 01 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The decision of Britain's National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) to invite its members to boycott Israeli academics that do not publicly dissociate themselves from Israeli government policies represents the latest round in the attempt of the extreme left and their fellow travelers to delegitimize Israel as the new incarnation of  apartheid South Africa. 
Along the way they have succeeded in gaining sympathy from more moderate liberals, who are critical of Israeli policy toward the Palestinians, but who lack in-depth knowledge of the situation. But make no mistake, for those behind the boycott campaign it is not about Israeli policy, it is about challenging Israel's right to exist. As such, it undermines support for a two-state solution and thereby fuels the conflict. 
Most of the promoters of the boycott are not motivated by conscious animosity toward Jews per se. However, in effect, their approach is prejudiced because it applies a different standard to Israel than it does to any other country. As an individual, I might care more about Israel or Palestine because I am emotionally connected to it - this is legitimate, but an external organization like NATFHE needs to have more objective criteria. Since Israeli academia and Israel itself are hardly among the worst human rights offenders in the world, it begs the question - why Israel? 
In the short term, it is unclear what the practical effect of the boycott will be. NATFHE will cease to exist on June 1 when it merges with the AUT to form the University and College Union (UCU). From NATFHE literature it would appear that the boycott policy will become defunct once the merger takes place. However, in the past, NATFHE has not always abided by its own rules, so this will need to be clarified soon. 
Democratization of higher education unions in the U.K. should make it more difficult to push through an overt boycott of Israeli universities in the future. After all, most union members are far more concerned with the fact that lecturers' income has fallen massively in real terms over the last 30 years. 
However, the problem is mutating into a new form - the notion of a "personal boycott," which is contained in the NATFHE motion. Instead of publicly calling for collective action, this encourages individuals to conduct their own boycott. This represents an insidious threat to academia worldwide. Instead of judging research on merit, it opens the door for academics from around the world to be judged according to their nationality and political opinions. It has begun with Israel, but who knows where it will end?

Regarding "Politics is killing them," May 19 
Your reporter claims politics is killing innocent sick Palestinians. Your reporter seems to have missed one important detail. The Palestinian Authority has an investment fund of billions of dollars, which it misappropriated from the donations received from Western donors, and refuses to use some of these funds to provide food and medical supplies for the Palestinian population. 
As with all the other problems faced by the Palestinian population, the cause can be laid directly at the feet of their leaders. 
It is very sad indeed to see how little their leaders are concerned for their welfare.

<title>Making Israel take responsibility</title>
<date>Thu Sep 14 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Many countries try to excuse their failings by blaming outsiders. For several decades after independence, people in the Irish Republic blamed its economic under-performance on centuries of British rule. Similarly, Israel uses anti-Semitism to excuse its expulsion of Palestinians in 1948, its discrimination against the Palestinians who managed to remain inside the Green Line, and its territorial  expansionism after 1967. 
All good excuses contain a germ of truth. The 19th-century Irish famine, which was exacerbated by British policies, greatly damaged the morale of the survivors and their descendants. Similarly, the Nazi Judeocide has left a huge scar on the survivors of that catastrophe. However, to escape dysfunctionality, every society must admit its own failings. Irish economic woes stemmed from a culture of risk-avoidance which, while derived from colonial history, had to be admitted and overcome by citizens of the independent state. Similarly, Israelis will never be secure until they admit their responsibility to make restitution for the crimes of their state against the Palestinians. Israelis should beware of false friends who tempt them to avoid this responsibility by misrepresenting the  critics of Israeli policies as anti-Semites. 
A salient example of this phenomenon appeared in Haaretz last week, in an article ("One hundred years of hostility," Sept. 8), which alleged that Sinn Fein was and is anti-Semitic, and tried to smear the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC) by association. Belonging to no party, I will leave it to Sinn Fein to defend itself. However, those Zionist Irish Jews who were prominent supporters of Sinn Fein would be surprised at last week's characterization. 
In his autobiography ("Living History"), Chaim Herzog wrote "My father [Yitzhak Herzog, later first Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Israel] was an open partisan of the Irish cause. The outstanding Jewish leader in the revolution was Robert Briscoe." 
Eamon de Valera, president of Sinn Fein from 1917 to 1926, was hidden in Rabbi Herzog's home on several occasions during the revolution. Briscoe, who made several trips to Germany to buy arms, was one of the hard-line Sinn Feiners, who followed de Valera in rejecting the 1921 treaty with Britain - an event which triggered civil war in the new state. Briscoe was also a Zionist who, while spending 38 years in the Irish parliament, found time to visit Poland in 1938 as an agent of Jabotinsky and to raise funds for the Irgun in New York in 1939, using his stature as a Jewish fighter for Irish independence. De Valera became a life-long friend of Herzog, meeting David Ben-Gurion in  Herzog's Jerusalem home in 1950 and being honored by the Irish Jewish community in the mid-1960s by the planting of a forest in Israel. 
In its early years, Israel received a great deal of sympathy in Ireland. While Briscoe's prominent place in Irish politics may have played a role, the two main reasons were a fellow-feeling for Jews as another people who had experienced religious persecution and ignorance about the dispossession of the Palestinians. As the truth about 1948 became known and the horrors of the post-1967 occupation became apparent,  attitudes changed. 
Coincidentally, the first English-language article to debunk the myth that the Palestinian refugees of 1948 had left on the orders of Arab radio broadcasts ("The Other Exodus," by Erskine Childers, The Spectator, May 1961) was written by the grandson and namesake of a prominent Sinn Feiner, who used his yacht to import arms from Germany in 1914 and who took the same side as Briscoe in the Irish Civil War. 
The IPSC reflects the fact that Irish people, having experienced settler colonialism, understand the suffering of Palestinians who endure it today. However, IPSC membership also includes Israeli Jews and Palestinians living in Ireland. Moreover, far from being "a subset of the Republican movement," as was claimed, the Belfast branch has Unionist members and  supporters. 
Our shared goal is universal human rights. We want all who have the right to reside between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, including refugees, to enjoy that right in peace. Unfortunately, many Israelis think that Palestinians should have less entitlement in their homeland than Jews who migrated to Palestine since 1882. The IPSC thinks both ethnic groups should enjoy all rights stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We have no view on the future organization of the territory. That is a decision for all those who are Palestinian or Israeli or both, including refugees. 
Many members of the IPSC are veterans of other anti-racist campaigns, such as those concerned with South Africa, East Timor and rights for Native Americans. IPSC members also support campaigns for West Papuans, Kurds, Tibetans and others. The Belfast branch is affiliated to a network which opposes attacks on immigrant workers in that city. With this wide perspective, we see that hafrada (separation) is the Zionist form of apartheid, so we argue that Israel should be treated like the old South Africa. 
Our campaign is gaining momentum. Recently, several Irish cultural events rejected Israeli embassy sponsorship and Irish trade unionists prevented use of Dublin trams for training staff of the projected tram system between West Bank settlements. But this is only the beginning. This campaign, part of a world-wide effort to help Israelis overcome their dysfunctional denial of responsibility, will cease only when Israel conforms to International Law.

<title>Not good enough</title>
<date>Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
The unilateral approach is not unreasonable in the absence of a Palestinian partner for an agreement, but anyone who proposes withdrawing to defensible borders, getting out of the Palestinians' lives, liberating them from the regime of checkpoints and apartheid in the territories, and returning most of the settlers to Israel within its pre-1967 borders must propose a plan that has geographic and demographic logic - not a temporary political compromise that leaves the problem burning on a steady flame. If Israel believes that what is best for it is to draw its own borders, with the support of the international community, it must aspire to viable ones. 
With the elections approaching, Kadima has remembered what it was founded for, and its leaders are promising, albeit somewhat weakly, that they intend to carry out an additional unilateral withdrawal in the West Bank after the elections, while canceling Israel's commitment to the road map. While the disengagement from Gaza involved withdrawing to the recognized international border, a kind of declaration that the era of settlement had ended, the withdrawal from the West Bank is much more than a political declaration. Its role is to enable the establishment of two states, which may in the future be led by reality to live in harmony and mutual affinity. 
The number of seats that Kadima is receiving in the polls, combined with those received by other parties that favor leaving the territories, indicate that there is broad public support for another move, and a major one. The obstacle on the path to carrying out another withdrawal is not Hamas, because ending the occupation is a necessity that does not depend on the nature of the occupied party's leadership. Rather, it is the abstract term "settlement blocs," which has gained too much weight in Israeli discourse and appears to reflect a new mistaken idee fixe. The number of "blocs," as well as their size, changes constantly, and the appetite for annexing territory has not waned for a moment. 
Avi Dichter, one of Kadima's senior members, talks of the Hebron-Kiryat Arba bloc, the Karnei Shomron-Kedumim bloc, the Ofra-Beit El bloc and three other blocs that would not be evacuated. This is not a withdrawal and it is not even worth discussing: It is merely talk about ending the occupation without ending it. 
Simple fairness requires presenting a withdrawal plan that does not remove people from their houses in dribs and drabs, but rather makes the 1967 borders its basis, along with those adjustments required by genuine necessity - not by "facts on the ground" established in error. There is no reason to postpone dividing Jerusalem, when every year that passes makes it an even harder demographic mixture to separate. There is no reason to annex the Jordan Valley, which is a vital land reserve for the Palestinian Authority. There is no reason to annex the entire Ma'aleh Adumim bloc, which cuts the West Bank into pieces and makes the division into two states a stingy pretense. 
The claim that Kadima has no platform and no plan, and is no more than a random collection of people seeking a safe Knesset seat, is unfair. Ehud Olmert is apparently determined to carry out another withdrawal. His proposal to exchange the road map for a unilateral plan with international backing is encouraging, and makes more sense than plans that aspire to topple Hamas. But so far, the plan he has proposed is insufficient.

<title>Olmert's marketing failure</title>
<date>Thu Jun 08 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Ehud Olmert has a problem. He was correct in identifying the demographic and political dangers that the occupation of the territories poses to Israel, and he put forth a worthy plan for the evacuation of most of the settlements and for convergence to new borders. But he failed in marketing. 
Olmert thought that the world leaders, who cheered Ariel Sharon's courage because of a limited evacuation of settlements, would willingly buy the new goods he was peddling: removing the settlers from the mountain ridge, and moving significantly closer to the Green Line. But to his surprise, the world was not enthused, and sent him back to do his homework. "Go talk with Mahmoud Abbas, and then come back to us," they say. 
It is hard to believe: For the first time since 1967, an Israeli leader proposes to pull out from most of the West Bank, and the world is silent. "Come back tomorrow," they tell Olmert. There are reasons for this that are not related to Israel. The governments in Washington, London and Paris, who lost domestic support, are disintegrating. Iran, Iraq and the price of oil are now of greater concern to the world than who will live in Beit El or Ofra. 
But there is another factor that Olmert did not take into account: that the Palestinians will carry out an international public relations campaign against his plan, and will succeed in swaying western public opinion of the validity of the opposing narrative. In short, that they succeeded in presenting convergence as yet another Israeli plot to take away lands and to further annexation, occupation, abuse and apartheid. Instead of arguing about the extent of the withdrawal, they diverted the discourse to questions of Israel's legitimacy and right to exist. 
When the western governments turned their backs on the Palestinians after the rise of Hamas, they turned to non-governmental organizations. It is easy to sell them Zionism as an evil empire, which drags the naive Americans by the nose. The boycotts against Israel by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) in Britain, and by the Ontario division of Canada's largest union of public employees, is just the beginning. Those coming after them will be easier to convince. 
Israel was caught by surprise. Just like in the case of the separation fence, it turns out that the internal Israeli debate is entirely cut off from the international agenda. What appears at home to be a serious withdrawal and an enormous concession, which will cause domestic rupture, is presented in the world as a tyrannical move against an occupied and wretched people. In Israel, there is fighting over the evacuation of some miserable outposts, and over there they hold serious discussions on the "one-state solution" that will put an end to the annoyance called Israel. 
Israeli public relations is finding it difficult to respond in kind and repulse the Palestinian onslaught because its policy is unclear. How can they market convergence if the government has yet to adopt it? And what to do with a prime minister whose internal message is that he is determined to carry out his plan, but abroad declares his love for Mahmoud Abbas? 
The result is that Israel is stuttering petty messages of pre-conditions for starting negotiations and the demands of the road map, which no one remembers anymore, rather than making a clear proclamation: We have decided to end the occupation and evacuate the settlements and move to a new line from which we will hold negotiations with the Palestinians after they sort out their internal affairs. Zionism is just, in more limited borders. 
Those around Olmert are saying there is nothing to worry about, that in the moment of truth the international community will rally in favor of convergence and evacuation of the settlers. Perhaps it will be so. But it is also possible that until the first home is evacuated, the world will come to see Israel's move as the wrong cure for the disease and choose the Palestinian narrative, which can be summed up in a single word: MORE. 
The decisions to boycott Israel, precisely at the time when the government is talking about a major withdrawal, are a serious warning signal. Successful marketing of convergence should be at the top of Olmert's priorities, and his trip to Britain and France next week will be an important test.

<title>Opening a door to Africa</title>
<date>Fri Jun 23 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki has confirmed that he wants to visit Israel and the Palestinian Authority this year. To make it possible, he has turned away from his declared intention of speaking to Hamas and says instead that his government will deal only with the Palestinian Authority led by President Mahmoud Abbas. 
The growing conflict among Palestinians means the timing of the visits, and even whether they will be possible, will depend on the outcome of the July 26 referendum and how anarchic the situation might be before and after that. Meanwhile, the Israeli embassy in Pretoria says it has not yet been contacted by the South African government about a visit. 
Until recently it was unlikely Mbeki would get to Israel, at least not as an official guest. He wanted to come, to take up a long-standing invitation, but made himself unwelcome in March by inviting Hamas to send a delegation to South Africa. His government said there was a "need to engage" with the Hamas leadership to help bring about peace and stability. 
The move upset Israel, which has a policy of refusing to talk to anyone who talks to Hamas. It also upset Abbas. 
Mbeki has changed his policy and conveyed it at a meeting with South African Jewish leaders last month. According to a statement issued by the leaders, he told them about his intention to visit Israel and the Palestinian Authority. He agreed to have a delegation of local Jews and Muslims travel with him. 
Abbas was a guest of the South African government in March and was given the honor of addressing parliament, as his predecessor, Yasser Arafat, had also done. Mbeki will reciprocate Abbas' visit and will address the Palestinian  legislative council. 
In practice that will, of course, mean he speaks to the Hamas government, which holds a majority in the legislative council. But, formally, he will be a guest of the PA president. Whether this will satisfy Israel remains to be seen. 
Mbeki has long wanted to get involved in the Middle East. It seems to be a personal mission for him. He believes South Africa's experience in ending apartheid offers lessons for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But so far he has made little headway. 
South Africa supports both Palestinian statehood and Israel's right to exist. In practice, though, in votes at the UN and elsewhere, it is highly critical of Israel. It has also kept silent about Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's call to "wipe out" Israel and his questioning of the Holocaust. 
The Jewish leaders who met Mbeki raised this issue. They told him that Jews, given their history, did not take threats of such a nature lightly, and did not expect their friends to take them lightly either; the international community needed to know how South Africa stood on the issue. 
Mbeki replied that his government's stance on the recognition of Israel and its opposition to all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism, was clear. For this reason, it disagreed with Ahmadinejad's statements and had conveyed this to the Iranian government. 
He did not know why no formal statement had been issued by his government and said he would look into it (so far, nothing further has been heard about this). 
Despite Mbeki's desires, his attempted role as a peacemaker in the Middle East has not carried weight. Israel is angered by any comparison with apartheid South Africa, and is wary of Mbeki's efforts to bypass official lines of communication. Successive Israeli governments have been cool and skeptical and he has not been viewed as a serious player. 
Perhaps, when he gets to Jerusalem, he will gain greater credibility in face-to-face encounters and persuade Israeli leaders of his good will and commitment to helping bring peace. Both sides do stand to gain significantly from an upgrading in relations, apart from the  obvious benefits of increased trade. 
For Mbeki, to be allowed to play a part in furthering peace would not only be personally rewarding to him but would raise his and his country's stature in the world. It could help South Africa win the permanent seat on the UN Security  Council that it wants. 
For Israel, there is the South African example of the dialogue between blacks and whites even when oppression was at its worst. And Mbeki could agree to urge Palestinians to heed a crucial lesson from South Africa's liberation struggle: Don't kill civilians. The African National Congress kept to the high moral ground and largely avoided attacks on white civilians. The country's whites therefore did not fear being killed and this helped make them more amenable to ending apartheid. 
A well-disposed South Africa could also use its influence to open the door to Africa and the developing world, transforming Israel's relations with the world.

<title>Sharon's second `big plan'</title>
<date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
Date: Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 IST 2006
The intense emotions of shock, orphanhood and fear elicited by Ariel Sharon's exit from the political arena evoked expressions bordering on kitsch, even from observers otherwise known for their sober approach.
"Parting from him is like parting from a father: expected, but always frightening and sad," Yaron London wrote, while Amnon Dankner described Sharon as "the portrait of a generation: "a figure embodying the split heart of everyone of us... from yearning to live peacefully to the necessity to resort to arms."
The similarity between Sharon and Yitzhak Rabin - and between those two and Moses on Mount Nevo - was inevitable: "From Moses to Sharon they all saw the land from afar, but none succeeded in bringing the train to a safe haven," one journalist concluded.
In other words, had his sickness not defeated him, Sharon would have brought us to the promised land - "peace with the Arabs and clear and recognized borders." The thwarted hope, or illusion, intensified the sense of loss. Again, cruel fate has robbed us of the chance for peace. Not our own acts and foibles, but "the angel of death, sharpening his scythe." But we will not stop pursuing peace and we will increase our support for Sharon's heirs, who are bound to continue his "heritage."
The sudden departure of a worshiped leader is always an opportunity to express his political will as one wishes to express it, not necessarily on the basis of the departed leader's real goals. The image of the "cruel general who became a peace hero" - although somewhat tarnished due to overexposure in describing Rabin - blinded the eyes of many. They failed to notice that Sharon was very close to the goal he had been aiming to achieve ever since he became an adult: a goal that has nothing to do with peace - to remove the Arab demographic threat unilaterally.
He was a junior partner to the removal of the demographic threat in 1948, by expelling hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. And later, when he climbed the rungs of power, his wish to initiate major historic moves grew.
His "big plan," which led to the war in Lebanon, attempted to solve the demographic problem by turning Jordan into Palestine, deporting the refugees from Lebanon, transferring them from the West Bank, and destroying the Hashemite kingdom. After this plan failed disastrously, Sharon drafted his canton plan, and strove to implement it in every post he filled. For many years he had to resort to underhanded, even illegal means, but he did not tire, and filled the territories with settlements and outposts.
Becoming prime minister enabled him to pursue his plan to "remove the demographic threat" - thus pulling out of Gaza seemed to subtract a million Palestinians from the demographic balance sheet. The "separation fence" next created isolated cantons, paving the way to fictitiously "losing" hundreds of thousands more. Setting up a separate transportation system, "border passes," and "closures" shattered the Palestinian community into four or five sub-communities, subjected to different conditions and gradually losing touch with each other.
On the eve of his hospitalization, Sharon could have surveyed his achievements with satisfaction. The moves to deal with the "demographic threat" gained unprecedented popularity that led him to believe he would be able to set up a Peronist-presidential regime in Israel. This regime would silence any criticism over his solving the "problem," by establishing an apartheid regime. The United States, entangled in Iraq, has signaled that the canton plan may be seen as the implementation of the Palestinian state, and the Israeli peace camp, crowning Sharon as its leader, also agreed enthusiastically.
The donor states agreed to funnel financial aid unequaled since World War II, thus financing Sharon's canton plan.
Indeed, cruel fate has robbed Sharon of attaining his deepest aspiration, to eliminate, after 60 years of struggle, the Palestinian demographic threat. However, there are signs that his illness has spared him the disappointment he would have suffered had he remained in power. For the present "big plan" - as it was in the war in Lebanon - is based on hasty, erroneous assumptions.
The Palestinian Authority's crumbling is only a matter of time, and donor states' patience is running out, which will lead to the drying up of the PA's financial sources, and therefore, a catastrophic economic crisis. The anarchy in the territories will spin out of control, and the violence directed internally and at Israelis will raise pressure to "react appropriately."
Extremist groups in Israel will undermine the "treacherous government," a new attempt will be made to revive the "Jordan is Palestine" idea and export the problem to Jordan, since it has no solution in the territories, or whatever remains of them once the "settlement blocs" have been stolen from them. The U.S. will be called upon to restore order, maybe in the style of Bosnia or Kosovo.
Like in the "big plan" of 1981, the biggest mistake at present is the attempt to solve the problem unilaterally with dictates and excessive power. Ariel Sharon is no longer capable of changing his approach, and perhaps he never was. But those who claim to be continuing Sharon's heritage should never forget that "heritage" also means learning from his mistakes and avoiding them.

<title>Staying home</title>
<date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>

A dispute between neighbors over a fence led to a precedent-setting ruling vis-a-vis an anti-Semitic incident in South Africa. Mel Fishman, a native Israeli, as the local media have noted, who lives in Mpumalangha province (north of Johannesburg), sued his neighbor, Gerhard Birkhausen, for demanding that he remove a dog kennel that he had placed on his side of their joint property line. 
For years, Fishman had been on good terms with Birkhausen, who maintained a canine grooming parlor next to his house, but their relations went downhill after Fishman purchased some land from a relative of Birkhausen's, and after he began trimming the hedges between their yards to create a fence. Birkhausen, who is also an artist, painted anti-Semitic slogans, including swastikas, in the area around Fishman's house. 
The local Equality Court - one of several created in the post-Apartheid era in order to combat racism - found for Fishman. The plaintiff's lawyer and the representatives of the civil rights organization that dealt with his suit expressed disappointment at the low fine (2,000 rand, or about NIS 1,200) levied against Birkhausen, particularly in light of the fact that the dog breeder did not express regret for his actions and claimed that he was merely exercising his constitutional right to free speech. 
Members of the local Jewish community, however, expressed satisfaction with the judgment, which, despite the low fine, underlined the fact that anti-Semitism was considered an expression of racist aggression and was illegal. 
The precedent says more about the normalization process in South Africa after decades of racism and discrimination, which left the vast majority of non-whites in the society with no rights or economic foundation, than it does about anti-Semitism in the country. 
In the past five years, South Africa has gotten onto the track of political and economic stability. It has a strong legal system and a free press, which does not hesitate to criticize the government. Still, some observers point with concern at the undue accumulation of power on the part of the ruling party - the African National Congress from the Nelson Mandela era, which is led by Tabu Mbeki - which in the absence of a genuine opposition has grown too strong. 
The political stabilization and economic health also find expression in demographic trends within South Africa's Jewish community. After years of emigration, which reduced the community from a peak of 120,000 in 1980 to about 70,000 at the start of the decade, experts are now speaking about an increase of 10 percent or more in the number of Jews living in the country. There are also increasing signs of stability and even renewed economic growth within the community, which is considered highly Zionist and boasts the highest proportion of children studying in Jewish day schools in the Diaspora. 
The government encourages return migration, and the proportion of South African Jews who are now returning is high. Among the returnees are a few thousand who immigrated to Israel. In addition, Israelis are estimated to comprise about 10 percent of South Africa's Jewish population. 
The Jewish establishment, which has expressed regret for not doing enough to end the Apartheid government, is consoled by the fact that many Jews were prominent in the anti-Apartheid opposition groups that fought against the racist regime and for human rights. Fear of social and economic chaos and violent crime gave way to optimism, and many Jews feel they have a mission to build a new, egalitarian society that will repair the injustices of the past. 
South Africa is now an economic and political leader of sub-Saharan Africa, and it has a central role in leading the Third World and the developing nations. The Jewish community can play an important role in developing political and economic connections on the African continent. The Chief Rabbi of South Africa, Warren Goldstein, 34, appointed after the death of Rabbi Cyril Harris, was known for his outspoken anti-Apartheid positions. Goldstein spoke recently about the migratory trends within the community, saying that it is choosing between "going home" (to fulfill the Zionist vision) and "staying home" to reinforce the local Jewish community.

<title>Stop scaring us!</title>

The State of Israel is the strongest state in the region - militarily, economically, scientifically and culturally. It enjoys broad support from the United States and European countries. It has peaceful relations with Egypt and Jordan. We could even have built a peace arrangement with Lebanon and Syria, if we had wanted to, but certainly no threat is hovering over Israel from that direction. 
But Benjamin Netanyahu is threatening us that they will throw us into the sea. Who? The Palestinians? Let's say they want to - can they? Netanyahu and his supporters on the right and the extreme right need to scare us so that they can continue eating away at the Palestinians' lands, just as long as everything is ours. This is the right and its doctrine. 
But far more worrisome - in words and actions - are our generals, those in active duty and those who once were: Moshe Ya'alon and Shaul Mofaz. They order a strategy of power and more power, from here to eternity. They warn of a threatening future, both in Jordan and in Egypt. They launch provocative acts of aggression on the lands of the West Bank, and continue  assassinations while ruining or murdering innocent people (without any ticking time bomb). All of this is to ensure that there will be action and risk, that the army will be given a larger budget, that the arms industry will grow and increase trade and that we will continue to worship our heroes who sacrifice their lives for our security. 
Every simpleton knows that there is no existential threat to Israel. Every reasonable person understands that the Israel Defense Forces' excessive operations against the Palestinians stir hatred, anger, fanaticism and a lust for revenge. The aim of the generals' remarks, which were not slips of the tongue, but intentional leaks, is to make us continue to be afraid and continue to allow the killing, destruction, expulsions, roadblocks and apartheid roads, and more and more fresh blows to be delivered, inspired by the vivid imaginations of our generals. 
When the past chief of staff - the one who opposed the withdrawal from Lebanon and from Gaza, and destroyed more homes and anything else that stood in his way than anyone else - also joined the group of doomsayers and fear mongers, I was reminded of the speech made by U.S. general and president, Dwight Eisenhower in 1961. In his farewell address to his nation, after serving eight years as president, he warned of the close ties between the army and the huge arms industry (in Israel it combines industry, purchasing and commerce all in one). The huge influence of this industry on all areas of life can lead to the superfluous and dangerous use of unnecessary force. Further on in his address, Eisenhower focused on the need to nurture democracy and conciliation between peoples, and to prevent war and change priorities in the division of manpower and production. The army and military industry are strong and influential, he said, and therefore this influence must be reined in and efforts should be made to build peace, conciliation, freedom and human rights. 
The U.S. only realized how right he was after it was too late, when it was becoming mired in the Vietnam War and cultivating the Cold War. In Israel, the IDF became a sacred cow upon the establishment of the state and today the army's top brass is very powerful. The IDF is a conqueror with a free hand on the trigger; everyone salutes it and anyone who criticizes it is marked as a flawed patriot. This army scorns human life and property, mocks the other and abuses injured populations. It is an army that has transformed every village and city into a detention camp for the sake of "our security," while knowing full well that every time it breaks into these places, a response will be provoked that will come at Israel's expense. 
The most worrisome thing today is the caution with which people from the peace movement speak about the possibility of reconciliation - even with the Hamas government - lest they be accused of a lack of "nationalism." Also worrisome is the acceptance of the fact that Israel may withhold the Palestinians' money while demanding that they uphold all agreements, at a time when we are the first to violate an agreement. 
The hastiness of the criticism, the search for collective punishments and the dispatching of the Palestinians to the Muslim countries, are also a folly that could be dangerous. Apparently our "wise men" will be happy if the Muslim countries once again mobilize against us. Then we will again be able to see ourselves as the ultimate victim of the world, and then - long live the army, long live armaments. And then there will be many festive memorial days. 
It does not have to be that way. It can be different. It is possible to try and build conciliation, to try and understand that the Palestinians are also entitled to a state of their own. We have to understand that we are applying a racist, colonialist and contemptible policy that we did not want. Merely saying these things aloud gives us the chills because after all, we thought that we, the Jews, have humanitarian values and that we remember that every person was created in the image of God. If we really do remember this, but continue with our actions against the Palestinians, then all of us  are afflicted with split  personalities.

<title>The checkpoint generation </title>
<date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
For nearly a month now, a young Palestinian has been hospitalized at Beilinson Hospital; soldiers shot him at a checkpoint in northern Nablus on Saturday, November 4. Haitem Yassin, 25, is conscious now, but he is still hooked up to a respirator. In recent days, he has been suffering from a high fever, apparently caused by an infection in his abdomen, which was wounded in the shooting. His family is still waiting for a report from the hospital about the number or type of bullets that caused the serious injury.  
At the Samaria Brigade, they are still investigating what happened that day at the fortified and isolated Asira al-Shmaliya checkpoint, through which only the inhabitants of several villages are permitted passage. However, according to testimonies taken by a researcher for B'Tselem - The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, it emerges that Yassin had irritated the soldiers. He dared to suggest to them that their demand of women to feel their own bodies to carry out a "security check" was inappropriate. So annoying was he that a soldier shoved him.  
Yassin, who had returned from overseas a few months earlier, had apparently not yet internalized the fact that it is dangerous to remind a soldier that a Palestinian is a human being. When the soldier shoved, Yassin shoved back. The soldier, according to the testimonies, started to scream and curse and hit. He quickly received reinforcement from two other soldiers, who fired into the air and at the ground. Even though Yassin fell to the ground after the shooting, the soldiers, relate the witnesses, threw him onto a concrete block, handcuffed him and kicked him. They also kicked him in the head, according to the testimonies, and beat him with their rifles.  
In a village in the Nablus area, S., another young Palestinian, is recovering from the trauma he suffered from a harsh beating at the hands of a soldier at the Jit checkpoint, midway between Nablus and Qalqilya. The office of the Israel Defense Forces Spokesman has stated that it was the young man who had shoved and hit a soldier who told him to return to his vehicle, whereas the soldier only fended him off, but the testimony of S. is completely different. He, like many others on that day, November 9, had got out of his vehicle while on the way to the Jewish settlement where he works, in order to find out why, just when everyone was hurrying to work, the line of cars at the checkpoint wasn't moving.  
According to one taxi driver, the soldiers announced that the cars would not be able to go through until noon. S., according to his own testimony, intended to return to his vehicle when the soldier approached him and looked as though he was going to hit him with his rifle. S. grabbed the rifle and pushed it aside. This apparently really bothered the soldier, who grabbed him, pulled him away from the rest of the people, flung him to the ground, and proceeded to him in all parts of his body. Including his head.  
Other soldiers, at the Beit Iba checkpoint west of Nablus, also got annoyed: At a student who felt he was suffocating among the mass of people who flocked to the checkpoint on October 9, and who felt the only way he could get some air was to climb a pole. When he refused to obey the soldiers' orders to come down, because there was no room and no air, they fell upon him and beat him with a rifle. According to the testimony of a friend, who spoke to an activist from Machsom Watch, the soldiers also broke his glasses and punished him: They detained him in "solitary confinement," in a kind of punishment cell into which the soldiers and the commanders throw Palestinians who "misbehave." The cell is intended for security suspects, but all too often people who dare to argue with the soldiers are thrown in there, or held in another sort of punishment cell at other checkpoints.  
In tens of thousands of homes in the West Bank live others, who may have not ended up in the hospital, but who every day accumulate harsh impressions of the nature and behavior of almost the only Israelis whom they encounter - the soldiers at the checkpoints. The non-Palestinians who pass through the checkpoints can also reach a similar conclusion - that most of the soldiers stationed at them are crude, arrogant, boastful and definitely hardhearted. All too often it appears that the soldiers intentionally cause the line of cars and people to dawdle at a checkpoint for a very long time. All too often they are seen laughing and grinning at the sight of the hundreds of people jostling and crowding in the slow line behind the narrow inspection turnstile.  
The Palestinians are not interested in, and do not need to be interested in, the explanations that Israel will give: It's a difficult mission; the soldiers are afraid; maybe someone will come bearing an explosive belt; they're young, still children; they're defending the homeland; if they weren't posted at checkpoints in the middle of the West Bank, suicide terrorists would be free to enter Israel.  
The truth is that even the soldiers' parents should not be interested in these explanations. They should, however, be very worried about their country sending their sons and daughters on an apartheid mission: to restrict Palestinian mobility within the occupied territory, to narrow the Palestinian expanse in order to enable Jews to move freely within that same occupied territory and in order to increase their expanse within it. In order to carry out this mission in full, facing the natives, the soldiers must feel and act like "superiors."

<title>The new British anti-Semitism</title>
<date>Thu Feb 16 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
Earlier this month, a parliamentary committee of inquiry began to hear testimony on the subject of the proliferation of anti-Semitism in Britain, with the aim of submitting a report that would aid the government of Britain in combating the phenomenon. 
This matter took on added significance in light of the trial of Abu Hamza, one of the leaders of the Islamic organization "al-Muhajiroun" (the Exiles), who is accused of inciting to murder Jews and recruiting British Muslims for objectives of the global Jihad. In the wake of a few studies that I have published about the issue, I was asked by the British House of Commons to appear before a parliamentary committee of inquiry. 
In fact, Britain has begun to generate its own suicide terrorists - for instance, Asif Mohammed Hanif, who blew himself up in April 2003 at "Mike's Place" in Tel Aviv, killing three civilians and wounding scores of others. Since then, homegrown Muslim terrorism struck in the heart of London, on July 7, 2005. This was not an anti-Jewish action but part of the global Jihad which threatens the West as a whole. But for some leading Muslim clerics like Sheikh Omar Bakri Muhammad (recently expelled from Britain), Jews, Christians and the West are all part of the "infidel" enemy to be destroyed. He and Abu Hamza openly recruited Muslim youth for "holy war" in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Palestine. 
In absolute numbers, Great Britain is today second only to France in serious anti-Semitic incidents among European countries. The hostile climate of opinion has been accompanied by an increase in violent assaults in the last two years. The number of synagogue desecrations has also soared, as well as serious attacks in the London neighborhood of Finsbury Park, and in the cities of Swansea and Edinburgh. A near-tripling in anti-Semitic incidents in British schools prompted the National Union of Teachers to issue new guidelines in July 2003 for combating anti-Semitism. There were also acts of vandalism in the months following the American invasion of Iraq, such as the desecration of a Jewish cemetery in the East End of London, where more than 400 graves were smashed. Last June, particularly ugly desecrations took place in Manchester and London cemeteries. 
In the past year, much has changed for the worse when it comes to anti-Semitism in Britain. Between 15 percent and 20 percent of Britons could be defined as anti-Semitic, according to a sampling by the Jewish Chronicle last year. As many as one in five Britons believe the Holocaust is "exaggerated"; a similar percentage would not vote for a Jewish prime minister, and a much higher number hold conventional anti-Semitic stereotypes about the link between Jews and money. As elsewhere in Western Europe, over 50 percent of Britons think Israel is the greatest danger to world peace. 
Last April, the Association of University Teachers (AUT), which has some 40,000 members, voted by sizable majorities to impose a boycott of two Israeli universities, Bar-Ilan University and University of Haifa, in solidarity with the Palestinian cause. The rushed vote was held on Passover eve, preventing most Jewish members from taking part. Just before the vote, speakers addressing the AUT's executive union meeting declared Israel a "colonial apartheid state, more insidious than South Africa," and called for the "removal of this regime." The boycott was reversed but the campaign continues. For most British Jews, such discriminatory boycotts are eerily reminiscent of anti-Semitic methods. 
The old-new anti-Semitism in Britain is not the kind of hatred that prevailed in Europe 60 years ago. The emerging multi-cultural society of Great Britain will not tolerate cries of Sieg Heil, jackboots, or the openly racist mythology that was irrevocably stained by the Holocaust. Still, the Muslim Council of Britain once again boycotted International Holocaust Memorial Day. 
It should be added that the vilification of Israel is leading to a sweeping accusation of the Jews as collaborators with a movement and a state that is conceived by some of the country's elites as a new form of fascism. This is evidenced by the unacceptable ease with which Israel is accused of "ethnic cleansing" or genocide of the Palestinians. 
This is not to say that British culture is inherently or overwhelmingly hostile to Jews. Great Britain, the birthplace of modern liberalism, continues to be an open society today, with a stable democracy, a free press and an independent judiciary dedicated to protecting individual liberties. For several centuries, and through World War II, Great Britain was, relative to the rest of Europe at least, a model of tolerance. Nevertheless, Great Britain has regrettably become home to a wave of anti-Jewish sentiments, innuendos, motifs, symbols, and public statements, which have gained legitimacy in British public discourse far beyond what is either healthy or acceptable.

<title>The problem that disappeared</title>
<date>Mon Sep 11 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
A month after the war in Lebanon ended, the time has come to ask what the Olmert government has to offer, now that the unilateral withdrawal plan is off the table. Beforehand, though, we must ask if more time, thought and planning is dedicated to policymaking than to coming up with a casual answer to journalists' questions. If the decision to go to war was made in a moment, in reaction to the abduction of the soldiers, it is questionable whether anyone even decided to put the realignment plan back in a drawer. 
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert mentioned it in a speech, Interior Minister Roni Bar-On said the realignment was being frozen temporarily, and Shimon Peres said there would be no withdrawal from the territories in the next 10 years. The impression is that the government has lost its way. 
Over the last two days, a chance rolled around for Olmert to recall the road map, in honor of British Prime Minister Tony Blair's visit. It is difficult to understand why Olmert waited for Blair's arrival to discuss a meeting with Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) or to promise the release of prisoners, just as it is difficult to understand why the Israeli government ignored Abu Mazen and then remembered him only after Hamas had taken power. The political vacuum generated by the government leaves a wide opening for those who have a clear agenda: the Hamas military wing, which is taking control of the Gaza Strip; and the settlers, who have already announced that the cancellation of the unilateral withdrawal will lead to a push for new construction in the West Bank. 
Everyone in the Sharon government talked about the "demographic problem" to convince people of the justness of the pullout. Now the Palestinians have been forgotten and demographics have been forgotten - all because the data can't be used for political ends. But the apartheid regime in the territories remains intact; millions of Palestinians are living without rights, freedom of movement or a livelihood, under the yoke of ongoing Israeli occupation, and in the future they will turn the Jews into a minority between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. 
The unfinished separation fence has become a monument to the shortsightedness of the Israeli policy to neither swallow nor regurgitate. The fence was meant to serve the unilateral withdrawal, but it has become clear that more outposts will be erected wherever the fence has not been completed, now that the Justice Ministry has suggested "laundering" the existing illegal outposts. When we want to withdraw, we will have to contend with more settlers. 
If the incumbent cabinet expands rightward to survive, it will not be able to set out a new political agenda. Even in the current situation, the cabinet does not appear capable of developing policy, only of reacting to the day's events from the gut and using force. The unilateral release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners sitting in our jails - with and without blood on their hands, with and without a trial, with and without a reason (some are held as bargaining chips) - could serve as a gesture that sets in motion a process of building mutual trust. 
But that is not enough. The least we can expect from a government that does not have a better solution to offer, and that has relinquished the solution for which it was elected, is that it tries to begin speaking with whoever is willing on the other side, that it involves Europe, that it suggests bringing an international force into the region - possibly with a United Nations mandate, to at least prevent deterioration. And perhaps this will be the way toward separation into two states.

<title>Uglier and uglier</title>

<content>
Palestinian politics has become exhausting and boring. At the end of last week the Fatah Central Committee convened in Amman under the leadership of Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas. This used to be a most important Palestinian political body - something like the politburo in the communist regimes or the secretariat of Mapai (precursor of the Labor Party) in days gone by. Now, at the meeting in Jordan, they decided on the establishment of a national unity government with Hamas, ignoring the fact that they are no longer in charge and that the government that is in power today is one that exists on behalf of Hamas. 
Farouk Kaddoumi, secretary general of Fatah, participated in the meeting (which was held in Amman because he does not enter the occupied territories), and declared that a government of experts must not be established because such people cannot lead the people "in a revolutionary period." The members of the young leadership reacted scornfully - What revolution? The man hasn't got a clue. 
Sixteen members participated in the meeting of the Fatah committee, all of them above the age of 70, and they discussed the question of whether and when to hold the movement's sixth convention. This is an almost permanent subject of debate that has been bandied around in the Fatah leadership for more than a decade now. The young members of the movement are already fed up with arguing with their elders. You aren't relevant, you aren't living in reality, you don't understand what is happening around you - these were some of the reactions to the meeting that were voiced by former government ministers and spokesmen for the younger generation, including Nabil Amar, Kadoura Fares and Hatem Abdul Qader. 
In Hamas the situation is no better. After the successes and dynamism that characterized the movement in the recent past, its leaders have sunk into stagnation. Internal tensions are not allowing them, whether in the territories or abroad, to evince flexibility on ideological issues. Hamas' leaders do want to lift the siege and the boycott by most of the world from themselves, but are unable to adopt a conciliatory formula on international policy or to bring the Fatah into their government. The heads of Hamas are insisting on holding on to all the powerful positions of the administration and most of the flexibility they have shown with respect to policy took the form of agreement to the "prisoners' letter," in which there is indirect and insufficient recognition of Israel. 
Can this state of affairs continue much longer? It is difficult to know. In the meantime, the 150,000 employees of the PA are receiving partial salaries and scraping by with difficulty. Every Monday and Thursday, there are demonstrations and strikes by these employees, which often turn violent. Hamas spokesmen are now accusing Abbas and his people of continuing in their corrupt ways. The Hamas organ Al Risala wrote last week that Abbas' office transferred $32 million to the Fatah leadership (which does not include Hamas members), and millions more were transferred to Palestinian television. Spokesmen for Abbas reacted angrily. 
It is clear that the phenomenon of Al-Qaida-style kidnappings is also a result of the anarchy in government. The demand by the new organization, the Holy Jihad Brigades, to release prisoners in return for the two Fox Network journalists it abducted was not directed at the State of Israel, but rather at the United States. Despite their release, this is a dangerous precedent because thus far every act of Palestinian terror has been to date done in a nationalist context and not in a context of global Islam. 
In the Palestinian public there is the fear that the stagnation and the anarchy will engender a harsh response from Israel that will win American backing. "The Americans are not succeeding in Iraq, they are having a hard time reining in Iran and we are the only ones they are succeeding in hitting hard, by means of Israel, in order to prove their capability," they are saying in the Palestinian media. 
Furthermore, the stagnation and anarchy in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are not attracting any attention from us in Israel. We have already become accustomed to it all: to the economic siege of the Palestinians, the apartheid roads, the regime of discrimination and collective punishment, and of course to "the lords of the land" who build all sorts of outposts. Only a few years ago each of these subjects aroused debate in Israeli society. Now there is hardly any. Everything keeps going on in the same way, only it is becoming uglier and uglier.

<title>What is Hamas doing in South Africa?</title>
<date>Fri Mar 31 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
"There will be cloudy weather over parts of racist South Africa," Zimbabwean TV weather anchors would forecast during the dark days of apartheid. Understandable perhaps, but bizarre. Fast forward to contemporary Israel and one wonders whether a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority will accept assistance in dealing with avian flu from the non-existent State of Israel? 
Even during the apartheid era, the differences between the South African and Israeli context were greater than the similarities, particularly on the fundamentals. The South African state was universally regarded as illegitimate, yet internationally recognised, de facto and de jure, even by Zimbabwean weather forecasters. Hamas' non-recognition of Israel is of a completely different order in that it denies the right of the State of Israel to exist. Moreover, Israel lives under the constant regional threat of hostile undemocratic regimes and now proto-nuclear powers that seek its destruction and sponsor acts of indiscriminate terror against its people. By contrast, in supporting the overthrow of the apartheid regime, Pretoria's African regional neighbors sought justice and democracy for all the country's citizens, rather than the state's destruction. 
Whilst Abu Mazen's official visit to South Africa starting this week has attracted little attention, Pretoria's invitation to Hamas has precipitated consternation in Israel. This is understandable. Responsible for some of the most heinous acts of terrorism, Hamas to date has rejected the international agreements signed with Israel by the PLO/Palestinian Authority and shows no signs of moderating its position as demonstrated by its failure compromise with Fatah to form a government of national unity. It is contended that as an Islamic fundamentalist movement, Hamas cannot compromise its fundamentals without changing the raison d'etre for its existence and there is little prospect of this as a party in power. 
Thus Israel is asking of South Africa, "What is there to discuss with Hamas?" What can South Africa deliver that the infinitely more powerful and influential Vladimir Putin could not? Informed Israelis may well question what South Africa hopes to achieve in talking to such a party when its own policy of "quiet diplomacy" toward the Mugabe regime has yielded nothing but embarrassment for Pretoria and further suffering for millions of Zimbabweans. 
Indeed there is a strong sentiment of dismissiveness and irritation in Israel at this middle-ranking country on the tip of Africa, with a governing party strongly affiliated to the PLO, "poking its nose in" where it is not wanted. For sceptics, South Africa's naivete and arrogance may have the unintended consequence of conferring recognition of Hamas' policies and positions toward Israel. South African watchers may also point to President Mbeki's own pretensions toward global statesmanship as the key to his personal involvement in facilitating dialogue between  Palestinians and Israel. 
Such is the case for the prosecution. There is, however, a different interpretation of South Africa's involvement that merits consideration. 
Last week at a Foreign Press Association press conference in Jerusalem, former prime minister Shimon Peres contended that his and Kadima's  approach to Hamas would be to first seek dialogue. Only as a second choice would a Kadima-led government carry out its four-year plan of disengagement unilaterally. Thus if the principle of dialogue is accepted and the policy of dialogue is the preferred option of a Kadima-led government, the same holds true of the international community and South Africa's desire to have a dialogue with the newly-elected government of the Palestinian Authority. 
Secondly, like it or not, many South Africans have a deep and personal interest in the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in particular. The country boasts an influential, but ever-diminishing Jewish population of some 80,000. There are Jews in the cabinet and parliament, including the leader of the official opposition. South African Jews are highly prominent in business, the judiciary and academia. One is reminded of the links of South African Jewry when walking past Jaffa Gate, restored with the support of South African Jews. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon singled out South African Jews as particularly welcome to make aliyah. 
But South Africa also has a much larger Muslim population of some 800,000, many of whom are successful, influential and enjoy strong and growing ties with the Middle East region. 
Thirdly, given Israel's often fraught relations at the United Nations, it is worth considering that South Africa is likely to be granted a permanent "African bloc" seat on any expanded United Nations Security Council. Every state needs friends in the international community, none more so than Israel and Palestine. South Africa carries a disproportionate weight in multilateral fora and still enjoys a degree of moral political capital. This is not just derived from its successful transition, but because, since democratisation, it has been a leading advocate of anti-poverty campaigns, debt write-off, trade reform and diplomatic conflict mediation. 
South Africa's testimony at the 2004 International Court of Justice hearings on the security wall aggrieved the Israeli government and its abstention from the recent International Atomic Energy Agency vote on Iran's referral to the UN Security Council was viewed as a sop to Teheran, or at worst, an act of hostility toward Israel. Yet South Africa's position was consistent with its approach to international relations, that is to seek consensus in multilateral forums and to oppose injustice,  unilateralism and pre-emption. 
South Africa's position on Iran's nuclear program was to await the full IAEA report before even considering a vote of referral. As the spurious grounds for invading Iraq demonstrated, being bulldozed or misled into adopting bellicose positions based on highly imperfect or manufactured intelligence is dangerous and counterproductive. 
South Africa can teach Israel and Palestine nothing. It has no experience in territorial, religious, or fundamentalist struggles. For South Africans, suicide bombers are a TV image, not a daily threat. It cannot mediate, cajole, nor persuade. It has neither the leverage, nor the political repertoire, to influence the deep and stark realities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. With all his charisma and credibility as a figure of reconciliation, not even Nelson Mandela could make the desert of Israeli- Palestinian relations bloom. 
South Africa is not viewed as an impartial (or even honest) broker by Israel and may even be viewed as a useful idiot by Palestinians. But what South Africa can do and has every legitimate right to do, is to share its story and to provide the protagonists a space for dialogue. Whilst South Africans generally understand far too little about Israeli history, fears and suffering, nor indeed about your particular struggle for identity, emerging from our past, we do have a degree of domestic success in conflict resolution, reconciliation, reconstruction and nation-building. Surely these are some of the issues that go to the very heart of the challenges that  confront Israel today?

<title>Abashed by Bush </title>
<date>Sun Feb 04 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
WASHINGTON - Among the hundreds of anecdotes about U.S. deliberation on whether to support the partition plan for Palestine, on the eve of the 1947 United Nations vote, there are some that reveal more about the president than about the supporters of the emerging state. Harry S Truman wavered during those days between his basic sympathy for the vision of the Jewish state and his anger at the incessant pressure exerted upon him. Even after he had announced his decision to support partition, it was actually a letter of appreciation that he received from Claude Pepper, then a U.S. senator from Florida, that managed to rankle him: "While this matter was pending, I received about 35,000 pieces of mail and propaganda from the Jews in this country," a vexed Truman wrote in response to Pepper. "I put it all in a pile and struck a match to it."  
Robert J. Donovan, in his 1977 book "Conflict and Crisis," on Truman's first term in office, doubts the veracity of this story. He interviewed several members of the president's staff and they all agreed that the bonfire was only in Truman's imagination. In the end, Truman contained his anger, and the following spring, after Israel declared its statehood, he agreed to recognize it. A somewhat anti-Semitic comment here and there, and Truman's refusal to more actively support Israel after its establishment, did not make much difference. Among "the Jews," he had already taken his place in the golden book of chronicles.  
Among the presidents who succeeded him, there were ups and downs - both in their support for Israel and in the fondness of American Jewry for them. Professor Kenneth W. Stein, who resigned from the Jimmy Carter Center after the recent publication of the former president's book, "Palestine: Peace not Apartheid," noted in an article in the current issue of the Middle East Quarterly that the meager support Carter received from Jews in the 1980 elections was a consequence of Carter's "increased pressure on Jerusalem." Since 1920, there had been no Democratic candidate who received so few of their votes, Stein notes in a section of the article entitled "The Roots of Carter's Anger."  
The roots of most of American Jewry's anger toward the current president, George W. Bush, cannot be traced to Israel. They did not vote for him in the first place. His ongoing support for Israel may be recognized and appreciated by the establishment, Israeli and Jewish, but it does not receive due credit among a wide Jewish-American public that is liberal, Democratic, dovish and very angry at Bush for significant and various reasons.  
Much has been written in recent weeks about the decline in interest in Israel among American Jews, but the writers made scant mention, if they mentioned it at all, of American politics. They should have - because Bush, strange as it may sound, is one of the factors behind the widening of the gap between Jews in America and Israel.  
This is one of those bizarre anomalies that characterize the period: The Jews of Israel comprise perhaps the most sympathetic group toward Bush in the entire world. They are certainly more supportive than the general American public and may very well be more sympathetic than any particular group of Americans. On the other hand, American Jews constitute one of the least sympathetic groups. A vast majority of them oppose Bush. Indeed, many really loathe him.  
In a survey conducted by Professor Camil Fuchs for Haaretz last November, it turned out that the overwhelming majority of Jewish Israelis do not agree with the statement that Bush is "dangerous for the world" - as the majority of people in Western countries hold (not to speak of public opinion toward Bush in the Middle East). In a Haaretz survey taken before the presidential election two years ago, Bush was clearly preferred by Jewish Israelis over his rival, John Kerry. But the Jews of America voted en masse for Kerry.  
Some American Jews have a hard time digesting a reality in which an Israeli prime minister can stand at Bush's side and describe the war in Iraq as an achievement. In fact, it could be said that the Israelis' fondness for Bush actually serves to alienate these American Jews from Israel. It is a sort of purist self-indulgence that does not tolerate contradictions: Jews from Israel. If this is the type of leader Israelis respect, and this is the type of leader who is a fan of Israel, how, these Jews wonder, can they identify with Israel?  
And here as well develops a line of revisionist denial of the reality that nearly every average Israeli accepts: Bush is actually "bad for Israel," and only its short-sighted citizenry and leaders fail to realize this. It is ostensibly a positive line, because those who choose it are looking for a way to continue to support Israel. Actually, however, it is patronizing and dangerous, as it is basically an arrogant attempt to deny Israel an independent assessment of the correct path for itself.  
Here's the catch. Bill Clinton, the friendliest president until Bush, and Lyndon Johnson, the friendliest until Clinton, did not put the Jews to this type of test. These two presidents received their votes and advocated policies vis-a-vis Israel that were acceptable to most American Jews. In any case, Bush is also the first president for whose support Israel is paying a price, even if it is a hidden price, among other important supporters, the Jews of America. He is making it difficult for a certain Jewish public to understand Israel and is making it easier for them to distance themselves from Israel. Of course, it's not he who is the guilty party. In this test, it is only the Jews who are failing.

<title>A believer in the grand gesture </title>
<date>Fri Jun 01 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Forty years ago, a prisoner in solitary confinement on South Africa's Robben Island had unusual insights into the Middle East: He warned against "humiliation" of the Arabs and urged that Israel "wash the enemies' wounds." A "grand gesture," he said, was needed for peace.  
Imagine how different our lives would be today if his advice had been heeded! And what dramatic change could be achieved if put into practice even now.  
The prisoner was Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe: He led the Pan-Africanist Congress, whose protests against apartheid on March 21, 1960, led to the Sharpeville massacre, in which police killed 68 demonstrators. Sobukwe was jailed for three years for incitement. As his imprisonment neared its end, a special law was rushed through parliament giving the government the power to continue his detention on a year-by-year basis, without trial. He was kept on his own, seeing few visitors, on Robben Island.  
Sobukwe was allowed to receive newspapers and followed world events closely. We wrote to each other - with great difficulty, because the prison censors delayed our letters for many weeks or simply confiscated them.  
After the end of the 1967 war in the Middle East, he wrote that "vicarious Israeli heroes are individually and severally telling us what lessons are to be drawn from the conflict. Unfortunately, the lessons are merely a rationalization of prejudices.  
"I would have felt happier if Levi Eshkol didn't have a [Moshe] Dayan to put up with. As one correspondent has said, Dayan is no Churchill. I am afraid he is allowing the ululations of the vicarious heroes to go to his head.  
"And yet the touch that is needed is the toning down of the humiliation under which the Arabs smart. Somebody has said a man will forgive you, after some time, for defrauding him or even taking his wife away from him but no man will forget or forgive a humiliation. Eshkol has the personality and the ability, I think, to wash his enemies' wounds."  
Sobukwe went on: "In the American Civil War it is recorded that Grant treated Lee when he came to surrender, as though he were his superior officer. When he left the hall, Grant and his men saluted. Quite recently, in a boxing championship in Britain, the Scottish champion McGowan was forced to retire because of a badly cut eye. The defending champion, an Asian, who was defeating McGowan for the second time, went to McGowan's corner - and they say McGowan was in tears - and knelt before him. The grand gesture.  
"A further illustration. Moshoeshoe I [19th century king of the Basotho nation, today Lesotho], when attacked by the Zulus, inflicted a crushing defeat on them at Thaba Bosiu and, as they retreated, sent a large herd of cattle to 'his brothers.' The Zulus never again attacked him. He cut the English forces to ribbons in 1852, and while Cathcart, the British Commander, was in a state of bewilderment and humiliation, sued for peace!  
"I am not saying Israel should be 'magnanimous.' If I were Nasser I would want no magnanimity from the Jews. All I am saying is that it is Eshkol and not Nasser who can afford a diplomatic rebuff, it is 'adulations' that might go to Dayan's head, 'not ululations.'"  
In another letter, tensions in the Middle East caused him to write that if I had any influence with Dayan I should give him a warning. I did not know Dayan so could not pass on the message: "He'll be seeking to talk genuine peace when Arab humiliation has rendered such a prospect impossible." On the other hand, Sobukwe thought a newspaper article by Dayan's daughter, Yael, "very well balanced - with none of the arrogance that characterises her father's references to Arabs.  
"I say it once more: Nobody is going to be 'taught a lesson' by anybody. The days for that type of mentality are over: between nations and between individuals. Our own children demand that we justify our 'right' to teach them a lesson."  
Nor did he approve of Shimon Peres, then secretary-general of Rafi, whom I interviewed when he visited Johannesburg after the Six-Day War. I sent Sobukwe the text published in my newspaper, the Rand Daily Mail. Sobukwe responded: "Throughout his interview Peres says: 'We told them...' Just imagine [King] Hussein in Peres' place, with the roles reversed, saying 'We told the Jews' and taste it in your mouth."  
Sobukwe did not live to put his thinking into practice. The government held him on Robben Island for six years and continued to fear him for his commitment to freedom. He was banished to the town of Kimberley with severe restrictions on his liberty. He died there of cancer nine years later, in February 1978.  
These details are extracted from "How Can Man Die Better: The Life of Robert  Sobukwe," by Benjamin Pogrund, now reissued in paperback by Jonathan Ball Publishers, Johannesburg.

<title>A boycott by any other name ...</title>
<date>Fri Apr 13 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
In the late 19th century, changes in Ottoman law created a new class of large landholders, including the Sursuq family from Beirut, which acquired large tracts in northern Palestine. A similar situation had long existed in Ireland, where most land was controlled by absentee landlords, many of whom lived in Britain. 
The 1880s, however, initiated dynamics that led the two lands in different directions. In 1882, the first Zionist immigrants arrived in Palestine, starting a process that subsequently led to the eviction of indigenous tenant farmers, when magnates like the Sursuqs pulled the land from under their feet, selling it to the Jewish National Fund. 
In contrast, in 1880, Irish tenant farmers started a process that turned them into owner-occupiers. A former British army officer played a role in this drama, which introduced his name as a new word into many languages. 
Western Ireland was again suffering near-famine conditions. The potato crop had failed for the third successive year. Captain Charles Cunningham Boycott, agent for Lord Erne, the absentee landlord of an estate in County Mayo, refused the request of tenants for a rent reduction and, instead, in September 1880, obtained eviction notices against 11 of them for failure to pay their rent. 
Thirty years earlier, evictions had expelled huge numbers of Irish to North America. But times were changing: A nationwide tenants' rights movement, the Land League, had recently been formed, under the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell, a scion of the landlord class, whose pro-tenant sympathies were inherited from his American mother, a woman whose grandfather had been one of George Washington's bodyguards. Speaking on September 19, 1880, Parnell outlined the strategy of the league: 
"When a man takes a farm from which another has been evicted, you must shun him on the roadside when you meet him, you must shun him in the streets of the town, you must shun him at the shop-counter, you must shun him at the fair and at the market-place and even in the house of worship, by leaving him severely alone, by putting him into a sort of moral Coventry, by isolating him from the rest of his kind, as if he were a leper of old, you must show him your detestation." 
Three days later, court officials attempted to serve Boycott's eviction notices on the tenants, and the Land League policy went into effect. Within two months, Boycott's name had become a synonym for ostracism, he had left the estate, and both landlords and government had discovered the power of ordinary people. Within a year, legislation at Westminster provided government finance for tenants wishing to purchase their farms. 
For too long, Israel has been taking land from which Palestinians have been evicted, and detestation is spreading around the world. In Ireland, photos of Israeli bulldozers are placed beside those of landlords' battering rams. Even a former U.S. president has recognized hafrada ("separation" in Hebrew) as apartheid. Disgust has reached such a level that even highly conservative institutions that normally try to avoid politics are driven to express concern. 
One such body is Aosdana, the Irish state-sponsored academy of artists. Its annual general assembly on March 28 passed a resolution whose full text is: "Mindful of the August 4, 2006 call from Palestinian filmmakers, artists and cultural workers to end all cooperation with state-sponsored Israeli cultural events and institutions, Aosdana wishes to encourage Irish artists and cultural institutions to reflect deeply before engaging in any such cooperation, always bearing in mind the undeniable courage of those Israeli artists, writers and intellectuals who oppose their own government's illegal policies towards the Palestinians." 
Although on the surface, this is a mild resolution, it is a boycott call in all but name. Its significance was not lost on Dr. Zion Evrony, the Israeli ambassador in Dublin. The very same day, he issued a press release that was replete with cliches that might have worked several decades ago, when Irish people were still unaware of the horrors that Israel has inflicted on the Palestinians. 
Possibly, the alacrity of Dr. Evrony's response was due to the fact that the strength of feeling among Irish artists had been rehearsed in the Irish press. Indeed, the proposer of the motion, playwright Margaretta D'Arcy, who is Jewish, had written in The Irish Times on February 16 that, "I was reluctant to advocate a cultural boycott of Israel until I visited the country for the first time last November ... I became convinced that a cultural boycott was necessary, if only as an act of solidarity with those in Israel who seek to remove the inequality, discrimination and segregation of their society." 
Continuing, she quoted from "Land Grab," by Yehezkel Lein, published by B'Tselem - the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories: "The settlement enterprise in the occupied territories has created a system of legally sanctioned separation based on discrimination that has, perhaps, no parallel anywhere in the world since the apartheid regime in South Africa." 
Ms. D'arcy finished by saying: "My uncle went to live in the Holy Land in the 1920s to help set up the utopian dream of peace, justice and equality between Jew and Arab. It was only when I arrived there that I realized how mistaken he was. He would have done better to have stayed in the East End of London to struggle for peace, justice and equality in England." 
Parnell finished his call to action by saying that "there will be no man so full of avarice, so lost to shame, as to dare the public opinion of all right-thinking men." 
They were both right.

<title>Academic boycotts are not enough </title>
<date>Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
The academic boycott of apartheid South Africa is often cited as a model for the current boycott of Israeli academic institutions. The reality is that they could not be more different except in one aspect: Such boycotts alone are ineffective.
In South Africa, the academic boycott employed a series of international embargoes on institutions and scholars during the apartheid era. But it was backed up by economic, social and sporting sanctions aimed at isolating what had become a pariah state.  
As early as 1964, 496 British professors from some 34 universities signed a declaration protesting South African policies of exclusion and separation. Proponents of the boycott believed that scholars should not be immune from the political and social ills of apartheid.  
South African universities - government institutions reliant on state funding - were obliged to follow the law of the land and impose segregation policies along racial lines. Universities and other institutions of higher learning thus became institutions mostly for white South Africans. And as white nationalism grew during the period, numerous Afrikaans-speaking universities sprang up and gained popularity. Such institutions were intended exclusively for white Afrikaners. Students of other races and language groups were excluded or discouraged from enrolling.  
At the time, anti-apartheid cleric Desmond Tutu encouraged the sanctions, but said there should be no blanket boycott on institutions, but rather a case-by-case embargo. Tutu nevertheless felt the boycott served to remind so-called liberal universities that they were not doing enough to champion the end of segregation in institutions of higher learning.  
By 1980, the momentum of the anti-apartheid movement had grown to such an extent that the United Nations called for "academic and cultural institutions to cut links with South Africa." But there was opposition to the boycott. Opponents from within the anti-apartheid movement felt that the lack of interaction and free flow of ideas were stifling the development of the very people the boycott aimed to help.  
In reality the academic boycott was more of a symbolic gesture then a concrete strategy for ending apartheid. On the contrary, it encouraged the growth of ideas and the development of homegrown technology. Academia thrives on exchanging and debating ideas. Being cut off encouraged South African institutions to resort to more rigorous internal exchanges as well as inter- university exchanges.  
Furthermore, in some cases academics were able to maneuver around blockades. Often a third party would be used to exchange ideas and research. Many scholars simply ignored the boycott, especially in the field of science. Others imposed their own restrictions on themselves, not bothering to apply or submit work to international bodies.  
A survey conducted in 1991 by the University of Illinois found that the academic boycott of South African universities was more of "an irritation then a true obstacle to academic development." The survey concluded that aside from its significance as a symbolic gesture, the academic boycott had very little true impact in isolating South African institutions of higher education.  
It is even less likely that an academic boycott of Israel will succeed. Unlike in South Africa, where the international community, eventually including the United States, endorsed boycotting the racial policies of the apartheid state, there is less cohesion with respect to Israel.  
Universities in the U.S. have not backed their British counterparts, and Israel has not suffered widespread condemnation, in contrast to the case of South Africa. The international Jewish lobby - considerably more effective than the pro-apartheid lobby ever was - has been quick to overturn any attempt at punitive sanctions. Israel's strong historic and economic links with the United States make it practically untouchable.  
An academic boycott of Israel in isolation is never going to achieve its goal. Even the hope of a symbolic gesture of defiance is unlikely to do more than draw unwelcome comparisons with academic boycotts in Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Any academic boycott will be ineffective if it is applied in isolation: It needs to be backed up with economic and social sanctions.

<title>A dramatic shift </title>
<date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, announced last week that it is considering proposing a new state constitution calling for a supranational regime in all of "historic Palestine." Although its statement makes no direct reference to the issue of borders, the proposal essentially undermines the principle of the two-state solution and promotes the idea of one binational state for Jews and Palestinians. Adalah's proposal signifies a change in the organization's position, and may mark an emerging trend among Israeli Arabs.  
Last year, Adalah published its draft of a "Democratic Constitution," one of several papers issued by Israeli Arab organizations that have come to be known as the Vision Documents. Taken collectively, these statements openly challenged the Jewish character of the State of Israel while accepting the framework of the two-state solution. The Vision Documents' stated goal was to spark public discourse concerning the future of Israeli Arabs. The Jewish population in Israel, however, has remained largely indifferent to the documents, while the reaction of Jewish politicians and commentators was negative at best.  
The fact that no concrete dialogue has ensued between the two camps, however, only partially explains the dramatic shift in Adalah's position. What really alarmed the organization was the recent renewal of political talks between Israel and the Palestinians, especially as subjects for discussion have included issues relating to Israel's Arab citizens, such as the idea of swapping populated lands, and the claim by senior Israeli officials that a future Palestinian state would solve Israeli Arabs' national demands. Moreover, the Israeli demand of the Palestine Liberation Organization that it recognize Israel's Jewish identity has been fiercely rejected by most of the Israeli Arab leadership and, as surveys show, public too. All these developments have contributed to a collective sense of unease among Israeli Arabs, and a concern that their destiny is being negotiated without their participation.  
Whereas the Vision Documents were largely intended to engage Israel's Jewish public, the new Adalah proposal is directed primarily at two different  audiences. First, considering that in the past year, Israeli Arab organizations have become more active in expressing their views regarding the "outstanding issues" between Israel and the Palestinians (such as Jerusalem and refugees), the latest statement may be intended to constrain the PLO's ability to maneuver in the political process. In fact, Adalah's proposal contradicts the PLO's official position, which calls for negotiations with Israel on the basis of the two-state solution.  
Adalah may be signaling to Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, therefore, not only that Israeli Arabs may not necessarily accept an agreement signed by Israel and the PLO, but also that a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders will not fulfill their demands for self-determination, and that the political fight will continue.  
Adalah's second message is geared toward the international community, which has become more critical in recent years of Israel's policies vis-a-vis its Arab citizens; it is that only a one-state solution, based on "one man, one vote," is moral, just and achievable. Furthermore, because leading international figures consider Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad to be the Palestinian "dream team" for negotiations, if they fail, it is  implied, this may raise doubts regarding the very viability of the two-state solution.  
In recent years, Israeli Arab organizations have frequently compared Israel's policies toward its Arab minority and the Palestinians to the South-African apartheid regime. Adalah's promotion of a one-state solution takes this comparison a step further: The organization publicly aligns its constitution with the African National Congress' 1956 Freedom Charter, which demanded the transformation of South Africa into a state for all its citizens, and was incorporated into the South African constitution in 1996.  
Therefore, Adalah's statement may confront Israel with a political conundrum: If it reaches an agreement with the PLO, the deal's legitimacy would be questioned by Israeli Arabs challenging the PLO's status. However, if negotiations fail, the until-now accepted framework of a political process based on a two-state solution will be challenged, bringing the one-state alternative to the fore.  
Israel needs to formulate guiding principles regarding its relations with Israeli Arabs and the future Palestinian state. First and foremost, Israel should consider the spectrum of diplomatic, legal and political relations it wishes to allow between these parties. Israeli positions in the current round of negotiations would set the degree of these associations, on matters such as dual passports, the right to vote and to be elected to the Palestinian parliament and the issue of family reunification.  
On the domestic level, Israeli Arabs' demands of the state have both legal- nationalist and socioeconomic dimensions. The legal-nationalist aspect, as it appears in the Vision Documents, threatens the Jewish character of Israel and therefore is too high a price to meet. Nonetheless, this does not relieve Israel of the need to seek a dialogue with the Israeli Arab leadership in order to find a formula enabling the integration of the Israeli Arab and Jewish communities. Finally, Israel should strive to bridge the socioeconomic gaps between the communities, in order to meet the socioeconomic demands of Israeli Arabs and quell at least some of the causes of unrest among them.

<title>A halt, not  a suspension </title>
<date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
When Ehud Olmert warns that the world could impose a "South African solution" on Israel if two states are not created, side by side, he is tacitly admitting that expansion of the settlements is making Israel look increasingly like an apartheid regime.  
The agreement to withdraw, or to make "painful concessions," as it is sanctimoniously called, is therefore less painful than any other alternative. The only question is whether another Yitzhak Rabin can be found, who is capable of really halting, not just suspending, the construction of settlements, to leave the Palestinians some territory in which to establish Palestine.  
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit declared that the Arab states will respond favorably if Israel suspends construction in the settlements. This shows the extent to which the continued building damages Israel's relations with its near and distant neighbors. Israelis have become used to accepting lies about "natural growth" in the settlements. They never question why settlers could not build high-rise apartments, but must spread widely across the land. And, of course, settlers' children could never move to Netanya or Mitzpeh Ramon, so for every rise in the population they need to grab more territory.  
This brings to mind Ariel Sharon's statement to Bush at the 2003 Aqaba summit: "What do you expect me to do - to ask the settlers' wives to have abortions?" As though there were no housing options for those children but in the West Bank.  
As long as the settlement blocs that Israel intends to annex have not been anchored in an agreement, as long as the route of the separation fence has not become an agreed border, as long as there is a will for genuine negotiations, as opposed to unilateral withdrawal, Ehud Olmert's government must act like Rabin's government in the Oslo period.  
The state must compensate private contractors who bought land for new neighborhoods, as it did in 1992-1995, to enable revoking contracts even on active building sites. "Settlement blocs" is an empty term until their size is determined by agreement with the Palestinians. Every expansion, every new neighborhood, every outpost left standing generates more access roads, more public infrastructure, more kindergartens. It adds up to robbing more and more land from what little is left on which to build a Palestinian state. It is settlements that prevent Israel from defining a border with the Palestinians, and this is the central issue it deliberately evades. The same goes for Jerusalem, as more and more construction continues to march eastward.  
Some 10,000 babies are born in the settlements every year. Israel has no moral or other obligation to make sure they have housing in the West Bank. In April 2004 the government promised the Americans that there would be no more construction "beyond the outside line" of each settlement. That outside line has never been set. Annapolis will not lead Israel to any solution with the Palestinians unless Israel stops cheating and learns to restrain its expansion eastward.

<title>A lesson for  the doomsayers </title>
<date>Thu Mar 29 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
The historic meeting this week between Ian Paisley and Gerry Adams in Belfast, was a slap in the face to all the doomsayers, professional skeptics, perpetual pessimists and people who believe that what was is what will always be. 
Here was the 80-year-old minister, as if from a distant era - the preacher who became a national leader - sitting comfortably with his sworn enemy, the Irish Republican Army leader, whom he once called "Satan," "the embodiment of evil" and "mass murderer." The pair sat in one of the halls of Stormont Castle, a symbol of absolute Protestant rule - a rule which Paisley vowed never to surrender. The man who preached in the streets and churches for 50 years, "if you compromise, God will curse you," "surrender is worse than death," "traitors and bridges are all the same - they both go to the other side," announced power-sharing with those who seek to eradicate Northern Ireland as a political entity and annex it to the Republic of Ireland.  
It's no wonder that surprised onlookers compared that meeting to others that shook the world: Nixon and Mao in 1972, Mandela and de Klerk in 1990 and Rabin and Arafat in 1993.  
Like those meetings, this meeting too holds great promise; fulfilling that promise though will require great effort. Like those other meetings, it also hides paradoxes: The event symbolizing a historic peace deal could only occur because, since the beginning of the peace process a decade ago, both the Catholic and Protestant communities have radicalized their political views and opted for less compromising parties.  
Paisley, who excelled at expressing Protestant fears of loss of their standing and anger at their representatives' weakness, found himself at the head of the largest party; this automatically made him the lone candidate for prime minister. Adams, whose party defeated more moderate Catholic parties, agreed to all of Paisley's conditions: primarily, full support of Northern Ireland's law enforcement. If Adams hadn't agreed to all that, he would have been accused of torpedoing the establishment of the power-sharing government and undermining the accomplishments of the truce, which had been good for the Catholics.  
Citizens of Northern Ireland watched the historic meeting from their mono-ethnic enclaves. The segregation lines - known as peace lines - have in Belfast increased since the peace process began and segregation has expanded so greatly, it is now known as "voluntary apartheid."  
The contradictions between the micro-ethnic positions, which cause introversion, and the macro-national openness can possibly be attributed to the complete change in British-Irish relations and the prosperity of the common market. The importance of the border between Northern Ireland and its south has decreased, while in contrast the importance of the internal, community segregation lines, has sharpened.  
The need to be differentiated from the "other" - once reliant on loyalty to the British crown, as opposed to loyalty to the Irish republic - is expressed differently today, as long as there is rational justification for the primeval need for the sense of "otherness."  
The two communities' power-sharing accords are based on the agreement that any change in Northern Ireland's sovereignty will be democratic, so as long as there is a Protestant majority, there will be no change. This raises the Northern Ireland version of "demographic danger," in all its severity. It is true, the percentage of Protestants is dropping and a Catholic majority is visible in the not-too-distant future. But everyone hopes that when it happens, there will no longer be any significance to distinction between the northern and southern parts of the island.  
And what about the famous comparison between Northern Ireland and Israel/Palestine? Once people were furious by the very comparison. Today we say: In our dreams, and the doomsayers, this writer included, should learn a lesson.

<title>A look outside the local pond </title>
<date>Wed Jun 06 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Many Israelis returning from even a short trip overseas share this feeling: The joy of homecoming is accompanied by a sense that home is not a normal place, in the bad sense of the expression.  
The encounter with foreign countries, at least those that are not part of the Third World, is like a blow to the consciousness: In many states, people go about their daily life without Qassam or Katyusha rockets or terror attacks. There are places in the world where civilians are not exposed to news about the security situation from morning to night. There are nations that do not live with the constant moral unease deriving from the occupation of another nation. There are societies that are not surrounded by incessant violence. Public life in most developed states is not suffused with feverish preoccupation with fateful questions about their national survival.  
Israel's insane lifestyle really hits those returning home. This is not just because, as tourists, they only superficially experience daily life abroad; it is because leaving Israel frees them from the local pond for a moment. When a society stews in its own juices, it cannot observe itself with a foreigner's eyes. On the contrary, it develops self-pity and self-righteousness and projects its own version of events onto reality.  
Thus Israel sees itself as a victim of Arab violence, and all its violent acts are intended solely to defend itself, so that it can realize its right to self-determination. These include the checkpoints and the abuse of innocent, helpless Palestinians by brutal soldiers and policemen. They include preventive arrests in the territories, as well as blockades and closures that destroy the lives of women, old people and children. They include the assassinations and the separation fence, which arbitrarily expropriates the private property of poor farmers, as well as the Air Force bombardments, the demolition of houses and the uprooting of orchards. The feeling of constant threat with which Israelis live dulls their sight and their ability to distinguish between good and evil.  
The growing view of Israel among a considerable part of the international community was recently reflected in an Amnesty International report and the British initiative for an academic boycott of Israel. Granted, local actors were behind both developments; international politics were also involved; and perhaps both show traces of anti-Israeliness per se, or even anti-Semitism. But curling up like a snail in a shell of self-righteousness is not the way to deal with them. Like the boycott initiative, the Amnesty report is another alarm bell. Israel's international standing is disintegrating; its moral image has been eroded; its military actions are indefensible.  
The basic picture is simple. The world sees Israel as an occupier, and its increasingly sullied image in the conflict with the Palestinians is a result of this. But the Israeli sees himself a victim of Arab aggression. He is fighting for his life, and his enemies keep plotting to take it away. The world is against him and is trying to stop him from defending himself.  
In his sallies abroad, the Israeli tastes the intoxicating flavor of an environment that exists without a bloody conflict and learns how he is seen by others. The Israel portrayed by the decisions of the British University and College Union is, as the UCU put it, an "apartheid state, engaging in crimes against humanity in the occupied territories." The Israel reflected in the Amnesty report for 2006, which focused on the Second Lebanon War, is a state that carried out "indiscriminate, disproportionate attacks on a large scale" and left about a million cluster bombs, as well as new minefields, behind in Lebanon.  
The foreign and education ministers can raise a hue and cry about substantive inaccuracies, one-sidedness and cynicism on the part of both Amnesty and the UCU. But their main duty is to exert their influence as senior cabinet members to bring about a change in Israel's basic situation.

<title>Battle for Britain </title>
<date>Sun May 27 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Britain has become in recent years the battlefield in Israel's fight for its existence as a Jewish state.  
The number of British organizations calling for the boycott of Israel, their public campaigns, and their constant comparisons between Israel and the apartheid regime of South Africa have made the battle for British public opinion particularly significant.  
On Wednesday, representatives of the new British University and College Union (UCU) will be meeting in Bournemouth. On the agenda is another proposal to boycott Israel's academic institutions. These proposals have become as regular and as predictable as Qassam attacks on Sderot. The fact that studies at the Sapir Academic College in Sderot are not taking place because of the constant rocket fire from Gaza, even though the college is not in occupied territory and Gaza is no longer occupied, apparently does not bother British academia. The fact that Hamas, which controls the Palestinian Authority, does not recognize even pre-1967 Israel, and commits acts of terror against civilians, does not matter either. These nuances did not stop one boycott initiator from saying last week that justice in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is entirely on one side.  
In the face of boycott proposals by Britain's National Union of Journalists, by a group of British doctors and a group of architects, and in the wake of the Anglican Church's decision to divest from companies cooperating with Israel, even the Israeli left - which opposes the occupation and has been working against it for years - has no choice but to fight back. Taking off the gloves in this debate involves knowingly foregoing the kudos that British academia lavishes on all who are willing to express anti-Israel stands. The UCU has even had the termerity to proclaim that Israeli lecturers who disown the policies of the Israeli government will not be boycotted. It is British academics who should lose sleep over this McCarthyistic demand. Academic freedom means first of all an open exchange of opinions, without coercion, and not shutting people's mouths. Moreover, the British boycott is directed at Israel's academic institutions that in any case are a bastion of opposition to the occupation.  
On the 40th anniversary of the Six-Day War, British academia should look realistically at peace efforts in the Middle East: Over the past decade, Israel has elected governments that have expressed the desire of a majority of Israelis for a bilateral solution of two states for two peoples and a withdrawal from most of the settlements. The withdrawal from Gaza was to have been the first stage. The victory of Hamas, which refuses to recognize Israel, cut off the process.  
The anti-Zionist winds blowing in Europe, mainly in academia and in Britain, strengthen the position that the very birth of the Jewish state was a mistake. The European hard left regards the Law of Return as the root of all evil; however, without acknowledging the Jewish character of the State of Israel, there is not even a basis for dialogue. British academia is in fact demanding that Israel democratically cease to exist as a Zionist entity, and that it be swallowed up in the non-democratic region in order to pander to the latest trend.

<title>Boycotting the boycotters </title>
<date>Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
The Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign's (IPSC) recent success in persuading Ireland's official arts association, Aosd'na, to pass a resolution urging Irish artists to "reflect deeply" before engaging in any cooperation with state-sponsored Israeli cultural events and institutions is, without doubt, a regrettable development. Aosd'na is Ireland's most prestigious cultural body and its decision to issue what the IPSC chairman described in Haaretz (April 13) as "a boycott call in all but name" will carry weight in the Irish arts world.  
In fact, this is not the first time that the IPSC has successfully targeted Israeli culture. Last summer it launched campaigns against Israeli government sponsorship for a series of Dublin-based events, which it argued would "align the Irish cultural sector with the oppression and racism" of an "ethnocratic rogue state." While official funding remained in place for events featuring poet Amir Or and A.B. Yehoshua, despite vociferous IPSC protests, sponsorship for both a screening of Eytan Fox's "Walk on Water" and a performance by the Toy Vivo Duo was canceled by the organizers.  
However, the media coverage of these IPSC successes risks investing them with a significance they scarcely deserve. For in reality, the great majority of its boycott campaigns have resoundingly failed. For instance, its ongoing efforts to persuade Irish companies such as CRH to divest from Israel and its "National Boycott Days" of Israeli produce have failed to make any impression; Irish-Israeli trade has increased exponentially in recent years and is now worth about $700 million a year. The IPSC's attempt to orchestrate boycotts of the Ireland-Israel World Cup qualifying games in 2005 proved another toe-curling shambles: 3,000 Irish fans traveled to Ramat Gan to watch Ireland's away game, while 34,000 attended the rematch in Dublin. And last September's well-publicized academic boycott campaign quickly crashed and burned after being denounced by both the Irish government and the European Commission.  
The IPSC's general lack of success may appear unusual in a country where the great majority energetically sympathizes with the Palestinians, perceiving them as a dispossessed nation, denied their right to self-determination by Zionism's neocolonial adventure. Consequently, there has been overwhelming public support for Dublin's staunchly pro-Palestinian positions on issues from the legitimacy of Yasser Arafat to the illegality of the security fence, while its trenchant attacks on Israel's use of "reckless and disproportionate force" in Lebanon last summer were also widely applauded. Yet the IPSC remains a marginal force where one might almost expect to find a mass movement.  
Why? Because the Irish mainstream is deterred by the IPSC's extremist approach to the issues. Its recent dismissal of Meretz-Yahad as a "phony" peace party "eager to preserve a mildly adjusted version of the status quo" has raised questions about the shape of the settlement the IPSC itself advocates, while its perceived ambivalence on Palestinian terrorism is another problematical factor. Suicide bombings have been condemned, but other attacks have been categorized as "lawful resistance" or "forceful defense," while the characterization as terrorists of the killers of 13 Israeli reservists in Jenin in April 2002 was described as "robbing the word 'terrorist' of all meaning" (unsurprising, perhaps, given that the IPSC's Belfast branch was until recently chaired by a convicted IRA bomber).  
The Irish mainstream has been further alienated by the stridency of the IPSC's anti-Israel rhetoric, which often verges on demonization. While the still-commonplace equation of Zionism and Nazism is now being discouraged, the drawing of analogies between Israel and apartheid-era South Africa is present IPSC policy and its chairman is currently promoting the Hebrew term hafrada (separation) as an Israel-specific alternative to the original Afrikaans term. Meanwhile, the IPSC's most prominent national spokesman implicitly compared "people who genuinely support Israel" with "people who genuinely support pedophilia" in a recent online debate on the Aosd?na issue.  
The IPSC's tendency, despite its frequent denunciations of anti-Semitism, to inadvertently stray close to the line has been an additional cause of disquiet. For instance, while it deplored the post-Qana pinning of children's shoes to an Irish synagogue gate, it previously accused Israel of "implementing barbaric racist policies in the name of Judaism," and its official charity Christmas cards have, by juxtaposing images of Israel's security detail with traditional nativity iconography, evoked religious anti-Semitic themes.  
An IPSC Web site's campaign to expose the "Zionist propaganda machine" by effectively highlighting the Jewishness of writers and journalists also caused controversy; Gil Troy, writing in The Forward, described it as "the internet version of the Nazi yellow star." And just last month, prominent IPSC members themselves began quarrelling over the extent of anti-Semitism in the organization with one internationally renowned activist arguing that they could "no longer claim naivete" on the issue, given that their current Israeli Blood Diamond campaign "uses a Jewish stereotype [i.e. 'diamond-dealing Jews'] to promote its agenda."  
While Irish anti-Israel agitation remains in the hands of such extremists, the Aosdna resolution will prove the exception rather than the rule.

<title>Democracy is more than going to the polls </title>
<date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
"The protest wave has calmed down," some Israeli journalists said Friday of the Burmese military junta's success in driving thousands of demonstrators off the streets, using excessive violence.  
Despite the natural sympathy for the uprisers, several editors chose the word "calm," which embodies the rulers' point of view: The norm is "calm," even if it means constant government violence. The mass protest against the oppression is a disruption of order and calm.  
The word "calm" was an automatic reflection of how most Israeli Jews and their media see the constant, 40-year Israeli oppression of the Palestinians. This is the norm one thinks of when the Palestinians disrupt the calm.  
The oppression of the Palestinian people is intended to perpetuate its banishment from its land and the infringement on its rights there. But on the other side of the regime of oppression is democracy for Jews, even those who oppose the occupation.  
Generally, Jewish dissidents are not risking their life, livelihood, freedom or rights. However, the demonstration against the separation fence does involve certain risks - a few hours in detention, soldiers' fire, tear gas, or a blow from a gun. Therefore, each protester makes his or her own courageous decision to take part in the demonstration. Assisting the Palestinian olive harvest also requires courage, because it could end in an attack by the settlers (while the government's representatives, the soldiers, stand idly by). And yet there are dozens of anti-oppression activities that do not endanger the hundreds of devoted activists (mostly women) who take part in them.  
Potentially, hundreds of thousands of Jewish Israelis could have taken part in activities against the multi-faceted Israeli oppression - the apartheid laws and orders, military attacks, hidden information, economic siege, land expropriation, expanding settlements, and more. Not a hair on their head would be touched. These are people who say they support peace, with a Palestinian state beside Israel. But apparently their interpretation of participation in democracy is going to the polls once every few years, and faint protest in their living room.  
However, democracy also is displaying civic responsibility, by constantly supervising the political decisions and acts between elections, thus ensuring that democracy's essence has not been eroded. Those who say they support a two-state solution are ignoring the other facet of the democracy-for-Jews - the military regime that it imposes on the Palestinians. This regime creates faits accomplis all the time, foiling the last chance for a solution (i.e. full withdrawal with slight changes to the June 4, 1967 lines and establishing a Palestinian state).  
The Jewish citizens who enjoy their democracy are not personally harmed by its other facet. On the contrary, they gain from it - cheap land and quality housing, additional water sources, a cadre of security professionals in demand worldwide, and thriving defense industries. This is the "calm" that even self-defined peace supporters refrain from disrupting.  
In the Soviet empire and racist South Africa - like in today's Burma (Myanmar) - objecting to oppression involved a high personal price. Therefore, one could understand the objectors who chose not to act. In Israel, because it is a democracy for Jews, all those who sit idle, ignoring what is being done in their name, bear a heavy responsibility.  
Chiefs of staff, prime ministers, ministers and generals are not the only ones responsible. Anyone who theoretically objects to oppression, discrimination and expulsion, but does not actively take part in the struggle and in creating a constant popular resistance to topple the apartheid regime we have created here, is responsible.

<title>Did someone say racism? </title>
<date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
BERN - Swiss voters went to the polls last month to elect a new National Council, the country's parliament. The election's results elicited a great deal of hand-wringing among the international media. The focus of the spotlight was the Swiss People's Party, which received 29 percent of the vote, taking 62 seats in the 200-seat National Council, an increase of seven. In a parliament that has delegates from 13 different parties, such a performance constitutes a near-landslide.  
Many people, both inside and outside of Switzerland, view the People's Party as racist, even anti-Semitic. The party has indeed called for dropping a code in Swiss criminal law that prohibits racist speech. Party leaders claim that the law could be interpreted by courts in a very broad manner and therefore risks severely impairing free speech. At the same time, the party is intent on retaining a clause that prohibits public denial of the Holocaust.  
During the recent campaign, the party took a lot of heat for a poster with a cartoon depicting a white sheep kicking a black sheep off Swiss territory. Party officials insisted that no racial connotation was intended, explaining that it simply reflected a plank in their platform that calls for alien residents who commit crimes to be deported after they finish serving their sentences. The campaign appeared to tap into the Swiss people's anxiety about violent crime, in which aliens, who made up more than 20 percent of the country's population in 2005 (the highest proportion in Europe), frequently figure. Federal police statistics published by the party suggest that that same year, foreigners accounted for more than 50 percent of violent acts and murders, and 85 percent of rapes.  
The poster, insisted party leaders, was just about criminals - that is, society's black sheep. This explanation, however, did not convince the UN's Special Rapporteur on racism, Doudou Diene, of Senegal, who called on the party to drop the poster. The New York Times went further, publishing a caricature of a man attempting to transform the white cross of the Swiss flag into a swastika. Singled out for special censure was Christoph Blocher, the leader of the People's Party and Swiss minister of justice in the most recent seven-member Federal Council, the country's cabinet. Blocher has been likened to Mussolini by fellow politicians, and to Hitler by Al Jazeera.  
What did the international media fail to consider when they likened a key player in Swiss politics to the worst dictators in modern history? The People's Party has had great success with its use of the so-called public initiative, a tool of direct democracy whereby any interest group obtaining the signature of 100,000 voters can force a national referendum on a proposed law, as long as it does not violate the state constitution. The sheep campaign was part of the party's efforts to pass a law that would allow the deportation of convicted criminals.  
The party works within the system, and within the law, and despite its alleged xenophobia, it has been rewarded with good results across the Swiss Confederation, in which four different languages are spoken. Do its initiatives seem populistic? They won't become law unless a majority supports them in a national poll. Such are the workings of direct democracy.  
And Switzerland remains a democracy. Even if the People's Party, with the help of the country's peasants, won 62 seats in the National Council, this still leaves the Swiss political system very balanced, with two centrist parties of 31 seats each (the Free Democrats and the Christian Democrats), as well as two parties on the political left (the Green Party and the Social Democrats), with 20 and 43 seats, respectively. So, when The Independent, in Britain, asks: "Is Switzerland Europe's heart of darkness?" - the answer is surely no.  
Switzerland is not the first democracy that has been tarred with the brush of racism and labeled a sponsor of apartheid by the international media. Israel is used to it. And while we are on this subject, considering the comparisons to Hitler and the Third Reich, should Israel be worried about its own relations with Switzerland and its biggest legislative faction, the People's Party?  
Certainly, the party is tough on terrorism. Ulrich Schluer, a member of parliament from the party, has proposed the addition of a new protocol to the Geneva Conventions, of which Switzerland is the depositary state, with the goal of holding states legally responsible for the actions of terrorists operating from their territory. He also wants to prosecute those who distribute footage of executions of hostages to the media with the goal of terrorizing the civilian population.  
And which party came to Israel's defense during last year's conflict with Hezbollah, while the Swiss foreign ministry was condemning only Israel's actions? Yes, the People's Party, whose leader, Justice Minister Blocher, is said to have been the one who convinced the cabinet at the time to push the ministry's statements back on a more neutral track.  
That ministry is headed by Micheline Calmy-Rey, a Social Democrat, one of the People's Party's most vocal opponents. The two parties strongly disagree over the definition of the country's historic neutrality. The People's Party wants no explicit Swiss interference in other states' affairs that do not directly affect the small Alpine country, while Calmy-Rey has put a variety of international affairs on her agenda. It was she who invited Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Switzerland. The Social Democrats lost nine seats in October's vote, and now have only 43 seats in the National Council. Interestingly, one member who lost her seat was the president of the Switzerland-Israel Association, Vreni Mueller-Hemmi. The leader of Swiss Jewry's umbrella organization, Alfred Donath, hinted at the possibility that her party's voters were punishing her for her commitment to Israel.  
A member of parliament who did get reelected was Daniel Vischer, the president of the Switzerland-Palestine Association and a member of the Green Party. Vischer recently announced his intention to host a Switzerland visit by senior Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh. He is certainly walking a thin line between neutrality and appeasement.  
It pays to take a closer look at political parties before believing all the hype.  People (and the media) have a habit of  accusing each other of anti-Semitism and racism while only few seem to have the ability to deal with Israel on normal terms.

<title>Disrupting the separation policy </title>
<date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
A woman chatting idly in Ramallah on Sunday said dismissively: "The High Court of Justice's decision to move the separation fence in Bil'in proves nothing about the effectiveness of the popular Palestinian-Israeli struggle. Israel needs it to portray itself as a democracy."  
Her frustration is understandable. The lives of tens of thousands of Palestinians are disrupted by a fence whose route elsewhere is no less "disproportionate" than it was in Bil'in. After two and a half years of weekly demonstrations by Palestinians, left-wing Israelis and foreign activists - demonstrations that were brutally dispersed, with numerous protesters being injured or arrested - the fence was moved a mere 1.7 kilometers. And the same High Court that moved the fence also legitimized the Jewish neighborhood that had already been built on Bil'in's private land.  
The gap between the huge effort and the meager results is characteristic of the activities of all Israeli groups that work against the occupation. Last Friday morning, the eve of Yom Kippur, Machsom Watch activists had to spend hours making frantic telephone calls and using their connections with high-ranking officials to enable three sick people to traverse the Qalandiyah checkpoint and reach Jerusalem for urgent treatment. Media reports had promised that despite the hermetic closure, humanitarian cases would be allowed through the checkpoints, but by noon, most of those cases had given up and returned home.  
In other cases, Machsom Watch's female volunteers try to alert commanders when soldiers are harassing people passing through the checkpoints. Months of correspondence and requests, reports in Haaretz and monitoring by B'Tselem resulted in two commanders being removed from the Taysir checkpoint. This did not stop a soldier from harassing people at that checkpoint a few months later, nor did it prevent similar abusive conduct at other checkpoints. Needless to say, the checkpoint and roadblock policy continues, despite the reek of apartheid it emits.  
But those frustrated by the limited impact of Israeli anti-occupation activity are ignoring two of its salient characteristics. First, by helping to return one dunam of land to one individual, enabling farmers to complete an olive harvest without harassment and attacks by settlers, shortening the waiting time at a checkpoint or releasing a patient or a minor from detention without trial, life is made a bit less difficult for particular individuals at a given moment. This results from the activity of people who, by exploiting their immunity as Jewish Israelis, challenge the occupation bureaucracy.  
Moreover, this immediate personal relief is interwoven into a more fundamental, longer-term Israeli-Palestinian struggle against the occupation. Since the 1990s, Israel has endeavored to separate the two peoples. It has restricted opportunities to meet and get to know one another outside the master-serf framework, VIP meetings or luxurious overseas peace showcases from which the term "occupation" is completely absent.   
Because of this separation, the Palestinians know only settlers and soldiers - in other words, only those whose conduct and roles in the system justify the Palestinians' conclusion that it is impossible to reach a just agreement and peace with Israel. This separation also reinforces Israelis' racist - or at best, patronizing - attitudes toward the Palestinians.  
The anarchists, Machsom Watch, Yesh Din, Rabbis for Human Rights, the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions, Physicians for Human Rights and other activist groups - few as their members may be - disrupt the separation policy and its ills. They remind the Palestinians that there are other Israelis, so perhaps there is still hope. And in their immediate environment, they expose Israelis to facts and experiences that make it difficult for them to keep wallowing in their voluntary ignorance and disregarding the dangers that our oppressive regime poses over the Palestinians.

<title>Don't miss  this opportunity </title>
<date>Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
After seven bad years - years of terror, a diplomatic freeze, Hamas' victory in the Palestinian parliamentary elections and its takeover of Gaza - empty words about a "diplomatic horizon" and barren meetings between representatives of the parties are giving way to genuine diplomatic processes and practical plans for solving the conflict.  
At the end of the first meeting between an Israeli prime minister and a Palestinian leader ever held in the West Bank, Ehud Olmert announced that he and Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas were determined to quickly craft a "framework" that would pave the way for establishing a Palestinian state. As Haaretz reported yesterday, Olmert, basing himself on a proposal by President Shimon Peres, welcomed the key principle of the Arab peace initiative, which guarantees that negotiations over the borders of the Palestinian state will be based on the June 4, 1967, lines.  
The Peres document proposes that Israel and the Palestinians draft a document of principles, with an upfront guarantee that Israel will provide the Palestinian state with territory equal to 100 percent of the West Bank and Gaza Stirp. A prior agreement on this central issue, along with a binding timetable, would enable negotiations to be held on the details of the agreement. Such a discussion would focus, among other issues, on what compensation the Palestinians would receive for the designated settlement blocs, which must not interfere with the West Bank's territorial contiguity. The Peres outline also proposes practical and balanced solutions for the issues of Jerusalem and the refugees' return to places other than Israel's sovereign territory.  
Neither Israel nor the Zionist movement has any more important or more urgent interest than ending the occupation of the territories. There is a stable majority among the public and in the government and Knesset that prefers a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders, along with territorial exchanges, to the other solutions: a binational state, or an apartheid regime.  
Moreover, time is not on the side of pragmatic forces in the Middle East. Israel's failed war in Lebanon, and the failure of American policy in Iraq, have raised the status of Shi'ite fanatics like Hassan Nasrallah, who receive support from Iran. The combination of hasty "democratization" and an atmosphere of violence is attracting extremist terrorist elements such as Al-Qaida to the region, and strengthening rejectionist organizations in the territories. Without a substantive change in the situation in the territories, Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip is liable to turn out to be the first step in a takeover of the entire territories by Islamic fanatics.  
These enemies have created a rare common incentive for Israel, the Arab League, and the Quartet - headed by the United States - to strengthen the circle of Middle East moderates, which is aware of the importance of a peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, before Tehran completes its nuclear program. If this opportunity is missed, it is liable to be one miss too many.

<title>Heading to December</title>
<date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Haim Ramon has been going around for some time with a proposal for power sharing in Jerusalem, and the sky has not fallen. Ostensibly this is quite an amazing phenomenon; there was a time when the vice premier's idea was heard only among the radical left, somewhere between Yesh Gvul and Gush Shalom. This seems to be a turning point of historic proportions.  
The great debate over the future of the territories occupied in the Six-Day War always has been based on agreement that Jerusalem should not be divided. "The city that is compact together" has served the religious-national myth considered to be one of the foundation stones of Zionist existence. Ehud Barak broke the sacred taboo when he secretly agreed to power sharing in Jerusalem, but at the last minute lost his nerve and did not dare give the Palestinians sovereignty over the Temple Mount. A vice premier calling openly for the division of the city - this has never happened.  
And it was as if he had not spoken. No one quit the cabinet, the coalition did not even crack, no one went out to demonstrate, nary a bumper sticker was printed. That phenomenon requires an explanation.  
Israeli rule in East Jerusalem is visible mainly in a wave of construction for Jews, not in the granting of equal rights to the Arab inhabitants, not in providing equal services to the two parts of the city. Former mayor Ehud Olmert initiated the physical division of the city using a giant concrete wall that leaves some 50,000 Arabs on the other side.  
Ramon is quite the cynic. But in the saga of Israelis' attitude on Jerusalem, he deserves at least a footnote: It is not important what political calculation he is making - speaking as vice premier he legitimizes the fact that recognition of the fiction called "the unification of Jerusalem" is not worth it and should disappear into the history books, just like apartheid in South Africa, the bloody conflict in Ireland and the Berlin Wall.  
The indifference that greeted Ramon's proposal may stem from the fact that in the 30 years he has been in politics, he has not attained the reputation of a statesman leaving his stamp on Jewish history. He will not be the one to determine Jerusalem's future. Of course, Ramon could be doing for Olmert what Olmert did for Ariel Sharon when he spoke about the withdrawal from Gaza as if it were his idea. Either way, how nice it would be if it were possible to know for certain that the Israeli public had learned to relate to East Jerusalem as it related to the settlements in the Gaza Strip.  
Unfortunately, the vice premier's proposal most likely passed without a scandal because most Israelis do not believe the Olmert government can make history. Summer passed, then the holidays, and Ramon spoke. So what. There may be nothing that illustrates more the public's disengagement from the government than the apathy with which his proposal was greeted.  
This is also the case regarding the apathy surrounding the talks with Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas. Ahead of the 60th anniversary of the United Nations Partition Plan they are theoretically working on the end of the conflict; this is a great thing. But the president of the Palestinians appears to be only a courteous collaborator. Everyone knows that the agreement must be made with Hamas in Gaza. The current move seems like a false display by three lame ducks: George W. Bush, Abbas and Olmert.  
Olmert needs the November summit because after November comes December. According to a report not officially confirmed, the Winograd Committee has overcome all legal obstacles and is getting ready to publish its report in December. Real life will begin again, and we will recall what a wonderful summer we had.

<title>Holding on tight  to the frequencies </title>
<date>Thu May 31 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
The air is one escape route from the roadblocks and the separation regime that Israel imposes on the Palestinians. But Israel catches up with them even in the air. Israel does not allocate cellular frequencies to the Palestinians that answer their modern technological, economic, social and personal needs. More precisely, Israel refuses to coordinate with the Palestinians so they can use the cellcom frequencies they should have according to the International Telecommunications Union.  
The Communications Ministry claims there is no coordination because we are not speaking to the Hamas government. A convenient excuse, but flawed, because even before the Hamas government arose, Palestinian requests to coordinate additional frequencies went unanswered. The Palestinian cellphone company Jawwal received the frequencies it should have had only in 1999, two years after it was founded. In March this year, Jawwal got a competitor: Al-Wataniya. The Kuwaiti company Wataniya International won the Palestinian Authority tender at the end of 2006. Ownership is to be shared between the international company, the Palestinian Investment Fund (PIF) and the public. A professional British management team was appointed, 500 jobs were promised, but no frequencies were allocated.  
The importance of the air is reflected in the following data: Jawwal has about 800,000 subscribers, about 60 percent of the Palestinian cellphone market. Economists estimate that Israeli companies have about a 40-percent share of the market. The approximately 4 million Palestinians have more than 1.3 million cellphones. Some people have two - a Palestinian one and an Israeli one. The Palestinians come in third in the Arab world in the number of people connected to the fast data transmission system ADSL. They are also frequent users of video-conferencing services at their parliament - the Palestinian Legislative Council - at government ministries and at private businesses.  
That is how they overcome the severing of Gaza from the West Bank and the roadblocks between Jenin and Ramallah. Families who live a few dozen kilometers apart and who have not seen each other for five years or more have learned how to make do with phones, Skype, and e-mails. No wonder Paltel (the Palestinian telecoms company, of which Jawwal is a subsidiary) is the most profitable Palestinian firm.  
Dozens of requests for operating permits for Internet and information technology companies lie on the desk of the deputy Palestinian communications minister, Suleiman Zuhairi, who has been working at the ministry since its establishment in 1994. He cannot approve them because of the lack of frequencies.  
The geopolitical reality of the multiplied "borders" between the Palestinian enclaves, on the one hand, and area C (of full Israeli control) and the settlements - which comprise 60 percent of the West Bank - requires maximum coordination between Israel and the PA. As long as Israel does not agree to coordinate the distribution and use of frequencies, it will be impossible to install proper equipment in C areas. That is the reason that even the development of landline infrastructure is limited. No private company will risk installing equipment in C areas lest the Civil Administration's supervisors and the Israel Defense Forces bulldozers pounce on it and destroy it.  
Although the Israeli Communications Ministry denies any connection with this matter, the non-allocation of frequencies to Palestinians serves the Israeli companies that compete with Jawwal on terms favorable to them. (They do not pay taxes to the PA, although the cellular phones are being used in the Palestinian territories.)  
The non-allocation of frequencies is another front in the economic war Israel is waging against the Palestinians. It means a direct loss of income, of jobs, and the blocking of the desire to develop economic niches, which by making use of the air, could overcome the earthen roadblocks and apartheid roads.

<title>Implement which law? </title>
<date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Amid cabinet members' expressions of shock in response to a female settler seen abusing a Hebron family came this comment by Ephraim Sneh: "The laws of the state are not being implemented in the city with due haste, particularly regarding Israeli citizens." The deputy defense minister's words were meant as criticism of how the security forces impose law and order in Hebron, but they contained the idea that the problem lies not in the "laws of the state," but only in their "implementation."  
To which laws and which state was the deputy minister referring? After all, Hebron has not been annexed to Israel, and ostensibly is subject to military rule. But in the 40th year of the occupation, a deputy minister can disregard such legal nuances and refer to Hebron as if it were annexed territory - just like any Israeli community, Israeli vehicle or Jew in the territories can be referred to as Israel's.  
The education minister's directive to restore the Green Line to textbook maps stirred much response, showing that many of those who support the move believe there is an essential difference between the two sides of the Green Line: With the exception of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, Israel did not impose its laws on the territories on the other side.  
Nothing could be more mistaken. The difference is solely in how the annexation is accomplished. Unlike the declared, comprehensive annexations of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, where the principle was set first and applied later, here the opposite method has been taken: annexation in a piecemeal, selective fashion until, after a few decades, the sum of the parts amount to full annexation despite the facade of "non-imposition of the law."  
This fiction is convenient for all concerned. The left can keep on deluding itself that the Green Line marks open possibilities, and that rule in the territories is "military" and therefore temporary. The right can emphatically insist upon a "declarative implementation" of the law and meanwhile enjoy selective annexation, which applies only to Jews - wherein lies its cleverness.  
The annexation for Jews alone has created a dual system under which rule of law is determined based on an individual's or a community's national identity. The "local" population is subject to only the original law, as amended in thousands of military injunctions. The right to choose is reserved for Jews. When it's convenient, they are Israeli citizens in every way. When it's less convenient, like when it comes to matters of higher education and especially infrastructure planning, they are subject to the local law. The latter lags behind the Israeli law, and therefore allows for manipulations.  
The confrontation between the female settler and the Palestinian woman from Hebron was a clash between two parallel worlds: The Jewish woman possesses all the rights of a citizen of a free country, who is entitled to the protection of its security forces. On the other side is a woman from an occupied people, who is also entitled to protection. However, the army of the occupation forgot long ago that under international law, its role is to protect the "protected population." The army has become the settlers' militia and views the local people as hostile elements.  
It's easy to condemn the vulgarity of the settler from Hebron, and it's easy to dismiss the Jewish enclave there as a gang of violent thugs. But they are only weeds that sprout from the rotten ground of the cruel regime that prevails beyond the Green Line. It's a regime based on ethnic discrimination and separation, double standards and an absence of the rule of law.  
Just which law does the deputy minister wish to see applied with "all due haste"? That of the settler woman or of the Palestinian woman? In a place where laws differ and discriminate based on national and personal identities, no law prevails. What do we expect of soldiers and police officers? Not to be influenced by orders that instruct them to act in a discriminatory and selective fashion?  
The outrage over the woman's crude tirade is just a distraction from the reality that prevails beyond the Green Line, where life is ostensibly normal. It won't be long before it's the liberals who are seeking to have the Green Line erased from the maps, once it has been permanently transformed from a symbol of the aspiration for peace to a line delineating the realms of apartheid.

<title>Is Bishara the 'Palestinian Herzl'? </title>
<date>Mon Apr 16 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
The recent affair concerning the criminal investigation of MK Azmi Bishara, the Israeli Arab Balad party chairman who has left the country, has spawned a multitude of journalistic reports and commentaries. Palestinian political commentator Hassan al-Batal went as far as to write that the lawmaker "could have become the Palestinian Herzl," referring to the founder of Zionism.  
The Arab media as a whole have applauded him. A journalist from the Saudi daily Asharq Al-Awsat interviewed a young woman from southern Lebanon, who predicted that Bishara would one day become president of the Palestinian state. He reminded her that Bishara was a member of the Israeli Knesset, and that he belonged to the Palestinian Christian minority. She was unfazed, insisting that he was the best choice precisely because of his intimate knowledge of "Zionist fascism."  
The Nazareth-based newspaper Hadith Al-Nas ran an article predicting that Bishara would not become another Mahmoud Darwish, the Arab-Israeli poet who left Israel in the 1970s. The article did not seek to slight Bishara; it just suggested that he would not leave the country as he himself said in one of his interviews.  
The comparison to Darwish was not incidental. Darwish was born in 1942 in the village of Al-Birwah near Acre, which was demolished during Israel's War of Independence. He grew up in a nearby village and worked for the communist newspaper Al-Ittihad until he left Israel in 1971. He became a prominent activist for the Palestine Liberation Organization and has been for many years one of the Arab world's most notable poets. His work achieved renown following the 1967 Six-Day War, owing in part to an editorial by the renowned Syrian poet Nizar Kabbani in a Lebanese literary magazine.  
Kabbani addressed the "poets of the occupied lands" with an apologetic tone. While he and his colleagues wrote of sunshine and love, he wrote, they had failed to heed the plight of the Arab poets who were under the yolk of the Israeli occupation. This was how the Arab media and literary world learned of Arab artists in Israel, such as Samih al-Kassem, Emil Habibi, Tawfiq Ziad and Salem Jubran - all of them communists like Darwish.  
Darwish was beyond a doubt the first to break through the siege surrounding the relatively small and isolated Arab minority in Israel. Others followed - and not only figures from the literary world. One of them is Sheikh Ra'ad Salah, who won international support for his recent struggle against the excavations near the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem, as well as for his efforts regarding the Al-Aqsa Mosque.  
MKs Ahmed Tibi and Mohammed Barakeh are well-known figures in the Arab world, due to their frequent appearances in Arab foreign media outlets. However, keen observers might have noticed that while they have been presented as lawmakers, Bishara is considered to be a thinker, an Arab nationalist.  
These details assume special importance in light of the possibility that the Arab-Israeli minority could in the future become a key factor in the regional dispute. The map is simple enough to decipher: If Israel and the Palestinian Authority fail to reach an agreement based on a two-state solution, the only alternative would be a single-state solution. There is no other prospect.  
This single state would not be a "secular democratic nation," as the PLO advocated in the past, nor would it be a state of all its citizens, which is the cause Bishara has set out to realize. The strong Jewish majority would not allow that. The only option remaining would be an apartheid state, whose first signs - and possibly more than just that - are already visible in the West Bank and in Gaza.  
In this case, the struggle in store for the Arabs of the occupied territories would be directed to achieving equal rights and equality within the State of Israel. This would include establishing full unity between them and the Arab Israeli minority - a unity that does not exist today. If that happens, then who knows what will occur: Azmi Bishara could very well go down in history as the "Palestinian Herzl."

<title>Just an optical illusion </title>
<date>Fri Apr 27 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Although there are no official statistics, more Israelis apparently waved their national flag this past Independence Day. Perhaps this was out of a longing for a more innocent period, when the corrupt at least felt ashamed of their deeds, or perhaps the reason was that Bank Hapoalim distributed free flags. However, there was another phenomenon, unparalleled in any other nation: The Stars and Stripes were flown alongside the national flag. This is essentially a declaration that Israelis cannot celebrate their own independence day without remembering that their country's existence is wholly dependent on American backing.  
This backing has several aspects. One of them is the military and economic aid that Israel receives annually from Uncle Sam. In this regard, there will soon be a change, in five months' time. October 1 will mark the last time Israel will receive economic aid (totaling $120 million) from the United States. This will be the closing chord of the economic aid Israel has received since the mid-1980s. After October 1, Israel will receive military aid only: $2.4 billion yearly.  
The process of gradually reducing the economic assistance began in 1996, with a festive speech by then prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to both houses of the U.S. Congress. In that address, he passionately declared that Israel had emerged from its childhood and was now mature enough to stand on its own two feet and achieve economic independence. Thus, he announced, Israel was waiving the economic aid that it had received until then from America. Members of Congress, who were moved by this gesture, gave Netanyahu a standing ovation, out of respect for someone willing to give up several hundred million dollars a year.  
However, the truth is that this was not a freely given concession; it was a response to American pressure.  
Today, 11 years after that festive "concession speech" and after Israel's celebration of its 59th year of independence, has Israel achieved the economic independence that Netanyahu promised? And is it politically independent?  
There are those who argue that Israel has already achieved economic independence: For the first time in Israeli history, there was a respectable surplus in our balance of payments, with exports exceeding imports by $0.9 billion and with a large surplus ($6.8 billion) in the current account. If we also factor in a rapid growth rate of five percent for the fourth consecutive year, a negligible inflation rate, the strengthening of the shekel vis-a-vis the dollar, a lower interest rate than in the U.S., and a decrease in unemployment, it is clear why many people believe that Israel has achieved economic independence.  
However, this is just an optical illusion. It is a sort of mirage, mere virtual reality - nothing more.  
If any American president were to give a small cough and say, in a half-whisper, "hmm, I am considering my steps concerning Israel," our country's excellent economic situation would immediately turn topsy-turvy. Israel's international credit line would instantly freeze, the dollar would soar, and so would our inflation rate. Our balance of payments surplus would become a deficit and foreign investment would flee Israel many times faster than it came. After all, the world knows that without American backing, tiny Israel would quickly revert to its natural proportions.  
Therefore, it really does not matter whether or not the economic aid ends in October. What is important is that Israel continue to enjoy the political support of the most powerful nation on earth. After all, were it not for America's veto in the United Nations Security Council, economic sanctions, a la South Africa during its apartheid regime, would have been imposed on Israel long ago. Without that veto, Israel would never have been able to continue fighting the Second Lebanon War when every other country in the world wanted it stopped as soon as it began.  
Anyone who needs further evidence of the sad fact that Israel is very far from independence - either economic or political - should know that Israel recently submitted another request for an increase in American military aid. Israel is now asking for a $50 million annual increment in the military grant, so that, in another 10 years' time, it would amount to $2.9 billion.  
In the current tense relationship between a Republican administration and a Democratic Congress, where there are sharp disagreements about every conceivable topic, there is only one subject on which President George Bush and Congress see eye-to-eye: unqualified support for Israel. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Israel will soon receive that additional $50 million annually.  
And when the money arrives, Israelis will have yet another reason to lift the American flag high next Independence Day. On Israeli Independence Day, that is.

Although there are no official statistics, more Israelis apparently waved their national flag this past Independence Day. Perhaps this was out of a longing for a more innocent period, when the corrupt at least felt ashamed of their deeds, or perhaps the reason was that Bank Hapoalim distributed free flags. However, there was another phenomenon, unparalleled in any other nation: The Stars and Stripes were flown alongside the national flag. This is essentially a declaration that Israelis cannot celebrate their own independence day without remembering that their country's existence is wholly dependent on American backing.  
This backing has several aspects. One of them is the military and economic aid that Israel receives annually from Uncle Sam. In this regard, there will soon be a change, in five months' time. October 1 will mark the last time Israel will receive economic aid (totaling $120 million) from the United States. This will be the closing chord of the economic aid Israel has received since the mid-1980s. After October 1, Israel will receive military aid only: $2.4 billion yearly.  
The process of gradually reducing the economic assistance began in 1996, with a festive speech by then prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to both houses of the U.S. Congress. In that address, he passionately declared that Israel had emerged from its childhood and was now mature enough to stand on its own two feet and achieve economic independence. Thus, he announced, Israel was waiving the economic aid that it had received until then from America. Members of Congress, who were moved by this gesture, gave Netanyahu a standing ovation, out of respect for someone willing to give up several hundred million dollars a year.

Part of world literature
Regarding "The Holocaust is ours," by Israel Gutman, June 4Reading your article, I was surprised that you are using statements from Mr. Sandauer's books, especially since, after the war, he was not a particular friend of Ella Schulz (Bruno Schulz's niece and my mother).
There were quite a few people (not only Jews) who tried to help Bruno Schulz escape the Drohobycz ghetto. 
Unfortunately, however, it took him too long to make the right decision (he was provided with the documents). Would those documents have saved his life? No one can know.Contrary to Mr. Gutman's statement that "the book manuscript [Cinnamon Shops] lay in a drawer for several years" and was published only thanks to Zofia Nalkowska, the book was actually published by Roj in 1934, after his brother Izydor Schulz (my grandfather) paid for it.
Your statement that the Holocaust is yours is correct, but at the same time, as an executor to Bruno Schulz's estate, I maintain that Bruno Schulz is still mine. This fact is honored by most cultural organizations, and I am dealing with those breaking the law through my agents and lawyers.Your statement that Bruno Schulz is not a bestseller is also correct - his work is not Mrs. Rowling's "Harry Potter." But Bruno Schulz has been translated into 39 languages and is still of interest to educated people, who are researching his work and trying to find something newer and deeper in his art.
I would also like to point out that Bruno Schulz wrote in Polish because this was his mother tongue. He could also have written in German, which he knew perfectly. As to the argument to whom Bruno Schulz belongs, I say: Bruno Schulz is simply part of world literature. This is a statement that I, his grand-nephew, the only survivor of both my parents' families, strongly support.

Redirecting the British boycott momentum
I take issue with the manner in which British unions and academia are contriving a global boycott of Israel as they rightfully did of South Africa's apartheid regime in 1962. Before one can dare to compare, one must be more cognizant of the South African enactment of apartheid legislation from 1949 to 1970, which included: the prohibition of mixed marriages and mixed sexual acts; no black vote; segregated and minimal education; segregated water fountains and restrooms, public transport and hospitals; and employment discrimination. These British unions and their academia would do well to focus their boycotting energies on all the terrorist Islamic regimes that advocate the destruction of a friendly UN state: Israel and its people.
The Arabs have emphasized their rejection and hatred of Israel with wave after wave of terrorist attacks, even before 1967 and the so-called "Israeli occupation," which was intended to create a buffer zone between the surrounding powerful Arab armies and Israel.
British academia and unions should be asking: "What kind of society do we wish to support or boycott: one that uses its youth as canon fodder and weaponry to promulgate its political/religious ideology, or one that intellectually speaking is among the most advanced nations of the world, with more per capita Nobel Prizes than any other, and which uses this knowledge to advance society?"
Since the days of the Six-Day War, the West Bank and Gaza have enjoyed better conditions, including a higher standard of living, educational institutions and medical facilities, all provided by Israel. Is this a sign of apartheid? 
As the Islamist influences from anti-Zionist, anti-democratic nations wormed their way into the Palestinian populace to create a hotbed of insurgency, the lives of the Palestinians deteriorated exponentially as they fomented terror. What caused the academia and unions of Britain to become so flagrantly anti-Israel and pro-Islamist? Instead of provoking more hatred, they should go forth and teach these Islamic nihilists how to invest in their future. 
Teach them how to use the greenhouses Israel left them in Gaza instead of destroying them, to build computers instead of Qassams, to invest in biotech and not in bombs and to teach their children about science and not about hatred or how to wear explosive belts.

<title>Let the settlers stay where they are </title>
<date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
 It's taken me all these years to finally realize that the settlers were right.  
At last, it all fell into logical place - the hardships, stumbling blocks and failures of the peace process, the dismal consequences of the disengagement from Gaza, the commandment to settle all of the Land of Israel, the rabbinical prohibitions against giving back one grain of soil, the settlers' success in battling the peace process and their alienation from the government.  
The answer is simple. The settlers are right. They should stay right where they are. No matter what. Even if there is an eventual peace. Even if the land they live on is part of a Palestinian state.  
For decades, the leaders of the settlement movement have told us that they will not leave their homes for the sake of a decision of the sovereign government of the State of Israel. They vow to make any future substantial evacuation of settlers from the West Bank so gut-wrenchingly difficult as to be functionally impossible.  
It is time we took the settlers at their word. They are not out there holding out for monetary compensation. They are out there in the primacy of their faith that a Jewish presence on the land of the Hebrew Bible is a commandment and a sacrament. The settlement movement is firm in its view that no elected government of Israel has the right to uproot the Jewish residents of Judea, Samaria and the neighborhoods of Jerusalem captured in the 1967 Six Day War.  
It is true that the vast majority of settlers reject the idea of soldiers refusing military orders. But it is also true that over the Green Line, Israeli defiance of Israeli law is by no means limited to a radical settler fringe. From its inception, the governing operational principle of the settlement movement has been to take action that is either questionably legal or clearly illegal, and then to force, finesse or sleaze the way to retroactive ratification.  
The disingenuous mantra of the settler movement, "We're here because the government of Israel sent us here," is thus doubly dishonest. These people were not expelled to the West Bank, evacuated to the West Bank, banished to the West Bank, ordered to the West Bank.  
Every Jewish Israeli living beyond the Green Line is a settler by choice. Many of them went there in defiance of the government. Many went to make it impossible for the government to change the status of the land under a peace agreement with the Palestinians. Every single one of them went there knowing that there was a chance that they'd be uprooted one day under a government decision.  
They went there by choice. Not the government's choice. Their choice. Does anyone seriously think that if the government decided against their being there, they would just go ahead and move because the government sent them back?  
In fact, now that several generations of Israelis have been born on the West Bank, it could be said that Israel has no right at this point to order them back.  
Let us, then, take the settlers at their word. If settling the land captured in 1967 is of paramount importance to the Jewish people, settling the land should also take precedence over making sure that land belongs to the Jewish state.  
And while we're at it, let us take the Palestinians at theirs. If they are so concerned about the evils of apartheid, then they must accept the idea of Jews living in their midst.  
On the scale of racist evils, surely a government - like Saudi Arabia for example, or a potential Palestine - that forbids religious, ethnic or national groups from entering or living within its borders, has much to answer for.  
Under a future peace agreement, it is reasonable to expect that settlers from across the West Bank will be invited to resettle in Green Line settlement blocs to be annexed to Israel in a territorial exchange with the Palestinians.   
But who could blame settlers in outlying enclaves for refusing to budge, given the government's abysmal track record in resettling fewer than 10,000 uprooted families since the 2005 disengagement?  
Let them stay. Let them stay right where they are. Let them have the courage of their beliefs. It's a test. For the settlers and, especially, for the Palestinians.  
And if the Palestinians counter that Israel must allow an equal number of Palestinian refugees into Israel proper, say 200,000 of them, so be it.  
We made this mess in the West Bank. We'll have to be creative about how we set it right.

<title>Lieberman's cigar test </title>
<date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
While MKs from all the parties crowded into the Knesset cafeteria to watch the television broadcasts from Annapolis, Strategic Affairs Minister Avigdor Lieberman pushed aside the sign that bans smoking in the sitting room at the end of the main auditorium. It was clear he did not care a bit about the controversy over the joint declaration's content. Nor did the decision to begin accelerated talks about a final-status agreement arouse much excitement in right-wing circles, inside and outside the coalition.  
On the other hand, the decisions at Annapolis tie the Labor Party to Ehud Olmert's government and shield the cabinet ministers from the final Winograd report. Even Meretz is deliberating about how to treat a rightist who sounds like Uri Avnery.  
How will we know who is right? Those who stay at Olmert's side because they believe/hope Annapolis will end up like innumerable previous conferences and agreements, or those who stick with the government because they assume/hope that this time things will be different? Have the decision makers learned their lessons from the failed attempts to achieve an agreement, or are they leading (mistakenly or deliberately) to an apartheid state, as the prime minister put it, in the worst case, or to another round of violence, in the equally bad case? Here are three tests that can help solve the riddle.  
The test of opening positions: Before beginning talks about a final-status agreement, the government must outline its opening positions on each of the core issues. If it adopts the approach that the Palestinians must make do with the security fence as a political border, agree to Israeli sovereignty on the Temple Mount and erase the right of return entirely, we can spare the Peace Administration's budget.  
The Palestinian leadership under President Mahmoud Abbas, which has emerged from Annapolis to negotiations over a final-status agreement, is far weaker than the delegation headed by Yasser Arafat at Camp David in July 2000. Seven years of "no partner," the destruction of the central government's infrastructure, the Hamas victory and the loss of Gaza have reduced the margins of any Fatah concessions, which are narrow in any case.  
Abu Mazen (Abbas) cannot permit himself to give up one centimeter more than Arafat - the June 1967 lines, with mutual and equal border adjustments. Concerning an agreement in Jerusalem and a solution to the refugee problem, there is no point in offering the Palestinians less than what the Clinton plan offered in December 2000.  
The fabric of life test: The Annapolis guideline returns the sides to the Rabin formula: conducting the negotiations as though there were no terror and fighting terror as though there were no negotiations. However, the experience of the Oslo process teaches that there is no value to a diplomatic channel unaccompanied by an improved situation for the population under Israeli occupation. The limitations on movement, the expropriation of land for the fence and settlers, assassinations and mass arrests erode public support for the leadership and shrink the little room it has for maneuver. Dismantling outposts, a total freeze on construction in the settlements, without playing games (such as "natural increase" and "expansions"), and a complete implementation of the Sasson report on illegal outposts have always tested Israeli governments' intentions.  
The test of the team leader: Many generals sit on the General Staff who have not relinquished the philosophy of "searing the awareness" espoused by defense officials Shaul Mofaz and Moshe Ya'alon. In the planning and intelligence divisions as well as the defense minister's diplomatic-security liaison office, they are saying and writing that if the Israel Defense Forces were to leave the West Bank, we will be forced to secure the homes in Kfar Sava against rockets.  
Were it up to them, the IDF would return to Gaza. They have no empathy for the Palestinian side and they do not believe that generous gestures or even a final-status agreement will turn the Palestinian Authority's security services into a suitable substitute for IDF forces in the territories. Although the prime minister says he is not impressed by the defense officials' horror scenarios, he is considering placing a former member of the defense establishment at the head of the Peace Administration, someone who for years was among those who got used to seeing the Arabs through gunsights.  
Lieberman is not a sucker. After Annapolis, as before, he is in no hurry to leave the government. As long as he calmly smokes his cigars, his friends in the West Bank settlement Nokdim can relax.

<title>Living the lives of others </title>
<date>Mon Jun 04 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Forty years ago today was the last day the citizens of Israel were a free people in their own land. It was the last day we lived here without living other people's lives. After that day, we started paying the price for living the lives of others.  
German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck recently explored that price in his acclaimed movie "The Lives of Others" on the modus operandi of the Stasi - communist East Germany's secret police.  
The threat that hovered over Israel on June 4, 1967, pertained to its actual survival. It erased from our consciousness the knowledge that our lives here used to be different. Four decades of creeping annexation and 20 years of violent confrontation contributed to this amnesia.  
And so, our victory on the battlefield - which was meant to make our lives better and safer - is making both our lives and the lives of others miserable. The year 1966 saw an important chapter in Israel's short existence. It was also an important point in the Jewish recovery from the feeling of siege. In early December, Levi Eshkol's cabinet canceled the military rule that was practiced in Israel, based on the British Mandate's regulations.  
In doing so, the government lifted the main hurdle that prevented Israel's Arab population from leading normal lives. Six months later, the government proceeded to make the Green Line indistinct, blurring the distinction between Israel proper and the recently conquered territories.  
Subsequently, many Jews began regarding the Arabs of towns such as Baka al-Garbiyeh on the Israeli side of the Green Line much the same as the Arabs of Baka al-Sharkiyeh, which used to be on the Jordanian side. Recently healed wounds were reopened, and an incipient sense of identity began to fragment.  
The need to exert authority over the large and alien population of the territories forced the government to recreate the military rule it had just abolished, and to employ it in the territories - tactics and methods included.  
Professor Yeshayahu Leibowitz did not need 40 years to realize that this would transform Israel to a secret-police state, and the Israel Defense Forces into an "occupation army." As early as spring 1968, he warned against the occupation's effects on education, freedom of speech and thought, and on the democratic nature of the government.  
Leibowitz predicted that the corruption that is characteristic of any colonialist regime would not spare Israel. He also warned against the collapse of social structures and the corruption of man - Arab and Jew alike.  
But even the Jerusalemite prophet of apocalypse did not predict the scale of corruption and the corruption of values that the settlement enterprise generated, and the extent of the apartheid regulations that would allow and encourage the theft of lands.  
No one could have foreseen the extent to which this enterprise damaged Israel's internal cohesion, nor could anyone have predicted the degree to which it compromised Israel's standing in the eyes of the free world.  
In June 1967, tiny Jerusalem accommodated 13 foreign embassies. Following the passing in 1980 of  the Basic Law on Jerusalem the Capital of Israel, the city was orphaned of all its embassies.  
It has been suggested that the Palestinian territories expanded the security margins that "tiny" Israel had. Few recall that in the mid-1960s, several months before the war broke out, the government saw fit to reduce mandatory military service for men by two months. Very few soldiers benefited from this because the security challenges of the occupation forced the government to increase service by 14 months - putting it at three years.  
But that's not all. During the Second Lebanon War, the citizens of Israel proper, within the Green Line, paid a steep price for the deterioration of the IDF's abilities. This was a result of its employment as a police force in the territories that Israel conquered in June 1967. This involved guarding the property of Jewish land robbers.  
As the years progressed, short-sighted Israeli politicians and Jewish religious leaders transformed "the fight for home" into "the fight for other people's home."  
It is true that there were times when the other side was unwilling to discuss anything, not even the borders of June 4, 1967. But nowadays, the 22 member states of the Arab league declare that they view this border as a basis for peace - an accomplishment no one would have dreamed of 40 years ago.  
And so, Israel is missing the opportunity to transform its military victory into its biggest achievement ever. It is losing the war of independence from controlling the lives of others.

<title>Netanyahu and Meshal forever </title>
<date>Sun Mar 11 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
A great surprise: The overwhelming majority of Israelis support a one-state solution. After years in which the binational solution was anathema, it has suddenly become apparent that this is the preferred solution. You don't believe it? Look at the opinion polls. Benjamin Netanyahu is again leading them. You don't believe Netanyahu advocates this solution? Listen to his words. Once again, Netanyahu "does not find" a Palestinian partner. The conclusion: Wait and do nothing.  
Netanyahu is not alone. Judging by their inaction, the prime minister and the foreign minister are also unable to find a partner; it is furthermore doubtful whether the Labor Party will find one. There are heaps and heaps of preconditions - one time it is the democratization of the Palestinians and another time it is their recognition of Israel; one time it is a halt to terror and another time it is a revision of their covenant; one time it is "no" to Arafat, then "no" to Mahmoud Abbas (the "fledgling") and now it is "no" to the unity government.   
And the result is plain to see. One state, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, is coalescing before our very eyes. Because what are Netanyahu and his ilk offering? To sit and do nothing, which simply translates into a binational state. Most Israelis declare that they are in favor of two states? This is a hollow statement - after all, they prefer Netanyahu.  
In fact, this is the real "big bang": The political map of Israel has been upended. There is no longer right and left, no more hawks and doves. The center, the right and the margins of the left are united. From now on, one should say: Israel is divided between supporters of one state, the overwhelming majority, and supporters of two states, a negligible minority.   
Whoever does not work immediately for the formation of two states is pushing for one state. There is no other solution, no third way. Anyone who supports the settlement enterprise is a devotee of the greater Land of Israel.   
"Tibi or Bibi?" It is more correct to say: "Netanyahu and Khaled Meshal forever." Both are proponents of a one-state solution and their dispute is only over the nature of this state - one favors an apartheid state and the other an Islamic state. Only the extreme left advocates a single democratic state.  
All of the talk about the questions concerning the future of Israel is misleading. While Netanyahu is running on his favorite ticket, the danger of a holocaust emanating from Iran, a more acute question mark hovers over the declared character of Israel: Has it not already become a binational state? It will soon be divided into two equal halves, and later there will be an Arab majority. What is Israel if not a binational state? And what are 3.5 million Palestinians, who have already lived under Israeli occupation for 40 years, if not subjects of a state that has existed with the occupation for twice as many years as it has existed without it?   
No, the occupation is not temporary, nor is the current nature of the state.  
Enough empty talk about "a Jewish state." There is no such thing. The fact that the Palestinians live under unequal conditions does not make them subjects of another entity. On the contrary, the state's control of their lives is immeasurably greater than its control over its Jewish citizens.  
"What good will it do - the time that is slipping like sand between the fingers, without taking any action," Netanyahu asked in an interview with Haaretz, published on Friday, in which he was described as someone who has "shifted to the center." But of course the "moderate" Netanyahu was referring to Iran, defiantly  ignoring the really crucial hourglass. In another moment, the Palestinians will be a majority here, and then what? A minority that continues to abuse a majority? Non-citizens forever? South Africa has already taught us how this culminates.  
This grown child must now be called by its name - Netanyahu, Yisrael Beiteinu, the National Religious Party, the settlers, Kadima and all those who reject negotiation should now be called "fans of the binational state." If it becomes a just state, perhaps this is good news. But is this really what the majority wants?

Abu Mazen's struggle against the Hamas government is mainly political-legal in nature. He established an "emergency government" in the West Bank that has now become a "transition government." The name is not important. What counts is that from a legal point of view this government does not have to, and of course cannot, receive the approval of the parliament, whose work has been paralyzed. A large majority of the MPs are representatives of Hamas, and a large percentage of them (residents of the West Bank and East Jerusalem) are sitting in Israeli prisons - which is how Abu Mazen can attempt to transfer more powers to Palestine Liberation Organization institutions. These institutions are considered representative of all the members of the Palestinian nation, in all its diasporas, and therefore they are (at least formally) above the institutions of the PA, which represent only the residents of the West Bank and Gaza, and thus constitute about half the nation.  
In light of this, Abu Mazen wanted to convene the central council of the PLO this week in Ramallah, and to invite important VIPs such as Naif Hawatmeh, the founder and leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), who is considered a senior partner in the historical leadership of the Palestinian nationalist movement. By means of such political and legal maneuvers, Abu Mazen and his followers are trying to unite all the nationalist factions, that is, Fatah and the leftist movements, against Hamas.  
In spite of the fact that Abu Mazen's effort enjoys broad international and Arab support, the chances that it will succeed are slim. The reason is well known: Abu Mazen and Fatah have nothing to sell the Palestinian public. The vision of the independent state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital, gradually dissipated during the years of the Oslo process. What finally destroyed it were the continuing violence and terror, the number of settlers, which doubled (from about 100,000 in 1990 to about 200,000 in 2000), and the new Jewish neighborhoods in Jerusalem and its environs. Instead of reconciliation and coexistence, is the feeling, we got an intifada, murderous attacks, separation walls, settlement blocs and an apartheid state. The Palestinian public knows that it is impossible to turn back the clock. It was not corruption and an absence of leadership that brought down the Fatah movement, and neither are they not what is causing it to fail now - but rather the fact that the political path of Abu Mazen and his friends has reached a dead end, and cannot be resurrected.  
Where is all this leading? Any Israeli who has occasion these days to meet often with Arabs from the West Bank, or speak by phone with Gaza residents, can increasingly hear comments such as: We can't take it any more, we're sick and tired of it. And the continuation: If only the days of full Israeli occupation would return. Occasionally one could think that these words are being said out of a desire to find favor with the Israeli listener. But the truth is that they are being said out of despair. When the hope of establishing a state within the territories, with Jerusalem as its capital, is lost, one can undertake to fight Israel to the finish, as Hamas proposes, or give up and say, under these circumstances, let there be occupation. In other words, make the State of Israel take full responsibility for the territories.  
Sooner or later Hamas will fail in its war against Israel. But that does mean that there will then be a return to the days of Oslo and the two-state vision, which has withered and died since September 2000. Rather, there will be increasingly strong demands by Palestinian Arabs, who constitute almost half the inhabitants of this land, who will say: Under the present conditions we cannot establish a state of our own, and what remains for us is to demand civil rights in the country that is our homeland. They will adopt the slogans of the struggle of the Arabs who are Israeli citizens, who demand equality and the definition of Israel as a state of all its citizens. That won't happen tomorrow morning, but there doesn't seem to be any option to its happening eventually. If there aren't two states for the two nations, in the end there will be one state.

<title>Sharon's dream </title>
<date>Mon Jun 18 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>

If Ariel Sharon were able to hear the news from the Gaza Strip and West Bank, he would call his loyal aide, Dov Weissglas, and say with a big laugh: "We did it, Dubi." Sharon is in a coma, but his plan is alive and kicking. Everyone is now talking about the state of Hamastan. In his house, they called it a bantustan, after the South African protectorates designed to perpetuate apartheid.  
Just as in the Palestinian territories, blacks and colored people in South Africa were given limited autonomy in the country's least fertile areas. Those who remained outside these isolated enclaves, which were disconnected from each other, received the status of foreign workers, without civil rights. A few years ago, Italian Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema told Israeli friends that shortly before he was elected prime minister, Sharon told him that the bantustan plan was the most suitable solution to our conflict.  
The right and the settlers feared that the disengagement from the entire Gaza Strip was no more than a down payment on a withdrawal from most of the West Bank. The left and the international community similarly believed that if the evacuation of Israeli soldiers and civilians from Gaza went well, the way would be paved for a two-state solution; but there were also some who feared that Sharon did not intend merely to sever Gaza from Israel, thereby erasing 1.4 million Arabs from the demographic balance, but also to drive a wedge between Gaza and the West Bank.  
Exactly two years ago, in June 2005, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit warned Shimon Peres during a visit to Israel that if the disengagement were not accompanied by progress toward a solution in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip "would explode," in his words. The then vice premier told his guest that he agreed with every word, but took care to point out that his statements did not necessarily reflect the views of prime minister Sharon.  
Israel's violation of the Agreement on Movement and Access, which was signed by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, strengthened suspicions that Sharon was plotting to sever Gaza from the West Bank. The order that the dogs could bark, but the caravans would not move between the Palestinian Authority's two sections had already been quietly issued by the end of 2005. That was a few months before Hamas' victory in the PA parliamentary elections provided the winning excuse for sealing off Gaza. Following the political upset in the territories, the severance policy became official. Israel imposed a sweeping ban on Gaza residents entering the West Bank, which even applied to students with no record of security offenses. Even as it was protesting the Hamas government's refusal to commit itself to previous agreements, Israel was disavowing the interim agreement (Oslo II) that it signed in Washington in September 1995, under which the West Bank and Gaza constitute a "single territorial unit."  
Alongside the severance of Gaza from the West Bank, a policy now called "isolation," the Sharon-Peres government and the Olmert-Peres government that succeeded it carried out the bantustan program in the West Bank. The Jordan Valley was separated from the rest of the West Bank; the south was severed from the north; and all three areas were severed from East Jerusalem. The "two states for two peoples" plan gave way to a "five states for two peoples" plan: one contiguous state, surrounded by settlement blocs, for Israel, and four isolated enclaves for the Palestinians. This plan was implemented on the ground via the intrusive route of the separation fence, a network of roadblocks deep inside the West Bank, settlement expansion and arbitrary orders by military commanders. The cantonized map that these dictated left no chance for the road map or the "gestures" that Israel promised to PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas and the Americans.  
But the hope that Hamas' thugs and Fatah's good-for-nothings will finish the work of that well-known righteous man, Sharon, and his flunkies in the government and army is no more than a warped delusion. Eight years of rioting and terror ended in the liquidation of South Africa's bantustans and their inclusion in a unified state governed by the black majority. This dream of Palestinian protectorates - Hamastan in Gaza and the Fatahland enclaves in the West Bank - is similarly the end of any solution based on dividing the land: Israel in agreed-upon borders based on the Green Line and Palestine on the other side. If we do not quickly wake up from this dream and rescue what remains of the two-state vision, we will truly be left with a choice between the plague - an apartheid regime - and the cholera: the Jewish state's replacement with a binational state between the Jordan River and the sea. Including the Gaza Strip.

<title>The anti-Israel lobby </title>
<date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
This week saw the launching of the Independent Jewish Voices initiative by a group of prominent left-of-center Jews in the U.K. The initiative intends, according to its founding statement, to "promote the expression of alternative Jewish voices." Its sponsors believe that "individuals and groups within all communities should feel free to express their views on any issue of public concern without incurring accusations of disloyalty." The signatories wish to contend that voices critical of Israel are receiving insufficient attention in British discussions of the Middle East. The claim is a strange one.  
Do opponents of Israeli government policy in the U.K., Jewish or non-Jewish, truly feel that their arguments are not being heard? Is it really their contention that the British Jewish leadership is setting up "unwritten laws," which establish the boundaries of what may or may not be discussed? If the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the main U.K. Jewish communal body, is indeed attempting to create unwritten laws and to foster anxiety to silence opponents of Israeli policy, it is doing a remarkably poor job. The public debate on Israel in the U.K. affords willing space to the most extreme of anti-Israel positions.  
If we take, as an example, contributors to the Guardian, which published the IJV's founding statement, Jews who have successfully found the courage to resist the Board of Deputies and its anxiety-inducing unwritten laws include Daphna Baram, who wrote in a recent op-ed that Israel is an "apartheid state"; Jacqueline Rose, whose book, as her Guardian interviewer reminded us, "draws tentative analogies between Israel's treatment of Palestinians and Nazi Germany's treatment of Jews," and Ilan Pappe, the Israeli academic who recently wrote in support of a boycott of Israeli academia.  
These opinions fit comfortably into parts of the British debate, in which denial of the right of Israel to exist and allegations of conspiracy theory are accepted within the parameters of polite discussion. British-born Jew Tony Judt, for example, was able to promote his thesis advocating the dismantling of the Jewish state in the London Review of Books.  
If one expands the search for a moment to include non-Jewish opponents of Israel, it may be recalled that Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer found a home at the same title for their claim that the Jewish lobby controls U.S. foreign policy. The supposedly objective BBC Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, considers Israel exclusively to blame for Palestinian internecine violence, according to a recent leaked memo. This is not to mention those open supporters of Palestinian suicide bombings who are regular fixtures in the British Middle East debate - such as Dr. Azzam Tamimi.  
The U.K. has seen a number of public initiatives toward the delegitimization of the Jewish state in recent years. These have included the attempted lecturers' boycott in 2005, a subsequent attempt at a similar boycott by architects and the demonstrations during last summer's war in Lebanon, featuring support for a Shi'ite Islamist organization with the slogan "We are all Hezbollah now." A number of Jewish organizations openly hostile to Israeli government policy already exist - such as Jews for Justice for the Palestinians, and the Jewish Forum for Justice and Human Rights. Such is the climate of debate in the U.K. on Israel.  
In the midst of all this, the initiators of Independent Jewish Voices believe that "an oppressive and unhealthy atmosphere" has emerged, as a result of the Board of Deputies stifling anti-Israel opinions.  
The Board of Deputies represents mainstream Anglo-Jewish opinion regarding Israel. Britain's Jews, like Jewish communities throughout the world, are strongly pro-Israel. The large attendance at pro-Israel rallies held on two occasions in the last years is testament to this fact.  
It is generally held in mainstream Jewish opinion that the Jewish state is currently passing through a moment of some danger. An aggressive, Islamist regime in Tehran is spreading Holocaust denial and openly calling for the destruction of Israel. This regime is currently seeking a nuclear capacity. It is also sponsoring proxy organizations such as Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which are engaged in murderous violence against Israelis.  
A climate of opinion has emerged, in which a shocking increase in anti-Semitic violence in the U.K. in the last year receives less than the attention it deserves, because the perpetrators are mainly emerging from within Britain's Muslim communities.  
In such a situation, unsurprisingly, individuals such as the Independent Jewish Voices initiators, who ignore these realities or who are in some cases sympathetic to the perpetrators, may find themselves treated in mainstream Jewish circles with less than the exquisite courtesy, which is undoubtedly their due.  
But as we have seen, mainstream outlets in the U.K. welcoming the contributions of Jews (and non-Jews) hostile to Israel are proliferating. There are broad swathes of contemporary British opinion in which a breezy dismissal of all Israeli and Jewish concerns is very much the bon ton. There have, indeed, rarely been better days to be a Jewish opponent of Israel in Britain.

<title>The Carter trap </title>
<date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
WASHINGTON - "If you ever have any questions or advice for me, just put Jimmy Carter, Plains, Georgia on the envelope," the then-presidential candidate told audiences in the 1970s. "I open every letter myself, and read them all." That claim, of course, was completely false, as the cover story of The Atlantic Monthly, which dealt with lies told by presidents, pointed out this week.  
It is impossible to know whether Carter personally opened the letter he received last Thursday. The Carter Center sent a measured, noncommittal response to its contents, but the authors gained the attention they had sought. The press quoted from the letter and television networks discussed it. Its 14 signatories, members of the Carter Center's Board of Councilors, informed Carter that they had decided to resign - publicly and with great fanfare, albeit "with sadness" - due to publication of his book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid."  
This book has featured for weeks on the bestseller lists, and has also provoked a huge outcry. It is no small matter when a former American president accuses Israel of an "apartheid" policy in the territories, and also holds it largely responsible for the ongoing bloodshed. "Your book," wrote the resigning board members, "has confused opinion with fact, subjectivity with objectivity."  
At almost the same time, a group of Reform rabbis announced that they had decided to cancel a planned visit to the Carter Center in March. In their announcement, they urged Carter to resume working to promote "peace, not prejudice."  
Accusations have been leveled at Carter's book since the day it was published. Those well-versed in the details of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, such as the Clinton administration's peace envoy, Dennis Ross, have found in it a plethora of falsehoods, fabrications and half-truths. "Mr. Carter's presentation badly misrepresents the Middle East proposals advanced by President Bill Clinton in 2000," Ross wrote.  
The resigning board members' letter cites several other lies Carter is trying to disseminate. For instance, his assertion in the book that UN Security Council Resolution 242 states that "Israel must withdraw from territories" - to which the letter responded: "But you know the word 'must' in fact is not in the resolution." Kenneth W. Stein, who was the Carter Center's first executive director, and resigned from his position as a fellow several weeks ago because of the book, told Haaretz that it contains "intentional falsehoods" and accused Carter of "irresponsible remarks."  
These "irresponsible remarks," to use Stein's term, were the straws that broke the backs of many people who had admired Carter, even if they did not always agree with him. Two of the most prominent such remarks were Carter's claim, in the book, that "Palestinian groups" had promised to stop suicide bombings the moment Israel accepted the principles of "international law" and the "ultimate goals of the road map for peace;" and various statements that appear to allege a Jewish conspiracy aimed at silencing critics of Israel, such as a sentence that appeared in an article he wrote for the Los Angeles Times: "Book reviews in the mainstream media have been written mostly by representatives of Jewish organizations." The 14 resigning board members said in their letter that they view the former statement as "condoning violence against Israelis." The latter statement elicited a harsh letter from Abe Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, who told Carter that such statements are "dangerous stuff." Martin Peretz, editor-in-chief of the weekly The New Republic, wrote that the former president "will go down in history as a Jew hater."  
It seems that the well-publicized resignation by the Carter Center board members and the Reform rabbis' letter, both developments of the past few days, have tipped the scales against Carter and his book. After all, neither the resigners nor the boycotters can be suspected of being enemies of the peace process. They are lily-white, proven doves for whom Carter simply went too far. A clear line has been drawn here, with Carter's help: a consensus that defines the boundaries of what cannot be said about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even in the eyes of fierce critics of Israeli policy.  
Nevertheless, one problem remains: The critics, as Carter justly claims, are almost all Jews. That is the only card left in his hand, but it is a strong one, which embodies a trap from which there is no escape.  
On one hand, this problem, too, could be solved: All it needs is one well-known, well-respected, non-Jewish critic to come out publicly against Carter. If such a person does emerge, it will be possible to completely undermine the legitimacy of this miserable book. But on the other hand, what lies behind the assumption that such a critic is needed? Is this not a disturbing admission that even in America, when it comes to Israel, the word of Jews is still not, and may never be, completely sufficient?

<title>The consensus trap </title>
<date>Fri Jul 20 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
For the past 40 years, the term "consensus" has been the axis of Israeli politics. This key concept refers to national agreement on operative plans that are meant to shape the future of Israeli society. From the Six-Day War until today, however, these nationally agreed upon schemes have had one thing in common: They are nothing short of self-delusion.  
Indeed, no political program that has enjoyed the overwhelming support of the Israeli public has ever materialized. The first of these plans that won national consensus was the one in force from the Six-Day War until the mid-1980s. The three main principles were (a) there is no Palestinian people and there will never be a Palestinian state; (b) the West Bank will be divided between Israel and Jordan, and large parts of it will be annexed for defense purposes and territorial expansion; (c) the 1967 borders are Auschwitz borders and Yasser Arafat is Hitler II.  
The ruling elite did not yet understand that the world had changed: In order to get this new reality into its skull, Israel needed the military fiasco of the first war in Lebanon, which did not achieve a single one of its objectives, and the shock of the intifada at the end of the 1980s.  
In the wake of the Oslo Accords, a second consensus came into being, according to which temporary meant permanent: It was roundly agreed and accepted that there was no immediate solution to the conflict, and one could only be reached gradually, in a process stretching out over many years. The end of the process was invariably shrouded in mist, and who knew what would happen in the meantime. In this way, the need to rethink the settlement enterprise could be ignored, and the flow of money and people into the territories could continue unabated.  
Only in the days of Ehud Barak did the idea of two states for two peoples begin to take shape. However - and this was Barak's great failure - the idea was not backed up with an order to stop building the settlements. The Palestinians were also very much responsible for the collapse of this plan, imprisoned in their dream of return and hopes of wearing Israel down.  
Today, the two-state solution is the dream of most Israelis. The problem is that yet again times have changed: It is doubtful that this third consensus can be implemented in its original form anymore. It has become nothing but a smoke screen, symbolized in the flesh by the president of Israel, Shimon Peres. Peres is the ultimate Israeli politician, the one who is always at the heart of consensus, the one who is never guilty of anything, the one who understands everything - only 20 years too late.  
A Palestinian state, which will free Israel from the yoke of occupation, is a precondition for saving traditional Zionism. Those who want a country with a Jewish majority that is neither an apartheid regime nor a bi-national state where Jews will become a minority by mid-century, must realize that unless some dramatic change takes place right away, Israeli society's existential problems will never be resolved.  
The irony of history is now revealing itself: Settlement beyond the Green Line was supposed to strengthen Zionism, or as the settlers see it, save Zionism from losing its way. In practice, however, it has created a situation whose destructiveness is already visible, although the next generation is the one that will bear the brunt of it. If Israeli society resigns itself to the fact that it lacks the political power and emotional strength needed to uproot the settlements, the question it will have to ask itself is "what next?"  
If Israel does not intend to evict the Arab population in the West Bank, the only solution is to give the Palestinian Authority territories in the south in exchange for the settlements. You can't hold the stick by both ends, as they say. Considering the danger to the future of the state being caused by the settlements, this is not too steep a price.  
Moreover, if we are already dreaming dreams, as the new president would like us to, maybe he should set an example by trying to get the United States and Europe involved in a joint effort, padded by the promise of billions of euros, to persuade Egypt to become the Palestinians' savior. Maybe if the Egyptians conceded some territory between the Rafah Salient and El-Arish for the sake of a Palestinian state, it could have a dramatic effect. This plan has no consensus, but who knows? Maybe it could work.

<title>The greatest settler </title>
<date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Among the many obituary notices published by various groups after the death of Teddy Kollek, one group's notice was conspicuous in its absence: the Yesha Council of Jewish Settlements. It is a bit difficult to comprehend this ingratitude by the settlers toward the person who brought approximately 200,000 Jews to the occupied territories - perhaps more than any other person. The settlement enterprise owes a great historic debt to Kollek. Neither Rabbi Moshe Levinger nor Hanan Porat nor Aharon Domb nor Ze'ev "Zambish" Hever are responsible for settling so many Israelis beyond the Green Line as Kollek, the enlightened Viennese liberal.  
The fact that most of the eulogies for the former Jerusalem mayor left out this detail and that Yesha did not embrace the mega-settler Kollek is no coincidence. Israeli society has adopted sundry and strange codes to whitewash the settlement enterprise. The settlement of the occupied territories in Jerusalem has never been considered hitnahalut (the term used for Jewish settlement in the territories). And the gargantuan neighborhoods of the capital, which were built during Teddy's term and span extensive Palestinian territory, have never been considered a controversial issue.  
The fact that almost no one in the world recognizes this enterprise and the new borders it charts does not change a thing: In our eyes, but only in our eyes, not every settlement is the same and each settlement has its own moral code. But this is a game we play with ourselves. Every home built beyond the Green Line - in Yitzhar or Itamar in the West Bank, in Nov in the Golan, or in French Hill in Jerusalem - is built on occupied land and all construction on occupied land is in violation of international law. Occupation is occupation. Not everything is legal, even if it is anchored in Israeli law, as in the case of the Golan Heights and Jerusalem.  
The Israelis invent patents for themselves, but this sophisticated semantic laundering will not meet the legal and ethical test. The Ramot neighborhood is a settlement. There is no difference between the "neighborhood" of Pisgat Ze'ev and the "settlement" of Givat Ze'ev. This artificial distinction does not end with the Jerusalem region. In the West Bank, distinctions are also made between settlements and "illegal outposts," another virtuoso but groundless exercise in semantics with regard to an enterprise that is entirely illegal. There are also no settlements (hitnahaluyot) in the occupied Jordan Valley, but rather yishuvim, a generic word for settlements, unrelated to the 1967 borders. An ethical blemish has never been attached to the residents of these Jordan Valley settlements. Why? Because this is the way it was determined by Labor governments at the time, when they established moshavim and kibbutzim in the Jordan Valley - not "settlements."  
Does this make any difference from the perspective of international law? Certainly not. Were the moshavim in the Jordan Valley not built on the land of residents who were disinherited? Have they not crushed the surrounding residents?  
With regard to the Golan Heights, we went up another level in the word game we play with ourselves. There are no hitnahaluyot there at all. Why? Because we decided so. There are towns, kibbutzim and moshavim, just like in the Jezreel Valley. But no word game or Knesset legislation can alter the unequivocal fact that the Golan Heights is occupied Syrian land and all of its residents are settlers and that international law regards them as criminals.  
This phenomenon reached its peak in Jerusalem, which will celebrate 40 years of its "unification" this year. This act of unification was an act of occupation and the fact that a charming and charismatic figure like Kollek presided over it does not change a thing. Kollek demolished a neighborhood in the Old City and built the new neighborhoods on Palestinian land for Jews only - apartheid at its worst - and this should also be remembered in the balance of his considerable achievements.  
The Jerusalem mayor Kollek left behind is a divided and wounded city, despite and because of its enormous development, replete with explosives that will yet explode in our faces. In fact, it was never unified. Like any colonialist city, there is a dark backyard for the natives. To this day, most Israelis do not set foot in Palestinian neighborhoods and the Palestinians avoid Jewish neighborhoods. The city remains divided, despite all of the lofty words about its unification for eternity. Regarding equality, there is nothing to say of course. It is sufficient to travel to the Shuafat camp or even to Sheikh Jarrah to note the outrageous disparity between the services in the eastern and western parts of the city.   
Societal neglect, piles of garbage, no playgrounds or community centers, no sidewalk and no streetlights. Gaza in Jerusalem, all on the basis of abominable ethnic discrimination. This did not begin with Ehud Olmert nor with Uri Lupolianski. This began with the wily Kollek. A city whose rule in the Palestinian section is conducted through the strength of arms, with surprise checkpoints and hundreds of violent Border Policemen routinely patrolling the streets, and whose residents are subject to prohibitions that violate their fundamental liberties, is not a "unified" city. Teddy is responsible for this.  
The history of the occupation, which has already lasted more than twice the amount of time than the years the state existed without it, is full of "men of peace" from the "left" who are responsible for this injustice. What would the settlement enterprise be without Yigal Allon and Moshe Dayan, Golda Meir and Yisrael Galili and, of course, Shimon Peres? Kollek must now be added to them, belatedly. He brought the wide world to Jerusalem but only to its Jewish part. He loved his city very much, and built and developed it in an impressive way, but on the downtrodden back of half of its residents. Moshe Amirav wrote in his article on Thursday ("Division, where unification failed") that Kollek said to him in his waning years: "We failed to unify the city. Tell Ehud Barak that I support dividing it." Better late than never, but why did we not hear a word about this in the lofty eulogies?

<title>The High Court of Justice is in no hurry </title>
<date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Had Defense Minister Amir Peretz wanted to prove in his actions that he views racism as despicable and dangerous - as it was possible to understand from his remarks on Monday to his colleague, Minister of Strategic Affairs Avigdor Lieberman - he would have used his authority to cancel in a timely manner an instruction issued by GOC Central Command Yair Naveh that will go into effect on Friday. He has not, however, done so, and starting on January 19, 2007, Israelis and foreigners will be prohibited from taking Palestinians as passengers in their cars throughout the West Bank.  
Had Education Minister Yuli Tamir truly wanted to change patterns that have become fixed in the education system during the course of 40 years of occupation, she would have already used her exalted position to raise an uproar in the Knesset and the government against the GOC's instruction, which undermines the right of Palestinians and Israelis to develop relationships on a friendly, familial and ideological basis. She has had sufficient time for this: The instruction was signed on November 19, 2006.   
Had Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh, who is shocked, shocked, by the situation in Hebron, and has come to the conclusion that the law does not operate effectively there, been interested - he could have blocked the instruction that adds another building-block to the rule of the Jewish settlers in the West Bank: Naveh's instruction allows only Israeli employers (mainly settlers and people who live inside Israel proper) to drive their Palestinian workers. That is, it makes explicit a perception whereby the only possible natural relationship between a Palestinian and an Israeli and Jew is that of employee and employer.  
Had members of the Israeli media, who were appalled by the sight of the young Jewish settler woman cursing her Palestinian "neighbors" in Hebron, in master-like gestures, been interested in being effective as well - they would have organized in time to express their shock at Major General Naveh's instruction, which will make a criminal of every Israeli who gives a ride in the West Bank to a Palestinian friend or a family member who is not a first-degree relative. But the media as a whole, and the Journalists Association and jurists who specialize in media law, have left the fight to the human rights organizations and a few lone journalists. Had the media not forgotten the innumerable reports that it itself has published about the doings of the settlers in Hebron and the military government there - it would have concluded that the demographic separation that Naveh's new instruction imposes is the offspring of the same mode of thinking and action that has brought about ethnic cleansing in the old city of Hebron.  
Had the chorus of shock at a single filmed settler woman not been a matter of "ratings," but rather the expression of a moral stance accepted by society, the High Court of Justice would have issued an interim order to delay implementation of Naveh's instruction. But it has not issued any such interim order, even though eight human rights organizations, represented by attorney Michael Sfard, have given it the opportunity to do so. Nor did the High Court's Justice Edmond Levy feel any urgency about the matter, and he postponed the hearing on the petition until February 12.  
The Court has been in no hurry because Naveh's instruction is logical and very obvious, and the road to it has been carefully and gradually paved in recent years, in a series of orders, instructions and laws, as well as the policy of separate roads and the route of the separation barrier. Always with the approval of the High Court.  
The instruction concords with other prohibitions on movement that Israel has imposed on Palestinians of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in the very same territory where Jews have unimpeded movement, and residential, economic and trade rights.   
For years now, these prohibitions on movement have been preventing thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank from visiting family and friends in Gaza. They are responsible for thousands of sagas about people who are not permitted to live with their families in their own homes or to care for their parents on their deathbeds. They prevent students from pursuing the studies of their choice at decent institutions of learning. They keep sick people away from clinics, women about to give birth from maternity wards, children from schools and workers from their workplaces.   
These prohibitions have transformed about one-third of the area of the West Bank - the Jordan Valley - into a region that is empty of Palestinians, apart from about 50,000 whose official address, as it appears in their identity cards, is in the valley.   
The instruction under discussion complements and completes one that was issued in October 2000 - and which under the well-known excuse of security prohibited Israelis from entering Areas A in the West Bank.   
The new instruction is particularly efficient because it mainly endangers the Palestinians who may disobey it: For various legal reasons, it will be difficult to bring the Israelis to trial in a civilian court. The Palestinian "criminals," however, will be shunted in and out of military courts, be blacklisted and pursued by the Shin Bet security service, and find themselves facing prison terms of up to five years. This fact will deter Israelis from choosing to practice non-violent civil disobedience, as taught by Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr., by disobeying this flagrantly illegal command. The founders of apartheid in South Africa would have been proud.

<title>To fortify the Supreme Court </title>
<date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
"All persons are entitled to the protection of their life, body and dignity," states the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Freedom. But when the Supreme Court reviewed the government's decision to fortify the schools in Sderot and stated that the steps taken do not provide the necessary protection and that, according to the government's own decision, measures must be taken to provide protection, the justice minister viewed this as a process that will bring about a situation "in which the judicial branch embodies within itself also... the executive branch."  
According to Daniel Friedmann, the enemy of the Israeli society and the enemy of the children of Sderot is not the Qassam rockets or the government's impotence in protecting the children against them, but the Supreme Court. The same person who in the 1970s suggested passing conditional death sentences on terrorists - a proposal that would have outraged even Israel's supporters - finds it difficult to grasp the tremendous service that the Supreme Court is rendering the State of Israel, and those who act in its name, under conditions of a continuing confrontation with the Palestinians.  
There are some who believe that the only way the occupation will end is if those who make the decisions in Israel and those who implement them - the Israel Defense Forces commanders and soldiers, for example - will be reluctant to visit other countries for fear they will be subjected there to judicial procedures arising from their decisions and actions in their security posts. But anyone who is concerned about this possibility, which if realized will seriously hamper Israel's ability to act, must want Israel to have an independent Supreme Court that is not afraid to review government actions and Knesset legislation.  
Sharp criticism was leveled in this space at the Supreme Court decision to leave intact the amendment to the Citizenship Law enacted by the Knesset that prevents unification between Israeli and Palestinian families. But it must be clear to both the proponents and the opponents of the Supreme Court decision that the procedure of judicial review that Knesset legislation undergoes greatly facilitates Israel's case in rebuffing allegations that it is tainted with elements of an apartheid state.  
This is not the only reason, but it is an important one, why the government, and in particular the justice minister, need to bolster the status of the Supreme Court in the eyes of the public, the country and the world.  
The import of that status is autonomy and independence, leeway to act and an attitude of support and respect. Indeed, the government's Basic Guidelines state: "The ultimate standing of the Israeli legal system, headed by the Supreme Court, will be ensured. The Government will preserve the high standing, as well as the range of functions and authorities of the Supreme Court, and will object to any change which may harm its standing, or to the way judges are appointed in the legal system."  
It is difficult to understand what prompted the prime minister, who heads a government with these Basic Guidelines, to appoint Friedmann minister of justice.   
As a newspaper commentator, Friedmann did much to undermine the court's status in the eyes of the public, calling for its range of activity to be decreased and for a change in the way judges are chosen.  
The man who appointed Friedmann knew exactly what he would get. Was this a cynical or frivolous decision by Ehud Olmert, or perhaps made due to an extraneous interest, or did it reflect the prime minister's dissociation from his government's Basic Guidelines? We are not likely ever to know. What was disappointing at the time was the Labor Party's acceptance of the appointment.  
The decision this week by Labor's Knesset faction to veto the proposed Basic Law on the powers of the court, which Friedmann wants to enact, shows that the party has shed its apathy and understands what it is up against, and also that there is in the government a responsible element that grasps the state's interest in - and the importance of - the continued existence of the Supreme Court as it developed in Israeli democracy as an instrument to fortify and enhance that democracy - in our eyes and in the eyes of the world.

<title>Violating the norms of democracy </title>
<date>Tue Jul 31 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
People born in this country before the state was established, whether Jews or Arabs, had experienced the British colonial administration in Palestine, hardly a model of democracy. As a matter of fact, it was only the small community of "Anglo-Saxons," those that arrived in Israel from the English-speaking world, who had had experience living in a democracy and brought that tradition with them to Israel.  
So it's been "one man, one vote," whether Jew or Arab, since 1948 in Israel. Certainly not Apartheid, as is so frequently charged by Israel's enemies, and even some of its friends. After all, the fight against Apartheid in South Africa focused on that simple demand - one man, one vote - that was denied to the black population there.  
But equality in the polling booth is not the only element of democratic government. It may be the most important one, but it is not the only one. Equality of rights and obligations for all citizens is also required. And don't forget equality of opportunity. It is surprising how easy it seems to be to forget or neglect to apply these "equalities" to all of Israel's citizens.  
Let's start with universal military service - the obligation to defend our country. By all accepted standards of democratic government, that should most certainly be applied to all. As if we needed a reminder, the latest Israel Defense Forces statistics show that a very large number of ultra-Orthodox Jewish youth do not fulfill this obligation. This has been true ever since 1948, and the number seems to be growing exponentially. Now along come our Knesset members, and instead of rectifying this matter, they renew the infamous Tal Law, which legitimizes this injustice, for another five years.  
The ultra-Orthodox Jewish youth are not the only ones to benefit from this inequality. If you are an Israeli citizen of the Islamic or Christian persuasion, you also are not required to defend your country. That is unless you are a Circassian, who even though Muslim, is subject to compulsory military service. Poor Circassians!  
Last week the Knesset passed in preliminary reading a law that would require the Jewish National Fund (JNF) to allocate land that it owns only to Jews. Presumably this means that Jews who are not citizens of Israel would qualify, but Israel's Arab citizens would be barred from access to land owned by the JNF. A blatant violation of the norms of democracy.  
But wait a minute, you might say, was not the Jewish National Fund founded in 1901 so the Land of Israel could be redeemed and come under Jewish ownership? Yes, of course, but something else happened in the meantime. In May 1948, the State of Israel was established, guaranteeing equality to all its citizens. The ultimate purpose of the Zionist Congress that decided on the establishment of the JNF - the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine - has been achieved. In a democratic state one cannot condone laws that discriminate between citizens on ethnic grounds. That was certainly not part of Herzl's vision of the Jewish State.  
So what about the Law of Return? Does it not provide a special privilege - the right to immigrate to Israel - for Jews only? Yes, but that is the foundation stone of the State of Israel - to provide a haven for any Jew in the world in need of a haven; so that what happened in the years before the Holocaust and during the Holocaust would never happen again. That is the mission of the State of Israel. A most humane mission by any reckoning. In fulfillment of this mission the Holocaust survivors from Europe, the Jewish communities from the Arab world and Iran, Soviet Jewry and the Ethiopian Jews were absorbed in Israel. Maybe even some of Israel's non-Jewish citizens can identify with this mission, and those who cannot must recognize that this is the reason the State of Israel was established.  
The proposed JNF law has nothing to do with this mission. Hopefully, it will not go beyond the preliminary reading in the Knesset.

<title>Weapon of the weak </title>
<date>Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
In conflicts, boycotts are the weapons of the weak. Their chief importance lies in their ability to raise public awareness and arouse disapproval. Yet, going by the paranoid reaction to the academic boycott of Israel, it might as well have been a declaration of nuclear war. No peaceable action in recent times has provoked so much anger and hostility as this British-based boycott.  
In the wake of the British University and College Union's vote at its annual general meeting on May 30 to initiate a national debate on a boycott of Israeli academic institutions, a wave of hysteria engulfed Israel and its friends. Articles appeared, before and after the vote, denouncing the UCU resolution and its initiators, and heated correspondence is still ongoing. Threats were made against members of the boycott group by pro-Israel organizations and individuals, and campaigns were mounted to defeat the boycott. Costly one-page advertisements appeared in The Times and The Guardian, carrying the names of scores of eminent signatories opposing the boycott.  
Photographs of the boycott's "ringleaders," like those of wanted criminals, appeared on the front page of the major British Jewish weekly, The Jewish Chronicle, which also carried a distressed article by Britain's chief rabbi condemning the boycott as an anti-Semitic "witch hunt." The Daily Mail's Jewish columnist Melanie Phillips declared "the age of reason" over. The Jewish-American lawyer and fierce warrior for Israel Alan Dershowitz has teamed up with his British counterpart, Anthony Julius, to take legal action against British supporters of the boycott. While this would not be valid in British law, its aim is clearly to intimidate.  
The fuss has not abated yet, and more battles lie ahead this autumn as pressure is exerted upon the UCU to ballot its members individually, in the hope that they will reject the motion passed by the conference.  
Two major misconceptions lie at the base of this response, both deliberately fostered. The first misconception is that the boycott is aimed against individual Israeli academics, and the second, and more important, is that it is anti-Semitic.  
With regard to the first misconception, the boycott in fact calls for a ban on dealings with Israeli academic institutions, for example, for not participating in joint research, conferences or other collaborative activity. In a malicious misrepresentation of this position, opponents claim that the boycott will end the free exchange of ideas with individual Israelis and encourage discrimination against them within British academia. By suppressing "free speech," goes the argument, this would end any hope of change in Israel's policies that academics could have brought about. This is an erroneous argument, and it has galvanized opposition to the boycott in Britain .  
The charge of anti-Semitism follows closely on this. The allegation is that the real reason for the boycott is hatred of Jews, a new outbreak of an old gentile affliction. Nothing is more designed to provoke and mislead than this charge, which, its authors know, antagonizes all Jews and many non-Jews.  
In fact, of course, the imputation of anti-Semitism is a red herring, as so often is the case when Israel is criticized, and its aim, as always, is to deflect criticism. In the case of the British boycott committee, it is particularly inapt, since most of the members are Jewish. The campaign started in 2004 with a letter that two British scholars, Hilary and Steven Rose, published in The Guardian, calling for a boycott of Israeli academic and cultural institutions, in support of a similar call by Palestinian civil society organizations. These, representing a majority of Palestinian academics and other professionals, had united to form a campaign for boycotting Israel because of its repressive policies against them.  
The letter in The Guardian spearheaded a growing demand for Israel to be called to account for its policies, which was soon joined by many academics in Europe and beyond. Support was particularly strong in South Africa, which had lived through a similar boycott during the apartheid era, and was especially sympathetic to the boycott's rationale and aims. Since that time, the boycott and divestment campaign against Israel has grown, resulting in the Association of University Teachers' Union voting for a boycott against two Israeli universities at its meeting in 2005. Thanks to a vigorous pro-Israel campaign against it, the decision was overturned within a month. But the issue did not go away, and resulted in the vote for the boycott two years later by the newly formed UCU, which had absorbed the AUT.  
Academic boycotts are not new to Britain. In 1965, a boycott campaign against apartheid South Africa was initiated by 34 universities in response to a call for solidarity by the African National Congress. After a prolonged British campaign, the boycott was adopted as policy by the AUT in 1988 and remained in place until the end of apartheid.  
The academic boycott against Israel is no different. Israel's well-documented repression of Palestinian academic life and victimization of Palestinian teachers and students is a scandal to be denounced by all those who claim to care about academic freedom. Rather than rushing to Israel's defense in a situation so perverse and immoral, all efforts should be directed toward boycotting all Israeli institutions. Only when Israel is made a pariah state, as happened with South Africa, will its people understand tha they cannot trample on another people's rights without penalty.

<title>Where are Labor and Meretz? </title>
<date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
On the eve of the trip to the Annapolis summit, a penetrating debate was held at the Muqata on the question of whether Mahmoud Abbas should participate in the George W. Bush and Ehud Olmert show. At the last moment the Palestinians discovered that the Israeli prime minister had retracted his promise that the conference document would address at least one of the core issues specifically, and in a binding manner. The opponents said that they were tired of the Israelis' empty promises to dismantle roadblocks, evacuate outposts and be more generous about freeing prisoners. They warned that another fruitless peace gathering would be a disappointment that the Palestinian public would not be able to tolerate, and spoke about how Hamas would celebrate the farce in Annapolis. The argument that tipped the balance in the end was that without the conference in Maryland, there would be no donors conference in Paris. Economic distress overcame political distress.  
Olmert cited political constraints as his excuse for refusing to mention the June 4, 1967 borders in the Annapolis declaration, and for refusing to commit to a time frame for concluding the negotiations. He explained that Avigdor Lieberman had threatened to take his party Yisrael Beitenu out of the government and to bring about early elections.  
Ehud Barak could have said to Olmert something like: "With all due respect to Lieberman, I am your main coalition partner. If you are planning to miss this opportunity - we are out." Barak, as we know, did not open his mouth. In any case he does not believe in the power of Abbas and his colleagues in the Fatah leadership to achieve a final-status agreement.  
Nor did the dovish wing of the Labor leadership protest the participation of their chair in the Annapolis show. Yuli Tamir, who came to politics from Peace Now, was busy with the teachers' strike and Ami Ayalon, who came from the Ayalon-Nusseibeh peace agreement, was busy preaching in favor of a military operation in Gaza. The opposition members Yossi Beilin and Haim Oron, who experienced the pre-Annapolis contacts between Olmert and Abbas at first hand, swallowed their tongues. The Meretz leadership (with the exception of Zehava Gal-On) gave the prime minister the support of the Zionist left at a bargain price. It made do with a general promise that the core issues that had been filtered out of the summation document of the Annapolis conference would be discussed in the negotiations that are supposed to begin in its wake.  
It turns out that the Zionist left finds it easier to fulfill its mission when it is confronting leaders who are loyal to the platform of the right, than when it is confronting right-wing prime ministers who are willing to mention the word "occupation." It was easier to attack Yitzhak Shamir and Benjamin Netanyahu for building "permitted" settlements than to demand that Ariel Sharon stop destroying the Palestinian Authority and to demand that Olmert dismantle "forbidden" outposts. Why make an issue of these "petty" matters when the former Likud members were evacuating Gaza and becoming friendly with Mahmoud Abbas?  
We should not, of course, ignore the fact that Olmert had to go a long distance from his Revisionist background in order to warn that a continuation of the occupation would lead to apartheid and to the end of the Jewish state. Words said by a leader are of significance. But the Israeli peace camp should have learned from its experience in the Barak government that talk about peace, without actions of peace, can end up with an intifada. The people behind the Oslo accords in the Labor Party turned a blind eye to Barak's many mistakes when conducting relations with the Palestinians: from the preference for the Syrian channel to the defective preparations for Camp David. The Meretz ministers gave him a big break when it came to the policy of the settlements and human rights in the territories.  
Has anyone heard that Labor and Meretz are demanding that the prime minister fulfill his commitment to the Americans to evacuate outposts? Why do they believe that a prime minister who violates official promises that his government made to the U.S. president will keep his word to conduct accelerated negotiations over Jerusalem? Why can Lieberman, the representative of the right, threaten Olmert that if the negotiations on the core issues reach an advanced stage, he will be forced to part from him, while a representative of the left cannot make a similar threat, conditioning its participation on progress in the peace process?  
The ultimate excuse, the doomsday weapon, "What do you want, Bibi [Netanyahu]?" cannot serve forever as the fig leaf of the Zionist left. Even if they provide Olmert with a refuge, a failure in the negotiations with what remains of the Palestinian peace camp (and/or the results of the Winograd report) will bring Netanyahu back to power. Sooner or later.

<title>Where is the occupation? </title>
<date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
The occupied territories and the Palestinians living there are slowly becoming virtual realities, distant from the eye and the heart. Palestinian workers have disappeared from our streets. Israelis no longer enter Palestinian towns for shopping. There is a new generation on each side that does not know the other. Even the settlers no longer meet Palestinians because of the different road systems that distinguish between the two populations; one is free and mobile, the other stuck at the roadblocks.  
While the politicians argue over dividing the land between two peoples, the public is apathetic. The people feel that the division has already taken place. The disengagement from the Gaza Strip, the evacuation of Gush Katif, the construction of a separation barrier - the problem is solved to our satisfaction. The settlers are conducting a settlement policy of their own, taking over new areas, expanding settlements, anything to prevent a permanent solution. They are also satisfied with the status quo that relies on the Shin Bet security service and the Israel Defense Forces.  
The de facto separation is today more similar to political apartheid than an occupation regime because of its constancy. One side - determined by national, not geographic association - includes people who have the right to choose and the freedom to move, and a growing economy. On the other side are people closed behind the walls surrounding their community, who have no right to vote, lack freedom of movement, and have no chance to plan their future. The economic gap is only getting wider and the Palestinians are wistfully watching as Israel imports laborers from China and Romania. Fear of terrorist attacks has transformed the Palestinian laborer into an undesirable.  
There have recently been reports of a further "upgrading" of the occupation. Sixteen crossing points between the West Bank and Israel are now being controlled by civilians instead of soldiers. On the face of it, this is an act of normalization, similar to the situation at international border crossings. But in this case a country exists only on one side. In the absence of an agreed border, there is only a security border that Israel has unilaterally established. The frustrated and frightened soldiers checking every Palestinian have now been replaced by contractors hired by the Defense Ministry.  
Their job is to check people holding permits; in other words, people the civil administration, under the Shin Bet's guidance, has allowed to enter Israel. The checks are being carried out by sophisticated means, almost without human contact, in reinforced, blast-proof structures. The new method has removed a burden from IDF soldiers but has created a distancing. The contact between the soldiers and the Palestinians at the crossings, precisely because it is so traumatic, has driven  the Israelis and Palestinians to seek a political solution. The stories the soldiers brought home fueled public debate. Now the soldiers are stationed only at roadblocks in the West Bank, and there is less friction. So the discourse is also minimized.  
Can this situation continue indefinitely? The more Israelis see less of the occupation, the easier it becomes to ignore. In September, 33 Palestinians and one soldier were killed in operations against terror and Qassam rockets. Only in the next intifada, or after missiles are fired at Israel from the West Bank, will we once again be reminded of the occupation.

<title>Who really cares about this Carter guy? </title>
<date>Mon Feb 05 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Undoubtedly, the former president of the United States, Jimmy Carter, is an honest man. That is why it behooves him to transfer some of the royalties from his book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid" to Jewish organizations in the U.S. Were it not for their attacks, it is doubtful the book would have soared to the top of the bestseller list.  
The book prompted countless articles and commentaries in the American media; when a former U.S. president clashes with irate Jews, no media outlet can ignore the story. Jews are also compulsive book buyers, and a book everyone is talking about must at the very least lie on the living room coffee table. It would be excessive to describe Carter as an anti-Semite (although he was accused of being one), and his role in the peace treaty with Egypt should be recalled. But a big Zionist he is not. However, it seems it is not the content of the book that has agitated most of the Jewish organizations.  
Carter does indeed side with the Palestinians, and describes Israeli behavior in the territories in a way that does not add to the country's dignity. But the media depicts all of that daily, in harsher language. Carter's book does not reveal anything new to the average Israeli or American interested in the Middle East.  
The anti-Israel triangle 
More infuriating and painful is the fact that the book creates a sort of triangle: the denunciations and defamations of Arab and pro-Arab sources have recently been joined by powerful Jews protesting against the occupation and Israel's behavior in the territories, speaking in the name of Jewish values. And now they are joined by the former U.S. president, a symbol of liberalism, righteousness and American support for the weak and persecuted all over the world. His words are a kind of seal of approval for the denunciations of Israel by the "Do-Gooders" Israelis once considered themselves part of.  
And above all stands the title. The word "Apartheid" associates the Israeli occupation in the territories with the racist white minority government in South Africa. As Carter later acknowledged, he should have thought twice about the title. And if he didn't think, it's not hard to suspect him of envisioning the public relations value of such a provocative title.  
However, in his numerous press and electronic media appearances, and at various academic speaking engagements, Carter defended the claim that Israeli behavior is indeed a form of "apartheid." And with the same intensity, Jewish spokesmen from Abe Foxman, the head of the Anti Defamation League, to Prof. Alan Dershowitz, of Harvard University, denounced Carter's errors.  
Of particular note was the reaction by Prof. Deborah Lipstadt, who received much publicity for her court appearances against Holocaust denier David Irving, published in the Washington Post. She says Carter's primary sin is that he completely ignores the Holocaust, and the connection between it and the establishment of a Jewish state. Lipstadt wrote of Carter: "Now, facing a storm of criticism, he has relied on anti-Semitic stereotypes in defense."  
While Carter is exceptionally sensitive to Palestinian suffering, continues Lipstadt, his book "ignores a legacy of mistreatment, expulsion and murder committed against Jews. One cannot ignore the Holocaust's impact on Jewish identity and the history of the Middle East conflict. When an Ahmadinejad or Hamas threatens to destroy Israel, Jews have historical precedent to believe them. Jimmy Carter either does not understand this or considers it irrelevant.  
"His book, which dwells on the Palestinian refugee experience, makes two fleeting references to the Holocaust ... Remarkably, there is nothing listed between 1939 and 1947 ... However, this event sealed in the minds of almost all the world's people then the need for the Jewish people to have a Jewish state in their ancestral homeland. Carter never discusses the Jewish refugees who were prevented from entering Palestine before and after the war.  
"Carter's minimization of the Holocaust is compounded by his recent behavior," says Lipstadt. "Carter has repeatedly fallen back - possibly unconsciously - on traditional anti-Semitic canards. In the Los Angeles Times last month, he declared it 'political suicide' for a [U.S.] politician to advocate a 'balanced position' on the crisis. On Al Jazeera TV, he dismissed the critique of his book by declaring that 'most of the condemnations of my book came from Jewish-American organizations.' ... Perhaps unused to being criticized, Carter reflexively fell back on this kind of innuendo about Jewish control of the media and government."  
An unfortunate achievement 
The Jewish organizations and their spokesmen therefore had, ostensibly, a considerable accomplishment: Leading American public figures questioned the objectivity and credibility of the former president with regard to anything connected to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But it is hard to shake the feeling that this is a success we would be better off without: The book has become a bestseller in the U.S. IDF soldiers' actions in the territories are again in the headlines.  
The best thing from Israel's perspective would have been for the American media to ignore the book. Israel may have had to distance itself from its charges. And it is not as if the Jewish organizations did not have precedents to learn from. The case of the article by the professors John Marsheimer and Steven Walt about the power of the Israel lobby in the U.S. was already on its way to becoming a big scandal, because of claims that Jewish organizations blocked a New York auditorium from being used for a public debate on the article.  
It was an ideal combination: both proof of the influence of Jewish power (and perhaps also Jewish money), and a debate over freedom of speech versus censorship. Fortunately, the fire subsided rather quickly, and the smoke lingered in intellectual journals and within academic institutions. Perhaps in those days, there were other things that drew more public attention. Perhaps Marsheimer and Walt were not important enough. But ignoring them certainly helped to drop the subject from the agenda.  
The matters of Carter's book, and Marsheimer and Walt's article, were not the first. Before that there was Mel Gibson's film, "The Passion of Christ." That was a full-fledged rehashing of the old anti-Semitic denunciations, whereby the Sanhedrin and the Jewish establishment forced the Romans to kill Jesus. This slander was responsible for 2,000 years for church incitement and pogroms across Europe. It is reasonable to think that in the 21st century, the film would be screened in Christian fundamentalist churches, and then quickly disappear. But the noisy attacks transformed it into a huge box office success, which earned Gibson and his partners millions of dollars in profits.  
It is worthwhile learning from these cases because criticism of the Israeli occupation and anti-Semitism are both on the rise. The former spurs anti-Semitism, and the latter reinforces hostility toward Israel. In its political struggle, the State of Israel needs the support of American Jews. In their struggle against anti-Semitism, they need wiser Israeli behavior in the conflict with the Palestinians. American Jews need to remember this reciprocal relation no less than the leaders of Israel.

<title>Words instead of actions </title>
<date>Fri May 18 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Every few weeks some international body issues a report directly linking the policy of restricted movement imposed by Israel on the occupied territories and the state of economic deterioration there. The report is often accompanied by a warning that the situation cannot persist. Last week it was the turn of the World Bank to issue a cautionary report, entitled "Movement and Access Restrictions in the West Bank: Uncertainty and Inefficiency in the Palestinian Economy."  
Dozens of international researchers and economic attaches are busy researching the Palestinians' economic deterioration, and many more similar reports will yet be written, as long as the countries that finance them settle for words and do not take steps to halt the policy of social and economic destruction that Israel is imposing on the Palestinians. The newest report is comprehensive, but there is nothing new in it and it stresses what has been written and said for years: Israel is inflicting enormous damage on the Palestinian economy and on its private sector.  
In 2002, following the release of a report on the impact of Israel's closure policy, the previous World Bank representative in the occupied territories, Nigel Roberts, praised the Palestinian society's endurance and suggested that any Western society would have collapsed had it undergone an economic disaster similar to that experienced in the territories. Today, five years after that report's warnings and pleas, Palestinian society's collapse is more worrying than ever - primarily in the Gaza Strip and Nablus, which not coincidentally are the areas facing the harshest Israeli siege.  
And why should Israel take into consideration the warnings of the World Bank when they have no teeth? It is not enough to mention the apartheid roads in connection with the expansion of the settlements, or the fact that around 50 percent of West Bank territory is not accessible to Palestinians. It is not enough to count the trucks at the Karni crossing that do not enter and exit, or to calculate the small number of days when the Rafah terminal is open. It is not enough to adorn the reports with scholarly charts presenting the Palestinian territories as a perpetual disaster area.  
The United States and Europe knew very well how to punish the Palestinians when democratic, free elections gave rise to a Hamas government: with a political boycott and a freeze on financial aid earmarked for development and for encouraging independent production and rebuilding. True, the donor countries, primarily Arab nations, nearly tripled in 2006 the funds they donated to the Palestinians ($900 million, compared to $349 million in 2005), but these were provided mostly in the form of nonproductive grants to an impoverished population, as detailed in the paper prepared by economist Karim Nashashibi, a former International Monetary Fund official, for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).  
The generous donations quell some of the humanitarian fires set by Israeli policy, but at the same time they subsidize it. They encourage Israel to continue to rob the tax and customs monies that make up approximately two-thirds of the Palestinian treasury's revenues. Non-transfer of the funds, of course, creates a chain reaction of economic and social regressions in the private and public sector.  
The countries issuing the warnings continue to purchase Israeli manufactured arms and other security-related products. They host military officers who are directly responsible for the killing of hundreds of Palestinian citizens and fervently implement the siege policy. They invite Israeli ministers who are responsible for the economic and social de-development of a whole people. Their representatives also meet with ministers whose remarks and actions negate the rights of the Palestinian people with no less determination than those of Hamas ministers, who refuse to declare their recognition of Israel's right to exist. The Western countries chose to punish the occupied with very concrete means - but not the occupier, which it sees as part of their Enlightened Civilization. They thus signal to Israel that it may adhere to the same policies whose impact the reports are warning against.

<title>A danger to democracy </title>
<date>Mon Dec 08 01:59:39 IST 2008</date>
<content>
The anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations 60 years ago this week, provides a good opportunity to take stock of the state of mankind throughout the world. A report issued yesterday by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel is a disturbing reminder of this country's standing.  
The report cites a gross violation of human rights, to the point that threatens Israeli democracy. What is especially striking are the inequities suffered by Arab citizens in the areas of infrastructure, education and health, among others. Such blatant discrimination contradicts the principle of equality to which Israel is committed in its Declaration of Independence.  
The High Court of Justice recently warned that its ruling of two years ago, in which it struck down the government's plan to delineate regions of the country as "areas of national preference" in education, has yet to be upheld. This is just one example of the complete contempt with which government ministries view the principle of equality, the same contempt that in one fell swoop voided the recommendations of the Or Commission that probed the events of October 2000.  
The ACRI report also reminds us that Israel is the most inegalitarian country in the Western world, next to the United States. This is manifest primarily in income disparities, but also in citizens' ability to obtain services that have been privatized. The harm done to the weaker sectors of society is also evident in the discrimination against those who suffer from disabilities - in terms of the lack of access and the low rate of employment - in contravention of the law.  
The report encompasses many realms and problems that necessitate profound attention, such as the wholesale infringement of the right to privacy, a right that is recognized in the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty. The violation of this right is evident in, among others, the demand raised by employers to revoke the privilege of medical confidentiality, forcibly impose polygraph tests, and monitor employees' e-mail, among other things. These are violations of rights guaranteed under the Equal Opportunity in the Workplace law.  
No less outrageous are the violations of detainees' and prisoners' rights by the use of excessive force, intolerable crowding in prisons, and inferior sanitary conditions. These too are violations of directives handed down in key High Court rulings, violations that ignore official reports issued by the Public Defenders Office and the Israel Bar.  
Turning toward the issue of what is unfolding beyond the Green Line, the report notes the significant increase in settler violence against Palestinians. Only a minority that are investigated by the police result in indictments. The report states that in most instances, the police do not even launch an investigation, which harms the foundations of the rule of law. This reality contravenes the State of Israel's obligations under international law, and arouses serious concern that Israel is doing nothing to stop the entrenchment of an apartheid policy in the territories.  
This collection of data and facts enunciated in the report is worrying, and it raises hard questions regarding the future of Israel as a democratic, egalitarian society. The candidates for prime minister, and the heads of all political parties, cannot ignore the serious significance of the report, and the public must demand a response as well as a commitment to take action, all the more so because any infringement on human rights is for all intents and purposes an infringement on the rationale for the state's existence.

<title>A new constitutional revolution</title>
<date>Tue Jun 10 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann will present the cabinet committee on legislation with 33 bills today, most of them sponsored by different MKs. Toward the end of the meeting, almost as an afterthought, bill number 29 on the committee's agenda will come up for discussion. The law, proposed by MK Michael Eitan, is a veritable constitutional revolution.  
According to the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Freedom, the court has the power to rule that a law legislated by the Knesset is unconstitutional, and to declare it void. This power is what gives the Basic Laws their constitutional standing, and allows them to supersede all laws that contradict it. Now along comes the justice minister to ask the committee to approve a proposal that would remove any law pertaining to restriction of entry into Israel, or residency or naturalization, from the body of laws that can be voided by the court for contravening a Basic Law. With regard to such a law, the court would only be able to declare that it contravenes a Basic Law, but its ruling would have no practical significance, except in that it would require the Knesset to deliberate the subject within 90 days.  
One need not be an expert on Israeli politics to know that Knesset deliberations on the court's rulings will not bode well for families seeking to reunite with their non-Jewish family members. Most likely, such a discussion will lead to naught, and Israel will be left with a law passed by the Knesset and ruled unconstitutional by the court, which nonetheless remains in effect despite the court's ruling. Nor does one need to be an expert on Israeli politics to know that if there is a precedent for the practical voiding of the constitutional standing of one Basic Law - this will become the fate of all Basic Laws.  
Since the legislation of the Basic Laws, the court has conducted itself with great restraint when deliberating cases in which it was argued that regular laws contradicted them. In the few cases when the court ruled that a law was unconstitutional, the Knesset also behaved with restraint and did not rush to legislate laws meant to circumvent the rulings. This is the desired situation in a constitutionally anchored system that is based on checks and balances, and this is what MK Eitan and the justice minister wish to destroy. One can certainly imagine that the court will become less restrained in its rulings, sticking closer to theory and less to practice, if it knows that its rulings have only declaratory significance and lack real practical importance. Such a development would not be desirable for Israel.  
If the country's book of laws includes one that discriminates between different groups, and one that has been ruled unconstitutional by the court but left in place by the Knesset, this would grant significant validity to the claims being heard around the world against Israel, that it is an apartheid state. The existence of the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Freedom, of effective judicial review, and of a judiciary that is independent of politicians, seriously bolsters Israel in its argument with its critics around the world.  
Menachem Begin understood this well. When the late prime minister said that "there are judges in Jerusalem," he contributed greatly to strengthening Israel's international standing, and it is hard to believe that the Likud leadership today, Begin's successors, is turning its back on his legacy. It is also hard to believe that there is a member of the cabinet who is tirelessly working to destroy this important asset.  
The background to this debate is the government's failure in its responsibility to shape an immigration policy for Israel, opting instead for legislation that is contrary to the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Freedom. This is a mistake that undermines the democratic element in Israel's identity. This approach must also be opposed by the interior minister: From his point of view, the best option must be an initiative to formulate an immigration policy that is suitable for Israel and fitting its values.  
The justice minister and MK Eitan are rushing into the vacuum created by the government's failure. The minister is bringing to the committee a bill that Eitan proposed two years ago. It may be that the timing is tied to Friedmann's obsession about anything that has to do with the authority of the Supreme Court. Two weeks ago he was forced to shelve a memo on a Basic Law that he circulated, according to which the court would not have judicial review on legislation pertaining to entry, residency and naturalization in Israel. When it was made clear to him that he cannot legislate Basic Laws without the agreement of all coalition partners, and that even those closest to him had expressed opposition to the proposal, he pulled the memo, at least for the time being. But with Friedmann, instinct overcomes reason, and when the door is shut before him, he will try the window; thus, Eitan's two-year-old proposal is being brought back to the fore.  
This proposal needs to be rejected and shelved. There is broad agreement in Israel on the need for a constitution. The Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee has invested great effort in this. The prime minister has declared it as an important goal of his government, and the coalition agreements reflect this. What is the point of working on a constitution when even the minimal constitution that does exist is being depleted of all meaning? How is it possible that such an important constitutional revolution can be brought before the cabinet committee for legislation without any public debate taking place - even among the Knesset factions? Another question that should be asked is how is it possible that a justice minister brings for approval legislation on Basic Laws without first gaining the approval of the coalition partners, as the coalition agreement requires him to do?

<title>A thorn in the Shin Bet's side </title>
<date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
About a month ago, Dr. Mustafa Barghouti was invited to the Italian Consulate in Jerusalem to receive a citation of honor from the government of Italy. The consulate submitted requests to the Israeli authorities for 15 entry permits to Jerusalem, for Barghouti and another 14 guests - family members and friends. The consulate was informed that 14 permits were issued. Only Barghouti did not receive a permit, he relates with a laugh.  
Ever since March 2007, upon the establishment of the Palestinian unity government, the Civil Administration has not granted Barghouti - a physician by profession - entry permits to the Gaza Strip. A member of the Legislative Council for the National Initiative list that he established, Barghouti was the information minister in that short-lived unity government.   
For the past three months he has not been receiving entry permits for Jerusalem either. He estimates that he has requested entry into Jerusalem 12 or 13 times. For the most part, it was European diplomats who invited him to meetings, and it was they who submitted the request for the permit. On one occasion it was Labor MK Ophir Pines-Paz.  
The Shin Bet security service has told Haaretz in response that "Mustafa Barghouti is forbidden to enter Israel, and this is because of, among other things, his connections with terror activists and activity on behalf of a terror organization, and with no connection to his membership in the National Initiative list in the Legislative Council."  
As in thousands of other cases of individuals denied freedom of movement, the Shin Bet seems to be revealing a small glimpse while concealing the whole picture. It feels confident in firing off its standard reply because the majority in the Jewish society of Israel backs it and is convinced that the organization is guided by pure, objective and professional security considerations. It is convinced that Shin Bet officers are devoid of personal and bullying motives, and that they are either not influenced by a wink from the political echelon or that it is not possible that they have been ordered or advised to suit the political excuse to a political intention.  
In Israel, most of the public is convinced: If a person does not get a travel permit of any sort, the Shin Bet has conclusive proof that he is dangerous. So maybe it is a blunder by the Shin Bet and the Israel Defense Forces that Mustafa Barghouti moves freely back and forth to Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah and Hebron like tens of thousands of other people "prohibited for security reasons?" Because what can the layman conclude? That a person who "is active for a terror organization" must be apprehended, if only for questioning. But Barghouti has not been arrested, even when during Ramadan he tried to enter Jerusalem when Israeli authorities allowed all people over 50 to enter the city. He was delayed for three hours at the checkpoint and sent back, even though he is "active on behalf of a terrorist organization."  
The travel permits are a way to tell Palestinian public figures exactly whom the Israeli patron wants to honor. Whose politics is tolerated, whose is legitimate and whose is intolerable. With no connection to the electoral weakness of Barghouti's National Initiative, the messages that are linked with his name are clear, resonant and popular: Hamas and Fatah have to get down off their high horses, rectify the serious mistakes they have made in recent months, and get back on the path of unity to fight the occupation. Popular struggle - along the separation fence, against the Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and against the apartheid roads - is the most effective means, which involves the entire society.  
Only last Friday, Barghouti, with hundreds of Palestinian activists and a hundred Israelis, took part in a demonstration against Road 443, which is blocked to Palestinians. Barghouti is frequently interviewed by foreign journalists because of his eloquence, and he is exactly the person who will stick pins in balloons that are inflated with false optimism on the progress of the negotiations because the Palestinian and Israeli negotiating chiefs - Ahmed Qureia and Tzipi Livni - have managed to come up with procedures for convening the committee that will discuss "the core issues."  
His messages interfere with the new taming course that Israel is trying to give the Palestinian Authority's high officials. Its main lesson is how to nurture the rupture with Hamas and how to swallow the frog of the settlements. And this is what makes Barghouti a thorn in the side of the Shin Bet.

<title>Beware, appeasement </title>
<date>Thu Apr 24 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
The suicidal left has found itself a new hero: Jimmy Carter. Finally, someone is speaking the truth: Israel is an apartheid state. Finally, someone is exposing justice: Palestinian terrorism is tantamount to the actions of the Israel Defense Forces. Finally, someone is bringing peace: He is welcomed by that modern-day Sadat, Khaled Meshal.  
For the suicidal left, Carter is the good American cop who is replacing the bad American cop and ending the dark era of George Bush. After eight lean years, we once again have a brave Southern sheriff chasing the true villain - Israel. Now, then, we can once again stretch out on the soft sofas of the 1990s divan and suck on a hookah of sweet illusions. As though Camp David never happened. As though Hamas did not exist. Because Jimmy has come home. Carter has brought back hope.  
In the spring of 1979, President Carter made history: He led Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat to sign a peace accord. Carter did not initiate the accord. In some of his moves, Carter even jeopardized it. And yet ultimately the former president headed the peace summit and brought Egypt and Israel to the happy ending that they had had trouble reaching by themselves. That glowing hour on the White House lawn is the hour of grace in Carter's failed career in international politics. No one can take it away from him.  
In the fall of 1979, however, President Carter once again made history: failing to understand that the Khomeini revolution was imminent, he prevented the Shah from preventing the revolution. He thus brought about a historical catastrophe whose dimensions remain difficult to grasp even today. In the name of his commitment to moderation and human rights, Carter allowed zealots to take over Iran and turn it into a regional power of evil. This power of evil is about to become nuclear. It is a threat to Israel's existence, to the stability of the Middle East and to world peace. Carter bears the heavy burden of responsibility for this development.  
In November 1980, the Americans kicked Carter out of the White House in disgrace. They did so because they felt that he had destabilized America and brought it to its knees, and because they could no longer stand everything he represented: weakness, sanctimoniousness and groveling before evil.  
For some 30 years, Carter has been perceived by most Americans as a self-righteous fool who does not understand the basic physics of the real world. The fact that the preacher from Georgia wrapped his alchemy of international politics in a moralizing theology only increased the repugnance he aroused. Just as Carter's policy is not really policy, his morality is not really morality. There is no zealous thug that Carter will not embrace. No third-world terrorist that he will not try to appease.  
The problem, however, is not Carter, but Carterism. Carterism is a policy of appeasement: it is the unwillingness of those who seek good in the West to protect the values of the West when faced with an aggressor from the East. Carterism is the inability of the enlightened in North America and North Tel Aviv to face the fact that sometimes there is evil in the Third World. Sometimes there is evil in the Arab world. There is even Palestinian evil.  
Carter himself is not very important. He did some damage to Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian moderates, but the damage is limited. He did talk peace with Hamas at the same time that Hamas was initiating a military offensive at Kerem Shalom, an act that might have sparked a war, but in this he only exposed his own shoddiness.  
Carterism is far more important than Jimmy Carter. Carterism is a profound scourge found among certain elites in the U.S., in Western Europe and in Israel. Carterism is a dangerous distortion of thought and values among those who presume to be thinkers committed to values.  
The possibility that a Democrat will be elected president of the United States in November makes the debate over Carterism relevant and vital. Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama will have to choose whether to continue in the sober tradition of Roosevelt-Truman-Kennedy or to revive Carter's appeasement. That is why it is important to speak out strongly right now about the path chosen by the old man who came to visit us this week.  
This path is not only delusional, but immoral. Carterism's cooperation with Hamas is cooperation with the oppression of women, with the jailing of homosexuals, with the persecution of Christians. It is cooperation with a religious tyranny that tramples the Palestinian individual and seeks to eradicate the Israeli-Jewish collective. True, George Bush too has wreaked calamity on the Middle East, but the way to correct Bush's mistake is not to return to Carter's abomination. If the Israeli, European and American left chooses to become a Carterist left, it will indeed become a suicidal left.

<title>Catastrophic, but not apartheid?</title>
<date>Fri May 02 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Twice within 10 days, Israel has been labeled as ?apartheid? in Haaretz: in an editorial in support of former U.S. president Jimmy Carter?s efforts for peace; and in a column by Yossi Sarid, the former Meretz leader. Two authoritative voices, both misinformed.? 
Both Haaretz and Sarid focused on the territories. Both condemn Israel?s nearly 41-year-long occupation. Haaretz ?(?Our Debt to Jimmy Carter,? April 15?) said that the ?interim political situation in the territories has crystallized into a kind of apartheid,? while Sarid ?(?Yes, It Is Apartheid,? April 25?) wrote with great emotion that ?what acts like apartheid, is run like apartheid and harasses like apartheid, is not a duck ? it is apartheid.?? 
Yes, there is no question that our occupation policies and practices can be compared with apartheid. And, equally, with China?s control of Tibet. And also, to one degree or another, with any other place in the world where one group of people oppresses another.? 
Domination and control are the common elements. Roadblocks, licenses and permits for every little matter, arbitrary seizure of land, privileges concerning water use, cheap labor ? these and much else are the stock in trade of suppression.? 
But to apply the apartheid label is wrong, both with regard to the territories ?(to which Haaretz and Sarid refer?), or to Israel within the Green Line ?(where Arabs suffer discrimination, but to say it?s apartheid would be laughable?). Why do I say this with such certainty? Because I was a journalist with the Rand Daily Mail newspaper in Johannesburg for 26 years, and my special function was to report and comment on apartheid?s evils. And for more than 10 years I have lived in Israel, and have been engaged in dialogue work.? 
The labeling is wrong because the situations are entirely different. Apartheid in South Africa, from 1948 until 1994, was a unique?system of racial separation and discrimination, institutionalized by law and custom in every aspect of everyday life, imposed by the white minority and based on a belief in white racial superiority. Skin color decreed inferior status from birth until death for blacks, Asians and ?mixed-race? coloreds. In contrast, West Bank oppression is not based on a predetermined racist ideology. It stems rather from historical factors such as Jordan?s attack during the 1967 war and the resulting Israeli conquest of the West Bank. From that, the settlement movement has developed because of a mixture of religious messianism, economic greed and security claims.? 
Some compare Israel?s attempts to carve up the West Bank with South Africa?s tribal mini-states, the Bantustans. This is wildly inappropriate. The Bantustans were devised to deny blacks South African citizenship, while continuing to exploit their labor. Blacks were penned in rural ?reserves,? and were allowed into white South Africa only when needed for specified jobs in factories, offices and homes and on farms. Israel?s purpose on the West Bank is the opposite: to keep Palestinians there and to allow only an absolute minimum of them into Israel ? and even them, reluctantly. Instead, the country?s labor needs are met by importing large numbers of foreign workers.? 
I am among the majority of Israelis who believe that the occupation and the settlements are catastrophic for both Israelis and Palestinians. I want two states, side by side in peace: That?s an agreed-upon separation, not apartheid. I share the dismay and shame of many Israelis about the morass into which the occupation has dragged us ? the mutual killings, the infliction of suffering, and the brutalization of both Israelis and?Palestinians as perpetrators and victims. I am desperately worried about our betrayal of our moral values and of the lessons of our own persecution down the centuries.? 
Calling it apartheid, however, is not only wrong but thoughtless ? because it ignores what is happening in the world, and especially the imminence of the Durban Review Conference, due to be held next year. That meeting is to be the follow-up to the United Nations anti-racism conference in Durban, South Africa, in August-September 2001. The first part was an international conference of NGOs that went berserk in condemning Israel as ?the new apartheid.? The aim was simple: If Israel was branded like this, it would be as illegitimate as apartheid South Africa had been, and hence subject to the same severe international sanctions. Moreover, whereas the intention with apartheid South Africa was to force a change in regime, it is obvious that critics of Israel include those who seek the destruction of the state itself.? 
The conference of governments that followed tangled over similar anti-Israel and anti-Semitic wording. After pressures, it eventually dumped virtually every reference to Israel. A few days later, 9/11 overtook the Durban meetings. Singling out Israel as the fount of original sin in human-rights abuses went to the back burner. Now it is creeping back: The apartheid accusation is being spread in meetings around the world and on Internet sites. It could feature at next year?s Review Conference.? 
Anticipating the worst, Canada has already announced that it will not attend the event. Israel is waiting to see what happens before deciding whether to take part. Apartheid deserves its unique place in human memory. Just as not every tragedy is a holocaust, so not every form of separation or oppressive rule is apartheid.?

<title>Citizenship law makes Israel an apartheid state</title>
<date>Fri Jun 27 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
The government's decision last week to extend the validity of the Citizenship Law (Temporary Order), for another year, is evidence that the legal barriers preventing severe discrimination against Israel's Arab citizens and harm to their civil rights have been removed.  
This extension is the eighth since the law was first passed in 2003, and it shows just how naive Justice Edmond Levy's position was when he refused to join in the 2006 decision by five judges from the High Court of Justice, who stated that the law was unconstitutional, that it contravened the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Freedom, and that it must be removed from the law books. Levy explained his refusal by saying that he saw no need to intervene because only two months remained until the law expired. However, at the end of the two months, the law was extended by a year, and now they want to extend it for yet another year.  
Had Levy known that the law's limited validity was nothing but a deception aimed at preparing a discriminatory and unconstitutional law, there is no doubt he would have joined the five justices' majority opinion that it was unconstitutional and should be removed. We must hope that the High Court of Justice, when it rules on the new petition submitted against the law after it was extended in 2006, will take into account that the term "temporary provision," which both the government and Knesset take pains to stress, is a deception. We are talking about, in effect, a permanent law.  
The law stipulates that the interior minister does not have the authority to approve residence in Israel for a resident of Judea and Samaria (unless, of course, they are Jews - that is, settlers). This is so even regarding family reunions, meaning marriage, when it comes to Palestinian spouses who are younger than 35 (for men) or 25 (for women). In effect, the law prevents young Israeli citizens from marrying the spouse of their choice and living with this spouse in Israel, if the spouse is a Palestinian from Judea and Samaria.  
It is obvious that this has barely any effect on the right of young Israeli Jews to live in their country with the spouse of their choice, because there are hardly any marriages between Israeli Jews and Palestinians from Judea and Samaria. On the other hand, these Palestinians constitute Israeli Arabs' natural pool for choosing a spouse. For this reason, the law severely discriminates when comparing the rights of young Israeli Jewish citizens and young Israeli Arab citizens.  
When the law was first passed in 2003, supposedly as a temporary one-year measure, it was accompanied by security reasoning - the risk of implanting terrorists in Israel via marriage. The reasoning was faulty even at that time: Every Palestinian who wishes to enter Israel must be addressed individually. It is the Shin Bet security service's task to do this and thus carry out its mission - protecting the security of Israel's citizens such that the country remains democratic, with equal rights for all. However, as the years go by, it becomes clear that the security argument and the term "temporary measure" are merely a deception aimed at "koshering" discriminatory legislation for demographic reasons.  
The claim that there are characteristics of an apartheid state in Israel is widely heard in the Western world. The word apartheid is catchy and understood in many parts of the world, which makes it useful to send a message that we resent and which we claim has no connection with  reality in Israel. However, we do not need to replicate exactly the characteristics of South African apartheid within discriminatory practices in civil rights in Israel in order to call Israel an apartheid state. The amendment to the Citizenship Law is exactly such a practice, and it is best that we not try to evade the truth: Its existence in our law books turns Israel into an apartheid state.
The government decided to add the Gaza Strip to the list of countries for which the interior minister does not have the prerogative to approve residence in Israel on the grounds of family reunions, regardless of age. Both the list and the new addition are superfluous and harmful. Since Hamas gained control, no one enters or leaves Gaza anyway, and the new restriction harms couples' cases from the time when there was passage between Israel and Gaza. There is no need for this affront.

<title>Colonial Zionism </title>
<date>Fri Oct 17 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
For the past 30 years I have considered the settlements a destructive phenomenon that raises a large question mark over Israel's future. In fact, the settlement enterprise is an ideological, political and social phenomenon that has succeeded in creating an original androgynous creation: colonial Zionism.  
There have already been variations of Zionism: general, revisionist, socialist, with or without quotation marks. Now we also have colonial Zionism, based on ethnic and religious inequality, which considers itself the exclusive emissary of Jewish history. The Divine promise and not the natural rights of human beings to freedom, independence and self-government is, in its eyes, the one and only source of legitimacy for the return of the Jews to the Land of Israel. According to this viewpoint, the land belongs not only to living Jews, but to all the past generations and those yet unborn; therefore, members of the present generation have no right to share possession of the land with members of another nation.  
As a matter of course, when we speak of "the settlements" we are not referring to that vast majority of Israelis who are living in the West Bank for reasons of convenience or necessity (cheap and improved housing). In addition, we do not talk about each settler separately: We talk about the settlement enterprise the way one talks about "socialism," "conservatism" or "nationalism;" in other words, about that which is essential to the ideology and the movement, and typifies it.  
Even the ideological core, which is in essence "the settlement movement," is not all of one stripe. Between the hilltop youth and many of their parents there is a large gap, not only in patterns of behavior but also in the degree of connection to universal values.  
However, overall, they are all nurtured by the same principles and aspire to the same goals. Since this small minority is convinced that it owns the absolute truth, it considers itself permitted to force it on all of society.   
Therefore its leaders and spokespersons show disdain for both the weak politicians and the basic tenets of democracy itself. They know how to exploit democratic institutions, but they ignore human rights and recognize only the rights of the Jews. Since the High Court of Justice decision on Elon Moreh in 1979, in which the court ruled that seizing private lands is illegal, they have been attacking this basic institution of Israeli democracy, the guardian of individual rights.  
Despite the power he has acquired thanks to the cowardice of the government, the ideological settler always wears the mantle of a martyr, persecuted by the left-wing elite and the media it ostensibly controls. Although he controls the territories, he likes to be portrayed as a perpetual victim of leftist conspiracies. Although for almost four decades the ideological settler has created a reality about which Israeli voters have never been called on to decide, and in subversive ways has turned the military occupation into civilian control that contradicts every accepted norm in the Western world, he does not cease to cry that he has been robbed.  
In Hebron a situation has been created that is a national disgrace, a genuine sin and crime: Apartheid, as legal scholar Boaz Okun wrote in the weekly Yedioth Ahronoth last week, is already here. But not only in Hebron: The situation in the territories in general and the lawless outposts in particular, along with the theft of private lands, is testimony to the bankruptcy of the state when faced with the daring of the settler and his determination not to retreat before ethical or legal obstacles. In that way the settlement movement is perforce creating daily violations of the law and a culture of violence: Ofra and Beit El may be quiet and pleasant places settled by idealists, but together with their satellite outposts, Amona, Beit Hagedud and Ofra Northeast, Beit El East and Hill 909, they have seized an area that, according to aerial photos and information conveyed to the Peace Now monitoring committee by government authorities, over 90 percent of which is composed of private Palestinian land (figures from October 2006).  
Finally, I would like to make one point clear once and for all, without any connection to the attempt to hurt me, an attempt whose perpetrators could belong to any faction of the extreme right, and not necessarily the settlement movement. In three articles I wrote in May and June of 2001, one of which included a paragraph that was not properly worded, I explained my position regarding the settlers: The lives of Jews living on both sides of the Green Line are "equally precious."   
And in another place: "The settlement movement is a historical disaster, but for now there are people living there whose lives must be protected." In fact, the distinction between individuals whom we must take care of as long as they are there - and the emphasis is on the dimension of temporariness - and the settlement enterprise as an historical phenomenon is essential.  
I have already written in the past in this newspaper, and I repeat it today: If Israeli society is unable to muster the courage necessary to put an end to the settlements, the settlements will put an end to the state of the Jews and will turn it into a binational state.

<title>Divide and save </title>
<date>Fri Sep 12 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
At first, I thought it was a joke. The world is funny, so we laugh, instead of crying. Then I realized that it is serious: Serious people do not repeat the same stupid joke twice. Sari Nusseibeh and Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala) are serious people, and recently they have been bringing up the idea of a binational state: No more two states for two peoples, but rather one state for both. The end of days is preceding history; plowshares and pruning-hooks are replacing swords and spears before they have been beaten at all.  
It is possible to understand them: After 40 years of occupation and oppression, after 15 years of barren negotiations in which an agreement, like the horizon, has grown more distant the nearer one approaches, it is no wonder that people are growing addicted to despair like a narcotic.  
Abu Ala told a Fatah meeting in Ramallah that if Israel continues to block the Palestinian state that is on the way, there will be no choice but to demand a binational state, according to a New York Times report. Not long ago, the Israel-Palestine Center for Research and Information completed a working paper that includes the binational option in case the negotiations collapse. And another group, the Palestine Strategy Study Group, which is funded by the European Union, is suggesting a number of scenarios, including one involving Israel-Palestine under a single sovereignty.  
Sari Nusseibeh is now the prophet of the one-state-for-everyone, for all who dwell between the Jordan River and the sea. His despair is even more uncomfortable and much scarier, because there is no one like him for insight and realism. And if he is sending out distress and warning signals like these, that is a very bad sign for "the process," and there are not very many hopeful people left in the neighborhood.  
A joke is a joke, but this region has a nasty proclivity for fulfilling black prophecies and bad jests. An idea is an idea, but it comes with a problem: It simply has not succeeded anywhere. One state for two ethnic or religious groups is a guarantee of calamity in the Balkan or Caucasian sense, of another Lebanese or Iraqi or Cypriot story - and never mind Africa, which colonialism left in shreds and tatters. Even Belgium seems set to fall apart; even Scotland is playing with musings about independence.  
Is something that has failed everywhere going to succeed in this cursed place, of all places? The more the status quo surrounds itself with barricades, lest it be breached, the more desperate people there will be, both Palestinians and Israelis, who will unwittingly want to establish here what is essentially a bad old South Africa, but without the South African solution. After all, the Jews will never agree to give up their exclusive rule, but a reconstructed apartheid state cannot survive in this day and age - and who would want to live in it willingly?  
The same state for two peoples? There will be one neither for me nor for you. The judgment of this country is the opposite of Solomon's judgment in the case of the two prostitutes living in the same house, because this is the test of one's relationship to the land: The one who seeks to clasp it to his breast and rock it, in one piece, is in fact the one who hates it, whereas the one who wants to amputate large parts of its body - to butcher, to relinquish and to share - is in fact the one who loves it. So divide it, divide it and save it, before we die.

<title>Don't call it apartheid </title>
<date>Thu Jul 17 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Every so often, when the comparison between Israel and the apartheid regime in South Africa is once again in the headlines, I am reminded of the racism conference in Durban in 2001. One incident at that conference, which became a milestone in the struggle to delegitimize Israel, remains engraved in my memory.  
In the last few weeks, during which Israel hosted a delegation of fair-minded people who were in the vanguard of the fight against apartheid, I was reminded of the sights and sounds of that incident: During a demonstration in the streets of Durban, protesters shouted "Amandela intifada!" Amandela is the Zulu word for power and was often used in demonstrations against the minority white regime.  
Since that conference, Israel's enemies have drawn a comparison between these two struggles, in order to argue that Israel - like apartheid - does not have the right to exist. Words and slogans have a power of their own. It is acknowledged that the phrasing of questions in public opinion polls influences the answer and can point the respondent in a certain direction. When one uses the word "apartheid," which, in practice, means the superiority of one race and the inferiority of all others, it is clear that there can be no solution. The only place for regimes such as the apartheid regime in South Africa is the ash heap of history. If Israel's critics compare the Israeli regime to other phenomena, such as colonialism, the only reasonable conclusion is that the comparison is inaccurate at best or malevolent at worst - but they will also learn from history that there is a way out. When dealing with apartheid, there is no point in even trying. The die has been cast.  
There are several countries whose behavior is not approved of by someone or other. In some countries, Jews and Christians are not allowed to hold citizenship, and there are some regimes that prevent women from voting. Is this just? No. Is it apartheid? No. There are some situations where there is an insurmountable gulf between rich and poor, between the educated and the ignorant. If we were to exaggerate the case, there are some countries where it is perfectly acceptable for the state to favor those who support the regime, at the expense of its opponents. Is this hard to stomach? Yes. Is it apartheid? Obviously not. Even countries where there are bloody ethnic struggles are not compared to that most maligned of all regimes. Even if it were possible to find some similarities between a certain regime and the apartheid regime - and it is always possible to find at least one common element - the crux of the issue is different. Only when it comes to Israel and Israel's actions is this comparison used indiscriminately.  
Especially annoying is the way certain people view the roadblocks and the other symbols of Israeli rule, as if they were final proof of the similarity between Israel and South African apartheid. Did Israel erect these roadblocks for no good reason? Is this Israeli-Palestinian conflict devoid of context and history? Are the Palestinians the only ones who suffered? Are we the only ones who must shoulder the blame? Only a fool or an evil person fails to recognize the mistakes and the suffering on both sides. Those who insist on seeing the two situations as identical should be reminded that avoiding harming innocent white civilians was a cornerstone of the struggle for freedom among black South Africans. In addition, apart from some fringe elements, there was no ideology calling for whites to be driven into the sea or to be deported back to wherever they came from.  
When we host delegations from South Africa, or people who take an interest in what is going on here, one cannot help but feel sorrow at the suffering of the sick people waiting at the checkpoints and the cries of "apartheid." Under these circumstances, there is no point in reminding people about the hundreds of thousands of black and colored children who died from malnutrition because the government decided they were not deserving of fresh water, electricity, roads, food or medicine. One can only compare the tools used by those opposing both regimes; one can compare their goals and then decide whether there is any justification to their behavior.  
Not everyone who uses the word apartheid to describe Israel believes that the Zionist enterprise should go the same way as the white minority regime in South Africa. Some want what is best for Israel, regret what Israel does and seek to warn us about the ramifications. But when they choose to use such a loaded expression, they provide additional ammunition to the worst of Israel's enemies. They do not provide them with guns and bullets, but with words to be used on the critical battlefield of international legitimacy.  
I grew up in South Arica and I returned there as Israeli ambassador. In my eyes, using the word apartheid to describe Israel also cheapens the memory of those who died at the hands of that evil regime. We must speak out about the use of such a sorry comparison.

<title> From darkness into light </title>
<date>Tue May 06 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Again we celebrated the holiday of freedom while Gilad Shalit remained in captivity. We spoke of going from darkness into a great light, but left the talks about releasing the abducted soldiers in the dark. We have become accustomed to let our future depend on Shin Bet people who negotiate covertly, and we have stopped asking what we could do to release the abducted soldiers.  
Why not talk with all our neighbors, Hamas, Fatah and Hezbollah, the presidents of Syria and Egypt and the Arab states, about releasing the abducted soldiers, about stopping the Qassam fire, about reconciliation?  
We boast of Israel's democracy and freedom of information, but let the Shin Bet security service direct our reality, although they act in darkness. We have no idea what our future map is, but we have been asked for years not to ask too many questions.  
Since 1967, Israel has imprisoned more than 700,000 Palestinians, about one-fifth of the Palestinian population. According to the last United Nations report, Israel is holding behind bars more than 11,000 Palestinian prisoners, including 118 women and 376 children, who are incarcerated - in violation of international law - outside the occupied territories. The Shin Bet decides which prisoners are to receive visits and which family members will be barred from entering Israel.  
We could release first, as a goodwill gesture, some 800 "administrative" Palestinian prisoners, who have been jailed in Israel for months with no trial. These prisoners, who have not been charged and do not know why they are being jailed for months (sometimes years) with no trial, must be released as the first stage of releasing the political abductees and prisoners. Releasing prisoners can be the first step of a reconciliation process, as it has been in many countries worldwide.  
Reconciliation processes everywhere in the world are not conducted in the dark but in a bright light. They include a public debate on victims' testimonies and public recognition of the pain, rights and compromises made by all the parties concerned. Some 22,000 people testified before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, and millions heard and watched their testimonies on television. Testifying before the committees made it possible for the victims to tell their story and win recognition, enabled many South Africans to hear for the first time about the extent of the apartheid regime's oppression and gave society a chance to deal with the pain of the past in order to build a more just future.  
In Israel the authorities prefer to conduct secret talks and not to hear the Palestinian story. We keep telling the story of our renewed return to the land of our fathers. What is the story of the Palestinians who have lived here, whom this country also belongs to? Why don't we want to hear their story, about the deportation of hundreds of thousands from their homes in 1948, destroying their villages and looting their property? Why shouldn't we hear of their dream to return to their homes in Jaffa and Ramle and Lod? About their life under occupation, when their universities were closed for years at the military governor's order? Why don't we hear about children growing up in crowded homes during months of curfew, about roadblocks and fences and family members being beaten, humiliated and arrested, and life without rights?  
It is time to talk with the Palestinians about the way we will live here together. Is there really nobody to talk to? Why aren't we willing to talk with everyone about everything, about the past, present and future?  
Is it possible that Gilad Shalit is still in captivity and the Qassam fire is continuing not because there is no one to talk to, but because we don't want to hear what the Palestinian leaders have to say? We must speak out loudly and openly with everyone - about the past, present and future, about a life of fair, decent neighborly relations. Without red and green lines and with no prior conditions. Only about how we will live here together and separately, Jews and Arabs, in reconciliation.

<title>Hamas is waiting for Netanyahu</title>
<date>Mon Nov 17 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
According to recent media reports, former Lt.-Gen. Moshe Ya'alon is in talks with Likud chairman Benjamin Netanyahu on the conditions for joining Netanyahu's beehive. In May 1996, at the height of Shimon Peres' campaign for the premiership, Ya'alon stung Netanyahu where it hurts him most: terror and Iran. Ya'alon, who was chief of Military Intelligence at the time, said Iran was encouraging terror organizations to increase their activity to bring about the rise of Likud. Netanyahu defended himself: "If the goal of Iran and of the terror organizations that operate under its aegis is to bring an end to the peace process by means of terror, they will be disappointed. A Likud-led government will continue the peace process in its own way."  
Likud won those elections. Despite the promises, the way in which the "old" Netanyahu (and to be fair, his successors as well) promoted the peace process with the Palestinians (and Syrians) apparently pleased Iran and its partners, first and foremost Hamas.  
Now the "new" Netanyahu is proposing an improved path: It is called "economic peace." Mr. Privatization promises that once economic growth in the Palestinian Authority reaches 10 percent annually, and the change is seen and felt, we will achieve stability on the ground. Instead of discussing issues such as the Temple Mount, borders and refugees, he will talk to the Palestinians about building a civil society.  
Last Wednesday Aluf Benn wrote here ("Give him a chance, Netanyahu will say") that Netanyahu has already managed to interest Barack Obama in his ideas. During their meeting last June in Jerusalem, the new-old claimant to the throne explained to the U.S. visitor that instead of arguing about removing checkpoints, it would be better to create employment opportunities near Palestinian cities and build projects that will get the economy in the territories moving. Jordan and Egypt will probably join the effort, he said.  
According to all the available evidence, Hamas is welcoming Netanyahu's comeback. In an interview about a week ago with the newspaper Al-Arab al-Youm, which was cited on the Muslim Brotherhood Web site, Hamas political leader Khaled Meshal was asked what motivated Jordan to begin talks with  his organization.   
Meshal cited four regional developments working in Hamas' favor: the new Palestinian reality, a result of Hamas' rise and strengthening; the dead-end in the talks on a final-status agreement; the rightward turn in Israeli politics (which threatens Jordan); and the loss of American credibility in the region.  
The idea of replacing the peace talks with methods of conflict management suits Hamas to a tee. To them, an "overall peace" that will improve everyday life is a tahadiyeh (truce). The head of the Hamas government will be happy to sign a new temporary truce with Netanyahu and toss the road map into the trash, along with the Annapolis declaration and Ehud Olmert's maps. Hamas does not even mind if Netanyahu builds new settlements.   
On the contrary, the more Jews there are in the West Bank, the lesser the danger that Greater Israel will remain a Jewish state, and the stronger the chances that it will become a binational state, and eventually Greater Palestine.  
With unconcealed irony, veteran Palestinian columnist Hani al-Masri said during a recent meeting with Israelis that if it is really possible to carry out economic, democratic and security reform under occupation, as Netanyahu proposes, then why not leave the occupation in place?   
In an article in the East Jerusalem newspaper Al-Ayyam, Masri analyzed the reasons for the failure of the Egyptian-mediated reconciliation talks between Hamas and Fatah.   
He claimed that Hamas, which has not succeeded in ending the rule of PA President Mahmoud Abbas before the end of his term in January 2009, has decided to wait for Netanyahu's second term, to start a month later.   
Why should Hamas pay a high price, such as recognizing Israel, wrote Masri, when in a few months from now Netanyahu will be sending Abbas to drink the Dead Sea?  
Obama's reaction to Netanyahu's ideas for an "overall peace" was not available at the time of this writing. We can only hope that America's first black president will remind the Israelis of what happened to the Bantustans - the black enclaves invented by the white apartheid regime in South Africa.   
To ensure that Tehran does not get carried away in its rejoicing, it is important for Obama to point this out even before the polls in divided Jerusalem kick off, and to reveal his peace plan.

<title>If the land isn't private? </title>
<date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Not long ago the greengrocer in Ramallah recalled - between weighing locally grown zucchini and stripped hyssop leaves - that his family owns the land on which the gas station at the old entrance to the Jewish settlement of Beit El in the West Bank is located. He would not be surprised by the figure that the Peace Now movement has succeeded in officially extracting from the defense establishment, after more than a year of fighting for the freedom of information: About one-third of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank (44 out of 120) were built on privately owned Palestinian land that was seized, by means of confiscation orders, for "security needs."  
From the data it emerges that at least 19 of the 44 settlements were built on private land, even after prime minister Menachem Begin decided in 1979 that the construction and expansion of settlements would take place only on state-owned land.  
Peace Now has revealed here another act of hypocrisy, even though the Supreme Court is no longer impressed even by this: It did, after all, legitimize the construction of the settlement of Matityahu on land owned by inhabitants of Bil'in.  
The known fact that settlements are built on private Palestinian lands combines all too well with the general civic and institutional Israeli perception to the effect that Palestinian lands that are not privately owned, or that lack proof of private ownership, belong to the Jewish people in Israel and the Diaspora.  
Under the Israeli approach, which has expanded further since the Oslo Accords, any land that is not private was and remains suitable for Israeli development - for the benefit of the Jewish citizens of the state and for those who have the right to immigrate to Israel under the Law of Return. These are exactly the lands that constitute a considerable part of Area C (which is under Israeli military and administrative responsibility, and holds 60 percent of the area of the West Bank) and prohibited for any Palestinian development. It is on these lands, which are denominated "state lands," that two-thirds of the settlements are built. No less illegally.  
The discussion of whether West Bank lands are privately owned or not reverberates far more loudly than the discussion of Israel's takeover of the Palestinian expanse by means of the closure policy. For example, since February 5, the army has once again severed the towns of the northern West Bank from the rest of the territory by means of roadblocks, and has forbidden males between the ages of 16 and 35 from leaving their towns. The media don't report on this.  
The discussion of private land reverberates well in the Israeli (and American) media because of the exaggerated sanctification of private property. And now, Peace Now must correct its initial report of October 2006, in which it was stated that 86 percent of the area of Ma'aleh Adumim is private Palestinian land. It emerges that only .05 percent of Ma'aleh Adumim is private land.  
Nonetheless, this non-ideological Jewish settlement is among the most damaging to the Palestinians, and it reinforces the regime of apartheid roads: It cuts the northern part of the West Bank off from the southern part, and prevents Palestinian territorial contiguity. The road that leads to Ma'aleh Adumim will soon be closed to Palestinians, who will be diverted to a separate, narrow and winding road. This Jewish settlement has caused the banishment of many Bedouin from their lands and their ways of life. Together with the adjacent Jewish settlements and the separation barrier, it has taken over lands that had served the Palestinian towns and villages in the area, their natural reserve for development and expansion.  
And so what if this is land that was not registered as private? Because of this robbery, these villages and towns have become crowded, choking neighborhoods that are cut off from the larger expanse.  
The extensive work that Peace Now has invested in exposing the private ownership of lands is a mirror image of the extensive and systematic effort of Civil Administration experts to prevent inhabitants of the villages from cultivating their lands beyond the separation barrier. They measure out for each individual his part in an inheritance and in accordance with this, they allot him the hours during which he may pass through the gate to harvest olives or to plow the land. They prevent shared cultivation of the land and calculate which of the siblings in a family is abroad so that, heaven forfend, his share of the land will not be cultivated by others.  
All of this is a preliminary step to expropriate land that remains "without owners" and its transformation in the future into state land - that is, Jews' land.  
The exaggerated concentration on private ownership feeds into the Israeli denial of the fact that the Palestinians' right is to all of the territory that has been occupied. Not as private individuals, but rather because they constitute an indigenous national group in this land.

<title>It stinks </title>
<date>Fri Aug 15 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
What is actually new about that invention that scatters demonstrations and is called "The Skunk"? It has a "source in the Border Police" waxing lyrical: "Here the effect is tremendous. People can't stand themselves and they leave the site." For over 40 years we've been stinking, in the words of the Border Policeman, we can still tolerate ourselves and we have yet to leave.  
Colonel Amir Baram just ended his term as commander of the Samaria Brigade. In a summarizing report, he identifies Daniella Weiss of Kedumim and Gabi Ben Zimra of Ma'aleh Levona as "major provocateurs," and warns of the harm caused by the gangs of settlers, which is steadily escalating without anyone stopping it.  
In contrast, another brigade commander, one Udi Ben Moha, who began his tour of duty three months ago, identifies the provocateurs elsewhere; he wakes up to work on the left side: Were it not for the presence of the leftist groups in Hebron and its satellites, in his opinion, the city of apartheid would be a model of coexistence.  
How is it that such a huge gap separates two brigade commanders? The occupation is the same occupation, the Palestinians are the same Palestinians and the settlers are the same settlers. There is no real difference between the strong-armed men in Yitzhar and the empty-headed ones in Hebron. The explanation is simple: One brigade commander is leaving the territories, the other is just beginning.  
Baram, free and carefree, can permit himself to describe the reality as it is, to tell the truth he did not tell previously; poor Ben Moha has no choice but to distort. He knows, does the Hebron brigade commander, that his future lies not with the leftists but with the settlers; only they are capable of determining the fate of his career, for better or worse.  
The Israel Defense Forces is the traditional collaborator of Rabbi Moshe Levinger and his sons and grandsons, and must adapt itself to the smell of the surroundings. Thus, one brigade commander decided to rid himself of the odor as he left, whereas his colleague is fated to putrefy in his tent.  
Who are we to complain about a poor officer with a miserable job, if the defense minister himself exudes a bad smell over his surroundings; he, too, lives and draws strength from the mouths of settlers. He has promised the High Court of Justice a thousand times to evacuate the outpost of Migron, which was born in sin and lives in crime, and failed to keep his promise. Now he will move the outpost by a few hundred meters, but not before all the new houses are built, another vision for evacuation and construction. It is not Ehud Barak's first rotten agreement with the heads of the Yesha (Judea and Samaria) families, and which he will make the judges swallow. The High Court, its tresses shorn, will also swallow whatever Barak feeds it.  
This week "baseless hatred" made another round on the furrowed back of Tisha B'Av. Pay attention to the chronicles as they really occurred, and not as they were distorted deliberately or by mistake. Messianic fanatics were the ones who caused the destruction of the Temple, and they are the sons of Belial, the rabble rousers of Hebron and Yitzhar and Havot Gilad and Ma'aleh Levona. And the leaders were scared to death of them; thus, due to the sins of the Sicarii [Jewish extremists during the Temple period] and their fallen vassals, we were exiled from our land. Many are already in exile.

<title>Jews who are a danger to Zionism </title>
<date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
To the eternal question as to which U.S. presidential candidate is better for the Jews, there is a Jewish answer. In other words, a question. Two questions actually. The first: "What's good for the Jews?" and the second: "For which Jews?"  
For example, this weekend the New York Times reported that at next month's Arab League conference in Damascus, the offer of Arab normalization with Israel in exchange for an end to the occupation will be reevaluated. Is this a good or a bad thing? It depends which Jews you ask.  
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert says that the most important and urgent issue for Jews is the establishment of a Palestinian state over most of the territories. He argues that if we do not find a way to divide the land into two states, as soon as possible, it will become a binational state. In other words, according to Olmert, an American president who is opposed to a final settlement agreement with the Palestinians is a threat to Zionism.  
On the other hand, Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu claims that a president who pushes for a Palestinian state is supporting the creation of a "terrorist entity" that would threaten the existence of the Jewish state. Netanyahu feels at home with American politicians from the camp of evangelist Pat Robertson, who said on a television program a few hours after Ariel Sharon collapsed, that this was Sharon's punishment for "dividing the holy land which belongs to God."  
Olmert has come to be the senior representative of the viewpoint that the settlements are an obstacle to the future success of Zionism. As such, President Bush Sr. was better for the Jews than his son, the incumbent. The father withheld U.S. loan guarantees for immigrant absorption as punishment for prime minister Yitzhak Shamir's refusal to freeze settlement activity during peace negotiations. On the other hand, Bush Jr. is making do with recycled Olmert promises to respect the commitments of his predecessor, Sharon, and to remove the illegal outposts.  
Notwithstanding Bush's vision of two states from June 2002 and his April 2004 letter to Sharon, which never got off the paper, these documents have great significance. They sealed the debate among the mainstream in the U.S. as to the preferable solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The principles guiding Bush are not substantively different from the formula his predecessor, Bill Clinton, laid out toward the end of his term.  
Between the carefully crafted statements of the three presidential candidates it is possible to discern that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John McCain also lack a more successful solution than the establishment of two states along the 1967 borders, with agreed changes to their precise location, and a fair and realistic solution to the refugee problem.  
Commitment to Israel's security has remained the litmus test for the title "friend of Israel." The Arabists in the American establishment, those who doubted Israel's right to exist securely, threw in the towel a long time ago. The three candidates surrounded themselves with advisers who consider peace with the Arabs to be the key to safeguarding Israel's security. They believe that resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict will bolster the pragmatists among the Arabs in their struggle with extremist Islam.  
According to the current Israeli government, the title "friend of Israel" is reserved for an American president who will not make do with paying lip service to a "political horizon" and who will place the Zionist challenge of two states at the top of his daily agenda.  
However, according to the Jewish establishment, the element that liaises between Israel and the decision makers in the U.S., a "friend of Israel" is an American who allows Israelis and Arabs to spill their blood on the way to a solution of one state or apartheid rule. People, for example, like the evangelist Gary Bauer, who ran eight years ago in the Republican primaries.  
The powerful pro-Israeli lobby, AIPAC, does not really bother to rally in favor of a two-state solution. AIPAC invited Bauer to speak during one of its annual conferences. The guest of honor reminded the applauding audience, "God granted the Land of Israel to the Jewish people and there is an absolute ban on giving it away to another people."  
Bauer is considered by Jewish politicos (who, according to polls, are far from representative of the majority in the Jewish community) to be a "friend of Israel." On the other hand, Obama lost his title in their eyes because Robert Malley, who was one of President Clinton's advisers on the Middle East and dedicated to promoting peace - was seen at his campaign headquarters.  
The prime minister has said that without a two-state solution, "Israel is finished." Jewish organizations say that they support the government of Israel, whatever its policy may be. So, who is a good Jew? The person who supports the candidate who calls for a Palestinian state, or the one who voted for the one who is opposed to it?

You reported on December 9, 2008, "Poll: Most Israelis think human rights groups hostile to their country." The report notes that "89 percent of Israelis attribute great importance to human rights and the protection of them." The article did not mention, however, that the poll was commissioned by NGO Monitor (together with Bar-Ilan University), and that the results reflect the findings of NGO Monitor's detailed research on human rights NGOs. The poll found that Israelis care deeply about human rights, but do not trust NGOs to safeguard them. NGO Monitor has chronicled the consistent use of double standards and selective application of international law by some organizations that claim benevolent agendas.  
In the context of continuing NGO campaigns against Israel's response to rocket attacks from Gaza, and the lead up to the Durban Review Conference in 2009, there has never been a more important time to "watch the watchers."  
Sarah Mandel  
Associate Editor NGO Monitor   
In its deliberations prior to nominating Shahar Zubari Israel's sportsman hero of the year, did the Olympic Committee of Israel ask itself how it would have reacted had another nation's Olympics committee bestowed a similar honor on an athlete who publicly, and in print, only a couple of months previously insulted the Jewish People in language even remotely as coarse as that employed by Zubari in his description of the Chinese? If that were to happen, protests of anti-Semitism would and should ring out, far and wide, particularly from the Olympic Committee of Israel.  
In view of our own historic experience of racial slurs, the Jewish State and its various representative organs should surely display sensitivity to the feelings of other peoples and desist from glorifying such a sportsman as a national hero and model for Israel's sportsmen, perhaps even going so far as to suspend him from representing our state and its sports for a period of time as penitence.  
E. Zev Sufott   
Deputy Chairman  
Council for the Promotion  of Israel-China Relations   
UN Human Rights High Commissioner Navanethem Pillay is wrong to admonish Canada and Israel for their dissociation from the fiasco that will be the Durban Review Conference. Justifiably dubbed "Durban II", the DRC will pick up where the original conference left off, providing yet another smokescreen to help regimes such as Iran, Libya and Cuba camouflage their own serial human rights violations.  
Understanding that malevolent forces had already derailed the DRC, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper made the principled decision to pull out of the hopelessly politicized and corrupt international forum. Israel has now followed suit and hopefully others will as well.  
Pillay suggests that in 2001 the states at the conference "assuaged" the concerns about the "denigration" of Israel by taking the high road in passing a framework for combating international racism. It did no such thing. The Durban process has generated seven years of unrelenting demonization of Israel and hate-filled attacks on the founding principles of Zionism. The Durban strategy has married calls for boycotts of this putative "apartheid state" with the promotion of a blinkered version of racism that begins and ends with Islamophobia.  
The planning documents for the DRC have already gutted Mr. Pillay's great opportunity to further the international anti-racism agenda. He asks, "What message does a state boycott [of the DRC] send to those who are suffering from racism?" Here's his answer: It is time for all democratic nations to admonish those egregious human rights violators behind Durban II who have hijacked the DRC from the outset because promoting their narrow vision of hatred is more important than confronting the world's legitimate human rights needs. By denying legitimacy to the farce that is the DRC, the world will make a statement that impunity and impotence no longer trump accountability and action. Thus, the global community will assert that purposeful international action to combat racism and xenophobia can no longer be sacrificed to satisfy visceral hatred of Israel, the West and the Jewish people.

<title>Netanyahu the devil </title>
<date>Sun Aug 10 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
They're playing that old tune again: Anybody but Benjamin ("they're-afffraid") Netanyahu. Shaul Mofaz loves peace, Tzipi Livni will end the occupation, Ehud Barak will treat the Palestinians like human beings. Only Netanyahu will bring disaster. Once again, the political fashion is to discuss how to stop the king of the opinion polls and the prince of disaster.  
The Likud chairman's demonization by the Anti-Netanyahu Defense League is not new. It has one goal: presenting all the other candidates as better, because they are so different from the devil Netanyahu. It is an old, tried-and-true method in Israeli discourse: For example, we will fight the "illegal outposts," thus koshering all the other, meticulously "legal" settlements. Just as there is no difference between Ariel and Asael - both are patently illegal - there is no real difference between Netanyahu and all the other candidates. None is a harbinger of peace or the end of the occupation, but only Netanyahu is painted in frightening hues, thus rendering the others kosher.  
Netanyahu, the man of our nightmares, met with Yasser Arafat, signed the Hebron agreement and did not bring peace. The prime ministers who succeeded him - Ehud Barak, Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert - did not lead Israel even one step closer to peace. Netanyahu did open the Western Wall Tunnel, a fiasco that ended with dozens killed. And who was his partner in that move? Olmert, then mayor of Jerusalem, who has never been as horrifying as Netanyahu. True, Olmert's rhetoric as prime minister was much more pleasant to peace-loving ears than Netanyahu's; he conducted negotiations, he was hospitable to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and he even sent emissaries to Turkey to conduct talks with Syria. But what did we get out of all that? More settlements, and more brutal occupation. Netanyahu, at least, did not set off on a useless, foolish war.  
The point of these arguments is not to praise Netanyahu. According to his declared ideology, he supports a one-state solution, an eternal apartheid state. But how the devil is he different from the others? Mofaz, for example, should frighten us much more: His hands have a great deal more blood on them than this scary Netanyahu has. While Netanyahu dispatched a representative to the Sryian president and sent out feelers about an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, Mofaz pledges "peace for peace," insults our intelligence, and actually promises another war in the north. The father of assassinations, he turned the Israel Defense Forces into a vengeful gang in the occupied territories. In any proper country Mofaz would have long ago been delegitimized because of his responsibility for what are considered war crimes elsewhere in the world. If he is elected prime minister, he will not be able to visit certain countries for fear of being arrested. Neither has anyone settled accounts with him over his part in the IDF's unpreparedness for the last war. But even Mofaz is not as frightening as Netanyahu.  
Barak's current term as defense minister does not give us reason to fear him any less than Netanyahu: This was a period of disproportionate and unbridled killing in Gaza. This is the man who invented the false no-partner theory and smashed the remnants of the Israeli peace camp. And now he is even going back to using that rusty and criminal weapon - demolishing terrorists' homes - in the name of the Israeli labor and peace movement. Can everyone who was shocked by Netanyahu's cruel capitalism depend on Barak? Has anyone ever caught this social democrat improving the welfare of anyone who was not his neighbor in a luxury high-rise? And yet, even he is not as frightening as Netanyahu.  
And what about Livni? She is certainly not as fearsome as Netanyahu. But she, too, thinks that talks with Syria and the Palestinians are moving too fast. After 40 years of occupation and bloodshed, Olmert's turtle-like pace is too fast for his "moderate" foreign minister.  
That is the choice. That is the arsenal of candidates seeking to succeed Olmert. None speak in the name of any ideology whatsoever. A past prime minister who failed at his post and brought about the second intifada; a former chief of staff and defense minister, a cruel military man, who fanned the flames and knows only how to sow destruction and death; a mild-mannered foreign minister who has not advanced peace in any way; and Netanyahu - the person everyone loves to hate. No worse than his fellow candidates, but immeasurably more persecuted. The media embraces Livni, accepts Mofaz as legitimate, sometimes supports Barak, but is terrified only by Netanyahu. Why?

<title>No less dangerous than anti-Semitism</title>
<date>Wed Apr 30 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Of all the Western countries, it is those in Europe - and European public opinion even more so than those countries' leaders - that are the most critical of Israel's policies in the territories. Opinion polls conducted in Europe repeatedly point to Israel as one of the greatest dangers to world peace, and one of the greatest violators of human rights. In a survey of this kind carried out in July 2007, some 45% of Europeans compared Israel's policies in the territories to those of the apartheid regime in South Africa.  
Parallel to this, European countries have been prominent in the past decade in marking the Holocaust. They have dealt extensively with their own roles during the period of extermination and expressed regret over collaboration during the time of the extermination, or over the looting of Jewish property after that.  
This duality is so obvious that there are many Jews and Israelis who try to claim that the commemoration and the criticism are two sides of the same coin which tries to relieve Europe of the heavy cloak of guilt that covers it. On the one hand Europe admits to its past and asks for forgiveness, and on the other hand it attacks the Jewish state and in this way creates some kind of "moral balance" between it and that Europe, as if to say 'when you have the power it turns out that you are no better'. Many others regard the excessive criticism of Israel as some sort of anti-Semitism.  
But one fact spoils this theory: Israel is not alone in facing the arrows of European criticism, but rather stands alongside the United States. Uncle Sam is also constantly attacked by European public opinion for having aggressive policies; the clearest example of the past few years being, of course, the American invasion and control of Iraq.  
And indeed there is a common denominator to the European criticism of Israel and the U.S., and this common denominator apparently also stems from the lessons of that war. It is the phenomenon of European pacifism, the desire to avoid the use of any kind of force, to avoid any forceful confrontation even with evil regimes.   
This instinct is particularly salient when talking about a confrontation of a Western country with a society from the developing world, such as the confrontation between the U.S. and Iraq or between Israel and the Palestinians.  
That is because another European instinct then comes into play, one that also belongs to the history of their colonialist heritage. This instinct guides the Europeans to identify any conflict between the West and the developing world as a colonialist conflict in which one must identify with the underdog, the one who seems to be weak. In that context, Israel is indeed discriminated against by the criticism leveled at it; not necessarily because it is a Jewish state, but rather mainly because it is a Western state.  
That is to say, the European sin is not anti-Semitism but rather pacifism, especially when dealing with the Europeans' attitude toward force on the part of a Western country. But this is not a sin that is any less dangerous than anti-Semitism. It was precisely the Holocaust that proved how dangerous silent acceptance was, even if accompanied with the most lofty excuses of preventing war and bringing "peace in our time" in the face of the forces of evil threatening openly to gain control, ruin and destroy - such are also the forces of fundamentalist Islam of our day.   
World War II also proved that at the end of the day, this kind of policy is not effective - it merely raises to a great extent the price that will have to be paid in order to deal with the forces of evil when they grow even stronger. With the means of mass destruction existing today, who knows if it will not be too late.  
In this sense, there is apparently a deep connection between the Europeans' pacifism and the low birth rates on the continent; both of them indicate a policy of "eat and make merry because tomorrow we may die;" a deep lack of trust in life in the long run because the wish to live - which is not merely that of an individual but rather of the civilization in which he lives - does indeed demand victims.   
It requires the effort that is involved in raising children as well as the effort and the risk involved with waging a war on behalf of the values of freedom or on behalf of a national and sovereign existence so that these may be ensured for generations to come. This is true in Europe just as it is true in Israel.

<title>No need for the A-word </title>
<date>Fri Jul 25 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
In "Don't Call it Apartheid" (Haaretz English edition, July 17), Tova Herzl takes issue with the use of the word "apartheid" to describe the situation in Israel. In particular, she implies that the recent South African human rights delegation to Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank - of which I was a member - indeed came to such a conclusion. As a group, we did no such thing.  
Instead, we sought to move beyond mere labels and focus on the manner and extent to which Israel is separating Palestinians and Israelis within the West Bank, the impact of the tools of separation on Palestinians in particular and the broader impact of the occupation on all. And in so doing, it was often impossible to avoid making comparisons with apartheid South Africa.  
Whether motivated by legitimate security considerations, fear, mistrust or sheer prejudice, the occupation's physical manifestations - including distinct identity cards, number plates and roads, as well as checkpoints, electronic fences and concrete walls - result in a degree of separation far in excess of what was achieved in South Africa. This separation speaks for itself, whether or not one categorizes it as apartheid.  
As a human rights lawyer who believes in the rule of law, I was particularly troubled by the existence of two separate - and highly unequal - systems of law operating in the West Bank. To be fair, all conduct of the military commander is subject to review by the High Court of Justice. Yet jurisdiction in all other matters is personal, with Israeli settlers having access to a modern, rights-based legal system and Palestinians being subject to the authority of military courts.  
Under apartheid, the legal system was used as a central tool in enforcing an unequal system based solely on race. In the occupied West Bank, separate legal systems are integral to the differential treatment of persons based solely on nationality. It is one thing to apply Israeli law to all citizens and residents of Israel within its internationally recognized borders; it is quite another to apply that law to Israeli citizens who choose to settle unlawfully in occupied territory.  
Our deliberate focus on the occupation meant that we did not consider any particular "solution" to the conflict. As a group, we expressed no opinion on whether a future peace agreement should be based on a two-state solution, in accordance with international law; a single binational state; or some other hybrid or federal form. Instead, we agreed on the need for and the right of both Israelis and Palestinians to live in a democratic and secular state that enshrines civil, political and socio-economic rights for all who live within its boundaries.  
At no point did we seek to "delegitimize" Israel. Nor did we try to reduce the complexity of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to a single concept, recognizing that no one needs to make use of the A-word to draw attention to the horror of the occupation. In particular, we recognized that the apartheid analogy provides Israel's unquestioning supporters with a convenient diversion. Instead of engaging the substantive issues, such as the legality of the settlements and the route and effect of the separation barrier, Herzl regretfully homes in on the red herring.

<title>No need to wait for Russia or China </title>
<date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
The permanent members of the United Nations Security Council are currently talking with Germany about formulating a resolution on more sanctions against Iran. As in past years, the United States and the European Union do not see eye to eye with Russia and China, which are opposed to severe sanctions against Tehran.  
The reasons are obvious. President Vladimir Putin's Russia has returned to the Soviet policy of the past, under which America's friends are Russia's enemies and vice versa. Thus, Iran has become Russia's close friend. Furthermore, little help can be expected from China on this issue. Its dependence on Iran for energy is total and was greatly increased by its accelerated growth in the last decade. A few years ago, the two nations signed an agreement whereby China will pay Iran $75 billion to supply it with natural gas over the next 30 years - the largest such contract in history.  
We must ask ourselves whether there is any point in waiting for Sino-Russian consent, or whether the two countries should simply be overlooked on this issue. In my opinion, waiting would be unnecessary and ineffective, and would not achieve the hoped-for result, namely, making Iran abandon its military nuclear project.  
Iran's trade with Russia is negligible: only 2 percent of its total international trade. Therefore, Russia's participation in the sanctions will not step up economic pressure on Iran. On the other hand, China does not interfere in international disputes that do not affect it directly. China never has vetoed any Security Council resolutions that did not affect its interests. Furthermore, its dependence on Iran is greater.  
There is no point in waiting. The U.S. and the EU can reach a clear, unequivocal and immediately implementable decision. Since most of Iran's international trade is with the U.S. and the EU, the decision to impose severe sanctions will have a strong, hard impact. Iran is already feeling the pinch of economic pressure. Recent decisions by a number of American states, forbidding pension funds from investing in companies operating in or conducting business with Iran, already are having an effect. The same can be said for the recent decisions by European and American banks to cancel the credit lines of Iranian companies and international corporations that do business with or operate in Iran.  
These decisions, which exert an economic stranglehold, already have caused considerable agitation in the Iranian business community, many of whose members fear that the international sword is now resting on their neck. The Tehran government already has decided to transfer a large chunk of its deposits from dollars to gold, in preparation for tougher times ahead.  
Iran's economic hardships are beginning to become apparent. The decision to ration fuel - each private vehicle is limited to 100 liters per month - is one tangible result. While it has one of the world's largest oil reserves, Iran must refine its oil in foreign refineries. The rationing of fuel has sparked great bitterness, a wave of protests and acts of arson against hundreds of service stations. Furthermore, the recent student riots are worrying Tehran and underscoring a complex problem that its leaders are now facing. Undoubtedly, the sanctions are working. In my opinion, they are the best option.  
In posing a threat to Israel's very survival, Iran markedly differs from Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad or even Syria. Thus, Israel must do everything possible to prevent Iran from acquiring a military nuclear capability. Israel can, and must, prepare for every option. Nevertheless, the alternatives are clear. The military option is problematic, complex and fraught with dangers. Certainly, the report published by the American intelligence community has tied President George W. Bush's hands and seriously narrowed his prospects of ordering an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.  
The question is: What should Israel do? Israel attacked the Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak in 1981, but today's situation is very different - Iran has many more nuclear facilities than Iraq had at the time. Moreover, Iran is further from Israel than Iraq, and in order to reach Iran, Israeli fighter jets will have to fly over friendly neighboring countries, which in itself is a problem.  
This does not mean, however, that Israel should not make the necessary preparations for the military option. Israel should be ready for any possible scenario. Yet it must also realize that sanctions are a much better and more realistic option. Economic sanctions have an impact, and have caused regimes to capitulate. They worked on South Africa's apartheid regime and on Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi, and will soon force North Korea to radically change its policies.  
Global resoluteness and tightening sanctions against Tehran will force it to capitulate as well, and to abandon its ambitious program to develop a nuclear bomb.

<title>Our debt to Jimmy Carter </title>
<date>Tue Apr 15 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
The government of Israel is boycotting Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United States, during his visit here this week
The boycott will not be remembered as a glorious moment in this government's history. Jimmy Carter has dedicated his life to humanitarian missions, to peace, to promoting democratic elections, and to better understanding between enemies throughout the world. Recently, he was involved in organizing the democratic elections in Nepal, following which a government will be set up that will include Maoist guerrillas who have laid down their arms. But Israelis have not liked him since he wrote the book "Palestine: Peace not Apartheid."  
Israel is not ready for such comparisons, even though the situation begs it. It is doubtful whether it is possible to complain when an outside observer, especially a former U.S. president who is well versed in international affairs, sees in the system of separate roads for Jews and Arabs, the lack of freedom of movement, Israel's control over Palestinian lands and their confiscation, and especially the continued settlement activity, which contravenes all promises Israel made and signed, a matter that cannot be accepted. The interim political situation in the territories has crystallized into a kind of apartheid that has been ongoing for 40 years. In Europe there is talk of the establishment of a binational state in order to overcome this anomaly. In the peace agreement with Egypt, 30 years ago, Israel agreed to "full autonomy" for the occupied territories, not to settle there.  
These promises have been forgotten by Israel, but Carter remembers.  
Whether Carter's approach to conflict resolution is considered by the Israeli government as appropriate or defeatist, no one can take away from the former U.S. president his international standing, nor the fact that he brought Israel and Egypt to a signed peace that has since held. Carter's method, which says that it is necessary to talk with every one, has still not proven to be any less successful than the method that calls for boycotts and air strikes. In terms of results, at the end of the day, Carter beats out any of those who ostracize him. For the peace agreement with Egypt, he deserves the respect reserved for royalty for the rest of his life.

<title>Palestinian revenge was inevitable</title>
<date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Last week's bombing in Dimona was the first martyrdom operation committed by Hamas in more than five years. For some time, we have been warning the world that the relentless pressure on our people would eventually tell. In the last two months, more than a hundred people have been killed by the Israeli occupation forces in the Gaza Strip, including many civilians, women and children.  
Thirty people have died in the last month for lack of medical care brought on by the embargo. Only two weeks ago, we saw the appalling sight of over 40 women and children seriously injured when an Israeli F-16 dropped an enormous bomb in the middle of the densely populated Gaza City, a few meters from a wedding party. This kind of atrocity, piled onto the daily death toll, has finally tested the patience of Palestinians, and after lengthy restraint, revenge was inevitable.  
To many in Israel and the West, this act of resistance will be judged in isolation. They will no doubt say that it justifies the inhumane embargo on the people of Gaza and the arrests of more than 500 people and daily torture of innocents in the West Bank by both Israelis and the puppet government imposed on us by the U.S.  
What they seem to forget is that just in the last two years, 2,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action and thousands more injured. The cold-blooded fact is that the ratio of Palestinian deaths to Israelis is now over 40 to 1.  
The Hamas-led government has consistently called for a long-term cease-fire. For nine months before the election that brought us to power we observed a unilateral ceasefire, ensuring that no rockets were fired from Gaza by our movement. We observed this policy during the first six months in government, despite the fact that our words and actions were summarily dismissed by the Israelis and their U.S. allies.  
If the people of Sderot want to know why rockets continue to land around them, they should ask their own government why it has continually rejected our calls for a cease-fire and continued its policy of daily incursions and reckless targeting that put the whole population at risk.  
We have tried consistently to create some kind of reconciliation with Fatah. But every attempt has been ignored by Abu Mazen [Mahmoud Abbas]. The threat by Israel and the U.S. to cease negotiations if he cooperates with the lawfully elected Hamas government has led to political impotence in Ramallah. This makes our citizens deeply cynical about the peace process. It makes them feel that Israel is simply exploiting the situation and Abu Mazen.  
The cranes and bulldozers are still busy in the settlements on our land in the West Bank. Neither is there any sign that the numerous checkpoints that are crippling our economy and social life are being dismantled. While Abu Mazen and Olmert talk of a final agreement, the apartheid wall continues to be erected on land that should be part of any future Palestinian state.  
If our people can see no genuine and realistic political or economic horizon and their attempts to establish a genuine truce are consistently rejected, it is inevitable that they will turn to resistance as the only outlet for their anger and frustration. What happened at Rafah recently is a sign of what is likely to happen on a much larger scale if people can see no end to the relentless pressure and aggression that is part of our daily life here in Gaza.  
While in the past we acknowledged the right of Abu Mazen to negotiate on behalf of our people, we believe that he has forfeited this mandate, as he no longer commands the respect of the majority of our people. Given the facts on the ground and the total mistrust that now prevails on all sides, we believe neither Israelis nor Palestinians are ready for final-status negotiations. It would be disastrous if the international community were to try to impose this, especially while we remain divided as a Palestinian people.  
We have consistently suggested that the best solution to our problems is a long-term cease-fire that provides both sides with the space and opportunity to address our differences in an atmosphere of calmness and normality. We can have little optimism for the immediate future when it is impossible to see any clear light at the end of the tunnel that we are now forced to inhabit.

<title>Refreshing pocket of resistance </title>
<date>Fri May 30 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
The German Left Party, the successor to the East German Socialist Unity Party, which refused to recognize Israel between 1949 and 1989, is hardly a bastion of support for the Jewish state. Nothing more than "New Year's firecrackers" was the phrase invoked by Norman Paech, a parliament member from the Left Party, as well as its foreign policy spokesman, following his trip to the Palestinian territories in late April, to play down the danger of Hamas missiles that have been fired on Israeli cities since the evacuation of the Gaza Strip. Paech says "there is no anti-Semitism in the Mideast," and though he acknowledges the sentiment does exist in Germany, he argues that its cause is Israeli militarism. He has an affinity for employing Nazi terminology when describing Israel in the German media.  
Yet a refreshing pocket of resistance has formed within the Left Party, whose members seek a sharp break with the prevailing anti-Israeli posture characteristic of Germany's third-largest political party. The BAK Shalom Working Group (BAK is from the German word Bundesarbeitskreis, meaning "federal working group"), a pro-Israel group within the Left Party's young members federation, demanded Paech's immediate resignation from his position in an opinion piece published by the popular Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel earlier this month. Benjamin Kruger, a BAK Shalom spokesman, told me that Paech sees "Hamas as an ally of the Left Party," whereas BAK Shalom views it "as a terror organization." He added that the 60-member BAK Shalom, a caucus made up of students, young professionals and working people under 35, aims to advance a "platform against anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism, anti-Americanism and regressive capitalism."  
While BAK is attempting to dissolve prejudices against Israel in a bottom-up fashion, the co-chairman of the Left Party, Gregor Gysi, a dynamic political personality and gifted speaker, delivered a dense 16-page speech in mid-April to members of the Left Party-aligned Rosa Luxemburg Foundation at an event marking Israel's 60th anniversary. Declaring that, "anti-Zionism can no longer be a tenable position for the German left in general, nor for the Left Party," Gysi wiped more salt into the open wound of the anti-Israeli Left by asserting that Israel's existence ought to be defined by his party as part of Germany's "national interest."  
The reactions were predictably unsettling. "I consider it legitimate to be against Zionism. After all, it has apartheid-like characteristics," said Ulla Jelpke, a leading Left Party member of the Bundestag. Her former employer, the neo-Stalinist left daily junge Welt, whose coverage of Israel drips with hostility, wrote, "With his commitment to Zionism, Gregor Gysi overturned coordinated left-wing foreign policy." Responding to Jelpke, Sebastian Voigt, a co-founder of BAK, cited the contemporary relevance of the Austrian Jew Jean Amery's comment about the German Left in the late 1960s: "Anti-Zionism contains anti-Semitism like a cloud contains a storm."  
The origin of the shifting plate tectonics in the left can be traced to the Second Lebanon War in 2006. While the Left Party executive committee member Wolfgang Gehrcke placed himself in the front row of a demonstration with 2000 anti-Israel supporters in Berlin that August, in which such slogans as "No room for Israel" and "Hezbollah until victory" were ubiquitous, Katja Kipping, a 30-year-old Left Party member of parliament from the southern city of Dresden, issued a position paper castigating the anti-Zionism and so-called "anti-imperialism" of the party. Already then, Kipping called on the party to move "beyond its anti-Zionism."  
Kipping and BAK Shalom represent wings of the same nondogmatic leftist segment of the party that seeks to dismantle the Left Party myth that Israel's existence represents an outpost of American-style imperialism in the Middle East. Yet journalist and writer Tjark Kunstreich, a seasoned observer of leftist politics in Germany, told me that the pro-Israel position is still "marginal" within the Left Party. In fact, he criticized Gysi for failing to completely divorce the party from its anti-Zionism. Kunstreich said that even if "Israel is a fact" for Gysi, the Left Party leader still has not brought himself to say, "We view the Israel project as good."  
"We need a clear 'yes' to the recognition of the State of Israel," said the party's parliamentary secretary Dagmar Enkelmann. That the discussion revolves around accepting the State of Israel shows that the overwhelming majority of the Left Party's rank-and-file and leadership is still stuck in the Middle Ages. Nevertheless, Ilan Mor, the charge d'affaires at Israel's Berlin Embassy, says that such pro-Israel voices as BAK and Kipping's are welcome. Mor participated in a panel discussion with BAK members celebrating Israel's 60th anniversary in early May.  
According to a late-March poll, the Left Party has the support of 13 percent of German voters, and, following its string of local state election victories in Hamburg, Lower Saxony and Hesse this year, it is a force that must be reckoned with. As a result of those victories, the Left Party added 3,000 new members, and now has a card-carrying membership base of 73,455 (compared to some 530,000 each for both the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats). The strength of the Left Party in regions of Eastern Germany has contributed to the coalition governments in such federal states as Berlin, where the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Left co-govern.  
It's still too early to tell whether the Left's apparent softening toward Israel is the sign of a permanent change. At the Party's convention last weekend, neither a resolution nor a discussion to abandon its anti-Israeli platform was on the Party's agenda. Kunstreich analyzed the conference as a "defeat" for the pro-Israel strand within the Left Party because there was "no sign" that the membership "shares the position" of BAK. The Left Party reinforced its opposition to sending German troops to Afghanistan, and its reelected co-chairman, Oskar Lafontaine, a former chairman of the SPD before he defected to the Left Party, continues to flirt with the mullah regime in Iran. He has not spoken out against the possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran, and it was only internal party pressure that forced him to cancel a visit with Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Iran in 2006 because his presence would have coincided with the Iranian Holocaust-denial conference, thus sidestepping a public relations debacle for the Left Party. A plan to introduce a motion at the party convention to condemn the "serious human rights violations" in Iran, and "tie the economic relationship with an improved human rights situation" did not get off the ground.  
The disturbingly warm relations between their party and the Islamic regime is an overriding priority for BAK Shalom. "The discussion of these issues has begun. BAK Shalom will do everything to accelerate it. Developments in the Left Party should be exciting," wrote co-founder Voigt in the Tagesspiegel piece this month.

<title>Spotlight on the lesser evil </title>
<date>Sun Aug 03 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>

The Olmert affair has come and all but gone. A few more invoices here and some daggers there will be hurled at the hemorrhaging political corpse hanging in the town square, and Ehud Olmert will disappear into the sunset. A hedonistic, spendthrift prime minister, a relatively small-time, corrupt man who, like many others, did not know where to the draw the line between public and private money and who - like many of his colleagues in the upper crust of government - thought that a politician deserves everything, is going home. Olmert and his transgressions will be remembered as a footnote in history.  
Contrary to the typically passionate claims of a few self-styled protectors of the law, Olmert's conduct did not for one second endanger the rule of law in Israel; it did not threaten its form of government, nor did it undermine the state's foundations. Far more serious acts of corruption have been committed. Much greater dangers stalk and ultimately threaten the rule of law, and our democracy is fissured and fragile due to other phenomena. It isn't the Rishon Tours affair, nor the house on Cremieux Street, nor the Talanskys of this world, nor the cronyism and patronage in the Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry that shape the state's character. On the contrary, the manner in which the relevant instruments of power sprang into action and launched an all-out offensive clearly proves that when it comes to minor corruptible violations, the rule of law is in relatively good shape. The danger we are faced with stems from other, incalculably graver circumstances. Nobody has taken it upon himself to wage a war against these circumstances, because this war demands much more courage.  
Like the "investigative journalism" programs we see on television, the self-righteous preoccupy themselves with trifle matters. How great it must be to make a name for yourself as a pursuer of justice as you shine the spotlight of your "investigation" onto a rabbi who got a little too frisky or the mechanic who overcharges his customer. This is a war that is universally satisfying to all sides. After all, who wants to tolerate an adulterous rabbi, a swindling mechanic, or a thief for a prime minister?  
It goes without saying that such characters are worthy of ostracism, yet these battles are confined to the tiny space illuminated by a flashlight instead of the larger front where the greatest danger awaits. Olmert failed the Kolbotek (a popular consumer affairs TV show) litmus test, and he deserves to be punished accordingly, but the saintly image of the hell-bent seekers of justice that has been affixed to those who have brought him down is exaggerated, if not ridiculous.  
Olmert's predecessor was suspected of far more serious crimes. Ariel Sharon and his sons allegedly laid their hands on sums of money that far exceed what has been attributed to Olmert, but Sharon exited the stage of history as a beloved, admired leader, a likeable grandfather figure who tended to his herd and did not harm a soul. A war against Sharon's corruption was a far more difficult proposition because Sharon cut a strong, threatening figure, and he was cherished. He was also responsible for the disengagement, which for some reason was portrayed by some as a step toward peace - perhaps that was the reason why the criminal investigations against him were buried. Those who closed the investigations without indictments and forgave Sharon are also those who are now bitterly ensconced in all-out war against his successor, who is cleaner and weaker by comparison.  
But the danger lurking around the corner emanates from a different direction. The law enforcement agencies, the police, the prosecutors and the courts - those we blindly admire - have for some time now ceased to operate as a system of justice with equal rights for all. Rich and poor, Jew and Arab do not receive the same treatment. Can anyone seriously claim that a wealthy individual armed with a phalanx of high-priced lawyers is consigned to the same legal fate as that of "Buzaglo," the average Israeli? Would a Jewish child who hurled a rock at a car receive the same punishment as an Arab child who did the same? Do the Israel Defense Forces and the police investigate settler crimes against Palestinians with the same sense of urgency? Is it a coincidence that the trigger fingers of Israel's police officers become itchier time and again whenever their weapons are pointed in the direction of Arab lawbreakers?  
Israel's legal system has already laid the groundwork for the legitimization of an apartheid regime. This is the real danger to the rule of law: The quasi automatic enlistment of the justice system by the defense establishment endangers the rule of law more than all this Olmertism. The IDF's ignoring of High Court rulings, much like the ban on the use of the "neighbor procedure" (soldiers using Palestinian civilians as human shields when arresting militants); the fact that the Shin Bet security service continues to torture suspects in contravention of a High Court ruling; and the failure to implement the court-ordered change to the route of the separation fence should have sent alarm bells ringing among the guardians of justice.  
When settlers continue to rampage against Palestinians - not nearly a day goes by without a pogrom and there is no place where armed militias don't roam around, yet nobody investigates these acts nor is anyone tried in court - this threatens the state's character much more than all of Olmert's cash-stuffed envelopes. The situation in the southern Hebron Hills, for example, which for a while now has become abandoned territory, endangers the rule of law far more than all of Olmert's investigations.  
In light of all of this, the self-styled knights of justice remain silent, cover their eyes, neither seeing nor hearing. Most importantly, they do not confront these ills. True, it is difficult to do so. It is likely to arouse fierce resistance. So, as a result, they plunge their swords into convenient places, which are safe and which everyone agrees on. They are no Emile Zolas. Rather, just miniature Rafi Ginats.

<title>Stay away from Durban II </title>
<date>Thu Dec 18 22:27:17 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Navanethem Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, is secretary-general of the UN's World Conference Against Racism, scheduled for April, in Geneva. Referred to as "Durban II," the meeting is meant as a follow-up to the infamous 2001 "Durban I" UN racism conference in South Africa. After her appointment, Pillay, a Durban native, was asked by the city's mayor "to rescue" the town's name. Aware that her human-rights credentials are tied to the success of the conference, Pillay has made it a top priority. She used her maiden speech at September's session of the Human Rights Council to champion a revisionist history of Durban I, and her latest effort to promote the upcoming event appeared in Haaretz this week ("The Anti-Racism Debate," December 16).  
Although Pillay was writing ostensibly for Israelis, she knows their foreign minister has already declared that Israel will not attend the conference; her real target was thus President-elect Barack Obama. The outgoing administration has not made a decision regarding U.S. participation, which means Obama and Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton have it in their power to discredit the meeting by staying away. But pressure to attend, from Pillay and others, is mounting.  
Pillay argues that attendance is appropriate because of what occurred at Durban I. She is right to focus on this. After all, the first objective of Durban II, as organizers determined last year, is "to foster the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Program of Action." That declaration, adopted by governmental delegates at the end of Durban I, asserts that Palestinians are victims of Israeli racism. This is the only country-specific accusation in a document purporting to address international racism and xenophobia. Regardless of the quantity of new vitriol in Durban II's final product, therefore, participation would necessarily legitimize a global event dedicated to "implementing" the mantra of Israeli racism.  
Pillay attempts to allay fears with a revisionist account of Durban I, writing that, "the controversy that tainted the 2001 Durban Conference ... was caused by the anti-Semitic behavior of some non-governmental organizations at the sidelines of the conference." She says she is committed to the proposition that "the concerns ... that the review conference will become a platform for denigrating Israel must be assuaged." She then adds: "Seven years ago, states did so by elevating the conference's outcome above the hatred and hostility that took place on its periphery."  
Pillay's tale is patently false. At meetings of the governmental drafting committee at Durban I, I watched as virtually every clause on anti-Semitism was deleted. And how did participating states "elevate" the outcome, after the U.S. and Israel made their opposition plain? The European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference cut a deal: Mention of anti-Semitism and the Holocaust could stay in - but with a condemnation of Israeli racism.  
For decades, the UN has tried to label Israel as  racist, to tie it to the mast of apartheid South Africa, and to sink it with the same moral indignation, and economic and political isolation. In 1975, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution equating Zionism with racism. When the resolution was rescinded in 1991, a plan to resurrect it began almost immediately. Act II culminated in Durban I; Act III is upon us. The so-called draft outcome document for Durban II accuses Israel of committing "a new kind of apartheid, a crime against humanity, [and] a form of genocide."  
Pillay's op-ed provides a clear window onto the Durban tactic. She fawns over the Durban declaration's statement that, "the Holocaust must never be forgotten," and its expression of "deep concern about the rise in anti-Semitism." Then she proceeds to ignore the demonization of racist Israel and its connection to anti-Semitism and the murdering of Jews here and now.  
Two weeks ago, General Assembly president Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann made a similar pitch for rupturing the bond between Jews and Israel, declaring, "I have a great love for the Jewish people and this has been true all my life. I have never hesitated to condemn the crimes of the Holocaust ...." He then accused Israel of "apartheid," which "must be outlawed," advocating a "campaign of boycott, divestment and sanctions to pressure Israel."  
By contrast, the Durban II draft doesn't mention Sudan, and the final version will be no different. On December 9, Pillay reminded a reporter that the High Commissioner's office had "set up [a] commission of inquiry, but did not find a Sudanese genocidal policy, but rather 'genocidal intent' committed by a few individuals." That commission maintained that the past decade's atrocities in Darfur did not constitute an ethnic or racially driven conflict, even though it was perpetrated by Arab militias against African tribal victims. Hundreds of thousands raped and murdered, 2.5 million displaced. But no genocide.  
Ultimately, Pillay asks readers precisely the right question: "States have a responsibility to show leadership against racial discrimination and intolerance. What message does a state boycott send to those who are suffering from racism ... [and] to those who perpetuate racism?"  
The answer: A boycott of Durban II sends a message that the real victims of racism are not alone. A boycott denies legitimacy to a platform for hatemongers and a cover for human-rights abusers. For states to show leadership against racism and intolerance, they must join Canada and Israel and stay away.

<title>The anti-racism debate </title>
<date>Tue Dec 16 01:58:27 IST 2008</date>
<content>
I grew up in Durban, South Africa, under a system of apartheid that institutionalized racial discrimination, denying equal rights of citizenship to all those who were not white. I later sat as a judge on the Rwanda Tribunal, where I came to know in painful detail, killing by killing, the unimaginable destruction of humanity when ethnic hatred explodes into genocide. I know that the consequences of allowing discrimination, inequality and intolerance to fester and spiral out of control can be genocidal. But South Africa's experience shows that with political will and a commitment to act, discrimination, inequality and intolerance can be overcome. We have just witnessed the election of the first African-American president of the United States, a country where racial segregation is as vivid a memory for some as it is for me.  
States will have an opportunity to demonstrate their determination to fight intolerance by moving the anti-racism agenda forward when, in April 2009, an international review conference meets in Geneva. The conference will evaluate the implementation of government commitments to eradicate racial hatred and discrimination, made seven years ago in Durban. It is imperative that all states participate and contribute to this crucial process in order to consolidate and improve the common ground on those fundamental human rights issues we all agree on.  
Regrettably, last January, Canada announced its intention to withdraw from the Durban review conference. And this month, so did Israel.  
Behind these decisions stands the controversy that tainted the 2001 Durban Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, and that was caused by the anti-Semitic behavior of some non-governmental organizations at the sidelines of the conference. Yet the document that emerged from the conference itself, the Durban Declaration and Program of Action (DDPA), transcended divisive and intolerant approaches.  
The DDPA offers a comprehensive global framework that calls for the adoption of more effective anti-discrimination laws and policies. It highlights discrimination against minorities, migrants and indigenous people, and it empowers civil society to demand accountability for actions committed or omitted by strengthening victims' grounds for recourse.  
The DDPA clearly states that: "The Holocaust must never be forgotten." It calls for an end to violence in the Middle East and recognizes Israel's right to security. It urges Israelis and Palestinians to resume the peace process and expresses deep concern about the rise in anti-Semitism around the world, as well as alarm over mounting prejudice related to religious beliefs, including Islamophobia.  
In April 2009, at the Durban review conference, states are expected to provide an assessment of achievements and gaps in the implementation of the commitments made in 2001, as well as identify concrete ways to improve performance and impact on the ground. The review is also meant to share and take ownership of good practices in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. It is an important opportunity to renew global commitment to our common goals and revitalize efforts to move toward these goals. All too often national policies and practices lag behind states' pledges. Yet progress in combating racism and intolerance is sorely needed in every region of the world.  
The Durban review conference is a timely opportunity to reaffirm the principles of non-discrimination and to build on the Durban Declaration and Program of Action. It is for states to ensure that this objective is met and implementation gaps are closed. If all states are not engaged in the process, this goal may remain elusive. Thus, the concerns expressed by Canada and Israel that the review conference will become a platform for denigrating Israel must be assuaged. Seven years ago, states did so by elevating the conference's outcome above the hatred and hostility that took place on its periphery, and by reaching a broad agreement on the necessary measures to combat racism and intolerance. They must achieve that commonality of purpose again through active engagement rather than withdrawal.  
We owe a frank debate and concrete action to the victims of discrimination, intolerance and racism. We can avoid or overcome friction by focusing on how to give new momentum to the struggle against these unconscionable practices. States have a responsibility to show leadership against racial discrimination and intolerance. What message does a state boycott send to those who are suffering from racism? What message does it send to those who perpetuate racism? This struggle concerns all of us in our increasingly multi-cultural and multi-ethnic societies.  
Navanethem Pillay is the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.

<title>The death of the right</title>
<date>Sun Oct 05 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
With neither sorrow nor grief it may be announced: The Israeli right is dead. After long and difficult death throes it has finally and laudably come to its end. The mercy killing was administered by one of its senior sons and princes, Ehud Olmert, but the prime minister's belated courageous statements on the eve of Rosh Hashanah were not needed to know that nothing remains of the right's doctrine.  
The right's new political doctrine was born in sin, the sin of arrogance, of messianism, of militarism and nationalism of the Six-Day War, so its death was predictable. Revisionism, the minority view, became annexationism, the majority view, and the right managed by trickery and sleight of hand to deceive a whole country for a generation, irreparably damaging the cause of peace. Now the celebrations are over and the curtain is coming down. Not only Olmert must repent of his sin, as he has done - an entire country must stand up and say aloud: Oops, we were wrong.  
The radical left, in whose voice the prime minister now speaks, was correct and predicted the truth. To most of the public it has become clear that no peace will be attained that is not based on the outlines sketched in an ad placed by the Matzpen movement in September 1967. That is how far we have come. But in Israeli society's ideological vacuum, the death of the right does not herald the flourishing of the left. It, too, expired a long time ago.  
One after another, the arguments of the right have collapsed, leaving not one stone of its teachings upon another. All the solutions it proposed over the years were found to be mirages that dissipated long ago. It began with messianic and biblical explanations about the sanctity of the land and our right to all of it. That was and still is the reasoning of that minority detached from reality. No rational person today can seriously argue that sanctity means the right to sovereignty. The tomb of Rabbi Nahman in Uman is sacred - so what? And Jerusalem is sacred to Christians - so what?  
Reasons of "security" have managed to fool more people. Based on these reasons, control of the territories is a guarantee of security. This foolishness was also proven groundless a long time ago. Technological developments have made it clear to the public that Tel Aviv can be bombed from Baghdad, that there is no security significance in living on the tops of the mountains and the slopes of the Jordan Valley, and there is nothing like living in Yitzhar to endanger the future of the entire country.  
Later came the withdrawal from Sinai to prove that territory can be a security burden, and certainly no guarantee of anything, and that peace ensures security more than any territory. The greatest danger to security in our history ambushed us, of all times, when we controlled Sinai: in 1973. In contrast, no years were as secure - on the Egyptian front - as the years of peace, without Sinai and even without Sharm el-Sheikh.  
All the solutions proposed by the right were found to be hollow: First Menachem Begin's and Yitzhak Shamir's futile idea that immigration would ensure a demographic majority, then the idea of expelling the Palestinians - Rehavam Ze'evi's "voluntary" transfer and Meir Kahane's involuntary transfer. "Autonomy," "functional compromise," and the "Jordanian option" were all found to be crazy ideas that have rested in peace. No one is even talking about annexation anymore. Try asking people on the right what they predict, according to their own logic, will really happen 20 years from now and they will not be able to respond. They will mumble a few murky slogans and fall silent.  
I have never heard a clear answer to this question except "industrial parks," Benjamin Netanyahu's latest craze, which was previously Shimon Peres' idea. And what will happen when the first bomb goes off in them? They will close down, like all their predecessors. But back to the main issue, what will really happen in another 20 years when there will be close to a majority of Palestinians between the river and the sea? The right has no answer. Two states? No! One state? No! What then? A continuation of the apartheid.  
What are we left with? With a land slashed by a wall, 10,000 settlements on every hilltop, fear campaigns and the sowing of hatred, and one solution: do nothing. Time has worked, does work and will work in our favor. Meanwhile, Hamas has risen and Arafat fell, today Hamas tomorrow Al-Qaida, yesterday Jordan today Iran, yesterday stones today Qassams and tomorrow dirty bombs. The left's ideas are now expounded by the majority; after all, everyone knows that it is either two states or we are finished, as the prime minister says, but meanwhile everyone also agrees that it is better to do nothing. "The time is not yet ripe" - until that option also comes to an end, until we all come to an end.

<title>The ever-rising price </title>
<date>Thu Jul 10 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
The cost of the existence of the Jewish nation-state as an occupier is constantly on the rise. In an article published here two weeks ago, Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken took the bull by the horns: Israel is on the way to apartheid.  
Indeed, the "temporary" changes in the Citizenship Law from 2003, followed by attempts by Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann to remove the new legislation from judicial oversight, are another phase in the desperate search for ways to build a wall between people as a substitute for an international border. If such a border had existed between Israel and the state of Palestine, it is reasonable to assume that the number of marriages between Israeli citizens and foreigners would be very limited, and the idea of special legislation for Arab Israelis would not have even come up. This is only one more aspect of the damage caused by our inability to put an end to the occupation.  
In fact, like other national movements, Zionism had a great deal of difficulty assimilating universal values except those like self-determination, which were in keeping with national claims. Zionist socialism was the first victim of national particularism. As long as the occupation of the land was ongoing, up to the victory in the War of Independence, the price may have been inevitable. However, it very quickly emerged that socialism had been dealt a mortal blow. The habits, concepts and principles that had been shaped during the days of the the pre-state Jewish community were too strong to change after the establishment of the state. Nevertheless, in other areas, especially at the beginning of the post-Ben-Gurion period, great progress was made, as attested among other things by the abrogation of the military government in 1965.  
The Six Day War took Israel back an entire generation. It has now become clear that colonial rule encourages the mixture of populations, and occupation requires seeking destructive solutions in terms of human rights. We should not delude ourselves: A democracy of lords will not last long. If we consciously create second-class citizens, if we anchor discrimination in a law armed against the intervention of the Supreme Court - the only gatekeeper of our liberty - we necessarily undermine the foundations of democracy. Universal rights are the heart and soul of a democracy; the moment these are denied to some segments of the population, they will eventually wither away for everyone.  
The worst thing of all is anchoring discrimination in law: then it becomes the norm, and society becomes accustomed to it. People will be able to sleep peacefully then, too. After all, the Knesset has spoken, and this is a country of law and the rule of law. Anyone who would turn to international courts would be considered a traitor, because after all, everyone persecutes the Jews. If the International Court in The Hague finds that the laws of the land do not conform to the rules of justice, and it notes that some norms, when trampled, call for those who trample them to be removed from the family of nations, its judges will be considered anti-Semites.  
It should be noted that barbaric laws existed not only in the worst dictatorships known in the 20th century, but also in the democratic United States. Less than 50 years ago, cruel racial oppression prevailed in the southern United States. Thus it is not enough for a law to pass in the Knesset for it to be worthy of a free society: Its content must meet the test of universal norms.  
No other people in the world should know this better than the Jews. Their expulsion and destruction were made possible because first of all it was declared that universal norms - thanks to whose victory in the French Revolution the Jews were liberated - endangered the nation. Subsequently special laws for various populations replaced them, and at the end of the process the Jews ceased being considered human beings. Special laws for Jews, known as race laws, were enacted in the 20th century in the three largest countries in Western Europe, which shows that everyone is capable of everything.  
The Citizenship Law discriminates against a certain category of citizens and it is therefore illegitimate. In this case the practical, reasonable solution is an international border. Even then, not all the problems will be solved; far from it. But a conflict between countries is always less severe than a conflict between sects or ethnic groups.  
Moreover, the more one looks at the reality emerging here, the deeper the awareness that if an end is not put to the occupation, the occupation will put an end to the Jewish state. If territories are not evacuated, it will be the settlements that at the end of the day will establish a common political framework for everyone living between the Jordan and the Mediterranean, thus creating a multi-national, multi-cultural, androgynous entity, turning Zionism into a passing episode.

<title>The sin of haughtiness </title>
<date>Fri Sep 05 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Along the timeline, 15 years minus one week since the signing of the Oslo Accords on the lawn of Bill Clinton's White House, it seems the prime minister is right. We have never been so close to peace with the Palestinians. It's enough to mention that 13 years ago minus one month, during the most sensitive days of the Oslo process, then Jerusalem mayor Ehud Olmert convinced the Republican candidate for the U.S. presidency, Senator Bob Dole, to introduce a bill to move the U.S. embassy to Israel's "undivided" capital.   
Today that very same Olmert is proposing that Jerusalem be divided and the Arab neighborhoods be transferred to Palestine. Nevertheless, if there is no basic change in the concepts held by the adults responsible for the negotiations, the Israeli and Palestinian children who learned this week how to read "Shalom, Kita Aleph" will meet each other in 12 years on the battlefield, in a binational state or in an apartheid regime.  
Measured on a yardstick, Israel has gone a long way to meet the Palestinians. However, the negotiations on the "shelf agreement" are being held on parallel yardsticks.   
The distance between them has been reduced, but as we all know, parallel lines never meet. When those conducting the negotiations cannot agree on a starting point, there is no chance they will find a meeting point.   
From Olmert's point of view, and more so from Tzipi Livni's, the conflict began in 1967. The concessions therefore have to refer to the border that divided Israel from the territories until the Six-Day War.   
That is why an agreement giving 93 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians, along with compensation in the form of a few percentage points of Israel's sovereign territory is a generous offer second to none. A real "Ben-Gurion-like decision."  
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) opened negotiations with Olmert at the point Yasser Arafat had been in negotiations with Ehud Barak. Their point of departure was the Nakba - the expulsion of the Palestinians from their lands in 1947 and 1948.   
From their point of view, their first "Ben-Gurion-like decision" was taken in December 1988 with the decision by the Palestinian National Council.   
At that time, the Palestine Liberation Organization exchanged the armed struggle of liberating 78 percent of the territory of Mandatory Palestine for the political struggle of establishing an independent state on the lands Israel occupied in 1967 (22 percent).   
Their second "Ben-Gurion-like decision" was made in March 2002 when Arafat adopted the Arab peace initiative including the paragraph that requires Israel's agreement to any solution on the refugee problem.  
Israel invented the term "settlement blocs" and blew it up to monstrous proportions, whether the international community was prepared to agree or not.   
Now the Israelis are demanding that the Palestinians concede these areas and agree that the blocs cut up their minuscule state.   
From their point of view, every dunam they give up to Israel in the West Bank and Jerusalem is a concession on an already meager share. It is worth recalling that when Benjamin Netanyahu was prime minister, he argued over the scope of the withdrawal from the territories despite the second Oslo agreement, and he repeatedly said that every percentage point was equivalent to the size of Tel Aviv.  
The phenomenon of parallel lines is especially salient when referring to the negotiations on Jerusalem. The argument in Israel over the division of Jerusalem on the basis of ethnic and national lines creates the impression that Olmert (as well as Barak) is prepared to commit suicide.   
The obvious conclusion is, supposedly, that it would be fitting for the Palestinians to compensate Israel with a substantive concession; for example, on the issue of sovereignty over the Temple Mount.   
From the Palestinians' point of view, the Israelis already had a substantive concession in their pockets before the Camp David II talks began. At that stage, Arafat agreed (in return for a suitable territorial exchange) to leave the Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty.   
The demand now to give up sovereignty over the Temple Mount is identical in their eyes to a demand by Israel to put the Western Wall under the control of the Muslim Waqf.  
Olmert expects everyone, including the Palestinians, to be moved by the giant leap he has taken from the "two banks to the Jordan" camp to renouncing "most of Judea and Samaria."   
He is repeating the sins of haughtiness and lack of empathy for the needs of the neighbor that tripped up Barak and contributed to the disaster of 2000's Black September. Until the Israeli leadership frees itself of the bug of the parallel lines, we will continue to transfer the conflict from generation to generation and convince ourselves that we have no partner.

<title>Yes, it is apartheid </title>
<date>Fri Apr 25 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
The anchorwoman was clearly shocked: I don't have time now to respond to what you have said, she told the former U.S. president, allowing Jimmy Carter to make a narrow escape from her clutches. Then she added that she did not want to imagine what would happen to him if he bumped into her colleague from the security affairs desk in Channel 2's dark alley. And the pundit sitting there, sunk in deep thought as always, nodded his heavy head, confirming: He's lucky, the bastard, that we didn't gang up on him and cut him to shreds.  
That's how it is here: The rulers set the tone, and the media begins to gripe: Not only did Carter's mission not help, it did damage. He alone was the reason Gilad Shalit was not ransomed out of captivity during the holiday. That's what happens when an enemy of the human race, the twin of the Twin Towers' bin Laden, sticks his nose where it does not belong.  
Let's let old Carter be, so he may let sleeping warriors lie; he will not be back. The contents of his words, however, should not be ignored. "Apartheid," he said, "apartheid" - a dark, scary word coined by Afrikaners and meaning segregation, racial segregation.  
What does he want from us, that evil man: What do we have to do with apartheid? Does a separation fence constitute separation? Do separate roads for Jewish settlers and Palestinians really separate? Are Palestinian enclaves between Jewish settlements Bantustans?  
There is no hint of similarity between South Africa and Israel, and only a sick mind could draw such shadowy connections between them. Roadblocks and inspections at every turn; licenses and permits for every little matter; the arbitrary seizure of land; special privileges in water use; cheap, hard labor; forming and uniting families by bureaucratic whim - none of these are apartheid, in any way. They are an incontrovertible security necessity, period.  
The white Afrikaners, too, had reasons for their segregation policy; they, too, felt threatened - a great evil was at their door, and they were frightened, out to defend themselves. Unfortunately, however, all good reasons for apartheid are bad reasons; apartheid always has a reason, and it never has a justification. And what acts like apartheid, is run like apartheid and harasses like apartheid, is not a duck - it is apartheid. Nor does it even solve the problem of fear: Today, everyone knows that all apartheid will inevitably reach its sorry end.  
One essential difference remains between South Africa and Israel: There a small minority dominated a large majority, and here we have almost a tie. But the tiebreaker is already darkening on the horizon. Then the Zionist project will come to an end if we don't choose to leave the slave house before being visited by a fatal demographic plague.  
It is entirely clear why the word apartheid terrifies us so. What should frighten us, however, is not the description of reality, but reality itself. Even Ehud Olmert has understood at last that continuing the present situation is the end of the Jewish democratic state, as he recently said.  
The Palestinians are unfortunate because they have not produced a Nelson Mandela; the Israelis are unfortunate because they have not produced an F.W. de Klerk.

<title>Abbas must unilaterally declare Palestinian state</title>
<date>Fri Nov 13 01:45:09 IST 2009</date>
<content>
It is precisely now that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas must not give up hope, and not because of the sweet nothings that Shimon Peres uttered at the rally in the square last Saturday night about people giving up hope in Ramallah. As if at the President's Residence every day is Carnaval, and not only when he's packing his bags for his trip to Brazil.  
Abbas was right when he decided to announce he would soon resign: It is impossible to hold negotiations "without prior conditions" while settlement is going on. For 42 years Israel has been scattering prior conditions and faits accomplis all over, marking them with red tile roofs and making the peace process into nothing more than a never-ending process.  
But before Abu Mazen quits, he has just one more job to do: He must declare, unilaterally, the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Palestine now.  
Both sides have a right to act unilaterally. Abbas owes it to his people, to himself, and to us. This week, there were reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finds this possibility very scary, and he expects the Americans to nip it in the bud. But his nightmare is our only chance for an end to the occupation in our time.  
When he declares independence, Abbas should call upon the Jews living in the state of Palestine to preserve the peace and to do their part in building up the new country as full and equal citizens, enjoying fair representation in all of its institutions. David Ben-Gurion would not have been upset by such a pretty act of plagiarism from his Declaration of Independence.  
And thus, Abbas will become the Palestinian Ben-Gurion. Conditions were no less foggy and circumstances were no more certain when Ben-Gurion declared independence in 1948. But our founding father took the risk, and we are fortunate that he did.  
The risk Abbas would be taking is much smaller. Of the 192 member states of the United Nations, over 150 would recognize a free Palestine, and it would soon become the 193rd. Although the American position is an unknown, it is hard to believe that Barack Obama would agree to drag America back into isolation now that it has begun to be part of the world again.  
And what would Netanyahu do? Invade and re-conquer the West Bank? Restore the military government in the Muqata in Ramallah?  
And what orders will Ehud Barak give his army? Serbia didn't dare invade Kosovo after it declared independence, and even Russia the great didn't allow itself to remain inside the sovereign territory of Georgia after their war.  
Immediately after the declaration, celebrations will begin in the capital, East Jerusalem, and people from all over the world will join in, including Israelis. The masses of the House of Ishmael will carouse joyously through the city's neighborhoods, and especially those neighborhoods from which they have been evicted by people with priestly pretensions. This will have to be joy without any manifestations of violence, not even one stone thrown.  
This week, I phoned Abbas, after not having spoken to him for at least four years. I told him everything that I am writing now. I also told him something else: What happened to the wall in Berlin 20 years ago, and to apartheid a few months later, would also happen to the occupation: It will collapse, even if attempts are made to reinforce it with nails.

<title>A modest proposal </title>
<date>Thu Sep 03 01:23:11 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Like the president of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Prof. Rivka Carmi, I too believe the demand that Dr. Neve Gordon resign as head of the university's Department of Politics and Government is a legitimate and even modest demand, given the financial damage the university will sustain if he fails to do so. Accordingly, it is up to Gordon, who desires what is best for his institution, to comply with the demand forthwith.  
Carmi's appeal to her faculty colleagues reveals that the economic crisis has dealt the university a severe blow: Donations are dwindling, and its financial situation has never been this bad. Gordon's call for a boycott of Israel, as published in his op-ed piece in the Los Angeles Times - a newspaper with a wide circulation, "particularly among Jews," - could, in Carmi's words, cause devastating harm: "Without these donations, we have no life, and certainly no development and progress," she wrote. What is being demanded of Gordon is therefore a modest sacrifice, a small bone to be tossed to the donors.  
Thus the many faculty members from all of the universities in this country who have urged Carmi "to declare that she regrets her initial reaction and that she encourages political activity by lecturers from all shades of the political spectrum," will presumably reconsider their position in view of the high price, in hard cash, that freedom of expression exacts.  
By her own account, Carmi has received an unprecedented flow of angry e-mails and phone calls from Jewish donors in Israel and abroad. There can be no doubt that faculty members understand the significance of this.  
It is also reasonable to assume that the faculty members who elected Gordon to his post, and who want him to remain there, will understand the motive behind the demand that he resign, even though thousands of messages of support for Gordon have also reached Carmi - an indication of the tremendous harm her response is causing the university.  
For example, Prof. David Ingleby, who is involved in the European Union's research initiatives, has written Carmi that Israel's preferential status in these projects could be harmed because of the contempt BGU is showing for academia's traditional commitment to democratic traditions.  
And Prof. Virginia H. Aksan, president of the Middle Eastern Studies Association of North America, which has a membership of over 3,000 scholars, has demanded that Carmi withdraw the threat to Gordon's position and protect freedom of expression.  
But one can understand Carmi. There is not as much money behind the above arguments as there is behind the donors' demands. Also sure to understand are those students who have written Carmi that "we are taught history, but we are forbidden to learn from it. In gender studies, we are taught to identify violent discourse, but we are expected to go on speaking the routine and familiar militaristic language. We are taught to be social workers, but not to identify with exploited cleaning workers. Learning is allowed, but not drawing practical conclusions - especially not in a newspaper, in English, with a large circulation."  
These students will certainly ultimately realize that the existence of research universities in Israel depends on those who have money to give them, and thereby also the ability to dictate the subjects of research and the limits of freedom of thought and expression.  
Students, you are our future, and I have a modest proposal for you: Stay in the ivory tower. Try not to see reality as it is. And certainly do not describe it with pejorative words like "apartheid" or try to change it. Try to understand, in practical terms, what is worth studying and what you are better off not publishing, since your future depends mainly on the degree of flexibility you can display and on your ability to toe the line. Above all, you must remember that to adapt is to survive. See the Carmi case.  
The writer is a professor at Tel Aviv University.

<title>  Bibi needs Tzipi </title>
<date>Wed Jul 01 02:07:20 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
The dispute with the United States over the settlement freeze is a futile controversy serving only one purpose: to bolster the status of the administration of President Barack Obama as an honest broker in the eyes of the Palestinians and the Arab states, in contrast to that of his predecessor, which was seen in Ramallah, Cairo and Riyadh as serving Israel. Obama wants to show that he can bend Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. That is not necessarily bad for Netanyahu. Every minute spent on unnecessary discussions on the future of unfinished buildings and empty apartments in the settlements defers the tough decisions that he still must face, and it leaves his coalition stable.  
In fact, even if construction in the settlements is frozen forever and not a single dog kennel or sheet of drywall is put up, the reality of the peace process will not change. Peace will not break out. Israel will not free itself of the occupation and its opponents around the world will continue to accuse it of apartheid and oppression of the Palestinians. There is a limit to what can be received in compensation for what one is not doing.  
The real debate will come in the next phase, when Obama presents his Middle East peace plan, or when Netanyahu surprises him with an end run and an initiative of his own, thereby avoiding an imposed agreement. Proposing their own plans is what Menahem Begin did in connection with the peace process with Egypt and what Ariel Sharon did with the Gaza disengagement. They preferred to pay a smaller price up front, but they controlled developments in the peace process and were not asked to make even greater concessions.  
Until now Netanyahu preferred to be seen as giving into Obama's pressure and compromising on Likud principles for the sake of relations with America. If he maintains this passive approach he will be faced with a demand for a complete withdrawal from the territories, which he will find difficult. His responsiveness to Obama on the issue of a Palestinian state shows that Netanyahu is not Yitzhak Shamir. He doesn't have the emotional strength to go head to head with the Americans, nor does he have the same ideological commitment to the Greater Land of Israel.  
Even if Netanyahu doesn't believe in peace and compromise with the Arabs, he wants Israel to be accepted in the international community and understands the importance of relations with the United States. For better or worse he is nearing a decision like those made by Begin and Sharon.  
Netanyahu might think he would do well to propose evacuating isolated settlements, to return settlers from the West Bank without withdrawing the army or to conduct expedited negotiations with Syria (as he attempted in 1998 to avoid U.S. pressure for an additional West Bank withdrawal). And maybe he will come up with something original and interesting that no one has thought of.  
The common denominator of all these ideas is that they cannot be implemented with Netanyahu's current coalition. To go beyond talk of a settlement freeze to a real peace process, Netanyahu will need Kadima's Tzipi Livni by his side. Shas, Yisrael Beiteinu and Habayit Hayehudi will not allow him to cede even a millimeter. Kadima constitutes his strategic reserves, and without it he will be doomed to wander the world like a leper, absorbing public blows from Obama and the Europeans and concluding yet another term without leaving a legacy.  
That's why Netanyahu must keep Kadima strong in the opposition. Without the party he will become a pawn in the hands of Yisrael Beiteinu's Avigdor Lieberman and Shas' Eli Yishai. Only the prospect of an alternative to the current coalition will allow him to continue moving forward.  
In attempting to fracture Kadima through the "Mofaz bill," which would enable seven or more Knesset members to form their own party, Netanyahu is acting against his own interests. If he adds a few more MKs to Likud he would only be buying himself more "rebels," who would act against every initiative and move in the peace process. Anyone returning to Likud from Kadima would have to demonstrate allegiance to the party's old values and take right-wing positions. One can understand the temptation to destroy the rival party, but if Kadima splits apart Netanyahu will be trapped in a coalition with his "natural partners" from the far right and be faced with a bitter, ongoing confrontation with Washington.  
Netanyahu must preserve his strategic reserves instead of looking for token gains. In his previous term as prime minister he fell from power because he stuck with the extreme right and didn't cultivate an alternative coalition, and then the right abandoned him over the Wye River accord. It would be a shame if that happened to him again after working so hard to get back into office.

<title> Bibi should shoot for the net</title>
<date>Sun Apr 26 01:08:28 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
No word in Hebrew appeals more to Benjamin Netanyahu than "block." He uses it in every conversation or speech, let alone in interviews. He works it into his speech and uses it to underline his achievements. That word is the essence of his worldview, a view that favors dribbling the ball away from the goal rather than kicking it into the net.  
Faithful to this, he boasts how he used to block slander from Arab countries as ambassador to the United Nations. How he blocked the dangers of Oslo during his first stint as prime minister and how he blocked the Histadrut labor federation's attempts to prevent structural reforms when he served as finance minister. But what Israel needs today is a striker, a real scoring machine, not a goalie. Israel needs a Barack Obama, not a Yitzhak Shamir.  
Netanyahu has been telling us for three years that he has an orderly work plan, that if we just let him take over again, he'll block the dangers that Ariel Sharon, Ehud Olmert and Tzipi Livni bequeathed on us.  
He has promised that he offers more than televised sound bites; he has a solid and mature strategy, a genuine alternative for getting out of the current situation. Yet, one month into his term, Israel is still dribbling around the penalty area.  
In Istanbul, Obama committed to a Palestinian state. He pledged his support to Annapolis, and George Mitchell is making sure the message is received in Jerusalem. Netanyahu, meanwhile, is doing his homework. Between the four walls of the prime minister's chambers, which have heard all the secrets, he is busy reevaluating, drowning in a sea of pages from dozens of folders containing documents on the peace process.  
And while Netanyahu the student is busy studying the writings of Livni and Ahmed Qureia - the minutes of their 70 encounters - a historical first is underway. For the first time in over a generation, the Israeli prime minister has not rushed to the Oval Office to extend his friendship to the president of the United States. Instead, Netanyahu has allowed the king of Jordan to beat him to Andrews Air Force Base en route to the White House.  
The Israeli prime minister, who promised Ehud Barak that he would honor the commitments of his predecessors, is turning against David Ben-Gurion's commitment under UN General Assembly Resolution 181 of November 29, 1947 - two states for two peoples. Suddenly the Palestinians are the ones crying about not having a partner, and Mahmoud Abbas is telling Tony Blair that there is nobody to talk to.  
The new world arena, overseen by Obama, is moving ahead at Twitter speed, a world where Hugo Chavez gets a handshake and a first visit to Havana is in the works. Netanyahu's bunker tactics won't work for long in this world. He will not be able to stall much, hoping for some global security calamity or other delays during stoppage time.  
And what will Netanyahu find when he's finished reading the folders? He'll find that the sea is the same sea and the Arabs are the same Arabs, and soon they will enjoy a majority between the Jordan River and the sea, and this majority will wash over our country unless we divide it in two. And what do we do when that happens? Import apartheid? Dust off the Allon Plan, which proposed ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank through a deal with Jordan? Shall we dispatch Shimon Peres to Amman with the draft of the London Agreement for ceasing all violence?  
Soon Netanyahu will discover what most of us have known for a long time, that a daring regional peace plan must be put forward, an initiative that corresponds with the Arab initiative and hitches Obama to the effort. This initiative will let us score: yes to the 1967 borders, yes to an exchange of territory, yes to the partition of Jerusalem, no to the right of return.  
Without a comprehensive regional peace plan for both banks of the Jordan, a plan that reinforces the American withdrawal from Iraq and reestablishes the coalition of the first Gulf War to block the axis of evil, Netanyahu can only dream that the Americans will look the other way when planes bedecked with stars of David show their radar signature on their dangerous and long journey to Natanz, Isfahan and Arak.  
In the world according to Obama, soccer matches do no last more than 90 minutes. So shoot Bibi, shoot.

<title>Comment / Settlement freeze is like racial segregation in U.S.</title>
<date>Tue Dec 29 01:46:19 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Once upon a time there was a black woman; her name was Rosa Parks. There were racially discriminating laws in the United States, but she continued to sit on the bus even when she was told to vacate her seat for a white person. She was arrested, which set off a process whose end saw the abolishment of racial segregation on American buses. How is it possible that one little black woman, a dressmaker by profession, could change history simply because she remained sitting? Her protest was stronger than any demonstration, op-ed piece or Knesset vote. She opted for the natural choice; that is why she was triumphant.  
People get married and have children. The children need space. The children grow up and get married. The children need a house. That is known as life. No one has ever managed to stop it. But every time another evil person arises who plans to destroy us, he does not succeed. And he does not succeed in destroying life itself.  
We have enemies who are big and strong. But the defense minister and prime minister are apparently too small to contend with them, so they contend with us instead. That is how we were defined as the enemy. My family and friends were outlawed. Why? Because we are building in the Land of Israel. After all the permits and approvals, in recognized and orderly settlements in which a third generation has already been raised, we woke up one morning to the humming of drones in the sky, taking pictures of us and the situation on the ground. It is forbidden to build. Not even a storeroom. Not a kennel. In certain places, it is even forbidden to add an air conditioner.  
The security forces have plans to cut off the area and act with paralyzing force; to achieve the element of surprise. They have a bank of targets that must be evacuated, and they screen mobile telephones to prevent us from calling up reinforcements against the demolition. This is humiliating, insulting and outrageous.  
The freeze is an edict that the public cannot tolerate. It is not democratic, nor is it humane. It hits hard at the pockets of law-abiding citizens and embitters their lives. But at its foundation, either intentionally or by accident, is pure and basic apartheid - it is forbidden for Jews to live in certain places. It is forbidden to build. It is forbidden to develop. And it doesn't matter what the reasons are.  
What makes me most furious is that there was no normal decision-making process for approving the move in the cabinet and Knesset. It was a wicked act done stealthily. On Wednesday night, the inner cabinet met, and the minutes are classified, of course. On Thursday there were already drones in the sky taking pictures of us. Suddenly there are no individual rights or civil rights because the law is above everything. This is a move that contravenes the substance of democracy, because democracy is the government of the people. And here rights are being trampled on.  
And if we are talking about democracy, how is it possible that the system of government in Israel always lets down the right? It happens to us time and time again. We elected a clearly right-wing leader and we got uprooting, evictions, freezes and delegitimation. What are we supposed to do to make our voices heard? The Knesset elections, after all, don't change a thing. Should we demonstrate? We've already had demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of people that have had no effect whatsoever. What is left for us to do? How can we stop what is clearly going to happen? How can we influence the reality?  
Despite the fury and the insult, let's not turn to violence. There is a simple, natural solution that is full of life - continuing to build. That will perhaps embarrass the prime minister in front of U.S. President Barack Obama, but that's precisely the point. A person with a manual cement mixer in Samaria can change history. Sometimes the man in the field can be a lot stronger than the great leaders. Just like Rosa Parks.

<title>Finish it now</title>
<date>Mon Oct 19 01:21:18 IST 2009</date>
<content>
In the early 1990s, when Judge Richard Goldstone headed a commission of inquiry on the rising violence in South Africa toward the end of apartheid, he garnered the same kind of compliments from the Afrikaners as he has been getting from Israel over the last few weeks. But the "Jew boy" wasn't the problem then, and he isn't the problem now. And PR isn't the solution. Take a look in the mirror; it's not Goldstone, it's us. We're the problem as well as the solution.  
Israel is being pushed to the side of the world stage and will yet find itself in the same position South Africa was during the final years of the right-wing "crocodile," P.W. Botha, a conservative ideologue. The Goldstone report is a cruel but accurate image of Israel the leper as seen by the "anti-Semitic" Goldstone and Israel's good friends around the world, who are having a hard time continuing to defend the country.  
When Martin Luther King Jr. was fighting for the rights of black people in the United States, it didn't bother anyone that South Africa had benches for white people only. But then the weather changed, winter turned to spring and racism became a crime once more, first in the United States and then around the world. That's exactly what's happening in Israel now. George W. Bush retired to his ranch and America has gotten tired of the settlers. Everyone understands what every decent and patriotic Israeli also realizes: Israel won't be in Hebron or Ofra when it celebrates its 70th anniversary. So why not be done with it before then?  
When will be the appropriate time? When Ankara recalls its ambassador? When Vice Premier Moshe Ya'alon is arrested in London? When the Security Council imposes sanctions? When Angela Merkel, Nicolas Sarkozy and Silvio Berlusconi start saying behind our backs the same things the Swedes and Norwegians say about us to our faces?  
We could be total suckers and not be done with it until then, or we could decide now, the way David Ben-Gurion took action at 4 P.M. one Friday afternoon: mightily, and in thrall to a Zionist vision. Complete the ugly, injurious fence that causes injustice but saves lives and turn it into Israel's internationally recognized border. Patriotic Israel realizes that the Palestinians must not beat us in the War of Independence and become the majority here, just as Ben-Gurion understood in 1948 when he made his decision. So the Arabs oppose dividing the land under reasonable conditions and want to talk until they form the majority here? Let them oppose. The world agrees, and we act.  
Israel didn't have to wallow in Lebanon for 18 years because of the Katyusha threat, and it doesn't need to immerse itself in Hebron for 42 years because of the Qassams. The Israel Defense Forces successfully defends our internationally recognized borders from security threats. We've waited too many years to give the Palestinians an answer on this, and time is against both sides of the conflict - mainly us.  
And when Israel establishes recognized borders, maybe peace will make a surprise appearance. The Palestinians will no longer be living under occupation, no one in the world will listen to them anymore, and the leaders of Egypt and Jordan will be worried about staying in power if it's not quiet in Palestine. So maybe something will move and we'll bury the sword.  
And if not? We will continue to seek peace while establishing ourselves as a model society with recognized borders; we will be respected members of the European Union and sought after by the entire world.  
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must decide whether it will be on his watch that Israel closes the book on its control over the territories, just as Ariel Sharon closed the book on Israel's presence in Gaza and Ehud Barak did in Lebanon. Or not, in which case Bibi will be followed by the Israeli F.W. de Klerk, who will lead us to a safe harbor and a historic, and final, victory in the War of Independence.

<title>Forcing Arabs to study Zionism is no solution</title>
<date>Wed Jun 17 02:17:34 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
The ministerial committee on legislation did well when it decided earlier this week to reject a bill by a group of Knesset members from Yisrael Beiteinu that would have required all Israeli schools to teach "Israel studies and Zionism."  
Aside from the fact that this was a stupid proposal, drafted by people who have apparently never in their lives entered a classroom, it was clear to all that the goal was to spark unnecessary national ferment - or, to be more precise, nationalist ferment.  
For when a bill says "all schools," and even stresses "all schools required to teach the core curriculum," it is clear that it is aimed at the Arabs. In other words, it is clear that this bill - like the Nakba bill before it and the long list of other bills that will undoubtedly follow (the disappointed sponsors are already preparing to submit the Israel studies bill to the Knesset as a private member's bill) - has one goal, and one only: to provoke the Arabs.  
What is important here is not the bill itself, but the trend. It began long ago, and now encompasses many areas of life - from a law sponsored by Likud's Limor Livnat that requires Arab schools to fly the Israeli flag to a bill by Kadima's Israel Hasson (which quietly passed its preliminary reading this week) that would "launder" family farms in the Negev (of which some are illegal and most are problematic), eradicate the limitations set by master plans and cleverly circumvent the principle of equality. Under Yisrael Beiteinu's auspices, this trend has broken through the few barriers that still existed, and its purpose is clearer than ever.  
Since this is the trend, the Israel studies and Zionism bill will undoubtedly be passed by the Knesset in some form or other. And strange as it might seem, the Arab school system - or at least, large parts of it - will probably welcome it joyfully. Granted, this is a poor man's joy, which will destroy the last vestiges of the Arab public's feeling of partnership in Israeli society, but joy nevertheless - because there is nothing like oppression to awaken and intensify slumbering national sentiment.  
Ukrainian youths who refuse to speak Russian, Corsicans who spit at signs written in French, and Jerusalemites who, during the British Mandate, refused to learn English in school will all attest to this.  
There is no better way to spark a bitter, mutinous discussion full of painful memories than a forced course in "Zionism." Do you want to know the history of the settlement movement? Of the land purchases? Of the "tower and stockade" era? Of the War of Independence? Be my guest. Israeli research into the history of Zionism offers an endless supply of different accounts and interpretations of every event. The revival of the term "Nakba" ("catastrophe") in the wake of the idiotic bill that seeks to bar its commemoration on Independence Day is only the beginning. Every debate and every nuanced discussion within Israeli Arab society has now been silenced by the nationalist, ostensibly Zionist, onslaught.  
But the gravest, most worrisome aspect of the whole affair is Yisrael Beiteinu's effort to adorn itself with the trappings of Zionism. Even though all the new laws and regulations it has proposed are designed simply to hammer the Arabs, they are dangerous to Israeli society as a whole, and especially to Israel's definition as a nation-state. Just when the prime minister has made Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish nation-state an ironclad condition for starting negotiations, Yisrael Beiteinu has exposed the real battle that is raging today - between the definition of Zionism as a national political movement and the perception of it as an apartheid movement.  
The "Zionism" that Yisrael Beiteinu wants to teach is not that of Herzl, and certainly not one that embodies dialogue among different strains, including those that seek to implement the principles of equality and the inclusion of those who are not "Zionist." This warped Zionism reflects a tradition of violent, colonialist conquest that silences all debate and grates on both sides' nationalist nerves. In such a context, reality disappears while symbols become all-important, and thus a source of ongoing conflict.  
Nor is this accidental. None of the people who have proposed bills of this kind have a genuine solution to either Jewish-Arab relations in Israel or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. So in a series of aggressive moves, they are turning the politics of "there is no solution" into a fact and trying to entrench it. And they will welcome any Palestinian counterreaction with open arms.

<title>From Sheikh Jarrah to Sheikh Munis</title>
<date>Thu Aug 06 02:07:14 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
At the top of the hill, a few dozen meters from where a house now stands, there used to be an irrigation pool for the village citrus groves. I swim every morning at the municipal swimming pool built on the ruins of the village irrigation pool. Palestinian Jaffa oranges grew in the now-vanished groves. My house stands there now. The land was "redeemed," as land acquisition was called in Zionist propaganda. In the case of Sheikh Munis, it was redeemed by force, and Tel Aviv's Ramat Aviv neighborhood was built there, including Tel Aviv University, a magnificent academic institution built on the ruins of a village whose 2,230 inhabitants were surrounded and threatened. They fled, never to return.  
All that remains of the large village is Habayit Hayarok (now a conference and party center) another house on Levanon Street and the cemetery, which sits neglected on the outskirts of the parking lot of an intimidating government facility - no outsiders allowed. Of course, there is neither a memorial nor a monument to the village that was wiped off the face of the earth - one of 418.  
Somewhere, perhaps in a refugee camp in terrible poverty, lives the family of the farmer who plowed the land where my house now stands. According to the Israeli judicial system, they have the right to get their land back immediately, destroy my house, return and grow Jaffa oranges for export on its ruins, and remove me by force if necessary. The Jerusalem District Court, which recently ruled that representatives of the Sephardi community committee had the right to take back the Hanun and Gawi families' apartments in East Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, has opened the 1948 file.  
That is, if Israel had an egalitarian system of law and justice, if the legal system were fair, because then millions of Palestinians would be able to applaud the court and demonstrate their joy in the streets at the ruling. The road to justice denied in 1948 has been opened to everyone. From now on, Jews and Arabs will be able to demand the restitution of their property. The return is in the offing, with the backing of the Israeli justice system.  
But of course, it's not like that. The court that sealed the fate of the two Palestinian families and allowed extremist settlers to live in their place has once again laid bare the rule of law's true state in Israel: racist and applying a double-standard, with separate legal systems for Jews and Arabs.  
We should perhaps thank the court for its scandalous ruling, which not only sparked a justifiable international wave of protest against Israel, but also revealed its true face. "There are judges in Jerusalem," as Menachem Begin said, and they have made it official: apartheid. Ownership rights are for Jews alone.  
The distance between Sheikh Jarrah and Sheikh Munis has been shortened in one fell swoop. Those who contend that Jews must be given back their property cannot in the same breath deny the Palestinians' property rights because of their national origin. It's true that a system of strict laws and regulations denies the Palestinians what it allows the Jews, but all reasonable Israelis must now ask themselves if this is the system of justice and the law of the "Jewish" state they want to live in.  
It is impossible to ignore the injustices of 1948 while hundreds of thousands of refugees rot in the camps. No agreement will hold water without a solution to their plight, which is more feasible than Israel's strident scaremongers suggest. But rulings like the current one make it harder to distinguish clearly between Sheikh Jarrah and Sheikh Munis, between the conquest of 1948 and the conquests of 1967. My house stands on land stolen by force, and it is the obligation of Israel and the world to redress the injustice without creating injustice and new dislocation. My house stands on land that was stolen, but the whole world has recognized the Jews' right to establish their state there. At the same time, no country in the world has recognized Israel's right to conquer Sheikh Jarrah as well.  
In my morning musings on the way to the pool, I sometimes think about the land's original owners. I long for the day when Israel takes moral and material responsibility for the injustice done to them. Now, because of the court ruling, my right to continue to swim here may also be in doubt.

<title>How Goldstone erred </title>
<date>Fri Sep 25 01:12:18 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
At least three times in his life, Richard Goldstone has gone against prevailing wisdom in taking on challenging jobs. Two were in apartheid South Africa - and he was brilliantly successful in both. The third, his Gaza inquiry, has brought down the coals of hell upon his head.  
During the first three decades of apartheid, many judges were appointed because of their loyalty to the Afrikaner government. One result was a decline in the quality and status of South African courts. In response, the government sought to appoint some liberal lawyers of quality. Most, however, were reluctant to join the bench because it meant applying apartheid laws.  
Some accepted: Goldstone, who made his name as a barrister in nonpolitical commercial cases, became a Supreme Court judge in 1980. The next year, far from merely applying the law, he handed down a judgment that struck at the heart of a basic apartheid law - the Group Areas Act, which had split the entire country into different areas where people of different races were respectively compelled to live and work, and displaced hundreds of thousands of people of color.  
Goldstone ruled in favor of an Asian woman appealing against eviction from her home, and said she first had to be provided with alternative accommodation. His startling judgment ended such evictions.  
His second challenging job came in 1991. Apartheid was winding down and the country was beset by violence, in which thousands were killed. A mysterious "Third Force" of government agents was rumored to be behind the killings. President F.W. de Klerk asked Goldstone to head a commission to investigate the terrible violence. Goldstone accepted - and ran it like no other commission before: Over three years, he issued 47 reports, revealing horrendous details about murder squads set up and funded by the government.  
Gaza has been Goldstone's latest challenge. He again accepted a mandate from a poisoned source: the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. I have no doubt that he acted with the best of intentions, as he has his entire life, first in South Africa and then in the world, to ensure justice be done. But I also believe that this time, his decision is open to question.  
First, Goldstone underestimated the Human Rights Council's malevolence toward Israel. Most members harbor deep hatred for Israel, and wish for no less than its destruction. Goldstone should have been warned off by the refusal of several people before him to accept the job, including former Irish president Mary Robinson.  
Second, he accepted the council's mandate, even though it had declared in advance that Israel was guilty of war crimes in Gaza. It is not enough that the council's chairman later said the mandate could include Hamas: Apart from the fact that this statement does not bind the council, his findings on Hamas will mean little or nothing in practice because the organization is not a recognized government and is beyond international action. Israel is the council's target and Goldstone has delivered it. His report has more strength because he is a Jew and enjoys international status.  
Third, rejecting objections, he allowed Prof. Christine Chinkin to remain a member of his four-person commission even though, back in January, she had already publicly found Israel guilty, referring to its "prima facie war crimes" in Gaza. Goldstone thus seriously, even fatally, undermined the commission's credibility, and in doing so raised questions about his own good sense.  
Fourth, the nearly 600-page report includes many pages of descriptions and allegations of Israeli oppression at home and on the West Bank. That is valid if the intention is to provide a context for Israel's actions in Gaza. But then it must be done properly, with careful research and assessments for a fair presentation of the mix of history, religion, culture and politics that make up the complex situation, including both good and bad. The report does not show that knowledge and understanding; instead, time and again, it's Israel that is bad, bad, bad.  
Fifth, the report follows the usual line pursued by members of the council and Israel's other enemies - treating Israel as though it were a unique source of evil instead of examining Gaza in the light of experience elsewhere, in places such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan, where the military has taken on terrorists in a civilian setting.  
Richard Goldstone is now under savage attack from many in the Jewish world. Right-wingers have gone berserk, with outpourings of hysterical condemnation. More measured criticism has come from Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the UN, who said there were "very serious concerns about many of the recommendations in the report," and U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly, who criticized the report for its "cookie-cutter conclusions" about Israel's actions, while it limited its comments on "the deplorable actions of Hamas to generalized remarks."  
But Kelly also urged Israel to further investigate IDF actions in Gaza. And that indeed is what Israel should do. I believed last December and still do that Israel was justified in going into Gaza. But I remain uncertain and uncomfortable about exactly what Israel did and why it did it. Was white phosphorous used over civilian areas? If so, why? What about the early killing of scores of policemen? What about reports that rescue parties were blocked from reaching the wounded, civilians carrying white flags were killed while fleeing and human shields were used? Why were journalists kept out?  
The IDF says emphatically that it behaved correctly, but it is not enough for it to investigate itself. An independent investigation is needed - and the obvious person to head it is former Israeli Supreme Court president Aharon Barak, who would give it strength and status, at home and abroad. Israelis need it for their own moral peace of mind, or if wrong was done, to recognize and to address it. Israel needs to be certain that it can tell Goldstone and other critics that their accusations are skewed and unjustified.  
Benjamin Pogrund, a former South African journalist, first reported on Richard Goldstone 48 years ago.

<title>How to talk to a right winger </title>
<date>Thu May 28 13:22:03 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
MK Tzipi Hotovely is a rising star in the Likud party. Well spoken, young and passionate, she decided to hold a diplomatic conference this week. The subject: Alternatives to the two-state concept.  
On the eve of the conference, Hotovely appeared on the nightly current events program "London and Kirschenbaum" on Channel 10. For seven minutes the pair tried to get one answer out of their guest: What is your alternative?  
The question was repeated no fewer than 10 times, in various versions, but they didn't get an answer. Instead they heard replies that seemed better suited to an amusing skit: "I'm very happy that you're asking that question"; "What's important is not the alternative"; "Palestinian society is not ripe for a solution"; "Jews will not be evicted from their homes again." Hotovely knows what she doesn't want, but she hasn't the faintest idea what she does want.  
Let's not blame Hotovely, she's not alone. From the prime minister down to the last of the right wingers, none of them has an answer to the simplest, most natural and most obvious question of all: What, in heaven's name, do you suggest? How will the country look according to your vision, and only according to your vision, 15 to 20 years from now?  
After all, at the conference that took place the day after the interview, the farce repeated itself. No less a personage than Strategic Affairs Minister Moshe Ya'alon said that there is no room for discussion of the two-state outline; that such a process has no chance; that the Palestinians don't want two states. All together now: an alternative - forget it.  
We therefore have before us the marvelously easy and effective way to bring down the right's house of cards in one fell swoop: Ask them what they suggest. Ask them what their solution is. They will squirm like Hotovely; there isn't a single decent right winger who has a ready answer.  
With the exception of those who favor transfer - "voluntary" transfer, of course - the right has no vision of how the country will look less than a generation from now, when the Arabs make up the majority between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean. What will a country where the minority rules the majority look like? For how many more years will millions of people continue to live without basic rights while the world remains silent?  
In the outside world such a country is called an apartheid state. In Israel they call it the one-state solution. Once it was out of bounds, only the radical left in both nations dared to suggest it. Now it is being proposed by the Israeli right, while they blur and repress the reality.  
Do you know what the right is proposing? It is proposing a continuation of the status quo. What was ostensibly good for Israel for 40 years will also be good for another 400 years. For 40 years we were able to deceive ourselves, to mock the world, to occupy, to oppress, to trample and to kill. So why shouldn't we continue?  
But the status quo is never static: It changes quickly. The Palestinians are intensifying their struggle and the world is gradually becoming disgusted with us. During the first 20 years of the occupation, we too were convinced that it could continue undisturbed: The Palestinians would continue to build our homes, sweep our streets, wash our dishes and cultivate our fields forever. Then came the first intifada which destroyed the illusion with stones and knives; then the second intifada did so with rifles and explosive devices.  
The third one is on the way, more violent than its predecessors. The soul of the world will become fed up: During the first intifada it remained silent for the most part, during the second it began to ostracize Israel, and during the third it will take painful practical steps against it.  
Some of the right wingers understand this. They have a secret wish in their hearts, which they will never dare to utter: Let's make the lives of the Palestinians intolerable, until they get the hint - which is as obvious as the barrel of the cannon directed at their homes - and leave.  
That's an idea. The problem is that the idea is not practical: The Palestinians, unfortunately, are staying put, more than the Jews are. Perhaps we haven't stepped on them hard enough as yet. There is also a chance that the camel's back will break in the end, just as Fatah is about to break, and then there will no longer be anyone with whom to solve the problem.  
So here is another way to deal with the slogans of the right: Expose the truth that lies behind them, and its hopelessness.  
There is nothing easier than causing the arguments of the right to collapse. Not a single genuinely secular person can be convinced of our right to the territories for religious reasons. The grave of Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav in Uman, Ukraine, is also holy and at the moment we have no claim to sovereignty over it.  
Just as absurd are the security-related explanations in an era of missiles capable of nearly anything. All that remains is the greed for real estate. And when it comes to real estate, let's talk about its price: it's rising. On the day when Israelis also begin to pay for the ground personally, with blood and money, and also understand the context - the deal will be called off.  
Until then the right will continue to use scare tactics, without proposing a single alternative, and the settlers will continue with their tricks; the solution of the left, the only one around, will become impossible and the right will win again.  
It will be a Pyrrhic victory; it will be too late to amend it. The largest and most dubious real estate deal of all will collapse and with it those who claimed that they were the owners of the property, even though something else was written on the deed of reality and justice.

<title>Israel boycott of U.K. goods would be toothless, stupid</title>
<date>Thu Dec 24 02:57:18 IST 2009</date>
<content>
"I admit I've bought a few things there in the past, but one can do without Marks & Spencer." With this observation on life's hardships before the cameras, MK Ronit Tirosh (Kadima) launched her "the Knesset says no to British products" campaign.  
Tirosh launches into her war against Britain with a lethal arsenal. Forty-two MKs from most of the parties in the Knesset signed a petition threatening "a boycott of British goods in the wake of the [British] government's recommendation that Israeli products made beyond the Green Line be marked as such." They are backed by Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin (Likud) who called the initiative "correct and important" and offered to have the petition translated and sent to his U.K. counterpart, the speaker of the House of Commons.  
Some say the petition's delivery should be accompanied by the Knesset choir belting out "Fools Britannia, Britain's fools and knaves." We'll give them boycott for boycott. Tirosh began with Marks & Spencer. We'll proceed to the Tate galleries and the West End Theater. We'll stay out of Hyde Park, we'll ignore Susan Boyle, and as for the Beatles we don't need them. And if all that doesn't help, we'll recall Liverpool's Israeli soccer star Yossi Benayoun, and even Avram Grant, now coaching bottom-of-the-league Portsmouth.  
Just as Tirosh was sticking out her neck to win the "we'll show 'em" sprint, up came Deputy Foreign Minister Daniel Ayalon to pip her at the post with his riposte to European Union Foreign Minister Katherine Ashton. His "just as the Romans failed to cut Israel off from Jerusalem, so too will United Nations and EU diplomats," gave him the gold medal.  
Patriotism, it turns out, is also the last refuge of those who can't read the map of reality. Nonetheless it would behoove our legislators and cabinet ministers, as well as their deputies, to take an occasional peek at those irrelevant international factors such as Europe, the UN and the United States. They may well discover that our constant whining is starting to have an effect. And if Tirosh and Ayalon would kindly look eastward from their Jerusalem offices, they would see that what has sprouted there, right under their noses, is not exactly Jack's magic beanstalk.  
It is an area whose value has risen several times more than anywhere else in Israel, and whose Jewish residents enjoy privileges several times greater than the residents of the state itself. These are territories that were conquered in war, and a policy of segregation between Jews and Palestinians has been in force for a long time. It is a state within a state, and some call the policy implemented there apartheid - not only in Britain, Sweden, Spain, Austria and Holland. It is in the air. Even in Washington.  
The day is not far off when that epithet will be spoken aloud, in the institutions of the EU and the UN, and perhaps also be translated into resolutions like those used against other states and regimes. Tirosh and Ayalon and their leaders should prepare themselves. It begins with trivialities: The sheet music for "Hatikva" can't be found at an international sporting event, an Israeli troupe's invitation to a dance festival is canceled - but it will steadily gather momentum, at conferences, in the discussions of international organizations and in cooperation with them.  
Although Tirosh and Rivlin may not have noticed it, the world has grown tired of us, and although it may be asleep, sometimes it kicks in its sleep. In the meantime, they should start checking how many and which Israeli companies are registered as suppliers of Marks & Spencer. Their threats against Britain are even dumber than the dumbest of dumb British shaggy dog stories.

<title>Israel's apartheid is worse than South Africa's</title>
<date>Sun Nov 08 01:11:22 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The shock that gripped the shrunken peace camp following Hillary Clinton's statement that the settlement construction freeze is not what we thought it would be, but rather what Benjamin Netanyahu thought it would be, is reminiscent of other shocks generated by American peace plans ever since the 1960s.  
Had the educated people of this camp not outnumbered its foot soldiers, this shock and amazement could be compared to other superstitions, like the correlation between rainfall and women's fertility.  
But precisely because the Israeli intelligentsia is always coming up with prophecies about "American pressure," it would not be unreasonable to assume that we can once again expect expert regurgitation of speculations about a "first-term president" versus a "second-term" one, and about when he stops being an "incoming" president and starts being a "lame duck."  
The truth is simpler. Regardless of whether there is a Democrat or a Republican in the White House, the United States became a distinctly pro-Israel world power after the 1967 war. It has no intention of being a "balanced mediator" when it comes to the conflict with the Palestinians.  
Barack Obama's public relations moves in the Arab world have frightened many average Israelis. But Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, allies of the final takeover of the West Bank, know very well that U.S. policy has not changed. It doesn't take a genius to read the working papers of past prime ministers.  
The prevailing attitude of all U.S. administrations was drafted by Henry Morgenthau, and was later updated by Kenneth Waltz. One line guided all of them - Dennis Ross, Martin Indyk, George Mitchell - essentially, that any possible settlement must match the positions of the stronger party.  
This is how the Americans abandoned the refugee issue, and this is why they abandoned the opposition to settlements. Netanyahu is no genius. He is simply not interested in saying good-bye to the occupation. That is all. After all, he came to power because of this. To complain about him is to complain about November rain.  
The Israeli public's choice is a different matter. The spokesmen of the dovish camp tell us horror stories about a future binational state. But the binational state is already here. It has a rigid apartheid legal system, as the High Court of Justice fades away.  
The system preserving this apartheid is more ruthless than that seen in South Africa, where the black were a labor force and could therefore also make a living. It is equipped with the lie of being "temporary." Occasionally, Israel's indifference comes up with allegations against the Palestinians.  
Abba Eban captured the allegation by coining a phrase repeated by the doves of all parties, who never really went to battle over Israel's future and allowed the "settlement project" to spread. After all, occupation makes Israelis richer. Why oppose it?  
Yaakov (Jack) Teitel is the American aid secured by moderate Israel. What Yitzhak Rabin failed to do after the massacre by the last import, Baruch Goldstein - to uproot the Jewish settlement in Hebron - will not happen now either. Shvut Rachel, Tapuah or any other such town will not be moved, nor will the smaller "illegal" outposts.  
Beyond the two Palestinians whose murders were never really investigated, and past what Ami Ortiz or Professor Ze'ev Sternhell went through, Teitel is a Made-in-the-U.S.A. reminder that "no one will do for you what you fail to do for yourselves."  
How to do what needs to be done? Surely, not through the rules drafted back in the 1970s, when "we" were in power and "they" were the opposition. The settlers are in power. The Shin Bet security service and Obama will not fight them.

<title>Jews as canaries and hawks </title>
<date>Fri Dec 25 01:17:15 IST 2009</date>
<content>
John Mann is a British Labor MP who explains that there isn't a single Jew among the industrial workers, farmers and retired coal miners in his constituency. He is one of the handful of MPs who came out of the recent parliamentary-expenses scandals cleaner than he went in. He was honored with an award at the Knesset during last week's conference of the Global Forum for Combating Anti-Semitism, for his work in Britain and internationally against anti-Jewish racism. Mann compared the Jews to a canary, like the ones his constituents used to take three miles down into the mines to make sure that the atmosphere was healthy for human beings. The process of the decay of all human values begins with anti-Semitism, said Gert Weisskirchen, who was honored in the same ceremony. Weisskirchen is a scholar as well as a long-time member of the Bundestag, a man imbued with the spirit of the gentle, civilized and worldly social democracy that built post-war West Germany out of the ashes of the Holocaust.  
So what's going on? The Jews are hawks, not canaries, aren't they? The Global Forum is run by Israel's Foreign Ministry, making Avigdor Lieberman its current host. He is a political figure who has broken new ground in Israel, mainstreaming the kind of racialized thinking of which anti-Semitism was a historic prototype, garnering votes by rhetorically threatening the status of the state's Arab citizens. He is the deputy prime minister in a government that continues to fail to bring its army and its settlers home from Palestinian territory, where they perpetrate the daily violence and humiliation characteristic of all occupations.  
In truth, it is only by denying whole facets of reality that one can fit Jews and Israelis into a simple worldview that defines everyone either as oppressed or as oppressor. Similarly, we would all like to believe that anti-Semitism is a thing of the past, but the ready-made ways of thinking that it offers are too deeply embedded in various cultural imaginations around the world for it to disappear easily. No matter how much serious consideration of anti-Semitism is ridiculed as a dishonest attempt to silence criticism of Israel; no matter how much Israelis would prefer to think of themselves as strong, and as being responsible for their own situation rather than perceiving themselves as victims of anti-Semitism - the old libels are still manifested in the ways in which people think about Israel and about Jews.  
Sammy Eppel, a journalist from Venezuela, explained to the conference in Jerusalem how half the members of that country's Jewish community have left, as the Chavez regime continues to whip up fervor against "Jewish Zionist imperialism" and to embrace the Jew-hating Iranian regime. Furthermore, a 747 fully loaded with who-knows-what flies from Caracas to Tehran weekly.  
Dovid Katz, who teaches Yiddish in Vilnius, raised the alarm about current trends to normalize the Holocaust in the Baltic states by portraying Stalin and Hitler as perpetrators of twin genocides. This is a rhetoric that hides a preference for Hitler, and allows surviving perpetrators of the Holocaust to be honored as anti-communist partisans, and anti-fascists to be put on trial as Stalin's collaborators. An additional worry is that this kind of "re-understanding" of the Holocaust fits in with other kinds of revisionism - like those that portray the Shoah as an invented justification for the State of Israel, or as a minor intra-European spat, dwarfed in importance and impact by the history of European colonialism - of which the oppression of the Palestinians is currently the key manifestation.  
Patrick Desbois, a quiet but hugely charismatic French Catholic priest, was also present at the Global Forum gathering, explaining how he has been traveling Ukraine and Belarus encouraging perpetrators, witnesses and bystanders of the Nazi genocide to divulge their memories before they are lost. Many who refuse to talk to investigators, and who appear to be Jewish, happily chat with him when he is wearing his comforting priest's collar.  
Stories were also presented to the conference about intellectuals, trade unionists, anti-racists and other good people who seek to exclude Israelis, and only Israelis, from the global academic, cultural and economic community; who declare that anti-boycott lawyers are financed by stolen Lehman Brothers money from New York; who say that "Zionist" Jews are the new Nazis, the new racists, the new imperialists, the new supporters of apartheid; who teach that the "Israel lobby" is responsible for the Iraq war; who find excuses for anti-Semitic violence and terrorism; who act as apologists for "critics of Israel" who learn from far-right conspiracy theorists; and who seek to silence those who speak up against anti-Semitism by saying that they only do so to give Prime Minister Netanyahu an easy ride.  
Eminent Israeli scholars Yehuda Bauer and Emmanuel Sivan skewered the worldview of those who ignorantly and innocently embrace anti-Semitic notions when all they think they are doing is speaking up for Palestinians. Yet they both warned the Global Forum that the fight against anti-Semitism is only part of the general fight against bigotry. Both found it necessary to spell out what ought to have been obvious to the delegates: that the struggles against Islamophobia and other types of racism are intimately related to the fight against anti-Jewish racism.

<title>Lieberman is no better than Feiglin </title>
<date>Fri Feb 20 01:36:26 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Kadima achieved its great accomplishment thanks to votes from the left, whereas Likud did not lose even more seats to Kadima because it succeeded in temporarily concealing and silencing Moshe Feiglin's Jewish Leadership movement. Now, even though Avigdor Lieberman and his aides - who, when it is convenient, like to wear the mask of pragmatists - are no better than the group from Jewish Leadership, Tzipi Livni and Benjamin Netanyahu are both competing for their favors.  
That is the nature of politics and the reason why politics are loathed by decent people who consider them the opposite of integrity and basic morality. It is no wonder that so many people do not bother to go to the polls.  
But Lieberman is not a unique phenomenon. About one-third of the members of the current Knesset show contempt for democracy's moral contents.  
Yisrael Beiteinu is joined by the ultra-Orthodox parties, whose patterns of behavior and principles in the political sphere are not substantially different from the concepts held by Lieberman's party or the Feiglin branch of Likud. Even though the ultra-Orthodox parties' source of authority is spiritual and the leader who makes the decisions achieved his position due to his intellectual prowess - while Lieberman draws on his skill at sowing hatred - the result is similar. Lieberman and Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, along with the factions at the fringes of their parties, represent those in our society who have authoritarian temperaments and tendencies.  
Yisrael Beiteinu, Shas and United Torah Judaism, National Union and the "Feiglins" openly show contempt for human rights. The claim that human rights are the heart of democracy and that the reason for its existence is to preserve human rights granted equally to all people everywhere, causes them revulsion. From their point of view, anyone who believes this is an enemy of the Jewish people and undermines the very foundations of the Jewish state.  
Even though some members of the nationalist camp are worse than Lieberman, he is the most dangerous because he is a natural street leader, the only one here. And lo and behold, instead of being an outcast, Lieberman has become the kingmaker. Anyone who in the past demanded that the Europeans denounce Joerg Haider's Austria, anyone who considered Jean-Marie Le Pen an anti-Semite who must not be allowed near power, cannot treat the Lieberman phenomenon with forgiveness.  
Until now, anti-democratic trends in Israel have been halted by a political framework designed in an era that had not yet known Lieberman and before religious Zionism had undergone a radicalization of the kind not even dreamed of by Agudat Yisrael, Poalei Agudat Yisrael and the National Religious Party as it was then. That is why the recent elections are a milestone. Not because of the success of Israel's version of Haider-Le Pen, but because of the legitimacy granted to him by politicians who lust for power and lack restraints.  
It is likewise wrong for Kadima's leaders to be blinded by Yisrael Beiteinu's secularism. Secularism is not a philosophical value in Lieberman's eyes but rather a means to solving his voters' problems. When that issue is resolved, the settler Lieberman will be seen joining religious nationalists in the most natural fashion. Less separates those two camps than what unites them. On the one hand, both of them want to rule over the territories and continue expanding there, and to perpetuate the policy of apartheid. On the other hand, they strive to reduce individual freedoms and rights to a minimum. With regard to the Arabs, their intention in practice is to do away with the defense of these rights.  
Later on, the judicial oversight of legislation and government actions will be abolished, the significance of which is the beginning of the end for democracy. It is interesting that Lieberman, like South American dictators at the end of the previous century, also supports capitalism run wild. Like them, he is a great liberal when it comes to the freedom to exploit another person, but not with regard to other freedoms.  
The experience of the previous century proved that when the liberal and conservative right joins up with the extreme right, in the hope of becoming stronger, it ends up disintegrating both morally and politically. So this is not the time to toss aside basic values. A front must be set up to preserve democratic freedoms. Those for whom our society's future is important must understand that a partnership with Lieberman will destroy everything in politics. Therefore blocking his way to power is a national interest, and a party interest, from Likud to Labor. The leaders of Likud and Kadima must be aware that teaming up with the man who for years has thrived on the frustrations, fears and complexes of Israeli society will ultimately lead to their own end.

<title>Lieberman is no racist</title>
<date>Sun Apr 26 01:08:00 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
I did not vote for Avigdor Lieberman and never will. I do not agree with some of his political positions and do not accept his framing of certain issues. But I am appalled by the left's delegitimizing of Lieberman and anyone connected with him. I do not believe that Israel's Arab citizens must be required to declare their loyalty to the Jewish state. What must be demanded of them and of all Israeli citizens, whether Jewish, Druze or other, is unflinching loyalty to the State of Israel and its laws. But even if one can, and sometimes should, disagree with Lieberman on his approach and statements on this sensitive issue, he's still not a racist. Lieberman is neither a racist nor a fascist, and depicting him as such does an injustice to his voters and harm to Israel.
What's racist is denying the Jewish people a state of their own. Certain Arab Knesset members talk incessantly about the Palestinian people's rights, including their own state. But in the same breath they refuse to acknowledge Israel as the state of the Jewish people and deny the very existence of a Jewish people as a nation with national rights. The person who deserves the racist epithet is MK Jamal Zahalka, who attended the conference of hate in Geneva and called himself "a victim of Israel's racist apartheid" while serving as a member of the Israeli parliament.
The left's tendency to delegitimize and demonize people with whom they disagree is no less reprehensible than similar tactics by the right. Just as we must condemn right wingers' attempts to cast doubt over the patriotism of Yossi Beilin and his fellow subscribers to the Geneva Initiative - provocative as this plan might be to most Israelis - we must condemn the left's lamentable habit of denigrating Lieberman.
The idea to change the state's borders in a peace agreement may not be practical or implementable in our circumstances, but we cannot deny its legitimacy and sense. And in any case, it has nothing to do with racism. Lieberman has said publicly that he supports the principle of establishing a Palestinian state. The media attacked Lieberman for his comments on Annapolis, but his statement on Israel's commitment to the road map is of infinitely greater importance. It's a fact that the Annapolis process did not mature into an agreement, and the road map enjoys widespread international recognition. Incidentally, it's interesting to note that no such assurances of Israel's commitment to the road map have come from Benjamin Netanyahu.
It's time that both the left and right learn to engage in debates over issues, not individuals, and stop delegitimizing and demonizing once and for all.

For over a decade, European governments have been major sources of funding for dozens of Israeli and Palestinian organizations claiming to promote human rights and similar moral causes. While these groups are known as "nongovernmental organizations," or NGOs, they are, in fact, selected and nurtured by foreign governments. And as seen in research to be discussed in a Knesset conference on December 1, their agendas are more political than moral.  
This often hidden support helps pay for expensive newspaper advertisements, such as those recently announcing B'Tselem's 20th anniversary; the salaries of lawyers involved in dozens of High Court cases about the security barrier, treatment of Palestinian terrorists, etc.; the Geneva Initiative's conferences and booklets; and a flood of statements submitted to the United Nations condemning Israeli policies. Recipient NGOs have a major influence on many issues in our lives, and on the decisions of our democratically elected government.  
Although foreign funding for Israeli NGOs is labeled as support for "civil society," this is false advertising. Organizations such as Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, B'Tselem, Hamoked Center for the Defense of the Individual, and many more, cannot claim to be rooted in Israeli civil society when they are funded both directly by the Swedish government, and indirectly through budgets provided by the same government to the Diakonia church organization. This process is repeated by another 15 governments (including Norway and Switzerland), as well as the European Commission, which between them fund more than 50 similar organizations.  
The nature and scale of European influence is unique - in no other case do democratic countries use taxpayer money to support opposition groups in other democracies. Imagine the French response to U.S. government financing for radical NGO anti-abortion campaigns in Paris, or for promoting Corsican separatists under the guise of human rights. Would Spain tolerate foreign government funding of NGO campaigns involving the violent Basque conflict? But here, as in other areas, Israel is singled out and subject to different rules.  
Taken together, the large sums provided to NGOS by European governments through secret processes constitute a major effort to manipulate the Israeli marketplace of ideas. This is inherently colonialistic, undermining the goals of Zionism and Jewish sovereign equality.  
For example, Adalah's 2007 "Democratic Constitution" seeks to abolish the Law of Return; Mada al-Carmel's "Haifa Declaration," featuring the EU logo, calls for a "change in the definition of the State of Israel from a Jewish state" and accuses Israel of "exploiting" the Holocaust "at the expense of the Palestinian people." In the judicial arena, dozens of politicized court cases are brought by these NGOs, making them "repeat players" with an unfair advantage that greatly distorts the legal process.  
Externally, officials from fringe ideological NGOs frequently speak at UN sessions on human rights, in churches and on university campuses, where they demonize Israel with terms like "apartheid," "ethnic cleansing," "genocide" and "war crimes." The allegations in the Goldstone report on the Gaza war are in some cases copied directly from reports of more than 20 NGOs funded by Europe, and many are also involved in the boycotts, divestment and sanctions campaign based on the Durban NGO Forum strategy of isolating Israel. The Coalition of Women for Peace, which receives grants from the EU, operates the "Who Profits?" divestment Web site, which tracks Israeli and international corporations allegedly "involved in the occupation." "Who Profits?" was central in the anti-Israel divestment campaign in Norway, and a similar project has begun in Britain. In parallel, using European funding, B'Tselem lobbyists in Washington and London campaign for the adoption of the Goldstone report, and oppose the policies of Israel's elected government. And the travel expenses provided to Breaking the Silence are used to promote its efforts to spread allegations of war crimes around the world. The use of taxpayer funds for this political warfare against Israel is unjustifiable.  
The first step to ending this practice is a law to require full transparency - a principle that European officials preach, but when it comes to Israel, do not practice. Before any NGO can accept foreign government funding, the details of the grant would have to be made public. Israeli law should also require full notification when the money is used, so that the backing for NGO activities - newspaper ads, political protests and conferences - is clearly stated. Transparency would also allow European parliamentary oversight and expose the absence of professional evaluation of the purposes to which funds have been put.  
Opponents and critics of research exposing European government funding allege that transparency requirements would hinder free speech. This is a diversion: Free speech is not the issue. As should be the case in civil society activities, private funding will always be available from local and Diaspora supporters for organizations representing the full spectrum of ideologies, including for allegations (real and fabricated) regarding human rights and related issues. Their main fear is that transparency will lead responsible Europeans to reconsider the wisdom of sending tens of millions of government euros, pounds and krona to favored Israeli fringe NGOs. Transparency may not halt the European practice of using Israeli NGOs to sell these agendas and manipulate policy and politics, but this is an important beginning.

<title>Not refusal at all</title>
<date>Wed Nov 25 02:28:28 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The clandestine gathering of the heads of the hesder yeshivas (which combine Torah study with military service) this week in Jerusalem let the cat out of the bag. Anyone who thinks it really is possible to describe those from the hesder yeshivas who raise signs and oppose evacuation as "refuseniks" must now understand that the old definitions no longer suit the settlers' domination of the Israeli reality.  
If we add to them IDF Chief Rabbi Avichai Rontzki, who a week ago said "Troops who show mercy to the enemy will be damned," it is difficult not to reach the dismal conclusion that the Israel Defense Forces is but a clear expression of this domination.  
Who are the rabbis who met to discuss the "IDF attack against the hesder yeshivas"? Rabbi Eliezer Melamed, his father Rabbi Zalman Baruch Melamed, Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu, Rabbi Yaakov Yosef and many others, all of whom are familiar to the Israeli public in one connection: undermining Israeli sovereignty. They have all come out openly against the legal system. They all have an ultra-Orthodox, faith-based worldview. They all promised their public that "there will be no disengagement" and when it began they spurred soldiers to fight against it.  
They all conduct messianic activity. For example, Rabbi Yehoshua Shapira - the students of his Ramat Gan yeshiva "illuminate the city" with Shabbat candles and booths for laying tefillin (phylacteries), and hold Hasidic dancing and awareness ceremonies that are controversial even in the religious community.  
They are all dragging the students into a stringent separation between men and women, and are forcing the IDF to subordinate itself to these extremist norms. They all support, to some degree or other, the "hilltop youth," for example Rabbi Eliezer Melamed, who in his book "Revivim" called them "the dear hilltop youth, who devote themselves to settling the land and making the desert bloom."  
They all teach their students that the blood of a Jew is redder than the blood of others, certainly than the blood of Arabs. In general, they all divide the world into Jews and the rest, like Rabbi Rontzki, who is praised in the hardali (ultra-Orthodox nationalist) press for the "revolution" he has brought about in the IDF and for his success in minimizing the influence of the Education Corps as compared to the military rabbinate, which is now in charge of the sphere of values.  
Since the establishment of the Gush Emunim settler movement this group has had one project, which is becoming increasingly focused: to impose their worldview on Israeli society, until the Green Line dissolves and we all become settlers. Today, more than ever, this goal is close to being realized. The fact is that the prime minister, defense minister and chief of staff are all speaking in a hollow and unsubstantial way about their opposition to "refusal from any direction," including draft evasion. As though it were all the same thing.  
And in fact the settlers, in whose eyes any means of penetrating public awareness are kosher, are now using explanations taken from the lexicon of draft evasion and the discourse of individual rights characteristic of the liberals of north Tel Aviv.  
They no longer say "Eretz Israel" ("the Land of Israel") but rather "A Jew does not expel a Jew." Not "the sanctity of the land," but "we have to support parents whose children are forced by the army to carry out missions against their consciences." How touching. And how well it disconnects the political-ideological element from the discourse.  
After all, we can understand a soldier whose conscience does not allow him to shoot on Shabbat, can't we? Well, the answer is absolutely not. That is precisely the path to the hardali takeover of the IDF: The rabbis have succeeded in keeping women away from their students, encourage them to turn to a rabbi on any issue related to "conscience" or "ethics," and have created a blatant separation between soldiers who have to obey every order every day of the week, and their favorites, the skullcap wearers.  
There can no doubt: The domination of the Israeli reality by the settler norm is a successful enterprise. Every fiery speech by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who bangs on the table with his fist and declares that "we will not agree to refusal from any side," and every demonstration of evasiveness by Defense Minister Ehud Barak who threatens to punish opponents of evacuation but ingratiates himself with the hesder yeshivas and says that we must not harm all of them "because of a handful of refuseniks," are increasing this domination.  
Just as the Supreme Court once permitted the two different legal systems in the territories and created a basis for apartheid, the political establishment is allowing the destroyers of democracy, who want to replace sovereignty with the rabbinate, to take it apart from within. That's not refusal at all. That's war.

<title>Obama is changing the rules of Mideast pressure</title>
<date>Mon May 11 02:39:32 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
It is not hard to imagine what a tumult it would stir in Jerusalem if the United States decided to temporarily ease the pressure on Iran regarding its nuclear program. Or if President Barack Obama ordered a freeze, for the time being, on the sanctions against Syria. God help the U.S. administration if it even considers lifting the boycott on the Hamas rulers in the Gaza Strip before the Palestinian group agrees to a two-state solution within the 1967 borders. And how nice that Congress is delaying the emergency assistance package to the Palestinian Authority until a new government is formed in Ramallah, in order to ensure that it's one we like.
International pressure on neighbors has always been a welcome and even essential tool. Without pressure from the outside why would Iran give up, voluntarily, its nuclear capability? If the United States does not pressure Syria to disengage from terrorist groups, what reason does Damascus have to clash with Hamas and Hezbollah? Were it not for the pressure applied by the Reagan administration on the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Palestinian National Council would not have declared a cessation of the armed struggle against Israel and would not have adopted UN Resolution 242. Presumably Benjamin Netanyahu will not complain about pressure that the Obama administration might apply against the Palestinians; for example, to push them to recognize Israel as a state of the Jewish people.
However, the legitimacy of international pressure comes to an end when it has to do with Israeli interests, or more precisely, with what the politician at the wheel perceives as Israeli interests. Why should the European Union pressure Netanyahu to resume the negotiations on a permanent settlement? Where did this audacity come from, to condition upgrading ties with Israel on the commitment of its government to abide by a two-state solution? What are they thinking? Are we Arabs? When Israel promises the U.S. president to evacuate outposts and freeze settlement activity, it does not need any pressure to keep its promises. In our case, our word counts for something.
Like a spoiled child, Israel is in no rush to willingly surrender real estate it holds and has settled for decades. (A survey by Prof. Daniel Bar-Tal and Dr. Eran Halperin found that 53 percent of Israelis consider the West Bank liberated territory and only a minority sees it as occupied territory?.) Even though the threat of Israel becoming a binational or apartheid state increases annually, such pressure is insufficient to make it pull out of the territories. Israeli decision makers have decided to give up the territories only if the price of the status quo, in foreign currency, is much higher than the price they will have to pay in local currency for the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of settlers and the division of Jerusalem.
Obama had already announced during the campaign for the presidency that a "friend of Israel" is not, in his opinion, synonymous with being a Likud member. In his first days at the White House he has made clear that whether a two-state solution is acceptable to a Likud government or not, that is the only formula up for negotiation. Moreover, according to Quartet envoy Tony Blair, the establishment of a Palestinian state is considered a U.S. national interest in Obama's eyes. This means that pressure on Israel to end the conflict with the Arabs will certainly not disrupt efforts to pressure Iran to halt its nuclear program, and may even contribute to it.
President George W. Bush enjoyed the title "friend of Israel" because he made do with paying lip service to pressure on Israel and passed around documents that lacked teeth. He taught the Israelis that it is possible to behave contemptuously and make a laughingstock of the road map, all the while preserving a most important strategic asset - special ties with the United States. Obama has already managed to alter the rules of the game of the U.S. in the Middle East; everyone, with no exception, is welcome to choose between understandings and sanctions, between carrots and sticks.
The question is not whether Obama will pressure Israel; the pressure is already there. There were times when an invitation to an Arab leader to Washington before an invitation to an Israeli prime minister was considered a serious offense. Once a visit by an American president to a neighboring Arab state, without a promise to also come to Israel, was interpreted as serious pressure.
The repertoire of pressure available to the president of the United States is extensive and multifaceted. It looks like we will have to learn about it the hard way.

<title> Obama's choice: Truman or Marshall </title>
<date>Mon Jan 19 01:37:32 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Click here for more articles by Akiva Eldar
In March 1948, then-U.S. secretary of state George Marshall informed president Harry Truman that he personally would not vote for Truman due to the president's support for the establishment of the State of Israel. Marshall argued that this contradicted American interests and accused Truman of supporting Israel out of electoral considerations - namely, Jewish money and votes. Marshall was being a bit unfair: The Holocaust of European Jewry also affected Truman's support for the establishment of a Jewish state. At that time, the prospect of a black man entering the White House seemed like science fiction.  
Today, Barack Obama has received the votes, and the money, of about 80 percent of American Jews, even though his rival, John McCain, was more outspokenly sympathetic to the Jewish state. Israelis were the only people in the world who hoped the Republican candidate would win. The new president can thus permit himself to reexamine the "special relationship" with Israel, especially with regard to its shared values with the United States and its contribution to American interests.  
What shared values did the black American liberal observe over the last few days as he watched the broadcasts of sites bombed by Israel in the heart of the world's most densely populated region? Is it possible to expect that the memory of the horrors of the Holocaust will influence Obama's relationship with Israel? Last week, a Jewish member of Britain's parliament said his grandmother was not murdered by the Nazis in order to provide a pretext for Israeli soldiers to murder Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza.  
The spokesman for the Israeli consulate in New York boasted of the masses who attended a solidarity demonstration with the children of Sderot. He did not mention the masses of Jews who do not know where to hide their shame at the sight of pictures of Palestinian men weeping bitterly over the families who perished under the ruins of their houses.  
Israeli spokesmen try to cope with the values question by using the following question/argument: "Would the United States have restrained itself in the face of ongoing rocket fire from Mexico at its children, in its sovereign territory?" It is hard to believe that such a comparison will make any impression on an intelligent man like Obama. Mexico is not under an American aerial and naval blockade, nor is it considered occupied territory under international law. The U.S. Army and American settlers have not controlled parts of Mexico for the past 41 years (and the United States was a guarantor of the Oslo Accords, which stated that Gaza and the West Bank constitute a single political entity).  
As for Israel's contribution to American interests, the second component of the "special relationship," this has been in doubt for years. Every time Jews kill Arabs in the territories, American flags are burned in Egypt and Jordan. In both of its wars against Iraq, the United States managed (or failed to manage) without Israel's help, and even thanked it for remaining on the sidelines. And fear of the pro-Israel lobby sometimes compels the administration and Congress to subordinate their policy to Israel, in violation of American interests. There is no better example of this than the restraint displayed by the last two U.S. administrations toward the ongoing expansion of the settlements, which utterly contradicts the Oslo process, the road map peace plan and the Annapolis declaration.  
Obama has two choices. First, he can let the Israelis bleed and kill all the way to an ostracized apartheid state, observing from the sidelines as Israel endangers peace in the Middle East and undermines his country's interests, just as George Marshall predicted. The second option is to stand at Israel's side in its struggle to achieve peace and maintain its Jewish and moral character en route to regional acceptance, which has been offered by 22 Arab states. Or in other words, to finish Truman's work.

<title>On praising Tel Aviv and its wonders </title>
<date>Wed Jun 17 02:17:32 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
As the first Hebrew city celebrates its centennial, there are patriots and nationalists in this country who are disrespectful to one of the greatest achievements of the Zionist revolution. The coarse remarks by Shlomi Katabi, the outgoing police commander of the Judea and Samaria District, in condemnation of Tel Aviv are an example of this deplorable trend. On the other hand, it has also become fashionable to declare Tel Aviv an island of sanity and enlightenment in the dark sea of fanaticism called the State of Israel. "Tel Aviv is the oasis of normalcy in an insane country," Gideon Levy replied to Katabi ("Yes, we do drink espresso," Haaretz English Edition, June 7).  
And how exactly does this realm of normality manage to exist in the very heart of an insane country? What is preventing the state from imposing its madness on the stubborn city? Who is protecting Tel Aviv and preventing its occupation by Jewish nationalism, which, as everyone knows, hungers for conquests? United Nations forces? Perhaps the forces of the Arab League?  
After all, this is no remote corner, but rather the country's economic and cultural center. Shouldn't this influence one's take on Israeli society and government? Of course, the very claim that all the enlightenment in Israel is concentrated in Tel Aviv - and that beyond its boundaries only darkness and fanaticism prevail - is neither enlightened nor liberal nor multicultural. Let us, however, assume for purposes of this discussion that the forces of darkness have prevailed in every place in Israel except for Tel Aviv; why haven't they vanquished Tel Aviv itself?  
In the 20th century there were a number of liberal cities that found themselves under the control of a benighted nationalist regime. Berlin had been known as Red Berlin. It was controlled by the Social Democrats and culturally, it was a tolerant, progressive and cosmopolitan city with a prominent Jewish presence. Berlin remained neither red nor cosmopolitan after January of 1933.  
Cape Town was once a liberal and pluralist city, in South African terms; the Cape Province even gave blacks the right to vote. However, after the nationalists came into power and imposed apartheid, those laws also applied to Cape Town.  
Alexandria, too, was once an open, tolerant, multi-ethnic and multicultural city - until it felt the touch of Arab nationalism. But today, the Egyptian city is what Gamal Abdel Nasser made of it.  
Tel Aviv, however, blossomed, flourished and became more and more modern and liberal precisely during the years when the country's elite opinion makers decided that Israel is at one and the same time a fascist state and a third-world country, as well as being the only third-world country that it is permissible to call fascist.  
There is, of course, something unique about Tel Aviv, but during those years of the city's flourishing, the entire country also became freer. The recent outrageous proposals aimed at imprisoning those who reject Zionist ideology will fail. They will not alter the reality that Israeli citizens are freer today to curse and execrate their country than they were in 1967 or in 1977 - and in this we take pride.  
Jerusalem was shaped only in part by Zionism and the State of Israel; Tel Aviv, however, is the handiwork of the Zionist revolution, and its purest expression. Anyone who rejects the Zionist project in principle should not glorify Tel Aviv, since the city represents not only Zionism's achievements, but also its price. Those who praise Tel Aviv praise Israel and the national movement that established it. One should know what one is praising.

<title>Please, with might </title>
<date>Sun May 17 02:25:27 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
The headline of this piece may be taken from a Kabbalistic prayer, but it's not aimed at God; this is rather an earthly plea to the American president. The statesman he will be hosting tomorrow has already shown during his brief tenure that might is the only language he understands. We should hope that Barack Obama will succeed just like the defense minister and the Histadrut labor federation chairman, who twisted Benjamin Netanyahu's arm in the budget deliberations.  
A political U-turn by the prime minister is much more vital to Israel than his impressively sharp economic U-turn. Obama is the final hope: Only if he throws his entire weight into the process will anything in the Middle East start moving. Any American president could have long ago brought about substantial progress, first and foremost ending the intolerable Israeli occupation. But Obama's predecessors shrank from the task, preferring to yield to the Jewish and Christian lobbies and to engage in masquerades of negotiations leading nowhere.  
A whole lot more is expected from Obama: "Change" in the Middle East; "Yes We Can" is also about Israel. This change must encompass two components: Genuinely pressuring Israel - and no, there isn't any other way - and demanding actions rather than words. We've had plenty of the latter, and it doesn't really matter if Netanyahu utters the words "two states" or if he does not.  
The real test is Moshe and Mohammed. Only if both of them feel a change can we say a truly different president is now in Washington. Mohammed, any Mohammed living in the occupied territories, should feel his life has become more free and prosperous; Moshe, any Moshe living in Israel, must feel he is withdrawing from being an occupier, after two successive generations. At the end of the day, both Moshe and Mohammed will be grateful to Barack Obama.  
It'll take more than sticky smiles. Netanyahu will be clinging to his usual excuse, the Iranian threat; Obama will have to explain that there is nothing like neutralizing the Arab-Israeli conflict to secure the future of the State of Israel. And this should be the order of the day, too: resolving the Palestinian issue as leverage for negotiating with Iran, even if Netanyahu tries to change the agenda and buy some time. Deep inside, we yearn for an Israeli prime minister who realizes that opportunities are running out and that the alternatives are dangerous, but this hope has long since been abandoned. Israel talks two states while expanding Ma'aleh Adumim; Israel talks peace and sets out on two unneccesary wars.  
Which is why, sadly, nothing will happen without pressure, and true pressure can come only from Washington. An American president who is a friend to Israel not only can, but must, apply this pressure; Israel is a protectorate addicted to occupation - and the only way to ditch a habit is the hard way. A bogus friend sponsors the addiction, a true friend gets us into rehab.  
Nor is this the time to present the Palestinians with endless demands or preconditions - to acknowledge, to give up, to compromise. They've done it plenty over the last two decades: Now is the time for the occupier to end the occupation, immediately, unconditionally, moments before the two-state solution draws its final breath and passes beyond the realm of possibility, if it hasn't already. Which is why Obama should be standing with a stopwatch, too: Time is running out.  
There's one message that should emerge from Washington: Israel is beginning to act, not to talk but to act, to end the occupation. Freeze the settlements without any lies, dismantle the outposts without tricks, give Palestinians freedoms without feints, and establish a rigid agenda to dismantle the entire settler enterprise. Anything less will be seen as failure, any move less daring will ensure a deadlock that will bring more bloodshed and the eventual establishment of a permanent binational apartheid state.  
Does it sound big and pretentious? Well, there's a big, pretentious president now sitting in Washington. The Arabs have already learned that Israel understands force and force alone; all its limited concessions were carried out after bloodshed, never before. It's time Washington learns the same lesson: Please, with might, Barack Obama, because there is no other way.

<title>Protesting with a prize in their hands </title>
<date>Mon Oct 12 07:16:01 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The Tel Aviv municipality's decision to award the Dizengoff Prize to artist David Reeb has stirred up protests and calls that the award be rescinded after it turned out that Reeb has called for sanctions on Israel and signed a petition against events honoring Tel Aviv at Toronto's film festival. According to the petition, identifying with Tel Aviv is the same as identifying with white Johannesburg in the apartheid era.  
The protests were duly rejected, of course. As a rule, from the moment a competent panel awards a prize out of professional considerations, attempts to have the decision rescinded for political reasons should be avoided. Liberal democracy today not only tolerates, but even pampers and embraces its denouncers.  
It may be infuriating and a little perverse, but on the whole liberal democracy is a good deal. There's no need to get worked up over the abuse leveled by radical prize winners, the establishment's spoiled brats. The question is not why the Israeli establishment decides sometimes to reward people who depict Israel as a fascist apartheid state, but rather why people who depict Israel that way are prepared to accept prizes and honors from the establishment of such a state. What does it say about them, their integrity, honesty and seriousness?
Who's heard of an Italian anti-fascist who received a prize from Benito Mussolini? What would we say about the sincerity and self-respect of such a person? Did the opponents of apartheid in South Africa get prizes and honors from the government? Certainly not. And my grandfather, who was a revolutionary anarchist in Czarist Russia, never received any awards from Nicholas II for his activities. There wasn't a single revolutionary on the committee organizing the celebrations of the Romanov dynasty's anniversary in 1913.
Clearly, these repressive regimes did not offer their opponents awards and honors like today's liberal governments. Even South Africa, which was less harsh to its white critics, certainly didn't pamper them. The Israeli establishment's conduct in this regard attests to the liberal and democratic nature of this country's system of government.  
Of course, the radical left won't acknowledge this. Some of its supporters see the root of all evil in the very fact that the Jewish people have a state of their own. They are generally unwilling to say anything favorable about this country. Others refer to the evil perpetrated by the government. And indeed, the evil of which they speak does exist, in the form of the occupation and Israel's contribution to its perpetuation - the settlements.  
The refusal on the radical left to deal seriously with the Palestinians' contribution, with the threats Israel faces, or with the evil latent in Arab nationalism and Islamic fundamentalism creates a picture of reality that is more a lie than truth, but it is impossible to say there is no truth in it. In such a situation, we cannot expect that everyone will accept authoritative definitions regarding the political reality or even the Israeli government. We can only expect all people who adopt a certain definition - including a radical one - to be consistent and honest with themselves.  
Whoever wishes, therefore, can argue, however groundless it may be in my opinion, that a unique and sophisticated form of fascism has evolved in Israel, one that does not prevent the establishment from embracing its denouncers. And still the question remains, why are these denouncers willing to accept the establishment's pampering? No one can expect people to give up their livelihoods - even an anti-fascist has to eat - but what about prizes and honors? Sartre rejected the Nobel Prize without calling the people who offered it to him fascists. Even in the eyes of those who claim that Israeli fascism is real, despite its liberal attitude to its political opponents, it must be clear that Israeli anti-fascism is phony.

<title>The binationalism vogue </title>
<date>Thu Apr 30 01:02:26 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Judging by the increasing number of symposia around the world devoted to promoting a binational state instead of two states for two peoples, a sea change is underway among academics and organizations engaged in progressive thinking.  
A generation ago, the demand for establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel expressed a radical, post-Zionist stance. Now that this position has been deemed acceptable by the heart of the establishment, and even serves as the platform of centrist political parties, the circles that fought for it are distancing themselves from it. In its stead has come talk of a binational state.  
Is a new trend taking shape? And are those who adhere to the old formula in danger of losing their position as the leaders of progressive thinking? Will the skeptics and naysayers opposed to a binational state today claim in a few years that they always favored this approach?  
Without a doubt, the intense interest is not solely academic or intellectual in nature. The steep decline in Israel's standing in the wake of its violent actions has spurred attempts to undermine the legitimacy of the Jewish state - and even the legitimacy of the Jewish collective in Israel - by advocating a binational formula. Those hostile to Israel have discovered that the call for one state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, a state based on civil and collective equality, is a powerful propaganda tool, because it is based on universal norms that enable critics to denounce Israel as an apartheid state.  
Israelis who seek to earnestly examine various models that could serve as the basis of a future sovereign entity at times find themselves being used as fig leaves to cover up efforts to spread anti-Israel propaganda. But this is always the lot of those who pursue new avenues. We should not rule out participating in such a discussion by denouncing it as illegitimate, because it is taking place in the shadow of the reality that has taken hold in the territories and in the midst of a diplomatic stalemate.  
Several factors have combined to rouse greater interest in the binational option. First, there is a growing realization that the chances of establishing an independent, viable Palestinian state no longer exist, aside from an entity along the lines of a Bantustan. Second, the status quo that has emerged, though it appears chaotic, is in practice quite stable and could be characterized as de facto binational. Third, the diplomatic positions of Benjamin Netanyahu's government inevitably lead to a diplomatic deadlock and a deepening of the policy of annexation.  
Under these circumstances, it appears that the continued preoccupation with establishing a Palestinian state is not just hopeless, but also injurious, since the delusions that it fosters enable the continuation of the status quo.  
Nothing serves the interests of Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman better than the demand that they recognize the principle of "two states." What happens if they agree to it? They do not intend to offer the Palestinians any proposals more generous than those Mahmoud Abbas already turned down in talks with Ehud Olmert. And in the meantime, they would have a free hand to expand settlements. Even the impassioned pleas for the Obama administration to finally enforce the "road map" lead to the same smokescreen of imagined progress toward a dead end.  
But if the fictitious option is taken off the table, the real dilemmas will finally be revealed. And this is precisely what the talk of a binational state seeks to accomplish.  
It is customary to classify people as belonging to either the left or the right on the basis of their positions toward "the Arabs," with the standard litmus test being a person's position on a Palestinian state. But take away this acid test, and after a short period of confusion, people's real positions on issues such as civic equality and the right to determine one's own future will be revealed. And then, to our amazement, left-wingers will be exposed as rightists and vice versa.  
But in any event, discussion about a binational state should not be of interest only to the radical left. For if the two-state option melts away, the burden of coping with a binational reality will fall on all of us.

<title>The carrot's moment has arrived </title>
<date>Tue Jun 16 01:12:48 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
After Israel conquered Sinai in 1956, the United States allowed David Ben-Gurion to make his speech about the "Third Kingdom of Israel." The Americans then sent the Israel Defense Forces quickly back to their tents. Had the Americans also wanted to resolve the conflict in 1967, they would have gotten Israel out of the territories four or five wars ago, with the same ease with which they coerced Yitzhak Rabin's first government into the first separation-of-forces agreement with Egypt. But the years went by, the dead were buried, the disabled have covered many long kilometers in their wheelchairs, the American peace plans have continued to create hopes, and the United States has not expelled Israel from the Palestinian territories.  
In his memoirs, Henry Kissinger boasts how he pulled the wool over Andrei Gromyko's eyes when the Soviet foreign minister thought the Geneva conference after the 1973 war would bring a comprehensive solution agreed on by the great powers. The Palestinian question would be included. Kissinger also boasts how he put together, behind the Soviets' backs, the disengagement agreements between Egypt and Israel in anticipation of a partial and separate peace. This is the key to reading the region's history.  
A withdrawal by us from the territories was always the American carrot. A carrot is accompanied by a stick, and over the years it was an Israeli stick, to the joy of our security elite (an inseparable part of the state's leadership since 1967). For example, there were the bombings deep inside Egypt of cities and their residents, factories and even a school during study hours. This happened without pity, without the High Court of Justice, without B'Tselem.  
The system worked. In less than 30 years, the entire Middle East, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, underwent a pro-Western change, except for the Syrians (who have not yet received their territories). In 1967, on the eve of the occupation, the United States was at its lowest point in the region. The three secular regimes - Egypt, Iraq and Syria - were closer than ever to the Soviet Union, and no one serious would guarantee the existence of the two feudal regimes - Jordan and Saudi Arabia.  
The turning point came with the Israeli victory. Today the Middle East is not merely poorer, it is fragmented, beaten and fundamentalist, and Israel has apparently completed its role. The fact that it identified itself as an ally and not a stick, and the fact that talk about withdrawal was always seen as an edict that did not necessarily have to be met is part of our tragedy in which the return to the 1967 borders and an independent Palestinian state have never been considered by the majority as being in our interest. And this is without any connection to the American policy that for many years did not favor a Palestinian state and therefore did not really oppose the settlements.  
Now it seems the shrunken peace camp is again waiting for the sheriff to release us from the imbroglio created by our governments - settlements, taking over the Palestinian water economy and integrating the West Bank into Israel (without integrating its subjects).  
If U.S. President Barack Obama indeed plans to solve the conflict, the carrot's great moment has arrived. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech stuttered despite all its fluency and sweated from being so dry. He seemed to be waiting for the moment in which, within the American agglomeration of interests, the U.S. religious right would strengthen, led by Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin and the military industries, the greatest beneficiaries of the special relations with Israel (like our military elite, which has been living in a fool's paradise since 1967).  
The Israeli war machine has apparently done its job and can now close shop. Already in the 1991 Gulf War, it was hinted that the IDF should keep its equipment and weapons empire for policing the towns and villages in the occupied territories, or for harsh strikes in Lebanon (until it becomes completely Westernized). Over the decades, this machine has turned us into a nation that lives by the sword, drugged as if its power were unlimited. It's a nation that protects a system for building settlements that is nothing more than an apartheid state.  
No one will free us from the labyrinth if we do not do it ourselves. For that we need to be ready for a confrontation as well. Certainly not to build a national consensus around "large settlement blocs."

<title>The covenant for the land </title>
<date>Sun Dec 20 01:12:20 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Since the first half of the 20th century, it has been impossible to speak of obedience to the rule of law as a supreme value, but important in this respect regarding the settlers, their rabbis and soldiers is not disobedience but the entire concept of sovereignty. The sovereign, from their standpoint, is not the electorate. A proclamation by the Greater Land of Israel movement already in 1967, in the name of which Yitzhak Rabin would be murdered years later, said the following: "Inasmuch as we have no authority to relinquish the State of Israel, we are also commanded to maintain what we received from it [the state] - the Land of Israel .... And no Israeli government is entitled to relinquish this as an integral whole."  
This stance is linked in its very essence to Zionism's "secular" roots. The signatories to that proclamation by the Greater Land of Israel, some of whom came from the left, defined themselves then as right-wingers - it was a distinction that began after 1967 as an answer to the implied question "Who is the sovereign?" While the settlers talk about their consciences, the interviewers stammer because they think there's a difference between religious and secular people in this context. In fact, a different question should be asked: On what basis did these messianic people obtain their great power, and what is the connection between the Labor movement's Land of Israel and the settlers?  
The time has come to acknowledge that the most important undertaking of the State of Israel, within narrow or expanded borders, has always been to maintain the supremacy of the Jews. In the 1950s, when looting Arab land was at its height, even Marxists were assigned to do the job. The role only passed to the right wing when, after 1967, the task became replete with contradictions, and the contradictions could only be resolved with the help of the Almighty, the Holy One Blessed Be He, and his militarist representatives. In any event, to this day, when the secular elite collaborates in excluding the Arabs, the state has no need for settlers or the hesder yeshivas that combine Torah study with military service.  
For example, at the University of Haifa, 20 percent of the students are Arab, but the faculty that very much enjoys its privileges is purely Jewish, if one overlooks the few who are not. But here there is no concern about compromising Jewish hegemony and redistributing wealth as a result of changed demographics. The hedonistic elite continues to collaborate with apartheid. The University of Haifa will not pursue any kind of affirmative action, but its people will feel disgust for the hesder yeshivas.  
Thus, when the country has no better representatives than academics, yuppies who move to Jaffa, residents of purely Jewish communities from the Galilee who work in Haifa, only then does the state summon its messianism and its violent soldiers.  
For example, in mixed Jewish-Arab towns, instead of telling the Arab residents that they can't surpass a 30 percent presence (which is apparently the quota in those cities), they give rights to a yeshiva, which discovers ancient Jewish roots - even in Acre, where it is not clear when the city was Jewish. They then make the Arabs' lives miserable until the Arabs move to Arab villages that the country's modern infrastructure has bypassed.  
There is nothing here that some future historian could not explain as the absolute logic of a systematic state effort at gradual expulsion, either in the occupied territories or within the state's borders, each area at its own pace. All you have to do is examine infant-mortality figures or the education budget in the Arab community in Israel to understand that there is no conflict between Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Rabbi Eliezer Melamed of the Har Bracha hesder yeshiva, who called on soldiers to disobey orders to remove settlers. This is the true historic covenant, whether in Nablus or Jaffa or Haifa.

<title>The 'guardians' of Israeli academia </title>
<date>Fri Oct 23 01:53:19 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Israeli academics are being watched. Vigilantes check what they say or write - and, if they are judged "anti-Israel," incite donors to the universities and colleges where they teach to act against them. Students are encouraged to spy on their teachers and to report what they say.  
Academics on the left are the targets. They are vilified as "Israel's academic fifth column" and "our inner scourge." They are called "traitors" and are accused of "treasonous betrayal" and of wanting "to suck up to and be accepted by the enemy."  
One vigilante group is Israel Academia Monitor (IAM) started five years ago by the American-born Dana Barnett. Another is IsraCampus, which does not reveal who its organizers are although many of its articles are written by Seth J. Frantzman, also from the United States.  
Prof. David Newman, of the department of politics and government at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU), who has been a target for attack, warns: "The academic McCarthyism of the right endangers Israeli democracy and society. It threatens the very basis of freedom of speech."  
Newman, who has spent the past three years working informally on behalf of Israel's universities against the academic boycott attempts in Europe, sees these so-called watchdog groups as causing as much harm to Israel's academic community and reputation as the Israel boycotters themselves.  
Both IAM and IsraCampus say they are modeled after Campus Watch in the United States, which is controversial for its monitoring of Middle East studies at American universities and of academics who are critical of Israel.  
Barnett sends out near-daily e-mails fingering and quoting named academics, and decides when protest and dissent are "anti-Israel." Every e-mail ends by asking the recipient: "Are you a donor to Israeli universities? Learn about what is happening on Israeli campuses." She urges donors to know "what is being done with your gifts and generosity" and to "speak about anti-Israel Israeli academics when you are in touch with university officials." She does not say who funds her work. She has acknowledged in a newspaper interview that "most of them are from abroad," and claims they are "Zionists with a love of Israel."  
The vigilantes totally attack any boycotts from abroad of Israel. But they want to use boycotts against the Israeli academics they condemn. They do not seem aware of the obvious contradiction in their stance.  
Inevitably, Dr. Neve Gordon, the BGU political science lecturer who has been in the headlines for urging a boycott of Israel, is a particular target for them: IAM has for weeks now been soliciting signatures for a petition urging that he be dismissed as chair of the politics and government department and from any university committee, that all his courses be made electives rather than required, and that he be denied travel and research funding.  
The response from international academic networks has not been long in coming. Respected academics throughout the world are said to have written letters to BGU President Rivka Carmi and to the Israel Academy of Sciences, protesting this attempt to infringe on the freedom of speech.  
The vigilantes have also gone after Israeli academics who expressed support for Gordon.  
Their net of condemnation is cast wide, and includes: Iaroslav Youssim, of the School of Social Work of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who was listed after circulating an invitation to a weekly "Stand Up for Jerusalem" march against Israel's occupation policies in the city. Dr. Kobi Snitz, professor of mathematics at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, is listed for having served 20 days' in jail for trying to prevent soldiers from demolishing a house in a Palestinian village as well as other activities, such as "support[ing] Palestinian struggle against Israel." Also Dr. David Shulman, of the Hebrew University department of comparative religions, was named after writing about a court case in which colleagues were acquitted on charges of disorderly behavior during a protest. Former foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, a former head of Tel Aviv University's history department, is listed for his review, in Foreign Affairs magazine, of Benny Morris' history of the 1948 war.  
IAM got itself into a knot, however, over the call by Tova Rosen, of BGU's Hebrew literature department, and many others for civil disobedience against three antidemocratic Knesset bills. IAM acknowledged that civil disobedience was a "time-honored expression of protest in democracies." But in classic McCarthyite style it added a dark warning that the "Communist Party" was involved in this particular case - even though it said it did not know what role, if any, the party played.  
IsraCampus has what it calls a "Rogues Gallery," with scores of names. Who are these dangerous people? They include many of Israel's most distinguished intellectuals: Amoz Oz ("and his ilk") features, as does historian and Haaretz journalist Tom Segev ("anti-Israel Israeli"), plus educator and feminist Dr. Alice Shalvi and Prof. Mordechai Kremnitzer, of the Hebrew University's Faculty of Law.  
No doubt the vigilantes view themselves as super-patriots serving Israel's interests. The opposite is true. They are dangerous cranks. The crude censorship they use to shut up academics runs counter to the most cherished beliefs about freedom of speech in Western democracies. They undermine Israel's status as a democracy.  
Benjamin Pogrund is a South African-born journalist who learned about academic freedom as a student, fighting against the imposition of apartheid on universities.

<title>The princess and Ivan the Terrible </title>
<date>Fri Feb 06 01:46:26 IST 2009</date>
<content>
This is not the title of a children's book but one that sums up the situation today, as we head for the 18th Knesset elections on Tuesday. On the one hand, we are facing colossal defense, economic and social problems, and on the other, a political rift. No matter what government comes to power, it will be led by a prime minister who has won by the tiniest of margins and a defense minister who doesn't understand how he it that he did not wind up back in the prime minister's seat, considering what a genius he is.  
This government will also have a coalition partner who will kick himself at the thought that an inexperienced princess has beat him, by a mere hairsbreadth, and all the while Avigdor Lieberman will be hovering in the background, spewing venom and threatening to turn Israel into a binational state.  
And then the question will arise of whether this government is capable of handling the challenges posed by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Will it have the power to carry out withdrawals and evacuate tens of thousands of settlers? With all the hot air and hatemongering at home, all we have done is confuse ourselves to death. With less than a week to go before the elections, the vote is totally splintered and everyone is at each other's throat.  
The Likud is attacking Kadima and Labor, but wants Ehud Barak for defense minister without Labor. Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu is dreaming of a world without Kadima.   
Barak himself is dying to be prime minister, and out of frustration is attacking Tzipi Livni as unsuitable for the job.  
And let's not forget that he was the one who threw the wrench into the works when Livni tried to form a new coalition and avoid going to the polls, with his batty demands to be acting prime minister and have the Knesset pass a law that the head of the opposition doesn't have to be a Knesset member. With the delay Barak caused with his bizarre requests, he pushed Shas into clamoring for money and issuing ultimatums over Jerusalem.  
Many people complain that Livni didn't make proper use of the 10 days left to her to put together a government, so it was her fault we had to go to early elections.   
In my opinion, Livni only proved her worth: She showed us that she is a determined and principled politician, not a political hack and horsetrader.  
Livni is not a backslapper or a sweet-talker. She is serious about her missions - the ones she took on herself or those Olmert doled out to her with intentional stinginess, so she wouldn't hog too much of the limelight. She did not complain, but rather  carried out her duties with skill and dedication.  
If some secret "jury" has popped up a few minutes before Election Day and decided to lop off her head through the auspices of my colleague Ari Shavit ("A Cautionary Note," Haaretz, February 2), I tip my hat to her. These guys are scared. Two macho men, otherwise known as Netanyahu and Barak, who both failed as prime minister, don't want to see her being elected and becoming their boss. What they have to say about her does not appear under their name in this verdict.  
Now, about this person who was "especially agitated despite being a mature, restrained and conservative man," and told Shavit he felt like "a member of some cult with a terrible secret: Tzipi Livni is not fit to be prime minister" - what I want to know is why he and the others kept their mouths shut until a week before the elections. What are they afraid of? That little Tzipi the weakling will have them executed?  
The outcome of these elections must be the establishment of a different kind of government. The last three years will be remembered as a grim era in Israeli political history. Since the Netanyahu administration, no prime minister has gone through office without a police investigation. A former finance minister is on trial. A senior minister was found guilty of an indecent act and did not appeal.  
And we haven't even gotten yet to the bungled Second Lebanon War, or to Operation Cast Lead, for which Israeli ministers and generals may face indictment for crimes against humanity, and which may have put an end to terror, but then again, maybe did not.  
Kadima, when Ariel Sharon established it, was an innovative party with a fresh new outlook and hope for the future, based on the idea of two states for two peoples. A few days before the 2001 elections, a well-known columnist wrote why Israel must not let Sharon become prime minister. His arguments were convincing. Next thing we knew, he was Sharon's great defender, hailing him as the best thing that ever happened to us.  
Tzipi Livni is not Sharon, but she wrote the party platform at his ranch, and was his loyal helpmate all along. When she won the Kadima party nomination for prime minister, the public greeted her victory with approval and optimism.  
To her credit, let it be said that long before Lieberman popped up with his demands to take away the citizenship of a million and a half Israeli Arabs, and Netanyahu tried to rebrand the Likud as a centrist party, Livni supported the establishment of a unity government with Likud and Labor on the grounds that "the left isn't so left anymore and the right isn't so right."  
A 20-percent abstention equals dozens of seats, which could neutralize Liebermanism. Tzipi and Netanyahu would do well to join forces in a new government that will tackle both the problems of peace and the demon that is turning the country into a bastion of apartheid.  
Lieberman, like Kahane, must remain outside.

<title>The real face of Tisha B'Av </title>
<date>Sun Aug 02 01:21:18 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Israel makes a lot of fuss about Jerusalem, much more than most countries make about their capitals. Nevertheless, most Israelis don't live in Jerusalem if they can help it, just like the elites zooming down the highway to Tel Aviv at the end of a workday.  
It's easy, of course, to blame the ultra-Orthodox (the "Jews" in the Israeli version of anti-Semitism), but the truth is that our capital is a city of memorials at the military cemetery on Mount Herzl, Israel Prize ceremonies, visits to the President's Residence, Yad Vashem delegations, ugly government offices and nouveau-riche-looking central bank and Supreme Court buildings. Above all, there's the monument to idiocy known as the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University, whose construction aptly demonstrates not only blindness to West Jerusalem's urban interests, but a preference for control over love of ancient landscapes. It is also a stark illustration of the academic elite's impotence, as early as the 1970s, when they were told that we "must return to Mount Scopus". Why? Because.  
In the evenings, the city that does the most begging in the world does not resemble a capital city. The money flowing to cultural institutions and foundations to host national and international conferences produces a living for ushers and clerks more than it produces any life in the city. And most of all, that symbol built in concrete - the wall - is becoming increasingly cruel to the Palestinian residents, living under an apartheid regime. What value do the Jerusalem Film Festival or Adenauer Foundation conferences have when the Shin Bet security service arrests Palestinian guests at conferences debating their own literature and cinema?  
The wall, not the one brought down to the tunes of Naomi Shemer and Rabbi Shlomo Goren, but the one cut into the Palestinians' living flesh, separates fathers from sons, believers from places of worship, West Bank Palestinians from their cultural centers - theaters, bookstores and libraries, not to mention the long-since-stolen Rockefeller Museum.  
And still, the city we're all supposed to salute as a highly-touted symbol ("freedom of worship for all," "the city of three religions," "the eternal capital of the Jewish people") has not managed over the past 42 years to become a sacred value in its own right. Even Jerusalem Day, for all the propaganda around it, is no real holiday, compared to Independence Day or Hanukkah. Why? Well, just look at the euphoria of the national-religious community, which made Jerusalem Day into everything the secular (and Haredi) Jews never subscribed to, an omen of messianic redemption spanning from the prayer book to Almighty God and then back to construction plans and the Shin Bet.  
When the city was "united," no Zionist party could be found to oppose the annexation. Quite the contrary, they all got up to sing "Hatikva." Like antiwar protests, the talk about dividing the city comes too late: The devastation is already upon its victims. United Jerusalem demonstrates better than anything else the distance between the left, or secular, public and its leaders. The leaders always rushed to make "right-wing" decisions, assuming the electorate would have to bear with it. David Ben-Gurion was closer to Zeev Jabotinsky than to his constituents; Moshe Dayan was closer to Menachem Begin than to his voters. And for most of his years as prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin was bitterly, grudgingly alienated from Peace Now.  
Jerusalem Day is heavily promoted every year. But on the eve of Tisha B'Av, Tel Aviv, too, seemed like a worldlier Jerusalem - empty and mourning not the Temple, but the blandness of national life, characterized by a separation wall.

In our political reality, left and right are divided over their positions on the conflict. On the left, you support the peace process and recognize that this requires withdrawal from territory and concessions. On the right, you talk about security and oppose the evacuation of even the smallest settlement.  
But what about those citizens who believe in a peaceful solution but also believe in a free-market economy? That voter has no party representing him.  
If he wants to vote for Meretz, a party whose worldview for years has called for two states for two peoples, without the vacillations of Labor, the package includes a socialist worldview that backs big government, a bloated budget, high taxes and the belief that the central authority knows best what the citizen should do with his money.  
If he wants to vote for a party that represents liberal economics, he needs to support Benjamin Netanyahu, who believes in the free market, in privatization, in reducing taxes and in spurring growth.  
How is it possible to vote with a single ballot both for Jumas (Haim Oron, head of Meretz) and for Bibi? After all, there is no such party, even though a combination of Oron in politics and Netanyahu in economics makes sense to me. There's a solid common denominator here: freedom, equality and economic prosperity for all.  
At the root of the two-state notion lies the belief that the other side has the right to a normal life, to an independent state, in which life is free, liberated from the chains of occupation. This is a liberal approach that believes that all humans are equal, and that which you hate you should not do to your neighbor. Because if this is not the case, you will always have to live by the sword.  
This is also the view of liberal economics, which supports a free market in which an individual lives by the fruit of his labor, and the government intervenes as little as possible and causes the least amount of damage and disorder. Under such an economic regime an individual assumes responsibilities and gains the maximum amount of freedom and the highest possible standard of living.  
A free-market economy means limiting the national budget, thus lowering taxes, which is the best way to fuel growth. We have seen in recent years how the budget was curtailed and taxes lowered, resulting in rapid growth of 5 percent per year and in 500,000 people joining the workforce. Factories opened, and business flourished. Is there a more important social contribution than taking the unemployed and providing them with jobs? It is also worth noting that 80 percent of those newly joining the workforce came from the lower classes.  
A free-market economy does not mean complete nonintervention. The government is obligated to intervene and support the weak, the handicapped, the elderly, the unemployed and the sick. But this is possible only when the economy operates according to free-market principles. Because then there is growth, and there are resources to support the needy.  
But where can one find a party that holds dear a liberal view in both politics and socioeconomics? The one closest to this worldview is Tzipi Livni. She is the only one who is talking about peace as a strategic goal. Livni has also not hesitated to talk about the dove of peace that is sitting on the window ledge. We can be cynical about her statements, as if she is only talking peace as a campaign tactic to woo center-left voters to Kadima. But this would be wrong. Livni was among the leaders of the ideological rift with Likud that led to leaving that party and establishing Kadima. She supported the evacuation of settlers from the Gaza Strip in recognition that the dream of a greater Land of Israel has passed, and it is necessary to reach an agreement on dividing the land, including evacuating settlements; for if this is not done the nightmare of an apartheid state, or of one in which the Arab minority becomes the majority, will come true.  
In socioeconomics, Livni also shares a liberal worldview. She believes in a compassionate free-market economy. She believes in lowering taxes and in reforms. While she is not passionate about it the way Netanyahu is, we have already noted that we can't have everything.  
Livni has two other important qualities. She has proven to be honest. Her record is spotless, and that is no small thing these days. And she has also not yet failed as prime minister like Netanyahu and Ehud Barak.  
So, while our political spectrum lacks a party reflecting the full synthesis between Jumas and Bibi, the closest to it is Livni.

<title>The silence of the left </title>
<date>Mon Dec 07 02:56:12 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Forty-one years after it declared that it is incumbent on Israel to recognize "the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people" and that "the territories held by Israel will be a bargaining chip in peace negotiations," the Israeli left has fallen silent.  
Its political frameworks have collapsed. Its protest has all but ceased to exist. Whether it concluded its historic role, or passed before its time, the Labor Party collapsed, taking with it the entire left.  
One by one, its leaders have also disappeared. They have ensconced themselves in research laboratories, libraries, writing desks, boardrooms and classrooms. They have sentenced themselves to self-imposed political exile in their homes. They have found consolation in a good book, in their children and in their grandchildren.  
It was the left that outlined the principles and paved the way toward an agreement with the Palestinians. Now, as Israel reaches a crossroads between two states for two peoples on the one hand and a bi-national state on the other; between a democratic state with borders and an apartheid state; between an agreement and yet another conflagration in the Middle East, this same left remains silent.  
It is silent to the extent that one needs to peer closely to see whether it is even still breathing. Perhaps this does not bother Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak. It might even be convenient for them, but it is bad for Israel. Because when the left is silent, what needs to be said once we have reached that crossroads is not heard.  
How long will it take before international organizations and institutions that clung to the Israeli voice of reason make the decision to push us into the margin of the international community?  
It was not easy, to say the least, to demonstrate 30 and 40 years ago against Golda Meir's "there is no such thing as a Palestinian people." The tyranny of settler leader Rabbi Moshe Levinger and Co. against the Arabs of the West Bank, the theft of their lands and the torching of their crops and the policy of successive Israeli governments, all were difficult to challenge.  
The only blows I absorbed in my life were from the batons of police officers during protests in Hebron, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as well as from the fists of two individuals who ambushed me in front of the entrance to my apartment in Tel Aviv. They left behind pamphlets which read "Down with the traitors."  
This struggle, which was inevitable, exhausting and devoid of any hint of martyrdom, is without a doubt the longest and most difficult struggle waged in Israel from 1968 to the present day.  
One would need a whole series of articles to explain the discrepancy between the acceptance of the slogan "two states for two peoples" into the national consensus and the attendant collapse of the left; between Labor's capturing 44 Knesset seats under Rabin, while Meretz got 12 seats when headed by Shulamit Aloni in 1992, and the fiasco of the recent elections in which Labor mustered just 13 seats while Meretz captured just three.  
The left has not survived the "war of attrition" it has waged since 1968. Its claim that its positions won the day do not hold water. It doesn't matter who is more left-wing, be it Ehud Olmert or Haim Oron or Yuli Tamir.  
What matters is whether there is a decision. And it has yet to be made. Until there is an agreement stipulating two states for two peoples, there are no winners. Not the left, not Israel, and not the Palestinians.  
In the meantime, what we have is something that may yet endure. Maybe it is an examination. Perhaps the removal of outposts. Maybe a settlement freeze. Perhaps a jumpstart of settlement construction. Maybe a process.  
All of these represent a huge question mark - which way will Netanyahu and Barak turn at the crossroads? Toward two states or toward a bi-national state? In the fourth quarter of the game, the left is floundering on the sidelines. What a pity that it is not summoning what is left of its strength in order to call on the Israeli government and the Palestinians (yes, also the Palestinians) to return to negotiations. These are our lives and theirs as well. Does anyone else have a better option?

<title>The third threat </title>
<date>Wed Sep 30 01:08:12 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Ever since its establishment, Israel has had to deal with the threat from the Arab states. At first the Arab countries put together a military force with the aim of conquering Israel. In the face of this physical threat, Israel developed a doctrine of building a force that allowed it to thwart the invasion attempts. When the enemy realized that their approach was not effective, the doctrine of "resistance" was constructed, combining activity by states and organizations.  
This doctrine is backed by the developing of teams to send steep-trajectory weapons from civilian areas into population centers in Israel. Since this threat was identified, defense officials have been working to answer it. The Second Lebanon War and Operation Cast Lead are part of the process of formulating that answer.  
In recent years, however, an additional threat has been developing. Its main thrust: attempts by pro-Arab organizations to destroy Israel's legitimacy as a political entity. There are many examples of this such, as accusations of an apartheid policy, Holocaust denial and the claim that the state's establishment was an illegal act, as well as accusations that Israel has committed war crimes. These lead to boycotts of Israeli companies and products, academic and cultural boycotts and ultimately calls to destroy the Zionist entity.
This threat is different from the previous ones - its characteristics are not physical and the areas of action are the countries of the world and their citizens. But it combines with the physical threat in an attempt to delegitimize the Israeli response to the Hamas threat. The Goldstone report, which constitutes part of it, is creating an infrastructure that supports the filing of suits abroad against top officials in the army and defense establishment. In fact, it is possible to see the two elements of the threat, the physical and political, as two parts of a complete action against Israel.  
The Defense Ministry has led the development of a response to the changing military threat to Israel. However, the threat of delegitimization is not getting the attention it needs; it is not clear who bears the overall responsibility for dealing with this and putting together a complete response doctrine. In fact, if we accept the argument that the two threats, the physical and political, are two parts of a single threat, no one out there is looking at the picture with an overall strategic vision.  
The government's decision makers have to understand that the attacks on Israel's political legitimacy are not a mere drip but a flood. The danger that this attack will in the future influence decision makers in the international community must not be ignored. To take preventive action, we must set up a framework to examine the threat and develop a comprehensive response. It seems that in the structure of the regime here, the most suitable place is the National Security Council, which can get help from the defense establishment, the Foreign Ministry, the authorities responsible for public relations, world Jewry and pro-Israel organizations.  
During its existence, Israel has been able to create a suitable response to the changing military threat. However, a response to the delegitimization of Israel also depends on the development of a strategic outlook with respect to another important factor: the faith of the country's citizens in our national existence in this land, regardless of political disagreements. Various pro-Arab bodies in the world are trying, with some success, to confuse some of the people of this country and damage their basic belief in the Jews' right to a national home in Israel. Deepening the belief in the justice of our national existence here is one of the main tools for thwarting this plot.  
The writer is head of the military research program at the Institute for National Security Studies.

<title>The year of hatred</title>
<date>Wed Aug 12 02:10:14 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Lacking an external enemy (at least so far), 2009 should be called "the year of hatred." Israeli public discourse has focused in recent months on virulent attacks on various groups: Arabs, the ultra-Orthodox, settlers, the liberal-secular. "They" are depicted as terrible enemies plotting against us, as people whose political and social power must be broken.  
This hatred is neither coincidental nor vague. It expresses a real power struggle in Israeli society, which has always been typified by factions and tribalism. Some people want to keep their positions of power, some seek a new social order. The front lines of the struggle vary according to demographics and political correctness. These days it is unacceptable to incite against Mizrahim or people from the former Soviet Union or Ethiopia. After the recent murders at the gay community center, derogatory remarks about homosexuals have been delegitimized. It's a pity that it took bloodshed.  
Although "they," the targets of the hatred, change with time and circumstances, its manifestations are identical. The side that hates purports to speak in the name of true and proper values, while "they" are described as a danger to the state's existence: the ultra-Orthodox who want a state based on Jewish law, Arabs who want a state of all its citizens, settlers who are leading to apartheid or a binational state, secular people and leftists who are abandoning Zionism to pursue hedonism.  
As support for the claim that they constitute an existential threat, "they" are depicted as parasites and law breakers who enjoy everything good the state has to offer without assuming the burdens. The ultra-Orthodox and the Arabs do not serve in the army and "do not pay taxes," the Tel Avivians evade military service or do not join combat units, the settlers cost us billions and enjoy subsidized services, the Arabs and the settlers build without permits, the ultra-Orthodox do not work and live off the public purse.  
The rapid natural increase of the ultra-Orthodox, Arab and settler populations amplifies the anxiety: Our country is changing, it is being stolen right out of our hands; in no time they will multiply, take over and drag us down to the third world. Look how they are taking over neighborhoods and cities that were once "ours." How frightening: The Arabs who bought apartments in the Jewish neighborhood "will want to build a mosque." The ultra-Orthodox will build a synagogue and ritual bath on our street and will squeeze us out. "Jerusalem is lost." They will kidnap our children to make them religious. They will harass our daughters. Luckily, political correctness does not permit casting aspersions on the personal hygiene of the hated group, its lack of culture or sexual habits; public discourse has eschewed these repulsive stereotypes almost entirely.  
Factional hatred is characterized by the utter negation of the enemy group and by seeking ways to get rid of it or limit its burdensome presence. The side that hates wants the state to "take care of 'them'" and remove them from our sight: revoking the Arabs' citizenship, forcing ethnic and religious separation in cities and neighborhoods, drafting the ultra-Orthodox into the army and forcing secular education on them, evacuating the settlers and destroying the outposts, breaking down the High Court of Justice's secular fortress. These proposals are largely impractical, which only magnifies the frustration and expressions of hatred.  
The time has come to say enough. Calm down. The state will not come apart so quickly; it will only change. This change cannot help but involve struggles. The opposing groups cannot be made to disappear, nor can love and dialogue be forced on them. There is no point in holding tightly to David Ben-Gurion's vision of a public that must be "remelted, poured into the mold of a renewed nation." These ideas belong to the history books, not to contemporary reality. Even the great Ben-Gurion was unable to establish a constitution, change the electoral system or force state education on the ultra-Orthodox.  
The task of leadership in 2009 is not to force a unified national narrative on everyone, but to seek out and foster common interests that will make it easier for rival tribes to live together and allow groups on the margins to integrate into the mainstream. That will not make the hatred go away, but perhaps it will channel some of the energy now invested in it for the greater good.

<title>Time to poll Israelis on continuing occupation</title>
<date>Sun Sep 13 01:31:19 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
This charade really has to stop. Forty-two years into the Israeli occupation, it's time to find out once and for all, without caveats or reservations, what Israelis actually want. Governments deceive us, one after another, as with generation after generation of a seemingly apathetic public. Now we have a prime minister who talks about a two-state solution and simultaneously works to undermine any chance of realizing it. No one knows what he, or we, are striving for, other than his own survival.  
The prime minister that preceded him made even more far-reaching, imaginary compromises, while simultaneously building up the settlements and leading us into two unnecessary wars. Another prime minister offered the skies to Yasser Arafat, and built 1,000 housing units in the West Bank alone. The settlements have blossomed and grown under every single Israeli government, absorbing colossal budgets, while settler leaders proclaim the public is with them. It's difficult to say whether they've been right or wrong, because the public has been as deceitful as the governments. In surveys, most of it says it supports the two-state solution, but at the same time it votes for right-wing, centrist or pseudo-leftist parties that have no intention whatsoever of ending the occupation.  
Occupation is not on the Israeli agenda. Not a single Jewish MK in today's Knesset ran on a ticket calling for an end to the occupation. The media, too, is doing everything it can to blur and suppress this issue. While everyone is busy blurring and deceiving, it's time to use the one tool Israel has never employed: a referendum - Israel's first - for or against continuing the occupation, whatever either choice entails. 
If supporters of the occupation win, we should storm the West Bank, build up more settlements, and proclaim to the world that this is the will of the people. If, however, opposition wins, all activity for the occupation's entrenchment must be stopped and the occupation itself must be ended, whether as part of an agreement or unilaterally. We don't need Barack Obama, we don't need Mahmoud Abbas, we don't even need Netanyahu: Let the people speak, and then we'll see who dares defy them.  
The arguments against a referendum are well-known. What's good for Switzerland, Ireland and Australia, is not necessarily good for Israel. And it's not as if we're not holding general elections every two to three years. If general elections in Israel provided an answer as to what the people want done about the occupation, a referendum would not be necessary. If Israel had a strong, determined leader - who proposed a clear choice to his voters between two states or one state, without any middle ground - elections would suffice. But Israel does not and never had such a leader.  
True, the charade can continue even after a referendum, which is why the question must be razor-sharp: Do we continue the occupation, all of the occupation, yes or no? If yes, then yes, if no, then no. But let's decide what it is that we want. This will be the real Big Bang: The referendum and the campaigns leading up to it will cut across party lines, rattle the system, drive it out of its dead-end brain freeze, and result in a defining moment of truth for Israeli politics and politicians. The latter, too, will once and for all have to answer truthfully.  
Without a referendum, any leader can go on deceiving, and the public can maintain its smug indifference. With the stopwatch of occupation ticking incessantly, the time has come to produce this doomsday weapon, because doomsday is very near indeed. Very soon, if not already, we'll be past the point of referenda and sentenced to live forever in a racist, bleeding, forever warring bi-national apartheid state. The government won't want the referendum and the Knesset won't like it; this is why the call must come from elsewhere - from the parched throats of the last Israelis, left and right, who still want to know what on earth we want and where we are going.

<title>Wanted: national priorities </title>
<date>Fri Dec 11 02:24:17 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Both the government's support for the referendum law and its proposed new map of the country's national priority zones, which will be brought to the cabinet for approval on Sunday, raise questions about our leadership's national order of priorities. What do economic benefits for 110,000 settlers, most of whom live in dozens of settlements outside the major blocs, have to do with the vision of two states for two peoples? What does a political roadblock in the form of a requirement for either an inflated majority in the Knesset or a referendum have to do with the desire to resume negotiations with the Palestinians and Syrians, which are based on the principle of land for peace?  
These two recent moves appear to be an attempt by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to appease his colleagues in the extremist wings of his Likud party and his coalition, and to compensate the settlers for the limited, temporary freeze on construction in the settlements. As in his previous term, Netanyahu is taking one step forward and then immediately two steps back. The decision to attach a ball and chain to the peace process in the form of a referendum lessens the value of his speech at Bar-Ilan University last June. Encouraging settlement in the heart of the West Bank by giving economic benefits to settlers increases suspicions among both the Arabs and the international community that the settlement freeze was not intended to do anything but repulse pressure from the U.S. administration.  
Yuval Diskin, the head of the Shin Bet security service, briefed the inner cabinet on Wednesday about the Palestinian security services' success in reducing terror in the West Bank. But the meager harvest they have reaped from the Oslo process is increasing popular Palestinian support for players such as Hamas, who insist that violence is the way to end the Israeli occupation. These players derive encouragement from every Israeli move that contradicts a solution of dividing the land and recognizing Palestinian rights.  
Even the most pragmatic elements of the Palestinian leadership such as Prime Minister Salam Fayyad are losing faith in the possibility of reaching an agreement with Israel through dialogue. At the same time, the referendum law - which has been nicknamed, and not for nothing, the "Law to Safeguard the Golan" - raises doubts about Israel's willingness to pay the price of peace with Syria.  
The erosion in this government's credibility regarding the diplomatic process - and in the credibility of each coalition member, including the Labor Party - is exacting a heavy price from Israel on both the domestic and international fronts. The diplomatic vacuum is being filled by Arab and European initiatives designed to advance a unilateral solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The latest evidence of this is the European Union's decision this week on the status of Jerusalem. And it is doubtful that the United States can for long (or would want to) save Israel from the slippery diplomatic slope onto which it is being dragged.  
The prime minister must decide where he is headed: toward an agreement that will assure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state, or toward a perpetuation of the occupation at the price of turning Israel into either a binational state or an apartheid one. It is impossible to woo the settlers while seeking a compromise with the Palestinians. The Israeli public has a right to know where its elected leadership is taking it.

<title>Why Livni </title>
<date>Thu Feb 05 01:17:23 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Click here for exclusive Haaretz coverage of the elections in Israel
If the forecast comes true, we will wake up on February 11 to a coalition of Netanyahu-Lieberman-Shas-National Union and Habayit Hayehudi. The roars of joy will be heard throughout the Middle East, from our youths of the hilltops to their youths with explosive belts. All those who live on extremism will then be able to continue nurturing one another with hatred.  
Vis-a-vis the hope for a new world that Barack Obama has brought, the Israeli voter will present the old world with its ills - Benny Begin, Limor Livnat, Moshe Feiglin, Uzi Landau, Avigdor Lieberman and Aryeh Eldad.  
Already now, according to the surveys, the extreme right-wing has a "blocking majority" in the next Knesset. If Benjamin Netanyahu gets even one more seat than Tzipi Livni, and he is the first to be called to the president and presents him with a majority of right-wing Knesset members who support him, the question of whether he will get Labor to join him or not will become marginal. The constant backing that Netanyahu will enjoy from the right will be what determines the path of the government that is established.  
This scenario of horror is not written in stone since about one-quarter of the voters have not yet decided for whom to vote. If more people take the trouble of going to the polls, and on the assumption that most of those who are wavering are from the center, it will be possible to turn the tables. If the left is able to overcome its urge to vote for a perfect party, and its regular tradition of not voting at all when there is no party that is both beautiful and has an influence, perhaps the trend will be reversed and a centrist-left government will be able to be set up.  
The sentimental approach to elections led to Netanyahu's victory at the polls in 1996, with a margin of a mere half a percent. The white ballot slip then was meant to punish Shimon Peres for the Grapes of Wrath campaign, and it became a collective punishment for the entire country.  
According to the voter surveys, the gap between Likud and Kadima now stands at three to five seats while more than 20 seats are still floating among the parties. Indeed, this is not enough for Livni to close the gap since there has to be a majority of MKs who will recommend to the president that she try to form the government, but an advantage of one seat may be able to give her the first chance. In the situation that is beginning to seem likely, a vote for any other party is a gamble on the entire jackpot. Deliberating over the question whether the premiership is "too big a job for Livni" is of no importance since it has already been proven that the job is too big for Netanyahu, while Ehud Barak is nowhere near getting a majority. The debate over the problems of Livni's personality is likewise strange, since reams have been written about Netanyahu's weaknesses, and billboards have even been filled about those of Barak.  
Livni represents decent politics without obsequiousness. If she survived the Likud Central Committee and proximity to Ariel Sharon without her reputation being stained by even an iota of corruption, she is apparently made of the right stuff.  
During an "Erev Hadash" program on Channel 1, Limor Livnat was asked what is Likud's political platform, and she was unable to answer. Likud knows mainly what it does not want. Not two states, not concessions, not disengagement, not partition, not surrender, not compromise. This worldview, if it gains the upper hand, is likely in the not too distant future to bring about international pressure for annexing the occupied territories and granting the right of to vote to the Palestinians.  
The right is deaf to the voices that call Israel an apartheid state, and it ignores the scenario in which the rule of the Jewish minority over the Palestinian majority between the Jordan River and the sea will be abrogated. It seems that only Livni has been able to internalize this concrete danger and therefore she sees in the establishment of two states an urgent strategic necessity.  
True, Kadima is seen as an artificial party, a kind of refugee camp for those who left Likud, but it should not be forgotten that it broke away from Likud because of an ideological rift, and not for seats. Sharon's decision to divide the land and to evacuate settlers so as to make possible the continued existence of the Jewish state is just as important now as it was then. There is no leader who relates to this need with greater seriousness than does Livni.  
That is why a vote for Kadima is not a compromise nor is it a gamble. With the assistance of the American administration, which is keen to find a solution, and with the support of European leadership, Livni has more of a chance than did her predecessors to achieve results. Whoever has despaired of a two-state solution has also despaired of the existence of a Jewish state. Planes and bombs will not be able to save us from mistaken decisions.

<title>Work for Labor's refugees</title>
<date>Tue Apr 07 02:25:36 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Ehud Barak and his friends saved Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing/ultra-Orthodox coalition, which appears unable to stand on its flimsy legs. The question is whether the Labor refugees will settle down to enjoy their considerable loot, or if they will try to be of some use to the Israeli people despite the political dead-end they've pushed themselves into.  
It's hard to believe that anything serious can come from these people, who haven't lived up to a single promise in more than 30 years. Still, we should pray that some pangs of conscience and commitment are left over. They face a challenge, and it remains to be seen whether they can muster the strength and courage to live up to it.  
To save Israel as a democratic country of the Jewish people we need forces that understand what hangs in the balance. The right ignored Napoleon's famous warning that you can do anything with bayonets except sit on them; the right still maintains it is possible to rule millions of desperate people who demand their freedom from Zionist occupiers, at least in the territories. The insistence to expand the settlements and bypass roads in the West Bank shows that the people in power today believe that blunt, brutal force and self-righteousness are enough to put facts of occupation and control on the ground.  
On the other side stands the universalist left, which is uncomfortable with the Jewish identity of the Israeli state. Too many in that camp are caught up in the illusion that Israel's Jewishness must be exchanged for an open democracy that will protect the rights of all those living between the river and the sea. This growing group knows full well that the Israelis will sink to oppression, apartheid and moral degradation before they hand their state over to the Palestinians. But they still go on hoping that Barack Obama, the Europeans, the rest of the world and sanctions will somehow shut down the current Israel and build up a wonderful new democracy where Palestinians and Israelis live in peace and quiet.  
The notion that we will all drown in a murky mire of Jewish dictatorship and the entire region will go up in flames before Israel gives up its sovereignty to the Palestinian majority doesn't appear to bother them too much.  
The real question is why the two groups manage to outshout the third, most decent and appropriate solution. Why should the Palestinian people be denied a state of their own, where their freedom and sovereignity will be assured? And why should the Jewish people lose the basic right to maintain their own state, guaranteeing the security and rights of all who see themselves as Jewish?  
You can try to avoid this admittedly difficult solution. You can pile up reservations and reasonable doubts and postpone the decision time. But in the meantime, do we risk finding we lost both the opportunity and our human character in the bargain? The demographic balance between the Jordan and the sea is already tipping toward the Palestinians. They are waiting.  
Tzipi Livni showed foresight and good sense when she realized that the Netanyahu-Yishai-Lieberman government must be toppled. But the Labor Party decided to rescue it instead. The little they now owe their voters, history and their conscience is to relentlessly push the government toward the two-state solution. Anything else would be an unforgivable oversight.

<title>Zuma and the original sin </title>
<date>Thu May 14 01:57:22 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Here's what has been said of Jacob Zuma, sworn in Saturday as president of South Africa - that he enjoys dancing at public events wrapped in tiger skins and a loincloth, that he has 22 children from six wives, that he spent 10 years in a prison run by the apartheid regime and 15 more in exile, and that he supports the death penalty and examining women's virginity before marriage. He was also charged with raping a woman he knew was HIV-positive who had "tempted" him with her "provocative" posture, then took a shower to (by his account) reduce the risk of contracting the virus. We also know he was found guilty of corruption and fraud, but was acquitted due to procedural failings.  
The tale of the uneducated Zulu shepherd who became one of Africa's most powerful men can compete with any story of achieving the American dream. South Africa's ambassador to Israel, Ismail Coovadia, has said the rise to power of this unlikely, colorful figure would have a positive influence on relations between the two countries, and spoke of "excellent relations" that will only grow deeper. Representatives of South Africa's Jewish community who met with Zuma last year were impressed with his charisma and personal warmth, and are pinning their hopes on a letter he gave them, in which he committed his support for the two-state solution with the Palestinians.  
Other observers are convinced Zuma's activities in the Middle East will be largely influenced by such bodies as the ANC Youth League, the South African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) - all of them central pillars of Zuma's base and widely perceived as having anti-Israel views.  
In February, Cosatu refused to unload ships belonging to Israel's Zim shipping company. A senior Cosatu official also called on South African Jews supporting Israel to leave the country, promising "Zionist" students in Johannesburg their lives would be "hell."  
During the term of Zuma's predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, the intelligence minister declared Israel's military action in the West Bank made the apartheid regime look like a "picnic." The deputy education minister under Mbeki insulted an Israeli diplomat of Ethiopian origin and said at a pro-Palestinian demonstration that most Western countries were in the hands of "Jewish money." Mbeki's South Africa hosted the UN anti-racism conference in Durban in 2001, where Zionism was equated with racism, and calls were made to stop the "Holocaust in Palestine" and to oust the Israeli ambassador.  
Israel is in large part still paying for its original sin - forging comprehensive security ties with the Apartheid regime and "selling its soul and morality to a racist, oppressive devil." In the words of former South African ambassador to Jerusalem Fumanekile Gqiba: "Israel must refrain from putting a question mark in front of our relations with the Palestinians. It must remember that it was, in the past, of the same flesh as the apartheid regime," he said.  
Presumably, Zuma will be too occupied with his country's massive domestic problems to focus on foreign policy issues. From Israel's perspective, the good news is that the former intelligence minister and deputy education minister are not in his government. Still, other members of the new government have signed a petition which likens Israel's government to an apartheid regime, condemns the "Bantustanization of Palestine" and calls for the commemoration of Nakba Day instead of Israel's Independence Day.  
Despite all this, observers in South Africa, including those in its Jewish community, are projecting a certain cautious optimism - even if their president does not transform into a Zionist, they foresee a warming in South African-Israeli relations. In their view, the government endangering the future of those ties sits not in Pretoria but in Jerusalem. If the new Israeli administration continues to oppose the two-state solution, South Africa will have a pretext for downgrading relations. For Zuma, Benjamin Netanyahu's verbal contortions of "economic peace" and Palestinian "autonomy" simply will not suffice.

<title>1932 is already here </title>
<date>Sun Dec 26 02:25:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Sebastian Haffner was a young lawyer in Germany in 1932. As a non-Jew, Haffner could have continued to further his career in the civil service. In describing the atmosphere in his country before the takeover by the Nazi dictatorship, he wrote that "the game dragged on tedious and gloomy, without high spots, without drama, without obvious decisive moments ... what was no longer to be found was pleasure in life, amiability, fun, understanding goodwill, generosity and a sense of humor .... The air in Germany had rapidly become suffocating."
Haffner chose to leave Germany. If he were to visit the neighborhoods of south Tel Aviv, Bnei Brak, Safed, Jerusalem or Bat Yam in late 2010, he would certainly recall those hard days in his homeland. He would find rabbis who sign racist manifestos against an ethnic minority and call for a policy of apartheid, fiery demonstrations against refugees from Africa, gangs of teens attacking Arabs, legislation promoting separatism and discrimination in racist and ethnic contexts, an oppressive public atmosphere, as well as violence and a lack of compassion toward people who are different and foreign.
Haffner would mainly warn against the anemic response of political institutions whose weakness and fears in 1933 led to a political reversal that could have been avoided. Of course, most Israelis do not see themselves as racist. The fact that half of Israel's Jewish population would not want to live next to Arabs is given various excuses, as is the popular and sweeping support of initiatives designed to keep Arabs or Africans from living alongside Jews. But only a few people who give those excuses would be willing to openly state that they support ethnic and racial separation.
The wild propagandists of the right like MK Michael Ben Ari  (National Union ) do not hesitate to use imagery and explanations taken from the anti-Semitic lexicon of Europe: Foreigners spread disease and take Jewish women; black refugees are violent criminals who endanger public safety.
This horrific propaganda is terrifying poor population groups who are already living with an infinite number of problems of survival. And the people who espouse this propaganda are persuading themselves that keeping foreigners out and racial separation produce hope for a solution to their problems. The historian Saul Friedlander defined this mood in Germany of the 1930s as "redemptive anti-Semitism." A society in existential confusion lacking a political direction that gave it hope was swept up by an apocalyptic idea at whose heart was the need to keep Jews out; if not, the nation's existence would come to an end.
Millions of people in Germany who would not have defined themselves as anti-Semites and certainly not as Nazis were swept up in the messianic and pseudo-religious public atmosphere. Israel today is becoming slowly and increasingly swept up in "redemptive xenophobia." To an increasing number of Israelis, the Arab, the African refugee and people who are foreign in their religion, skin color or nationality are considered the most serious problem society has to solve on the road to tranquillity.
No society is immune to deterioration into violent racism. In the Israel of today, we can observe quite a few conditions whose presence in other societies and among other peoples led to racial separation, ethnic cleansing and even genocide. There are minority groups  (Arabs and foreigners ) who are ostracized by the majority, a growing racist ideology, attempts to limit the political activities and civil rights of the minority, a tense security situation and strong political elements with vested interests in territorial expansion.
But this is not an edict from heaven. The task of responsible leadership is to stop this dangerous process. Benjamin Netanyahu frequently uses the imagery of 1938 regarding the international community's attitude toward the Iranian nuclear threat. Back then, at the last moment before the world descended into a horrific bloody war, the democratic powers could have stopped Hitler, but they stuttered.
Netanyahu must understand that the domestic reality in Israel today is 1932, and his pallid speech calling on people not to take the law into their own hands cannot extricate Israeli society from the xenophobic and intolerant atmosphere that has spread. For this, a move of an entirely different magnitude is required.

<title>A condition for peace </title>
<date>Tue Sep 07 01:29:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
In light of the Palestinians' acceptance of a land swap, the battle over the construction freeze in the settlements is not a struggle for their very existence, since most of them and their residents will be annexed to Israel in any agreement. The battle over the construction freeze is a battle for perception in Israel and abroad - between Greater Israel on the one hand and two states for two peoples on the other. So this battle is important for the existence of the diplomatic process.
Those who favor a Greater Israel have discovered that the assessment by former prime minister Yitzhak Shamir that half a million Israelis in the territories are enough to create an irreversible reality is not coming true. They have discovered that international opinion does not consider the West Bank part of Israel.
In addition, Israel showed that in exchange for peace with Egypt it could evacuate settlements. Those who favor a Greater Israel also understand that another outpost and another neighborhood will not change the West Bank's demographic balance. But they are convinced that as long as the construction process continues, the situation on the ground reduces the chance of dividing the country.
The defense minister has refused to recognize that. He used to justify granting building permits in the territories by saying it makes no difference where and how much construction goes on because the moment the border is agreed on, everyone will know the law. But if Menachem Begin froze construction before the peace treaty with Egypt, the same should be done after negotiations have gone on for 17 years and the number of Israelis living outside the settlement blocs has grown from 20,000 to 120,000.
Another declaration by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about a freeze, if it comes, will be more meaningful than Yitzhak Rabin's declaration in 1992 about "drying up" the settlements. At the time the subject was a change in national priorities, without mentioning a Palestinian state. Last year, when the Americans proposed building only in the settlement blocs, Netanyahu refused. He included United Torah Judaism and Shas voters in Beitar Ilit and Modi'in Ilit in the freeze to guarantee that those parties would also apply pressure for a renewal of construction in the West Bank, counter-pressure to the American pressure.
But now the "blocs" compromise means Netanyahu will be forced to turn the settlement enterprise, whose goal is to create a reality and perception of one state, into one that serves the idea of two states by determining a de facto border for Israel between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River.
Is Netanyahu blind to the light that ministers Ehud Barak, Dan Meridor, Michael Eitan and others have been able to see: that the settlement enterprise, which has expanded by 200,000 people since the Oslo Accords, is leading to a situation where more Israelis prefer no negotiations for fear of a civil war? That ever more people prefer democracy for Jews only, even if the world calls it apartheid? That more people sanctify settlement everywhere in the country, even if the result is a state with an Arab majority? That more Palestinians believe that their willingness to make do with a state in only part of Palestine is not relevant because we are trying to "Judaicize" that part too? That more Palestinians are convinced that the diplomatic path has failed and that the idea of resistance will reunify the Palestinians? That more people in the world believe that Israel is a factor harming regional and world stability and are questioning its legitimacy?
Netanyahu must realize that declarations and deeds are intertwined, in an honest attempt to achieve a solution. There is no point in dreaming about peace without creating the conditions for achieving it.

<title>And what happens in our community? </title>
<date>Sun May 02 11:35:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 
The headlines have screamed racism and discrimination. The segregation of Ashkenazi and Sephardi girls at the Beit Yaakov school in the West Bank settlement of Immanuel is indeed disgraceful and outrageous, while the apartheid in the ultra-Orthodox community as a whole engenders disgust. It starts with the deep arrogance toward the non-Jew that is embedded in Jewish religious law, and continues with racism toward Jews of Middle Eastern descent. Our shock as secular Jews over what's happening in places like Immanuel and Bnei Brak is justified and well-founded.
Having said that, let's take a look at some of our own enlightened, secular Ashkenazim. With us, it's not a matter of blatant, official discrimination as it is among the Haredim. We have no litmus test on admissions policies based on ethnic origin, we have nothing that resembles rabbinical segregation. Still, this should not be a source of pride.
The school in Immanuel is not admitting girls of Sephardi origin? This is a horrible thing. But what about the Israel Prize? Let's recall the ceremony that took place a few days ago: Almost all the recipients and presenters were Ashkenazi. It was once, and justifiably, dubbed the Israelovich Prize. Of the 158 prize laureates in cultural fields over the years, only 10 have been of Sephardi origin. And the picture isn't any better among the more than 600 laureates in all categories. True, no one decided to shut out Sephardim from this honor; no one imposed an ethnic admissions requirement as the rabbis have. On occasion, token Sephardim even win a prize - generally unknown rabbis in the category of Jewish thought - but the results speak for themselves.
Covert secular discrimination is sometimes more serious than blatant ultra-Orthodox discrimination, which is devoid of our purist rules of order. Open discrimination spawns opposition and outrage. But covert (and therefore more restrained) discrimination doesn't spark any protest.
Since the 1950s, they have been telling us that there is no discrimination; that soon we won't even know who's Ashkenazi and who's Sephardi; that the Israeli army is our melting pot. True, at one time the heads of the Labor Movement didn't hesitate to openly spout sickening racist statements, of the sort no one would dare utter today. In the 1950s, the enlightened statesman Abba Eban wrote that we needed to instill a Western spirit in them (meaning the Sephardim) and not let them drag us into their  unnatural Middle Eastern ways.
Andre Azoulay, a senior adviser to the king of Morocco, is convinced to this day that Moroccan Jews were brought to Israel only to provide cheap labor and serve as human shields in border regions. He points to comments by prime minister David Ben-Gurion and former World Jewish Congress president Nahum Goldmann that attest to this. In Israel, Azoulay's wife was also once told: "You don't look Moroccan." Every time I meet this impressive man, who has had such an amazing career, I can't help asking myself (and him): What would he have become if he had immigrated to Israel? The secretary of the workers' council in Dimona, where his cousins live? Or perhaps a textile worker, like them?
And what about another individual, who did immigrate to Israel from Morocco, Amir Peretz? He's one of Israel's most decent politicians and among the few who possess a worldview. He was doubtless the object of ridicule (either openly or secretly) from his first day as defense minister because of his ethnic background.
There is no discrimination, we claim, yet our entire political, economic, legal, academic and even military leadership is made up of Ashkenazim, with a smattering of Sephardim as the exceptions that so remarkably prove the rule. And the rule is that, even 62 years after its establishment, Israel is run by an ethnically pure elite. True, we did have two presidents of Sephardi origin, but there's no way they could have been Moroccan Jews, who until recently comprised the largest ethnic community in the country. We have had two or three Sephardi army chiefs of staff and there are already a few major generals, a bank head or two, but not one prime minister. Who's counting, though? Equality reins.
Equality reins? In looking at employment conditions, the situation is even worse. If in 1975 Sephardim earned on average 79 percent of the Ashkenazi wage, in 1992 that figure was down to 68 percent. According to studies that have not been updated, closing the educational gap between the two communities will take another 75 years. Prisons are full of Sephardim, while universities, where only about 7 percent of faculty are Sephardi, are much less so. But why do we need statistics? Let's ask ourselves honestly how many of the people who appear on television every day are Sephardi, and how many of the people who shape our fate are.
We cluck our tongues over Immanuel and the Haredim, but let's take a good look at ourselves first.

<title>Appeasing high risk groups can prove deadly</title>
<date>Sun Jan 03 01:10:19 IST 2010</date>
<content>
There is apartheid in the Middle East on the roads, too. Steps are taken to separate people according to their religion. It's a phenomenon that has escaped the notice of Jimmy Carter, Condoleezza Rice, Richard Goldstone and Scandinavian politicians, but it's there, white letters on a green background on traffic signs in Saudia Arabia. You can see it on highways leading to Mecca on which only Muslims can travel. Other drivers and passengers, impure heretics as they may be, are barred from using them. Out of revulsion they are relegated to another road.  
Limitations on Palestinians using Route 443 through the West Bank do not constitute apartheid, in the opinion of Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch. The elation of opponents of the limitations regarding the High Court of Justice's decision last week doesn't reflect the full text of the court opinion. The court in fact confirmed, not rejected, the security rationale at the basis of the prohibitions imposed nine years ago when terrorism struck.  
The Israel Defense Forces is being required to update its policies to conform with the calm on the highway since it stamped out terrorism. The 40 army vehicles a day that currently use the road from nearby Arab villages are not enough. A rate of 80 vehicles, the IDF's updated proposal, is also not enough. A further increase in the number and the installation of checkpoints are expected to satisfy the court. The principle of limiting traffic was not invalidated, only the way it is implemented on the ground.  
Route 443 from the Tel Aviv area to Jerusalem was partly built on the Arab side of the Green Line, as was Highway 1 to Jerusalem in the Latrun area. But this doesn't impede opponents of the occupation from putting their personal convenience in traveling between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem before the trouble of plodding along the old highway used prior to the Six-Day War. The shock absorber attached to their morality is exposed as more effective than the car.  
It's good that there is public and legal supervision of the authorities so they don't act arbitrarily, or in a manner that is biased or discriminates based on religion, nationality, race or gender. (I'm going to snitch here: There is an establishment at the Tel Aviv Port open to women only. Men who try to get in are turned away.) On the other hand, the pendulum can swing the other way and endanger lives, through the mad American logic that gave preference to Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's right to fly to Detroit over the safety of the hundreds of his fellow passengers on Northwest Airlines Flight 253.  
That is the dissembling, idiotic approach of Democratic U.S. administrations: Bill Clinton and his attorney general, Janet Reno, and Barack Obama and his attorney general, Eric Holder, who was previously Reno's deputy. With Clinton's blessing, Reno imposed a separation between intelligence collected on terrorism suspects by agencies such as the CIA and the law enforcement of the FBI. The result became apparent on September 11, 2001. Holder, who with Obama's support ordered a criminal investigation against CIA staff accused of harming terror suspects after September 11, is encouraging a mindset that prevented Abdulmutallab from being put on a no-fly list barring his entry into the United States.  
Holder, Rice and Obama, as well as Carter and Clinton, who were both governors of southern states before becoming president, have copied a simplistic notion of the civil rights struggle involving American blacks and implemented it in U.S. foreign and defense policy. Racist white mayors and state troopers harassing innocent black pedestrians and motorists? That's exactly what Muslims on Flight 253 and Palestinians on Route 443 must be spared, even if the world blows up.  
The intrusive inconvenience to those belonging to high-risk groups, meaning those who create risks and not those exposed to them, should create a measure of deterrence and difficulty for terrorists. The price of misguided lenience in the other direction is much higher.

<title>Are Israel and apartheid South Africa really different?</title>
<date>Mon Jan 04 01:09:26 IST 2010</date>
<content>
The day after the murder of the settler Meir Hai about 10 days ago, Major General (res.) Amos Gilad was asked to comment on the claim by settlers that the attack was able to take place because roadblocks had been lifted on West Bank roads. The security-political coordinator at the Defense Ministry told his radio interviewer that the policy of thinning out internal roadblocks has greatly contributed to the West Bank's impressive economic growth. According to Gilad, who until recently was coordinator of activities in the territories, the improvement of the Palestinians' economic lot has contributed substantially to Israelis' security.  
An army man, who is not suspected of belonging to a human rights organization, thus upsets the simplistic and most accepted formula: restrictions on Arabs means more security for Jews. The Supreme Court ruling last week to lift the ban on Palestinians using Route 443 shows that members of the judiciary also no longer stand at attention when they hear the magic word security. Nonetheless, the judiciary members, like politicians and the media, still find it hard to let go of their paralyzing dependency on this term. This is intentional: If discrimination is not mandated by security considerations stemming from the threat of Palestinian terrorism, how can we diagnose this regime as segregationist? If it is not diagnosed as such, there is no need to treat it.  
The Association for Civil Rights in Israel, which appealed against the ban on Route 443, dared suggest the word apartheid and was reprimanded for it. In her ruling, Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch wrote that "the great difference between the security means adopted by the State of Israel for defense against terrorist attacks and the unacceptable practices of the policy of apartheid requires that any comparison or use of this grave term be avoided." A similar argument was voiced during the days of Israel's military administration over its Arab citizens, which was lifted in 1966, and which is today considered a dark period in the country's history.  
Beinisch herself is a co-author of about a dozen rulings that exposed the malicious use of the segregation regime in an effort to take over Palestinian land. In some cases, most notably one concerning the separation fence near Bil'in, she wrote that the invasive route set by the army was inferior from a security point of view to the route proposed by experts at the Council for Peace and Security. In another case the state admitted that the person in charge of planning the fence did not inform government lawyers that the route had been adjusted to the blueprint for expanding the settlement of Tzofin. Were it not for human rights organizations and conscientious lawyers, who would prevent shortsighted politicians from annexing more and more territory "for security against terrorism"? asked Beinisch.  
One of the myths among whites in South Africa was that "blacks want to throw us into the sea." Many of apartheid's practices were formally based on security, mostly those involving restrictions on movement. Thus, for example, at a fairly early stage, black citizens needed permits to move around the country. During the final years of apartheid, when the blacks' struggle intensified as did terrorism, its practices became more severe.  
To avoid the rude word apartheid, Beinisch pulled out the well-known argument that apartheid is "a policy of segregation and discrimination based on race and ethnicity, which is based on a series of discriminatory practices designed to achieve the superiority of a certain race and oppress those of other races." Indeed, systematic segregation (apartheid) and discrimination in South Africa were meant to preserve the supremacy of one race over others.  
In Israel, on the other hand, institutional discrimination is meant to preserve the supremacy of a group of Jewish settlers over Palestinian Arabs. As far as discriminatory practices are concerned, it's hard to find differences between white rule in South Africa and Israeli rule in the territories; for example, separate areas and separate laws for Jews and Palestinians.  
Last Wednesday, Israeli policemen blocked the main road linking Nablus and Tul Karm. Dozens of taxis with Palestinian workers on their way home from another day on the job in the settlements were told to park on the side of the road. Cars with yellow license plates passed by. There was no roadblock for security inspections; it was just the memorial ceremony for Rabbi Meir Hai. Just as long as they do not say that there is apartheid.

<title>A retractionist-retentionist discourse </title>
<date>Fri Feb 12 02:11:12 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In his keynote address at last week's Herzliya Conference, Ehud Barak summoned up the most dramatic case for changing the status quo: "If, and as long as between the Jordan and the sea, there is only one political entity, named Israel, it will end up being either non-Jewish or non-democratic ... If the Palestinians vote in elections, it is a binational state, and if they don't, it is an apartheid state."  
This quote is particularly remarkable for the specific wording chosen by Israel's defense minister: He (perhaps unintentionally) suggested that the existing situation could already be described as apartheid.  
Considering the Labor Party's collapse, one may dismiss its leader's comments, but Barak's speech does matter, not because of its author, but because it articulates the core narrative of the centrist-pragmatic trend in Israeli-Jewish politics - from Likud realists like ministers Dan Meridor and Michael Eitan, to Kadima and the remnants of Labor and Meretz. Let's call it the "retractionist camp" - ready to support a withdrawal from the occupied territories that meets the minimum necessary requirement for the creation of a dignified and viable sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel, and therefore a sustainable two-state solution.  
They show realist tendencies, but there is a powerful disconnect (one that was pervasive in Barak's speech) between most of this camp's diagnosis of the situation (an "end of the world as we know it" threat of apartheid or binationalism) and their prescription for addressing it: resume negotiations, blame the Palestinians, more of the same. It's like telling someone they have life-threatening yet treatable cancer and prescribing two aspirins a day.  
If the situation is so dire, then bolder steps are surely called for. There are any number of game-changing options to consider. Maybe it is possible to engage Hamas (as is happening in the ongoing Shalit negotiations), to lift the Gaza siege, and to accept Palestinian unity instead of vetoing it, so as to facilitate an empowered negotiating and implementing address. After all, Israel spoke to the PLO before its charter was amended, and the United States engaged Sunni ex-insurgents in Iraq and is encouraging dialogue with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Alternatively, Israel could encourage internationalization of the conflict, handing the territories over to an international protectorate and international forces, or could embrace Salam Fayyad's two-year plan for statehood and scale back its Area C presence, or even withdraw to the 1967 lines while negotiating over a way settlers could reside under Palestinian sovereignty. Perhaps a Quartet-driven or imposed plan could be encouraged. Anything but business as usual.  
Yet most of those in the camp that favors retracting Israel's occupation - let's call them "soft retractionists" - eschew such bold positions. Their opponents, the "retentionists," support retaining all, most or at least enough control of the territories to render impossible a real two-state outcome (indeed, a commitment to retain all of Jerusalem under exclusive Israeli sovereignty is enough to negate a workable two-state option). Again, most retentionists belong in the "soft" category - they are ready to use the language of two states, and support negotiations, economic peace, even a partial easing of the West Bank internal closure. At the heart of both the retractionist and retentionist camps, in their "soft" manifestations, is a basic element of denial. Soft retentionists pretend that ongoing occupation can coexist with preservation of Israel's democratic character, its security, international acceptance, and a consensus about it in the Jewish world. Making noise about peace and throwing money at public relations will do the trick. Soft retractionists pretend that the occupation can be undone without a fundamental change in approach, and in particular while maintaining existing incentive and disincentive structures (which produced and preserve the current realities).  
But while the respective "soft" narratives are more pleasant to the ear, and easier to market, both are not only wrong but also increasingly irrelevant to Israel's future. The real struggle for the country is between what are commonly labeled as the extremes.  
Hard retentionists know they will have to rewrite the rules of democracy, and plead a special exemption clause for "Jewish democracy" and for the elevation of Jewish-only rights. Palestinians are to be dehumanized, human and civil rights groups and international humanitarian law excoriated and a vocabulary created for laundering and justifying an apartheid reality.  
Hard retractionists will need to stand up for (long-ridiculed) Jewish values, ethics and morality, for the unloved "other" in society, hold up a mirror to the nations' warts, and ultimately support international campaigns that distinguish between Israel proper and the occupied territories.  
Both camps have a vision for the country's future: the Jewish Republic of Israel - equal parts ethnocracy, theocracy and garrison state on the retentionist side, while for the retractionists, well, something that lives up to the words of Israel's Declaration of Independence.  
Retentionist cooperation with racist European Islamophobes and American dispensationalist evangelists (for whom Jews have a particularly unenticing role to play during the anticipated Rapture and Second Coming) is considered legitimate and necessary and is embraced by the mainstream. But when retractionists make common cause with the global civil and human rights community, they are vilified as traitors by the mainstream.  
The dominant discourse in Israel massively stacks the odds against the hard retractionists. The soft retractionists continue to feed that discourse even though it undermines the very outcome they know is necessary. Their frequent silence, no less than the settlers' noise, is drowning out Israeli democracy. The hard retentionists are very well represented in the Knesset, while the hard retractionists can barely rely on a tiny and shrinking number of Jewish MKs.  
It is the human and civil rights community, the New Israel Fund, the demonstrators at Sheikh Jarrah and the few brave public figures who have joined them - including David Grossman, Moshe Halbertal and Ron Pundak - who are now the standard-bearers and source of hope in this decisive phase of the struggle for Israel's future.

<title>A surgical strike on Israel's wallet could end the occupation</title>
<date>Fri Apr 30 01:13:12 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
What on earth will it take to persuade Israel to leave the occupied territories? Sometimes it seems as if nothing will work. For eight years now, the Arab Peace Initiative, which early Zionist leaders would have seen as a dream-come-true, has been collecting dust. Its terms include two states based on the pre-1967 borders, a mutually agreed-upon solution to the Palestinian refugee crisis, and normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and the entire Arab world. What once would have appeared to many to be Israel's salvation now seems impossible given Israel's entrenched colonial position in the West Bank and the settlers' political power.  
Perhaps American college students can help bring Israel to its senses. This past March 18, members of the student senate at the University of California, Berkeley, voted to recommend to the university's governing board of regents that they divest their holdings in General Electric and United Technologies - two companies that have profited from Israel's occupation of Palestinian land, its demolition of Palestinian homes, its aggressive campaign in Gaza last year, and the expansion of settlements. Although Berkeley's student government is not the first in the United States to vote for a divestment recommendation of this nature, it is by far the most significant.  
To be clear, the student bill does not call for a comprehensive form of divestment, and only targets companies involved in Israel's occupation and military misadventures.  
Some see the divestment proposal as counter-productive. "From the standpoint of advancing the causes of peace and justice for Palestinians, the Berkeley bill is worse than useless," claimed Haaretz's Bradley Burston in a recent column. Burston dismissed the idea of selling "some pension fund shares in American companies which make military aircraft engines" because those companies will "continue to sell them to Israel, regardless of the vote."  
But if history is any guide, Berkeley's divestment measure could have a positive impact. In the 1980s, Berkeley's student government was one of the first at any U.S. institution of higher learning to vote to recommend divestment from South Africa's apartheid regime. The UC system's board of regents initially resisted the divestment call, but student protests eventually led the regents to divest funds from companies with ties to South Africa. Eventually other campuses and local municipalities took similar actions.  
The United States government, formerly one of the chief enablers of apartheid, followed the lead of the students, passing the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act in 1986. The legislation prohibited all new U.S. trade and investment in South Africa, and stated five preconditions for lifting the sanctions, including a timeline for ending apartheid laws and the release of Nelson Mandela.  
"In South Africa, we could not have achieved our freedom and just peace without the help of people around the world, who through the use of nonviolent means, such as boycotts and divestments, encouraged their governments and other corporate actors to reverse decades-long support for the Apartheid regime. Students played a leading role in that struggle," Nobel laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu wrote in a letter to Berkeley's student government endorsing the current divestment bill.  
Whether one sees Israel as an apartheid-like regime or not, certainly the aforementioned history could offer lessons in how to end the occupation. If more American college campuses and local agencies pass divestment measures, eventually members of U.S. Congress may come to see that they must listen to their pro-justice, pro-peace constituents and not only to AIPAC. If that happens, a U.S. anti-occupation act could become a possibility.  
If the U.S. government were to seriously pressure Israel - for example, by conditioning $3 billion in annual aid on an end to the occupation and implementation of an equitable peace agreement - perhaps that would provide the incentive necessary to end the occupation.  
Although the Berkeley student president subsequently vetoed the divestment bill, and AIPAC's lobbying of student senators successfully prevented an override vote by the narrowest of margins, the proposal's eventual passage seems inevitable. That will turn the spotlight onto the university regents, who will face protests if they don't follow the divestment recommendation.  
We who promoted and rallied for this bill are a remarkably diverse coalition of Jews, Christians and Muslims; Israelis and Palestinians; and Americans of all backgrounds. Prominent Jewish supporters included Ofra Ben Artzi, sister-in-law of Prime Minister Netanyahu, and Hedy Epstein, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor.  
We Jews who support the divestment bill are fed up with Israel's violations of Palestinian human rights. We are unwilling to wait for political pressure to get Israel out of the territories to spring from the head of Zeus. And we believe that this move is in the best interests of the Israeli and Palestinian people.  
The consequences to Israel of not ending the occupation could not be clearer. "If this bloc of millions of Palestinians cannot vote [in Israeli elections], that will be an apartheid state," said none other than Defense Minister Ehud Barak, in his address to the Herzliya National Security Conference this past winter.  
Israel must choose: End the occupation or face the unraveling of the militarily enforced Jewish-majority state. The selective divestment approach that Berkeley students advocate will help build the political pressure to force Israel to make this choice.

<title>Barak should expose Netanyahu's 'true face' as he did for Arafat </title>
<date>Mon Jan 11 02:27:16 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Ehud Barak is living proof that a leader can influence history, for better or for worse. The first time was in Camp David, in July 2000, when he was the first Israeli prime minister to break the taboo on dividing Jerusalem.  
The second time was when he got back from there, planted the "no partner" land mine and destroyed the public's faith in the possibility of an agreement with the Palestinians.  
Almost 10 years later, Barak can fill in the missing pieces regarding an agreement over Jerusalem and dismantle that land mine. It is in his power to change history for a third time, for better or for worse.  
True, this time Barak is only chairman of a crumbling party and has never been further from the premiership. However, to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Barak's weight is many times greater than his formal title.  
The power of the Labor Party is greater than the 13 Knesset seats it holds. From a political perspective, Netanyahu's government can survive without the Labor Party, but from a diplomatic perspective, the departure of its only left-wing partner could spell disaster. That is the reason he is desperately courting every Kadima MK.  
Labor under Barak's leadership provides a beautiful face for this government (everything is relative), which Labor under foreign minister Shimon Peres gave Ariel Sharon's government. If Barak announced he didn't believe the government wants to pay the price of peace, who would be left to persuade U.S. President Barack Obama that Netanyahu meant what he said in his Bar-Ilan speech? The foreign minister from Yisrael Beiteinu, Avigdor Lieberman? Shas Interior Minister Eli Yishai? Perhaps Science and Technology Minister Daniel Hershkowitz, from Habayit Hayehudi?  
Barak has come a long way since he turned himself into the main salesman of the "no-partner" brand. He seems to be convinced that the failure of a diplomatic move (like the failure of a military operation) can highlight a problem in implementation and the need to correct an anomaly, not necessarily a fundamental flaw. He does not miss an opportunity to explain that the alternative to a two-state solution is a binational state or an outcast apartheid regime. His analytical brain can describe the reality well, but does nothing to change it.  
Brark proudly told members of the Labor Party Bureau Friday that the security situation has not been as good for as long a time. He did not need Gaza's firing on the western Negev over the weekend to know that this security is only as stable as the position of the Palestinian Authority.  
The cruel embargo on Gaza and delays in the diplomatic process have recently begun to eat away at the motivation of the Palestinian Authority's security forces in the West Bank. How long will Palestinian police agree to act as the occupation's sub-contractors?  
Cairo is somewhat hinting, somewhat threatening, that a failure of the Egyptian initiative to renew talks between Fatah and Israel will lead to renewed attempts by Egypt at reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas.  
Rapprochement with Hamas political chief Khaled Meshal will obviously be one of the issues raised in the upcoming meeting between PA President Mahmoud Abbas and Syrian President Bashar Assad in Damascus. The Arab peace initiative from March 2002 will be presented for ratification at the Arab League Summit, which is to meet in two months in Libya. If by then there is no essential change in the situation in the territories and in the diplomatic situation, this could be the eighth and last time it is presented.  
Barak is proud of the fact that at Camp David he revealed "Arafat's true face." The time has come for him to reveal Netanyahu's true face. If the prime minister intends to reach a permanent status agreement, let him assure Abbas that he will delay the tenders for expanded construction in East Jerusalem until negotiations are over. If we are dealing the old Netanyahu, who built neighborhoods in East Jerusalem to undermine Oslo, Barak has no business being in a right-wing government.  
What does he have to lose? He has already been prime minister, and he will not be again. At least he will not go down in Israeli history as the undertaker of the party that established the state.

<title>Boycott becomes them </title>
<date>Sun Jul 04 01:12:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
How charming the boycott cry is. Boycott Israeli universities, Israeli products from the settlements, flowers grown in Israel. When this call comes from Israelis, it reflects a great deal of despair, and stems from goodwill, of course. It's an enchanting formula: They'll boycott Israel, the public outcry will reach the government and the latter, being democratic, will have to obey the will of the people. How could they not have thought of it sooner?
They did think about it. That is exactly the formula behind the sanctions against Iran. Economic isolation, frozen bank accounts, senior officials not being able to travel abroad - then the Iranian people will wake up and change their regime, or at least its policies. Iran has been under sanctions for 30 years, and the people, wonder of wonders, have not risen up. They protest, but not because of the sanctions; because of the regime's suppression.
This remedy was also tried with Iraq. For 12 years the Iraqi people groaned under sanctions and dictatorship, but did not rise up against the great military leader who ruled their bedrooms. In the end there was no choice but war. Sanctions did not help.
And what about South Africa? The ostensibly successful sanctions and boycott, which led to the regime's fall? Sanctions - first military - were imposed on South Africa as early as the start of the 1960s. Then in the mid-1970s, they were extended to oil exports, and finally came the widescale sanctions of the mid-1980s. But apartheid was eliminated only in the mid-1990s, and even then it was not due to sanctions alone; in fact, in those years South Africa experienced economic growth and its exports increased 26 percent. President P.W. Botha's response to the blacks was no less vindictive than the West's desire to impose sanctions. Botha wanted to prove that outside intervention would not impact apartheid.
Israel has adopted the same policy. It has blockaded Gaza to spur the inhabitants to rise up against the Hamas regime, in order to achieve politically what the Israel Defense Forces could not achieve militarily. But three years of blockade, four years of fighting Hamas, and even the destructive Operation Cast Lead did not do the trick. The people of Gaza did not rise up, and the Hamas regime only grew stronger.
Anywhere sanctions are imposed - from Iraq to Iran, from Gaza to Pakistan - nationalist and radical forces actually have become stronger. Even the intellectuals who oppose the regimes have found themselves forced to defend them from outside intervention. Nationalism, or more correctly, extreme nationalism, rejoices.
People calling for a boycott of Israel or its institutions and products have given up on change from within. But what is worse, the call is motivated by the same logic that guides government policy in Gaza, and it is just as mistaken. After all, there is no reason whatsoever to believe that the Israeli government or the public will behave differently than Gazans or Iranians.
The fact that Israel is a democracy is no guarantee. Proof of this lies in the collective behavior in the face of Turkey's attack on Israel and the threat of military sanctions. Cancelling vacations in Antalya, protests and boycotting Turkish goods have become symbols of the "just struggle" against the bad guys.
If Israeli scholars are banned by universities in London, that's not so terrible. They can still go to Pennsylvania, and if they are banned there, they can still correspond and publish online; what's more important is that foreigners don't dictate policy "to us." If now, even before a boycott, lecturers have to think twice about what they say lest extreme nationalists mark them, then under sanctions, some elected officials may ensure such academics are immediately fired. In any case, people waiting for an academic uprising amidst a boycott should have their heads examined.
Who else can take part in the civil disobedience in the boycott proponents' fantasy? Farmers? Students? Travelers? Businesspeople? How many of them will wrap themselves in the Israeli flag to show the world we do not give in to sanctions? That will be the finest hour of the right wing, the "nationalist camp," fascism. Boycott becomes them.

<title>Boycotting the boycotters </title>
<date>Sun May 16 01:18:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Most people here are appalled at the notion that anybody beyond Israel's borders would think to boycott their country, products or universities. Boycotts, after all, are viewed in Israel as illegitimate. Anyone who calls for such a step is perceived as an anti-Semite and Israel-hater who is undermining the state's very right to exist. In Israel itself, those who call for a boycott are branded as traitors and heretics. The notion that a boycott, limited as it may be, is likely to convince Israel to change its ways - and for its own benefit - is not tolerated here.
Even an obvious, logical step - like the Palestinian Authority's boycott of products made in the settlements - is viewed by hypocritical Israeli eyes as provocative. Moreover, while the international boycott against apartheid South Africa is credited with leading to the regime's downfall, here it is considered irrelevant and unworthy of comparison.
It would be possible to identify with these intolerant reactions were it not for the fact that Israel itself is one of the world's prolific boycotters. Not only does it boycott, it preaches to others, at times even forces others, to follow in tow. Israel has imposed a cultural, academic, political, economic and military boycott on the territories. At the same time, almost no one here utters a dissenting word questioning the legitimacy of these boycotts. Yet the thought of boycotting the boycotter? Now that's inconceivable.
The most brutal, naked boycott is, of course, the siege on Gaza and the boycott of Hamas. At Israel's behest, nearly all Western countries signed onto the boycott with inexplicable alacrity. This is not just a siege that has left Gaza in a state of shortage for three years. Nor is it just a complete (and foolish ) boycott of Hamas, save for the discussions over abducted soldier Gilad Shalit. It's a series of cultural, academic, humanitarian and economic boycotts. Israel threatens nearly every diplomat who seeks to enter Gaza to see firsthand the unbearable sights.
In addition, Israel bars entry to anyone who wishes to lend humanitarian aid. We should note that the boycott isn't just against Hamas, but against all Gaza, everyone who lives there. The convoy of ships that will soon sail from Europe to try to break the siege will carry thousands of tons of construction material, prefab houses and medicine. Israel has announced that it plans to stop the vessels. A boycott is a boycott.
Doctors, professors, artists, jurists, intellectuals, economists, engineers - none of them are permitted to enter Gaza. This is a complete boycott that bears the tag "Made in Israel." Those who speak about immoral and ineffective boycotts do so without batting an eye when it comes to Gaza.
Israel is also urging the world to boycott Iran. But it's not just Gaza and Iran that are at issue here, because entry into Israel and the West Bank is being affected by the recent frenzy of boycotts. Anyone who is suspected of supporting the Palestinians or expressing concern for their lot is boycotted and expelled. This group includes a clown who came to organize a conference; a peace activist who was due to appear at a symposium; and scientists, artists and intellectuals who arouse suspicions that they back the Palestinian cause. This is a cultural and academic boycott on all counts, the type of boycott that we reject when it is used against us.
Yet the anti-boycott country's list of boycotted parties does not end there. Even a Jewish-American organization like J Street, which defines itself as pro-Israel, has felt the long arm of the Israeli boycott. It is permissible to boycott J Street because it champions peace, but we can't tolerate a boycott of products made in settlements that were built on usurped land. Denying a visiting professor entry into Gaza for an appearance at a university does not qualify as a boycott, but cutting off ties with Israeli institutions that provide fast-track degree programs for army officers and interrogators in the Shin Bet security service - people who are often viewed around the world as complicit in war crimes - is viewed as verboten.
Yes, an Israeli who lives in Israel will have a hard time preaching to others about the virtues of a boycott when that person does not boycott his or her own country or university. But it is his right to believe that a boycott could compel his government to end the occupation. As long as the Israelis don't pay any price, there won't be a change.
This is a legitimate, moral position. It is no less legitimate or moral than those who claim that a boycott is an immoral, ineffective tool while exercising that same option against others. So you oppose a boycott against Israel? Then let's first do away with all the boycotts we have imposed ourselves.

<title>Come join the march of the many </title>
<date>Fri Dec 10 00:57:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
The government and its institutions are those responsible for safeguarding our rights - all our rights. They have the power to enforce the law or break it, to foster an atmosphere of equality or of discrimination; it is in their hands to decide whether collective resources are equitably distributed among different groups in order to close socio-economic gaps or whether they are channeled into the hands of the few. Ultimately, the actions of our leaders are what will determine whether they back the state's commitment to the rights of all those living under its jurisdiction.
Alas, the past year seems to have set a new standard in the way the state betrays its commitments to the public. In government circles, the Knesset, academia and other spheres, Israeli democracy finds itself under threat.
In the Knesset, the recent wave of anti-democratic legislative initiatives was highlighted by the amendment to the citizenship law and the draft bill that would make it possible for small communities to reject "incompatible" residents. These bills, however, are only part of a more widespread trend which recently prompted the Knesset speaker to note: "There are members of Knesset who in their deeds turn to the emotions of the public and in so doing are creating a public global image of Israel as an apartheid state."
In the courts, the inconceivable inclination of the state to ignore court rulings reached new heights this year, prompting the attorney general to publish the following directive: "Implementation of court rulings ... is an obligation of the state. Obedience to court rulings does not just obligate the residents of a country and all who come through its gates, but rather it first and foremost obligates the state itself." Has the rule of law deteriorated to the point that it is necessary to enunciate such obvious guidelines? And, has the government changed its ways since the directive was handed down, or does it still regard certain court rulings with contempt?
Social services, be it welfare, health or housing, continued to be neglected; this is neither a new phenomenon in this country nor an act of nature - it's become systematic policy. This past year yet again, inequality, socioeconomic gaps and poverty reach record levels, leaving more citizens than ever to fend for themselves. Indeed, the recent national disaster in the Carmel Forest and the inability of the firefighters to control the blaze were painful reminders of the dangers of an economic policy that promotes cuts in public services. Maintaining a high level of public services in not in the interest of a particular demographic group but of society as a whole.
On racism, the origins of the wave that is now sweeping the country can be traced to government leaders: Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman spoke at the United Nations about "transfer of populations and territories" - and kept his ministerial seat; a municipal rabbi, a civil servant, published a halakhic decree that Jews are prohibited from renting apartments to non-Jews and not only kept his position, but has been joined by dozens of his peers. The common thread is that racism is receiving legitimacy and backing from the government, either through active participation or by tacit compliance.
Thus it is our government that is currently spearheading the attack against the foundations of our democracy. It is also responsible for the separation regime that is taking an even stronger hold in the occupied territories, the shameful treatment of refugees and migrant workers, and the close links that have been forged between those ruling the country and those groups seeking to intimidate and tag as "disloyal" anyone they see fit, targeting, among others, academia and human rights organizations.
Looking at this gloomy picture today, International Human Rights Day, one might ask: What hope is there for human rights in Israel? The events of the past year showed that this hope lies primarily in the hands of the citizens. It is critical that we remember that the power of the state and its institutions, and the budgets and resources they use, are given to it by us, the citizens - all the citizens. The chief responsibility of the state and all those working on its behalf is to be loyal to the public. The public still remembers its rights. Israelis demand that their government safeguard the basic rights of all those under its authority, they oppose cuts in public services, and they support equality and human rights. Everyone's rights.
Today, Friday, December 10, as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is celebrated worldwide, thousands of people will be gathering for the second year in the streets of Tel Aviv for Israel's Human Rights March. Working toward many different causes through shared values we will call out together: Human rights are everyone's rights. In order for the state to change direction, in order for the democratic forces to continue believing in our values and fighting for them even in the face of extremism, we will march together in the largest annual human rights event held in Israel. This is the march of the many who, despite the attacks against them, are determined to continue believing.

<title>Declaring war on the intellect </title>
<date>Tue May 18 02:12:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
By stopping the illustrious American scholar Prof. Noam Chomsky at the Allenby Bridge and barring his entry into Israel and the Palestinian Authority, the government's outrageous treatment of those with the audacity to criticize its policies has reached new heights. Israel looks like a bully who has been insulted by a superior intellect and is now trying to fight it, arrest it and expel it.
Chomsky is a controversial and bold intellectual. His linguistic research has brought him unquestionable respect, but his political writings and speeches, in which he bluntly and acerbically attacks any government that he thinks deserves it, have made him unpopular both inside and outside the United States.
Nevertheless, it is hard to imagine any country that would not feel honored to be visited by Chomsky, apart from Israel, which has its own accounts to settle with him. As a Jew who lived here for a brief period in the 1950s and is fluent in Hebrew, Chomsky takes a great interest in events here. In many articles, petitions and open letters, he has been sharply critical of Israel's actions and policies.
Like many other members of the intellectual left in the U.S., Chomsky has roundly condemned the occupation and displayed sympathy for the Palestinian struggle against it. In recent years, he has often been quoted as calling Israel an apartheid state. But despite this, he has firmly opposed any blanket boycott of Israel. He says it is the settlements that should be boycotted, as well as the bodies that support them, both in Israel and abroad  (including in the U.S. ), but that it makes no sense to boycott the Israeli public in general or its academic institutions.
Israel, however, has lost its last remnants of tolerance for anyone who does not join its shrinking chorus of supporters. On the right, but not only there, Chomsky is seen as a deserter, a traitor and an enemy of the people. The details of the incident, as reported by Haaretz correspondent Amira Hass, sound as if they were taken from the theater of the absurd or from some political satire on places and times that have gone down in infamy. The questions that were posed to Chomsky by a border inspector, on orders from his superiors, have to be read and reread to be believed.
"Israel," Chomsky was informed, "doesn't like what you say." Is this a reasonable pretext for a democratic state to detain someone for questioning or hold him up at the border? And who is this "Israel" that doesn't like what Chomsky says? The general public? The Interior Ministry? The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories? The government?
One does not have to be an ardent supporter of Chomsky in order to agree with his view that Israel is behaving like South Africa in the 1960s, when it understood that it was an outcast, but thought it could solve the problem with the help of a better public relations campaign.
Now that the affair has come to light, Interior Ministry sources are claiming it was COGAT that should have handled Chomsky, and that his detention was the result of a misunderstanding, whereas COGAT is claiming that it did not know of the scholar's arrival. This, at best, is blatant disingenuousness.
Interior Minister Eli Yishai and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should apologize to Chomsky and make sure that he is allowed to move freely around Israel and throughout the West Bank, including Bir Zeit University. It is not yet too late to repair some of the damage caused by this harmful folly.

<title>Destructive 'agnosticism' </title>
<date>Fri Nov 26 02:03:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In his November 5 opinion piece in Haaretz English Edition, Matthew Taylor (“Just who is misguided?”), of the Jewish Voice for Peace, lodged a complaint against the “older [Jewish] establishment” for being “condescending” to young Jews. His protest included an attack on remarks made by Julie Bernstein, of the Jewish Community Relations Council of San Francisco, who was a panelist in a workshop at the General Assembly earlier this month in New Orleans.
The irony of Bernstein being a young adult and part-time graduate student seems to have been lost on Taylor. The main target of his "j'accuse," though, was the recently launched plan of the Jewish Federations of North America and the Jewish Council for Public Affairs to actively confront the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS ) campaign, a well-funded internationally coordinated movement to isolate and delegitimize Israel. To bolster his argument, Taylor could have tried to demonstrate that BDS does not strive to dismantle the State of Israel. He did not, nor could he had he wanted to - because Israel's demise is the BDS movement's aim.
The leaders of BDS certainly speak plainly about their goals. Omar Barghouti, a founding member of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, spoke last March at a church in the San Francisco Bay area, and declared that for the BDS movement the 1967 occupation is "not the most important" issue. Instead, he said, the "foremost" demand of BDS is the right of return. The same Barghouti has also said, "If the refugees were to return you would not have a two-state solution; you'll have a Palestine next to a Palestine rather than a Palestine next to an Israel."
Other BDS advocates are equally explicit. "BDS represents three words that will help bring about the defeat of Zionist Israel and victory for Palestine," said Ronnie Kasrils, the veteran South African political figure and advocate for the Palestinian cause. And Palestinian-American journalist Ahmed Moor writes, "Ending the occupation doesn't mean anything if it doesn't mean upending the Jewish state itself ... BDS does mean the end of the Jewish state."
Some may try to dismiss these comments as merely individual opinions. But that is just more obfuscation. The sum of the BDS movement's central demands (as outlined in its manifesto, the "Palestinian United Call for BDS against Israel" ) - especially the demand for a "right of return" - make it clear that BDS seeks to disassemble the State of Israel. Or, as Barghouti envisions it, a "Palestine next to a Palestine" and no Israel.
While these BDS advocates are clear about their movement's goals, Taylor and Jewish Voice for Peace prefer murkiness. JVP's website declares: "Our mission statement endorses neither a one-state solution, nor a two-state solution ... we have members and supporters on both sides of this question, as well as many others who, like the organization as a whole, are agnostic about it."
In the face of the annihilationist and overtly anti-Semitic ideologies motivating Hamas, Hezbollah and their state sponsor Iran, this agnosticism coming from a Jewish group with respect to Israel's existence, and thus the safety of millions of Israeli Jews, represents a gross moral failure.
JVP's website also states, "JVP defends activists' right to use the full range of BDS tactics without being persecuted or demonized." Missing from this statement, and from any JVP public pronouncements, are any critiques of the BDS movement's explicit goal of dismantling Israel. Further, JVP not only defends pro-BDS groups, it also partners with them. Based in the San Francisco Bay area, JVP for years has repeatedly co-sponsored scores of events and demonstrations with anti-Israel and explicitly anti-Zionist organizations that overtly support the full range of BDS. These include the Al Awda Palestinian Right to Return Coalition, International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network, Students for Justice in Palestine, Sabeel, Bay Area Campaign to End Israeli Apartheid and the International Solidarity Movement, among many others.
It is important to draw a stark line between BDS supporters like the JVP and critics of specific Israeli government policies. In the American and Israeli Jewish communities, there is ample space for wide-ranging debate - from left to right - about specific policies. However, "agnosticism" on Israel's right to exist as an independent Jewish and democratic state within secure borders is, in fact, anti-Israel. Delegitimizing Israel and thereby promoting its isolation and destabilization is, in fact, anti-Israel. Applying harsher criteria for and imposing harsher punishment on Israel than are applied to any other country whose policies are considered objectionable, is, in fact, anti-Israel.
The time has come - particularly after JVP's behavior at the General Assembly and the subsequent gloating about its outbursts there - to remove the cloak of respectability that JVP has tried to place over its positions and ask all reasonable people to examine the organization's real record.

<title>Dubai hit shows Israel won't be safer with exiled terrorists</title>
<date>Mon Feb 22 02:37:10 IST 2010</date>
<content>
If Mahmoud al-Mabhouh were sitting in an Israeli prison instead of posthumously starring in the international media, his name would be on the list of prisoners whom Hamas is demanding in exchange for Gilad Shalit. He would almost certainly be one of the "arch-terrorists" that Israel, for its own security, is insisting be barred from the Palestinian territories after their release, a condition that Hamas has refused to accept. On top of this snag, the American government is strenuously opposed to the exchange, on the grounds that a Hamas success in securing the release of hundreds of prisoners would bolster the organization's prestige and highlight the impotence of the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority.  
Yet both these arguments are utterly specious, and merely lay bare the obtuseness and shortsightedness prevalent in both Jerusalem and Washington. The wantonly negligent handling of the plight of a young soldier languishing in captivity is characteristic of the policy, or lack thereof, regarding Israel's fate as a Jewish and democratic state.  
The Mabhouh case has knocked the bottom out of the argument that Israel will be safer if the worst of the freed terrorists are exiled to Damascus as part of a deal for Shalit. The huge effort put into assassinating Mabhouh in Dubai and the diplomatic and security risks - surely calculated ones - taken by whoever did it are indications of the man's standing in the world of terrorism. Exile, it transpires, can be an ideal hothouse for breeding arch-terrorists.  
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who gave the okay for the botched attempt to kill Khaled Meshal in Amman in 1997, must have realized by now that it is best to keep the most dangerous and sophisticated prisoners Israel releases close to hand. That way, it is easier to keep track of them. If a brother of Mabhouh, upon returning home after a prison sojourn, were to revert to his evil ways, no Israeli ambassador would be called in to explain the day after he was eliminated.  
Netanyahu is aware that Hamas has rejected deportation from the outset. There is no chance that further bargaining will shift it from this position. The only explanation for Israel's insistence on reinforcing the ranks of Meshal's gang in Damascus with vengeance-hungry exiles is that the prime minister does not want to pay the price of the deal.  
The price tag of the bigger deal with the Palestinians has also been known for a long time. It was set out in the Clinton parameters of 2000, the Arab peace initiative of 2002, the road map of 2003 and the Annapolis statement of 2007. All of these propose a comprehensive peace in exchange for a withdrawal to the 1967 borders, with minor, reciprocal border adjustments and an agreed solution to the refugee problem. In fact, the tariff has remained the same since the PLO's 1988 declaration of an independent Palestinian state.  
Netanyahu also avers that he has accepted the principle of two states for two peoples. But after accepting it, he immediately rushed to set impossible conditions: He demanded that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state and declared that East Jerusalem, the Ariel bloc and the Jordan Valley would be annexed to Israel. Having heard what his defense minister claims to have offered Yasser Arafat, and being aware of the map that his predecessor laid before Mahmoud Abbas, it is hard to believe that the prime minister thinks he can find a Palestinian partner for what he has in mind.  
America's dogged resistance to a reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas shows that President Barack Obama fears for the future of the Palestinian peace camp. But instead of moving the peace process forward with that same doggedness, the United States has been attacking the Shalit deal. That is far easier than pressuring Israel to transfer more of Area C to Abbas, remove more roadblocks and make sure that the freeze on settlement construction is not a hoax.  
Assassinating exiled terrorists will not defeat Hamas, and thwarting a prisoner exchange will not have a long-term impact on the balance of power in the Palestinian territories. The right way to tackle Hamas is to create a real political alternative to its violent and uncompromising course. In the absence of such an alternative, operations taken from James Bond movies that the foreign media attribute to Israel make this country look like a neighborhood thug and divert attention from the specter of apartheid crouching at the gate.

<title>End the siege on Israel </title>
<date>Fri Jun 11 01:18:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Israel's deadly attack on the "Freedom Flotilla" is proof of how Gaza continues to give Israel a taste of its own medicine. Intended to help solve Israel's problems with Hamas, the three-year-old siege of Gaza is developing into a siege of Israel, while it causes tremendous damage to the country's image around the world.
It should be clear to both Israel and the United States by now that the siege of Gaza has failed to accomplish its goals. Israel has failed to weaken Hamas, free Gilad Shalit or even put an end to arms smuggling.
To Israel's dismay, Hamas has succeeded in putting the spotlight on Gaza and directing world attention to the country's irrational policies toward not only the Palestinians, but also its own citizens.
From outside, the situation in Gaza may appear unsustainable for Hamas, but in fact the Islamic movement and its supporters are content to wait it out, calling Israel's bluff on the blockade. Indeed some cynics believe the current status quo is the best situation the Palestinians have enjoyed in a long time.
Late last month, at the fifth annual Al Jazeera forum in Doha, Osama Hamdan of Hamas and Ibrahim el-Moussaoui of Hezbollah applauded and shook hands with Abdel Bari Atwan, the editor of Al-Quds Al-Arabi, a widely circulated pan-Arabist newspaper, when he said: "I have good news: There is a Palestinian split. Things have never been better before. One camp is with the Americans, the Israelis and seculars, and the other camp is with Iran and Islamists. So, if one side loses, the other is bound to win, and this has been the best and safest situation for the Palestinians in a long time."
Atwan is known to favor the latter camp, and from his "good news," one can surmise that he is betting it is on its way to winning - clearly with tremendous help from the siege of Gaza.
What is even more unsettling from the point of view of peace-loving Palestinians is the fact that Israel's top politicians are aware of the implications of their damaging policies, even as they refuse to change them.
After meeting with Defense Minister Ehud Barak two months ago at his office in Tel Aviv, I walked away believing he understood that unless Israel changes its policies vis-a-vis my people, sooner or later the world will see those policies for what they are: apartheid. I believe the deadly attack on the flotilla, and the worldwide reactions that followed, are confirming Barak's fears - and sooner, rather than later. Israel's policies are no longer acceptable to the world community, and a change in policy is crucial.
The day after the Mavi Marmara incident, the head of the Mossad, Meir Dagan, bluntly told the Knesset: "Israel is becoming more of a liability and less of an asset for the United States."
The siege of Gaza has been going on for nearly three years, and strategically speaking, so far, Israel and its allies have been the biggest losers. The reaction from both the world's governments and its peoples to last week's attack shows not only the growing intolerance of Israel's policies, but an urgent need for Israel to rethink its long-term goals. Is it to exist as a democracy, and in peace with its neighbors, or will it continue to be the Palestinians' landlords?
If Israel's goal is to be a permanent landlord, then its future in the region is clear: More and more disgruntled Arab and Muslim youth will continue to join the lines of resistance against the apartheid in the territories and will continue to threaten the stability of the already weak neighboring Arab regimes. It is important to note that a large number of the people on the ships bound for Gaza were young Arabs from almost every country in the region. Today they may come on ships with peace activists, tomorrow they will storm the borders with jihadist movements. Then, it will not only be Israel facing them. Their own regimes and the United States will also have to face the consequences.
The fact that Turkey and Iran are sending aid to the Palestinians and criticizing Israel's policies will not only undermine the legitimacy of the nearby Arab regimes, which are already seen as helpless and ineffective, but will also lead their populations to draw inspiration from those two countries.
Egypt, realizing that its regime is weak and unstable, has already felt the heat and immediately opened the Rafah crossing with Gaza, which it intends to leave open.
So, is Israel ready to think seriously about long-term solutions, or does it intend to simply continue to impose a siege on itself?
Israel's leaders - with the help of the United States and the international community - must redefine their country's long-term vision and goals, and allow a Palestinian state to exist by its side. If Israel's goal is to live in a democracy and in peace with the Palestinians, then its path should be clear: Lift the siege on Gaza, encourage a unity government, and let the Palestinians build their own democracy.

<title>From 'Ajami' to 'Beaufort' </title>
<date>Thu Mar 11 01:17:14 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Just hours before Sunday's Academy Awards ceremony, Scandar Copti, one of the co-directors of "Ajami," announced that the film does not represent Israel. At around the same time, MK Jamal Zahalka was taking part in an Israeli Apartheid Week event at McGill University in Montreal, pouring oil on the flames of the Arab-Jewish rift. At a special Knesset session to honor the 12 members of the pre-state Jewish underground militias who were hanged by the British during the Mandate era (known as the olei hagardom in Hebrew), MKs Ahmed Tibi and Talab al-Sana called these men terrorists.  
As a movie, "Ajami" is no better or worse than others of its ilk created around the world that tell nearly the same story. In every part of the world in which national minorities fight the majority (especially when the fight regularly erupts into verbal and physical violence), the reality is even worse than in Israel.  
It's reasonable to assume that had the film not been set in Jaffa, where, it is implied, the sad state of the Arabs is the consequence of the Jewish sin of "the occupation of 1948," it would likely not have been nominated for best foreign film. Similarly, "Beaufort" and "Waltz with Bashir" were nominated for Oscars because they were critical of Israel.  
The political statement made by Copti turned "Ajami" from a movie into another link in the fight waged by the Palestinians in Israel against the state of which they are citizens. That makes it just like disrespecting the memory of the olei hagardom or accusing Israel of being an apartheid state even though the Israeli Palestinians' rights as citizens here exceed those of any Arab country (and include supernumerary rights, such as exemption from mandatory military service).  
It can be assumed that the Israeli Arabs would present their position more moderately (and thus more effectively) were it not for the encouragement they receive from Jewish entities in the areas of art, culture, academia, philanthropy and the media. A large proportion of Israeli films, both features and documentaries, focus on and promote the Palestinian narrative, whether directly or indirectly. This narrative blames the Jews for all the ills of the Arab community - the result of the mother of all occupations, that of 1948.  
All Israelis seeking public funding for a movie are aware that aid from international foundations, and even Israeli ones, depends on the submission of a screenplay that is critical of Israel. No filmmaker could obtain funding from a European or even an Israeli foundation (including governmental ones) for a movie that presents a balanced view of Israel, much less a positive one.  
The result: Dozens of "checkpoint films" telling the story of Arab suffering. None of the films in this genre delves into the reasons behind the checkpoints or asks about the mass killings that were prevented by the capture of terrorists or timely discovery of explosives at those very checkpoints. Many of these films show women weeping and crying out next to their demolished homes.  
The movies - in Israel, too - evoke sympathy for the oppressed and that is their purpose.  
But not a single movie has been made that shows the reasons leading up to the demolition of the homes, that tells the story of the hundreds of Jewish victims who were murdered by the terrorists whose homes were subsequently destroyed.  
Had they not wallowed in the mire of "We have sinned, we have trespassed," it is doubtful that "Ajami," "Beaufort" or "Waltz with Bashir" would have gotten so close to the pinnacle of Hollywood recognition. It is fashionable today to criticize or even to hate Israel. Among those contributing to hatred of Israel are, in addition to filmmakers, Israeli intellectuals and artists from other disciplines - and for exactly the same reasons that the filmmakers are so eager to make their self-flagellating films.

<title>Grandpa Bibi's responsibility </title>
<date>Mon Jun 21 03:04:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
At times, when I'm watching my little grandchildren, my thoughts turn to Grandpa Bibi. Doesn't Shmuel's grandfather also wonder what kind of country our generation will bequeath to theirs? Grandchildren turn the future from a mere political, social or economic concept into concrete reality, replete with responsibility. Doesn't Benjamin Netanyahu ask himself what he is doing to ensure that his grandson will raise his children in a Jewish and democratic state? Is it possible that this man, who has taken upon himself for the second time supreme responsibility for the fate of the Zionist dream, believes that time and his own inactivity are working for the good of future generations?
The dramatic speech Netanyahu delivered last July at Bar-Ilan University elicited hopes that he had begun to free himself of the shackles of the past and to overcome the fears of his revisionist father. He addressed the Palestinians as neighbors, not enemies, calling on them "to give our young generation a better place to live" and to act together to advance the two-state solution, each state with its own flag and government. He placed the partition of the land at the center of his political vision.
The leader of the right spoke of the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside the Jewish state as a Zionist interest, and not as a forced response to external pressure.
In the year that has passed since that "historic" speech, no Israeli or Palestinian child, including the infant Shmuel, has been born into a better world. Negotiations over the two-state solution have devolved into small-time haggling over neighborhoods in the West Bank and buildings in East Jerusalem.
Instead of discussing the 2002 Arab peace initiative, which is gradually fading away, the government occupies itself with shopping lists of Gazans. Most of the time and energy of the decision makers is devoted to putting out fires in international relations. Not only doesn't the government advance a solution to the conflict, it is not even managing it correctly and preserving the status quo.
Any child who has ever ridden a bicycle knows that if you stop pedaling you fall flat on your face. An Israeli leader who gives up on progress in the negotiations toward a two-state solution is dooming his grandchildren, and perhaps his children too, to a binational, one-state solution. This is no longer the nightmare scenario of lunatic-fringe leftists who have lost their faith in the god of the status quo. Moshe Arens, Netanyahu's first political patron, who appointed him deputy chief of mission at the Israeli Embassy in Washington D.C. in 1982, argues that the only realistic alternative to partition is extending Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank and giving Israeli citizenship to the Palestinian residents.
Although all of the official documents Israel has signed declare that the Gaza Strip and the West Bank form a single entity, Arens has unilaterally erased the 1.5 million Gazans from the demographic equation. But even if his forecast proves correct, when the time comes for Shmuel to enlist in the armed forces of "Isratine"  (Muammar Gadhafi's term) most of his age group will be followers of Allah and Mohammed, his prophet, or believers in the supremacy of halakha over the law of the land, or supporters of an apartheid government of isolated pariahs.
He will live, along with the grandchildren of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, if they remain here, in a state torn between fanatical Muslims and fanatical religious Jews. Sooner, rather than later, they will be an absolute majority and no Supreme Court will be able to intervene in the education of future generations of the enemies of progress and democracy.
You don't believe me? In Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, Jews who believe in the sovereignty of the Knesset are already in the minority.
Since the Bar-Ilan speech, Shimon Peres has been telling all guests to the Presidential Residence, albeit a little more hesitantly recently, that Netanyahu understands the dimensions of the "historical responsibility" that he bears. This is no mere inflated cliche: His actions and derelictions in coming months will affect Israel beyond 2010. When Grandpa Bibi plays with little Shmuel, he should know that his survival games are an irresponsible gamble on the fate of today's grandchildren.

<title>He will bring us all down </title>
<date>Wed Mar 17 04:00:13 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In the next frame of this cartoon, Benjamin Netanyahu will find himself running in thin air, then a moment later fall into the abyss. It's a frame we've seen before, one that always brings a smile in cartoons. But not in life.  
The prime minister is warning that if he's ousted, Barack Obama will go down with him. That won't happen - the constitution holds the U.S. president in the Oval Office for a full four years. Netanyahu, by contrast, is held in office by ministers Ehud Barak, Avigdor Lieberman and Eli Yishai. And it's best not to be in their hands when they smell the blood of the weak.  
The scene doesn't have to stop there. Netanyahu would do well to read his favorite book, John F. Kennedy's "Profiles in Courage," before bed. At the last minute he could change not only his life, but the course of history itself, by recognizing that Obama doesn't want to throw him under the proverbial bus, that Hillary Clinton is not out to settle scores over how he wronged her husband and that overall, maybe the world is no longer all that anti-Semitic, certainly not against us.  
It is we who didn't realize the sun had set over the occupation. Even our best friends, who for years saved us from UN Security Council vetoes, believe that Israel must quit the territories and withdraw to the western side of the separation fence - a secure and widely recognized border - with or without an agreement. This is the conclusion one reaches with a fair reading of Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, the Bill Clinton parameters and the letters exchanged between George W. Bush and Ariel Sharon.  
Netanyahu must get the message that Menachem Begin, Sharon and Ehud Olmert - his predecessors on the right - all came to understand, that the scenery looks entirely different once you're in power. Then he will understand that only the radical Palestinians and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad don't want to divide the land. It's good for them that Israel is turning into an updated version of an apartheid state. Israel haters everywhere understand well that the community of nations won't allow the rebirth of the Afrikaners' South Africa, one forcing on the world a single state between the river and the sea. This would be a single democratic state in which everyone has a vote, and when the ballots open, Ahmed Tibi will be elected prime minister.  
This is a scary prospect, more than Qassam rockets and far more than a second "Hamastan." It would be the end of a Jewish democratic Israel. Netanyahu can jolt the steering wheel at the last second and change the end of this film - to return to the vision of Theodor Herzl and create a Jewish national home in recognized, defensible borders. He will not only receive a Nobel Peace Prize, but enter history as a second David Ben-Gurion.  
What must he do? Create a third Netanyahu government, distance himself from the ideas of Tzipi Hotovely and other lawmakers in her camp, and join up with Tzipi Livni. Livni could be given half the steering wheel, with a joint Livni-Netanyahu government set up to divide the land and end the occupation. Half and half in the cabinet, fifty-fifty in government - the new administration would be one-quarter bigger than the current one. Lieberman would be released to do as he wishes and Yishai simply released.
And what about Barak? Let him remain defense minister. It's good for Israel and good for ending the occupation. Barak is, after all, experienced in unilateral withdrawals. He did a great job in Lebanon and would do the same in the West Bank.  
What are the odds of this actually happening? Only Netanyahu knows. Only he can decide whether to save Israel or let it continue to fall. Only Netanyahu - not Obama.

<title>Is Israel a normal country? </title>
<date>Fri Jul 09 08:22:54 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 Israel's decision in May to drop commandos onto a flotilla of pro-Palestinian activists was brutal. The killing of nine civilians by those commandos was a terrible consequence. Israel's blockade of Gaza and occupation of Palestinian territories in the West Bank, not to mention the road blocks, destruction of homes and other daily torments of the Palestinians, are also a form of institutionalized inhumanity. 
 Nevertheless, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's description of the Israeli raid on the activists' boat as "an attack on the conscience of humanity" which "deserves every kind of curse," and as a "turning point in history" after which "nothing will be the same," seems hysterical. Whatever one thinks of various Israeli governments  (and I don't think much of the current one ), reactions to Israeli government-sponsored violence tend to be much fiercer - not just in Turkey - than reactions to crimes committed by the leaders of other countries, with the exception perhaps of the United States. But then, in the minds of many critics, the two countries are often conflated. 
 Israel has never done anything comparable to the late Syrian leader Hafez Assad's 1982 massacre of more than 20,000 members of the Muslim Brotherhood in the city of Hama. Far more Muslims are still being murdered by fellow Muslims than by Israelis, or indeed by Americans. And if one thinks of the death toll wreaked by the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo - more than 4 million - talking of turning points in history, after the killing of nine people, sounds a little absurd. 
 But none of that seems to count as much as what Israel does. 
 So is it true, as many defenders of Israel claim, that the Jewish state is judged by different standards than other countries? I believe that it is. But, while anti-Semitism certainly plays a part, it may not be the main reason. 
 Especially after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, many Europeans, I suspect, sighed with relief that Jews could be aggressors, too. Jewish brutality relieved the burden of wartime guilt. Eagerness to overcome this guilt might even have prompted some people to exaggerate Israeli aggression. The old anti-Semitic slogan, promoted by the Nazi newspaper Der Stuermer, that "the Jews are our misfortune," has been given new currency by the Israeli conflict with the Palestinians. 
 There are other reasons, however, for the double standard directed at Israel. One is what the liberal Israeli philosopher and peace activist Avishai Margalit has termed "moral racism." The bloodlust of an African or Asian people is not taken as seriously that of a European - or other white - people. After all, some might say  (and many more might think ), what can one expect from savages? They don't know any better. 
 This is, of course, a deeply colonial sentiment, and the legacy of colonialism works against Israel in another way, too. As was true of apartheid-era South Africa, Israel reminds people of the sins of Western imperialism. Israel is regarded in the Middle East, as well as by many people in the West, as a colony led by white people  (despite the fact that many prominent Israelis have their roots in Tehran, Fez or Baghdad ). The Palestinians are seen as colonial subjects, and the longer Israel continues to occupy Arab territories, the more this perception will be confirmed. 
 Finally, Israel is still a democracy, and as such should not be judged by the same standards as dictatorships. We must expect more of Benjamin Netanyahu's government than of, say, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's regime in Iran - not because Jews are morally superior to Persians, but because Netanyahu was freely elected and is subject to the rule of law, whereas Ahmadinejad has helped to destroy whatever was democratic about Iran. In a sense, to hold Israel to the highest standards is to pay it the compliment of being treated like a normal democracy. 
 If some critics of Israel refuse to treat it as a normal country, however, the same is true of some of Israel's staunchest defenders. Special pleading for Israel as a nation of victims - the natural heirs of the targets of Nazi mass murder - is another way to apply a double standard. The French philosopher Alain Finkielkraut was right to criticize Erdogan for overreacting to the raid on the "Gaza freedom flotilla." But, by adding that Hitler's "Mein Kampf" is a best-seller in Turkey, he implied that Erdogan's Turks are modern-day Nazis. 
 Israel as a nation of victims is, in fact, contrary to its founders' creed. They wanted to create a new nation, a normal nation, a nation of good Jewish soldiers and farmers, different from the powerless Jews who fell victim to European persecution. It was only later, starting perhaps with the Adolf Eichmann trial in 1961, that the Holocaust became a staple of state propaganda. Later still, under such leaders as Menachem Begin, military enterprises were justified by references to the Nazi genocide. 
 That all Jews, including Israeli Jews, should remain haunted by a horrible past is understandable. But it must never be used to justify aggression against others. Israel is an immensely powerful country - freer, richer and better armed than all of its neighbors. Holding its leaders to account for their actions is essential, not only to protect Palestinians from brutality, but to preserve the freedom of Israelis. Allowing the past to cloud our critical faculties undermines Israeli democracy, and will have further dangerous consequences in the future.

<title>Israel demands peace from Palestinians as its own racism spreads</title>
<date>Sun Mar 14 03:15:01 IST 2010</date>
<content>
The Strategic Affairs Ministry never ceases to bring us peace of mind. How nice to know that someone in Israel is monitoring Palestinian incitement, ensuring they "create an environment of peace" and striving "to push them toward a culture of peace". After all, what do we care about construction in Jerusalem, Efrat or Ramat Shlomo, or about checkpoints, arrests, home demolitions, the army's "neighbor policy," bone breaking, land appropriation or the blockade of 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza?  
All of these are minor issues compared with naming a square near Ramallah after Dalal Mughrabi, a Palestinian woman who took part in a bloody terror attack three decades ago, calling for confronting the occupation or referring to suicide bombers as martyrs. These are the real threats to peace. After all, according to the road map, the Palestinians are responsible for ending incitement. After we have meticulously fulfilled everything the road map required of us and completely frozen settlement construction, it's now their turn.  
Yossi Kuperwasser, the deputy director of the Strategic Affairs Ministry and a generally bright man who once headed the Military Intelligence research department, explains that there are several categories of incitement. These include encouraging others to commit terrorist acts, demonizing Israel and creating an atmosphere of hostility toward it. The fact that the occupation persists in the Palestinian territories, and that any nation under occupation will do virtually anything to rid itself of this arrangement, is apparently missing from his consciousness. 
In his view, when Palestinians get up in the morning they begin cursing Israel and plotting its erasure from the map and school textbooks through the noble acts of their martyrs. The members of the team tasked with monitoring incitement disingenuously assert that there is no difference between scrutinizing this kind of incitement and monitoring anti-Israel rhetoric emanating from Europe or the United States. The difference, however, is profound: Israel hasn't occupied France or Cleveland, or destroyed a single home there.  
Incitement is an elusive affair. How, for example, would the monitoring team classify the following remarks: "The political statement made by [Scandar] Copti turned 'Ajami' from a movie into another link in the fight waged by the Palestinians in Israel against the state of which they are citizens. That makes it just like disrespecting the memory of the Olei Hagardom [pre-state Zionist militants executed by British authorities in the Mandate period] or accusing Israel of being an apartheid state even though the Israeli Palestinians' rights as citizens here exceed those of any Arab country (and include supernumerary rights, such as exemption from mandatory military service) .... Among those contributing to hatred of Israel are, in addition to filmmakers, Israeli intellectuals and artists from other disciplines - and for exactly the same reasons that the filmmakers are so eager to make their self-flagellating films."  
Did the writer of these words in these pages (Israel Harel, March 11) intend to incite against Arab citizens of Israel or against Israeli intellectuals? Wouldn't it be more appropriate to examine instances of incitement in Israel before sticking our nose into the affairs of an occupied nation?  
Here is a good place for the monitoring team to start: a poll conducted by the Maagar Mochot research institution and presented recently at a Tel Aviv University conference shows that 56 percent of Israeli high school students believe that the country's Arab citizens should be prohibited from being elected to the Knesset. That figure rises to 82 percent among religious youths. Around half the respondents say Israeli Arabs should not receive the same rights as Israeli Jews. In the words of Prof. Daniel Bar-Tal of the Tel Aviv University School of Education: "The worldview of religious youth melds fundamentalism, nationalism and racism."  
If using the criteria of the monitoring team, Bar-Tal's remarks could be considered incitement against religious youth, or even Israeli youth in general. Before we file an indictment against Bar-Tal, however, we should return to Kuperwasser's comment that the purpose of the incitement index is to convince the Palestinians to create a "culture of peace." With whom exactly are they expected to build such a culture? With Israel's young generation, which sees Israeli Arabs as a dangerous foe from whom democratic rights should be withheld? With inciters who see an Arab film director, or the Jewish intellectuals who support him, as enemies of the state?  
The incitement index is not intended to actually gauge the measure of hatred Palestinians feel toward Israel, or to create the vaunted culture of peace. It is simply another dishonest tool being used to present Israel as a pure, righteous and peace-loving nation, all of whose citizens love Arabs. This is a veil intended to conceal the fact that, while a culture of peace is being demanded of the Palestinians, the Israeli side is witnessing an unimpeded spread of a culture of racism.

<title>Israel's apartheid doesn't stop at the West Bank</title>
<date>Wed Mar 03 01:40:12 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Here is a civics lesson about the Zionist heritage, which has recently basked in the limelight of another government decision.  
It has often been observed that poetry and lies have much in common, and this also applies to the state of Israel's founding document - the Declaration of Independence. It will "foster," it told me, "the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants... it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants." The document also calls upon "the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel" - not the "members of minorities," so beloved by the Zionist media - "to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the State on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions."  
However, since its establishment the state has not kept its promise. It continues to conduct itself like a Zionist occupation regime on every inch of the land. True, the military government has been lifted and "the Arab inhabitants" are usually free to move around in their homeland and even send representatives to the Knesset - but this is the sum total of the equality that was formulated and promised.  
The alienation between Arabs and Jews can be seen everywhere. It has not arisen solely in the context of the national conflict, but is rather a result of an establishment policy which has expropriated Arabs' lands to build communities "for Jews only" and has pushed the Arab inhabitants into localities under an "ethno-Zionist siege" on all sides.  
The Israel Police, which is responsible for maintaining public law and order, provides the most blatant evidence that the Israeli regime behaves as if it is a foreign regime. It abandons the Arab localities to the rule of criminal gangs, intervening only when concern arises that the crime might spill over into Jewish locales. The Arab alienation from the police - a symbol of the regime - is apparent, among other things, in the absence of Arabic writing on police vehicles. How does an Arab citizen feel about a police force that appears in his community, but does not include any writing in his language? Does this not symbolize, more than anything else, that the police represent an occupation regime, a foreign regime? How would the inhabitant of some Jewish locale feel if there were no writing in Hebrew on police vehicles, but only a foreign language?  
The alienation is also evident with regard to the central government. This is the only democratic country in the world where one-fifth of the citizens - who are declared to have equal rights, at least on paper - have no representation in the government or in "provisional and permanent institutions." And this is the case even before we start talking about budgetary allocations, master plans, the building of cities and communities, education, culture, industrialization and more.  
This national alienation is evident in the apartheid reflected throughout the media. Anyone watching talk shows on television will immediately notice a balance in terms of the guests in the studio: There is a religious person and a secular person, a settler and someone from Peace Now. Only the Arab citizen is absent from every discourse.  
Were the Arab Knesset members blessed with any imagination, they would pull the words "on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions" out of the Declaration of Independence and formulate them into a bill. After all, what makes a malicious Jewish populist any better than a malicious Arab populist? There is no dearth of Arab populists who would feel right at home with the Jewish populists in the studios or on ministerial committees. If the proposal is accepted, we will advance the principle of equality. If it is rejected, we will have exposed the lies and deceit of those who take the name of the Declaration of Independence in vain.

<title>Israel's legislation could eventually serve its enemies</title>
<date>Mon Nov 01 05:14:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
The proposed law for the amendment of the communal cooperative directive − which enables admissions committees of small communities to reject candidates if they don’t meet certain criteria − is a wolf in lamb’s clothing.
At first glance, the proposal, which was approved by the Knesset’s Constitution, Law and Justic Committee, bans these committees from refusing to accept a candidate “exclusively on the basis of race, religion, sex, nationality or physical disability.” In actual effect, owing to a formula that allows as criteria for admissions “the lack of a candidate’s suitability for the community’s social-cultural fabric,” the proposal allows for the disqualification of anyone who is not a Zionist, meaning Arabs, and other types of “unsuitable” candidates. In this way, the proposal joins continuing discrimination against the Arab public in the housing sector, as well as a series of proposed laws that seek to harm this population.
The Arab population in Israel suffers from ongoing discrimination in housing and land allocation resulting from massive expropriation in the past, unwillingness to expand areas for building in Arab towns and villages and the lack of an authorized development plan in many of these communities. In addition to discrimination in many areas, such as education and employment, there is a growing sense that Arabs in Israel are not citizens who enjoy equal rights, and that what is now at play is policy designed to drive them away.
The result is mounting hostility between Arabs and Jews in Israel. There are those, such as Prof. Ruth Gavison, who support the notion of “separate but equal” in principle. Yet even these people must acknowledge that under existing circumstances of disparity, the barring of Arabs from communal settlements is discriminatory toward them. The foul odor of racism wafts from the desire to keep Arabs out of the communal settlements. Types of justification marshalled to warrant this approach, such as fears of decline in property values, of intermarriage or of outbreaks of violence, are dubious.
How would we respond were such arguments hazarded against Jews in another country? Weighing against the racially based preferences of Jewish individuals to live exclusively with people of their own religious group, there is the right of a minority not to be humiliated by prohibitions against belonging to a certain group. This right has prerogative.
The issue in question is not just the liberty of a resident to choose his neighbors. It is also the way the state allocates its economic assets. In such allocations, the state has no right to discriminate on a national-ethnic basis. Should we accept the assumption that the arguments utilized to justify the barring of Arabs from the communal settlements take precedence over the rights of equality and human dignity, then these arguments would apply not just to the small communities but also to all forms of settlement in Israel, including cities that lack traits of planned communal villages.
Such a possibility has no legitimacy in a democratic society. There is thus a straight line connecting this proposed law and calls issued by rabbis in Safed not to sell or rent apartments to Arabs. So long as the state has a Jewish majority, its Jewish character will be preserved. This difference between majority and minority justifies settlements for Arabs ‏(or vegans‏) alone, but not for Jews only. Since Jews are the majority, there is no concern about the preservation of their group identity, where the Arabs are a minority, and their collective identity is threatened.
The national isolationism that this proposal is designed to promote will deepen alienation and hostility. As things stand, separation between Arabs and Jews in Israel is extreme: There are scarcely any joint educational, residential or military service frameworks. A Jewish-Israeli can go through life without meeting an Arab-Israeli. That is how fears, stereotypes and malice is engendered.
No doubt, the proposal promotes the Yisrael Beiteinu party’s vision of making the Arabs disappear, and, until that time, of knocking them down in the hopes that they will lose their bearings. It is also clear that should the law be passed, the Knesset will notch a major “achievement” − the provision of ammunition to enemies of Israel who claim that it is a racist, Apartheid state.

<title>It's not the PR, stupid </title>
<date>Tue Jun 08 01:53:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 
The core of Israel's atrocious failure in handling the Gaza flotilla isn't on the operational side, and not even in the clumsy planning and implementation of the public-relations aspects. It isn't even a matter of the policy of blockading Gaza, which has ceased serving its purpose and has become a millstone around our necks. The source of the debacle lies in our inability to grasp the nature of the campaign against us, and what conclusions must be drawn.
Having failed to defeat us by force, our remaining enemies have shifted their efforts to trying to weaken the world's support for the justice of our cause and to delegitimize our very existence. They are doing this systematically and ardently in all arenas, with a readiness to make sacrifices and use any means.
Regrettably, they are achieving substantial success. This is the common denominator of the world's response to the outcome of the flotilla raid, the reference to Israel by the recent Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference, the Goldstone report and the articles about the alleged nuclear cooperation between Israel and the apartheid regime in South Africa. They all depict Israel as a nefarious state with an irresponsible, trigger-happy leadership that indiscriminately uses illegitimate means and meets every problem with brutal, vengeful force.
And we play right into their hands. Again and again, we make our few friends left sick of us, and over and over we push the skeptics and neutrals into the arms of our inveterate hate-driven foes. We contribute to this not only by balking at peace, continuing "illegal"  (as we call it ) settlement, wanton misconduct in the territories, and barring intellectuals from entering Israel. We are also our callous toward the many Arab citizens who wish to continue living with us in peace as Israelis.
The delusionary attitude of rabbis and leaders toward Jews whose only sin is that they belong to the Reform or Conservative movements or are, God forbid, dark-skinned, drives many of our people away from us. On top of all this comes our bear hug of evangelical Christians.
We fail to take advantage of our opportunities to expound on our positive credo to the world, or to fulfill it. Our prime minister has avoided taking a leading role in the environmental struggle and halting global warming, just as he has recoiled from presenting our vision of disarmament and from appearing at the nuclear security summit convened by the U.S. president. These are all areas in which Israel has not only a clear interest, but also a favorable record. All we have left for the world is for it to see us using force, even when it is unnecessary and devoid of any sense, including innumerable apparent breaches of international norms, from piracy on the high seas to the misuse of foreign passports.
True, there is an abundance of hypocrisy and shortsightedness in the world, and our enemies exploit it at every opportunity. But we, by acts of both commission and omission, abet them. The reserves of tolerance toward us are running out at a terrifying rate. The debate over whether Israel has the right to exist is no longer confined merely to marginal academic circles in Britain or bleeding-heart trade unions in Norway. The legitimization of our continued existence is in peril.
This is not a PR problem of how to explain ourselves. This is first and foremost the outcome of a muddleheaded and shortsighted policy, guided by neither a moral compass nor long-range self-interest. Our fight is essential and right, but in diplomacy as in driving a car, to survive, you have to be smart, not just right.

<title>It's our duty to challenge Israel's law of segregation</title>
<date>Mon Dec 27 02:38:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Ilana Hammerman's articles challenge us to ask what the role of a citizen is in a country where the law is illegal. In this space known as Israel and the occupied territories, the space guarded by Israeli soldiers, there are six groups with different rights and different levels of freedom of movement, according to the law.
The first group consists of about 1.5 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, who have been under a prolonged closure for years, with only a small number of persons bearing special permits allowed to leave. The second group is the 2.4 million Palestinians in the West Bank, barred from entering Jerusalem or Israel proper unless they have special permits, which they can receive only in exceptional cases from the military authority known as the Civil Administration. The settlements, all of which are illegal by international law, have stolen 44 percent of West Bank land for Jewish settlers. They have been surrounded by patrol and access roads, on which Palestinians are not allowed to travel. The roads from one place to another inside the territories are also blocked by hundreds of checkpoints. The freedom of movement of almost all Palestinians in the West Bank is limited - to inside the West Bank only.
The third group is the quarter-million Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, who have blue identity cards and can travel in Israel, Jerusalem and parts of the West Bank, but whose travel outside of that space is controlled and restricted by Israel. Jerusalem Palestinians who leave the city to study abroad, or even in Bethlehem, lose their status of "permanent residents," which signifies their future temporary presence in the city.
The Palestinian citizens of Israel are the fourth group, and supposedly have the same freedom of movement as the fifth group: the Jewish citizens of Israel. Neither group is allowed to enter Gaza or the main cities in the West Bank. But the law allows Jews from the whole world and from Israel to settle in Israel and the territories, and to receive Israeli citizenship, while forbidding - with the endorsement of the Supreme Court - Palestinians from the first, second, third and fourth groups to intermarry and decide where to live together.
The sixth group is asylum seekers and migrant laborers, whose freedom of movement is restricted and who live in fear of being deported. While this group is new here, after 43 years of occupation, the regime that separates different groups of people with different rights is not temporary and resembles the apartheid regime.
In South Africa, too, the apartheid system was created thanks to detailed legislation that determined who had the right to vote, who had the right to live where, which persons had to carry passes to stay in white cities and which lived there by right, and which were considered strangers in the very cities in which they were born and grew up. Apartheid was not only a system of racial discrimination maintained by the military through the use of extreme force, but a system of discrimination regulated by legislation.
The State of Israel also emphasizes, both to its own citizens and the international community, that it is a state of law; the occupied territories are administered by a system of laws, orders and directives. The Supreme Court expanded its jurisdiction into the territories. Furthermore, Israel has signed most of the main international conventions on human rights  (although with significant reservations ), and invests considerable efforts in maintaining the rule of law. Like in South Africa, separation and discrimination are enforced by the law.
Like Ilana Hammerman, I too refuse to obey illegal laws. In a country where spacious prisons were built under the protection of the law, in which people live in fear, it is not only our right but our duty to offer a space of hope. As long as we do not have agreed-upon borders, we are living in an occupying country that discriminates between the rights of different groups based on their ethnicity.
In such a country, just like in South Africa under apartheid, it is our right and our duty to challenge the legality of the law.

<title>Legitimizing an obstacle to peace</title>
<date>Wed Sep 08 08:02:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
I feel compelled to speak out on the controversy surrounding the Israeli artists who have announced their refusal to perform in the territories. For the record, my career as a performer has spanned 68 years. In my 20s, I was a cofounder of the Cameri Theater in Tel Aviv ‏(of that group, I am the last one alive‏). I have resided in America since 1954, and as a concert artist I frequently work in the field of Jewish culture, performing in the languages of our people − Hebrew, Yiddish, Ladino and even in English, the language spoken by the largest Jewish community in the world.
As president of the Associated Actors & Artistes of America ‏(the umbrella union covering performers in the United States‏), I have often spoken out in opposition to cultural boycotts. I have argued that art opens minds and builds bridges, even when carried into the very heart of enemy territory − perhaps especially then. But life, as we know it, often defies simple formulas. In the political arena, artists make a statement by their presence or their absence.
Pablo Casals, the world-famous cellist, who chose life-long exile from his native Spain because of the fascist dictator who ruled the beloved country of his birth, said this: “My cello is my weapon; I choose where I play, when I play, and before whom I play.”
My own choices have often been dictated by similar sentiments. For many years, when apartheid was the law of the land there, I refused official invitations and lucrative offers to perform in South Africa. Indeed, I have always refused to appear in halls that were racially segregated, whether in America or elsewhere in the world. More than two years ago, I refused an invitation by the mayor of Ariel to appear at the opening of the very same cultural facility then under construction and now at the center of the controversy.
There are weighty reasons why I find myself in full support of the artists’ refusal to perform in the territories. And it should be noted that I am not alone in supporting the courageous stand of our Israeli colleagues. There is a growing list of over 150 prominent artists and arts leaders from the U.S. who have expressed similar concerns to mine.
The cause celebre regarding the new performance facility in Ariel has given rise to statements from the leaders of that community as well as from Prime Minister Netanyahu and the culture minister, Limor Livnat. While the latter asserts that “political disputes should be left outside cultural life and art,” both the prime minister and the settlers’ council make it clear that the matter is not about art at all, but about what they call an attack on Israel “from within.” 
The declaration of conscience signed by prominent Israeli artists − among them recipients of the Israel Prize, the highest cultural accolade given by the state − is characterized as emanating from “anti-Zionist leftists” and is described by the prime minister as being part of an “international movement of delegitimization.”
Clearly, anything that is connected to the settlers or to the settlements’ presence beyond the Green Line is political. And, if the refusal of the artists to perform in the territories is tantamount to delegitimization, it follows that any agreement to perform there would amount to legitimizing what many of us ‏(in and outside of Israel‏) believe to be the single most glaring obstacle to peace.

<title>Liberal Diaspora Jewry afraid to talk, afraid to be silent </title>
<date>Fri Jun 11 01:18:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
LONDON - Last week I wrote a comment piece for the Guardian comparing the Israeli attack on the Gaza aid ships to the British assault on the Exodus in 1947. The comparison between the two events is far from exact, but both involved the running of a naval blockade as a public relations stunt, and both succeeded in dramatically winning over world opinion. In each case a more complex narrative told by the other side went unheard. Israel has failed to convince the public in Europe that those on board included terrorists smuggling arms to Hamas, and that they attacked the Israeli commandos first. As in 1947, rightly or wrongly, the sympathy was with those whose vessels were boarded, not those doing the boarding.
Here in Britain, for the most part, ordinary people don't care about the complicated story of the Middle East. They don't buy the line that Israel stands on the front line of the war against terror. They may know of the impoverished city of Sderot and the rocket fire it faced over time, but in the balance sheet of life and death - when, in a densely packed strip of earth blockaded from all directions, children are made to go without food, toys and medicines - human sympathy has little difficulty attaching itself to the victims.
Early on Friday morning I turned on my computer to see if my piece had run. It hadn't. I fired off an e-mail to my editor to ask what had happened, and settled down to read Anshel Pfeffer's June 4 column on Haaretz.com, in which he made the case that the Diaspora had failed Israel by not being the friend it needed. The close, loyal, loving friend who can tell you bluntly when you are destroying yourself.
In 2000, I published a novel about pre-state Tel Aviv, and a few years later, a nonfiction book about the months I spent observing the people on one block of Ben Yehuda Street in that same city. I define my political orientation as being on the left - the same left as authors David Grossman, Amos Oz and Etgar Keret, though not the left of historian Ilan Pappe. So Pfeffer's piece spoke to me.
After I finished reading the column, my e-mail pinged. It was the Guardian editor. My piece had been published in the newspaper's print edition, but was being held from the online site until after 8 A.M., when a dedicated moderator to monitor readers' comments would become available. Since the beginning of the week, she told me, the site's supervisors had been dealing with "appalling levels of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and hatred."
This is the tight place in which liberal Jews in the Diaspora find ourselves, and we can hardly breathe, let alone speak. Wanting to articulate the same critique of Israeli policy as Israeli critics, we find ourselves adding our voices to a condemnation of the Jewish state, which is turning into hate speech here. There is no evil crime of which Israel cannot be accused: It's an outlaw state, a pariah state, a demonic force. Calls for an end to the occupation are now regarded as merely propping up Zionism, an apartheid system. The right of return is sacred; the law of return is a racist abomination.
An Indian novelist I met 18 months ago said he had been warned against me. "She's a Zionist," he had been told, as if I was a carrier of bubonic plague. In Europe, public opinion is tending in one direction only: An anti-Zionist narrative is being articulated in the media, and "soft" public opinion is being dragged along in its wake - especially among people who don't know much about Israel or Palestine, but see best-selling Swedish novelists whose books are dramatized on British TV, and Irish Nobel Peace Prize winners on a mercy mission to aid a civilian population. A one-state solution, just like South Africa? Sounds lovely, they say.
Since the Spanish Civil War, the left has allied itself to a succession of progressive causes. In my lifetime these have been Czechoslovakia, Nicaragua, Northern Ireland, South Africa. They are the struggles according to which you define your politics. Today it is Palestine. In the British media, critical pro-Israel voices are drowned out by pro-Palestinian ones and the angry American Zionist right. Either you're a supporter of apartheid or a self-hating Jew.
In such a climate, it is very difficult to speak at all. To critically support Israel is to discredit your own progressive values - to be a pariah in the artistic and intellectual communities that are your natural home. To feel you can't stay shtum a moment longer and must express outrage is to contribute to an environment in which anti-Semites cherry-pick your words for their own abusive propaganda. To stay silent is the peaceful alternative, but for a writer the one that seems most shameful.

<title>Like Netanyahu, Barak wants second shot as prime minister </title>
<date>Wed Feb 10 01:59:14 IST 2010</date>
<content>
His career has been eulogized more than once. They said he would never be leader again, that he was insensitive, arrogant and disconnected from the people. They reckoned that his party was disintegrating and predicted that he would defect to the rival camp and glean crumbs from the table of his historical antagonist. All the same, Ehud Barak is returning to the center of the political arena and has once again joined the list of candidates for prime minister. A Haaretz-Dialog survey published last Friday confirmed a gut feeling: Barak is the most popular person in the cabinet.  
True, he came last in that list of candidates for the premiership, and true, defense ministers always enjoy support in times of peace. But the elections will not take place tomorrow, and Barak is not running for prime minister right now. The survey shows that Barak has overcome the public's disgust and is once again considered legitimate. That's all he needs for the moment.  
Barak's comeback campaign has been going on for a few weeks, after a lengthy period during which he was seen as the copilot to his former subordinate in the military, Benjamin Netanyahu. It does not suit Barak to serve as number two, and he is behaving like his old self again and trying to separate himself from the prime minister. The lack of a border with the Palestinians "within the historic Land of Israel" is a greater threat than the Iranian bomb, Netanyahu declared, when he spoke at Auschwitz about the Islamic Republic, "the new Amalek." Barak wants peace with Syria, even at the price of returning the Golan Heights. Netanyahu doesn't.  
Barak likes attacking the "left" for its naivete and blindness, but he has adopted the left's generations-old knockout argument: If we do not partition the land between us and the Palestinians, Israel will become an apartheid state. Like his great rival, Ehud Olmert, Barak has concluded that only partition can save Zionism. Netanyahu is someplace else. He ostensibly backs a two-state solution, but now he is trying to overcome the demographic threat by giving the vote to Israelis living abroad. He will accompany negotiations with the Palestinians with a propaganda campaign against anti-Israel incitement in the Palestinian Authority.  
A tipping point in the delicate equilibrium between the prime minister and the defense minister became evident during the brouhaha over the Netanyahu family's maid. Barak, too, had maid troubles, which on the face of it were far more serious. Mr. and Mrs. Barak employed an illegal migrant, whereas Bibi and Sara's maid was legally employed and only complained of bad working conditions.  
But Barak ignored the matter, making do with a noncommittal statement from his office, while Netanyahu accused the media of persecuting him and took advantage of a state visit to Germany to defend his wife publicly. Barak never implored the media "to leave Nili alone," and his insensitivity seems to have paid off in retrospect. Netanyahu slipped back into his old image, the pressured and sweaty one, while Barak displayed self-control and restraint - precisely the qualities the public wants for the hand on the red button.  
Barak has not changed. He has always been respected but not liked. As defense minister he is demonstrating the same capability as he did in the army - to read the situation correctly and avoid the snags that hit others. His proposal to end Operation Cast Lead after a number of days, as distinct from Olmert who wanted to go on and on, was justified, and it immunized him against the Goldstone report's allegations. Meanwhile, preparing the army for the mission and the low number of Israeli casualties were notched up to his credit.  
Barak's aspirations are based on two models. One is Yitzhak Rabin, who used his term as defense minister to correct his image as a weak prime minister and return to the helm as the national savior. The other is none other than Netanyahu, who received a divided and fractured Likud in 2006 and came back with it to government in 2009. Barak believes that if they succeeded, so can he. His chances depend on how the security situation plays out. If there is a national crisis, Barak could be called on to take over because of his experience and composure. An unsuccessful war could gravely damage his career, as happened to Moshe Dayan and Amir Peretz, and to Barak himself in the second intifada.  
During the Olmert period, Barak tried to moderate the prime minister's aggression, to delay or shorten military operations. His critics say he feared that Olmert would take all the credit. Will Barak behave the same way when Netanyahu brings the Iranian bomb issue up for a decision? Will he manage to leverage the crisis to his own advantage and come back to the leadership in a big way?

<title>Little Goldstones </title>
<date>Thu May 13 23:52:52 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 
 Sometimes you have to point out someone else's defects in order to expose your own. 
 There is absolutely no doubt: Richard Goldstone has turned out to have a defect, and it's no small one. It's not necessary to continue to coddle him after he has been found defective. A thousand excuses about constraints will not save his soul, from the time he consented to be appointed an appeals judge in the service of apartheid. Even the seal of approval given him after the fact by the African National Congress will not remove the stain. At best, he will be able to stand with those who repent. 
 If someone places his hand in the bosom of apartheid - even if he later removes it - his hand becomes leprous. This is the hand that signed execution orders and handed over the backs of children to be lashed. Although a penetrating and disturbing account can be received even from the hand of a leper, there is no obligation to shake that hand, and certainly not to wash it. 
 With the fall of Goldstone there are many people rejoicing here, because with him his report will fall. This is only the rejoicing of the poor in spirit, rejoicing about which we can ask: What is it doing here? After all, Israel itself cooperated with the regime of racial segregation, and the Pretoria government had no better friend that the government in Jerusalem. 
 This has always been our way: To relax for our own benefit on the darkened side of the globe, to spend time in the shadow of oppressive regimes. We have never refused an indecent offer from a leprous country, and a business permit has always been found for it. 
 It is hard to resist temptation; and the more disgusting the government, the more skilled it is at being tempted. 
 They tried once to tempt me, too: After I publicly expressed reservations about the special relationship between the two countries, the South African ambassador phoned and asked to meet. He invited me to visit his country. Of course my wife was invited too, of course I would meet with ministers and legislators in the capital and rhinos in the nature preserve, and of course we would also meet with opponents of the regime, if we so desired; the name of Archbishop Desmond Tutu was mentioned. 
 I refused. It's true that I wasn't offered a judgeship, but I didn't even want to be a temporary guest. 
 I don't care that stones are now being thrown at Goldstone - a real white intifada - but I wouldn't want to identify among those stone-throwers people who went at the time to investigate apartheid at his expense, and returned full of impressions. 
 We also have to make sure that the glass in our house will not shatter. Many are liable to be hurt - even judges - and mainly those who sit in judgment wearing uniforms. Although our military courts do not mete out death sentences, they end lives, and not necessarily according to due process of law, as Ilana Hammerman occasionally reports in her columns. 
 "Those were the laws at the time," the great Goldstone is now arguing in his defense, and without realizing it, in the defense of others like him; this country is full of little Goldstones, and somewhat bigger ones too. 
 When Georges Clemenceau realized during the Dreyfus trial how quickly the mills of justice grind, and how human beings are ground into human dust, he bequeathed us a perpetual insight: Military justice is to justice, he said, what military music is to music.

<title>Mideast peace needs prophets, not yes-men</title>
<date>Sat Aug 14 16:10:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
“After I visited Israel and wrote “The Shadow Over Israel” for Haaretz, many people asked me what “my position” was. “Position” is a military term and spatial metaphor, and space and time and functions of each other: positions alter as events unfold — but “my position” is that I wish the best outcome for all. But what is that outcome, and what are the alternatives?
Picture a minor prophet. Perhaps he’d be working today as an astrologer. He’s looking towards Israel and Palestine, consulting his charts and stars, getting a handle on the future. But the future is never single -- there are too many variables – so what he sees is a number of futures.
In the first one, there’s no Israel: it’s been destroyed in war and all the Israelis have been killed. (Unlikely, but not impossible.) In the second, there’s no Palestine: it’s been merged with Israel, and the Palestinians either slaughtered or driven beyond its borders. Israel has become completely isolated: international opinion has been outraged, boycott measures have been successful, financial aid from the U.S. -- both public and private – has evaporated, and the United States government, weakened by the huge debt caused by its Iraqi and Afghani wars and lured by the promise of mineral wealth and oil, has cooled towards Israel and swung towards entente with the Muslim world. Israel has become like North Korea or Burma – an embattled military state – and civilian rights have suffered accordingly. The moderate Israelis have emigrated, and live as exiles, in a state of bitterness over wasted opportunities and blighted dreams.
In the third future there’s one state, but a civil war has resulted, since the enlarged population couldn’t agree on a common flag, a common history, a common set of laws, or a common set of commemoration days -- “victory” for some being “catastrophe” for others. In the fourth, the one-state solution has had better results: it’s a true one-person, one-vote secular democracy, with equal rights for all. (Again, unlikely in the immediate future, but not impossible in the long run.)
In the fifth future, neither Israel nor Palestine exist: several atomic bombs have cleared the land of human beings, though wildlife is flourishing, as at Chernobyl. In the sixth, climate change has turned the area into a waterless desert.
But there’s another future: the seventh future. In this future there are two states, “Israel” and “Palestine.” Both are flourishing, and both are members of a regional council that deals with matters affecting the whole area. Trade flows harmoniously between the two viable states, joint development enterprises have been established, know-how is being shared, and, as in Northern Ireland, peace is paying dividends.
That, surely, is a desirable outcome, thinks the stargazer; but how was it achieved? Since he has the gift of virtual time travel, he leaps into the seventh future and looks back at the steps taken to get there.
The impetus came from within Israel. The Israeli leaders saw that the wind had shifted: it was now blowing against the earlier policy of crushing force and the appropriation of occupied lands. What had caused this change? Was it the international reaction to the destructive Cast Lead invasion of Gaza? The misjudged killing of flotilla activists? The gathering boycott activities in the United States and Europe? The lobbying of organizations such as J-Street? The 2010 World Zionist Congress vote to support a settlement freeze and endorse a two-state solution?
For whatever reasons, Israel had lost control of its own story. It was no longer Jack confronting a big bad Giant: the narrative of the small country struggling bravely against overwhelming odds had moved over to the Palestinians. The mantra, “Plant a tree in Israel,” was no longer respectable, as it evoked images of bulldozers knocking down Palestinian olive groves. Israel could not continue along its current path without altering its own self-image beyond recognition. The leadership read the signs correctly and decided to act before a peaceful resolution slipped forever beyond reach. Leaders are supposed to guide their people towards a better and more secure future, they thought: not over the edge of a cliff.
First, the Golan Heights was returned to Syria under a pact that created a demilitarized zone with international supervision. The few Israeli inhabitants were allowed to remain if they wished, though they then paid taxes to Syria.
Then, with the help of a now-friendly Syria, Hamas was invited to the peace negotiations. The enlightened leaders – with an eye to Northern Ireland -- realized that they couldn’t set as a precondition something that remained to be negotiated, so they didn’t demand the pre-recognition of Israel as a Jewish state. Hamas, to the surprise of many, accepted the invitation, as it had nothing to lose by doing so. Peace was made between Fatah and Hamas, and Palestine was thus able to present a single negotiating team.
The negotiations were complex, but people worked hard not to lose their tempers. Several North American First Nations negotiators were invited as coaches, as they had much long-term experience and patience, and –remembering South Africa – they knew that yelling and denouncing would not accomplish anything. As soon as they stepped off the plane, they smudged with sage to cleanse the region of its buildup of fear, anger, and hatred, and despair, and with sweetgrass to attract positive emotions.
The agreement took less time than expected, as happens when people are serious. Then the Occupation – disastrous for those in both countries, both physically and morally -- was over, and Palestinian independence was declared. A mutual defense pact was signed, along with a trade and development pact. As Israel had realized that it could not rest its foundation on international law while also violating that law, the borders reverted to those of 1967, with a few land swaps along the edges. Jerusalem was declared an international city, with both an Israeli parliament building and a Palestinian one, and access to the various holy sites for believers.
Gaza was joined to the West Bank by corridors, as in the East/West Germany of old; the ports were opened, and the fishing boats could sail once more. Development money poured in, creating full employment. The water situation was rectified, with fair-access agreements signed, pollution cleaned up, and more fresh water created through a new cheap solar-driven desalination process.
What about the difficult matter of the Settlements? The First Nations advisors cited some of their own precedents: settlers could stay in Palestine if they wished, under lease agreements. The leases and taxes paid by the settlers were a source of income to the Palestinian state, and as their products were no longer boycotted, the Settlements did better. On the whole, peace and security reigned. There was even a shared Memorial Day, in which all those fallen in past wars were honoured.
The seventh future is within reach -- the stars favour it -- but the stargazer knows that many prefer the status quo: there can be advantage as well as profit in conflict. However, change often comes abruptly, like the fall of the Berlin Wall, the storming of the Bastille, or the end of Apartheid. The amount of blood shed during such transitions – from none to a great deal -- depends on the wisdom of the leadership.
How to promote such wisdom? It’s a prophet’s traditional duty to lay out the alternatives – the good futures, and also the bad ones. Prophets – unlike yes-men -- tell the powerful not what they want to hear, but what they need to hear. “How can I put this?” thinks the stargazer. “Something beginning with the handwriting on the wall…?”

<title>Missing the forest </title>
<date>Sun Aug 08 01:17:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Sometimes you really can't see the forest for the trees. The forest of political, governmental and institutional racism in Israel is dark and deep. One particular tree in that forest happens to have Israelis all riled up: The state's handling of the children of migrant workers. In the shade of a nearby tree is the state's handling of these children's parents, but this excites the Israelis somewhat less. And there are many other poisonous trees in the forest: Citizenship laws, loyalty laws, conversion laws, the razing of Bedouin villages in the Negev and even the story of the Arab delivery man who was convicted of rape for pretending to be a Jew. Each one galvanized parts of society into action, and this is well and good; but few see the big picture, and the big picture is several times worse than the sum of its components.
Enlightenment came from an unexpected direction; it was Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, of all people, who accurately defined the problem. In deciding on these children's future, he said, the cabinet is torn between humanitarian considerations on one hand and Zionist considerations on the other. The prime minister of Israel himself presents them as a contradiction, and this is the story in a nutshell.
Each particular wrong must be fought, of course, but we must not forget that all comes down to one large, fundamental truth: Defining Israel as a Jewish state condemns us to living in a racist state. This is the new definition of Zionism that we have subscribed to, and until we realize that we will not be able to uproot all the wild weeds that have seeded themselves here lately. Were we to not expel the migrant workers' children but continue to raze Bedouin villages we would not solve a thing. We will continue to move from one injustice to another until we recognize the racist nature of the state.
Israel is not the only place where racism is on the rise. Europe and the United States are awash in a turbid wave of xenophobia; but in Israel, this racism is embedded in the state's most fundamental values. There is no other state whose immigration laws are blatantly and unequivocally based on the candidates' bloodlines. Jewish blood, whether authentic or dubious, is kosher. Other blood, from those of other creeds or nationalities, is unacceptable. No country throws its doors wide open to everyone, but while other states take social, economic and cultural considerations into account in Israel bloodline is the name of the game. How else are we to understand the fact that someone who was born here, who speaks the language, cherishes its values and even serves in the military, can be unceremoniously expelled while a member of the Bnei Menashe community in India or the grandson of a half-Jew from Kazakhstan are welcomed with open arms.
In contrast to what we have been told there is no significant argument in the wider world, and of course not in Israel, over the Jews' right to a state. The argument is about its character. There is also no argument about the justice of the Law of Return: Israel is the place of the Jews who want to live there. The real argument is over the law's exclusivity, over the fact that it applies only to Jews. That's where it all begins. One could understand the need after the Holocaust, the necessity in the first years of the state, but 62 years after the founding of the state the time has come to reexamine the long-obsolete concepts.
Does anyone actually know the meaning of the term "Jewish state" that we bandy about so much? Does it mean a state for Jews only? Is it not a new kind of "racial purity"? Is the "demographic threat" greater than the danger of the state's becoming a religious enthnocracy or an apartheid state? Wouldn't it be better to live in a just democracy? And how is it even possible to speak about a state being both Jewish and democratic? But anyone who tries to enter the cauldron of this debate, who tries to think outside the box of tired cliche, is automatically fated to delegitimization and slander. Just ask Avraham Burg, who last week announced his intention to set up a political party along those very lines.

<title>Mr. Prime Minister, douse the flames of racism </title>
<date>Mon Dec 20 01:27:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
"How would we feel if we were told not to sell an apartment to Jews?" asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [speaking at the National Bible Contest for Adults]. "We would protest, and we protest now when it is said of our neighbors." He added: "Such things cannot be said, not about Jews and not about Arabs. They cannot be said in any democratic country, and especially not in a Jewish and democratic one. The State of Israel rejects these sayings."  ("Netanyahu slams top rabbis' call to forbid renting homes to Arabs," Haaretz, Dec. 8 )
The prime minister spoke properly and correctly when he came out against the racist, despicable call by municipal chief rabbis not to sell or rent apartments to Arabs. But if the legislation concerning community admission committees' right to accept or reject potential members passes its upcoming second and third readings - the message promoted by those rabbis will receive additional validation from the Knesset. If they don't vigorously oppose that bill and try to prevent its passage, the Knesset, the government and the prime minister will in essence be saying that words are one thing, but deeds are another.
On the one hand, the rabbis' racism is condemned and democracy is praised. On the other hand, a law may be passed that allows membership committees to disqualify candidates from living in small locales on the basis of "the candidate's lack of suitability for the social-cultural fabric of the community." Meaning, disqualifying those who are not Zionist - in other words, Arabs.
It is worthwhile to point out that that supporters of the law do not even try to hide its purpose, which is to "Judaize" the Negev and Galilee and enable residents of small communities "to choose their neighbors," according to unclear criteria that make it possible to exclude minorities and other weak populations.
In our view, passage of such a law is like putting an obstacle in the way of a blind man. The law unleashes the racist "evil urge" that exists in one form or another in virtually everyone - the same urge that pushes people to want to live with neighbors like them and to reject the alien, the different, the minority. Even someone who is not a racist and never even thought about screening his neighbors, may do so the moment this law gives him the tools to do so. In this way the legislation in question is not only an expression of racism, but it also aids and abets it.
This bill - beyond its grave violation of the dignity of the person undergoing the admissions process, with its screening, labeling and diagnosis, just because he wants to live in a small community - will serve opponents of Israel in their claims that this is a racist apartheid state. If it becomes law, it could also serve anti-Semites who want to exclude Jews from their communities. In such cases Israel will not be able to protest, as the prime minister said, because a similar discriminatory and racist law will be on its books.
That is why it's time to turn Netanyahu's justified position into deeds. He must throw his entire weight and responsibility behind preventing passage of the admission committees' bill in the Knesset plenum.
The fire of racism fanned by this bill will not be doused by any super-tanker plane, and we certainly will not receive any help from the international community in this matter. The responsibility for heading it off rests with the prime minister and the Knesset.

<title>Netanyahu did one thing right in the Jerusalem debacle</title>
<date>Sun Mar 21 01:14:21 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In the sea of (justified) mudslinging at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, there is also room for a good word. Intentionally or not, the prime minister has revealed the lies about Jerusalem and presented things truthfully. Intentionally or not, Netanyahu has put the capital's occupied parts that the world does not recognize in their proper place: Ramot is the same as Psagot; Neveh Yaakov is the same as Kokhav Yaakov. There is no difference between Yitzhar and French Hill. They are all settlements, including Ramot, which was built in no-man's-land. Intentional or not, you have to appreciate Netanyahu's move.  
A revelation has come forth in Jerusalem: Most of it is a settlement. After decades in which we lied ourselves to pieces and rendered kosher that which was not - only to ourselves, not to any other country - the truth has been revealed. It has been revealed after years in which no one thought to call the residents of these giant neighborhoods settlers. Years in which Teddy Kollek, a Labor Party man and a man of peace, of course, was considered a "builder" and not the greatest of settlers. He settled more Jews in occupied areas than any settler leader. Years in which doubting the settlement enterprise was tantamount to heresy and treason. So of all people, this right-winger, Netanyahu, proponent of the Greater Land of Israel, has lifted the veil.  
The work of the righteous is sometimes done by others, as the saying goes. (Let's not forget the assistance of the Obama administration - its only real achievement so far.) From now on we will have to conduct ourselves in the neighborhoods in the occupied areas just as we do in the settlements in the occupied areas. Any additional construction will come at a heavy political cost. House demolitions in the city have already been completely stopped; we can thank Netanyahu and Obama for that, too. Those who wanted it all may now lose it all, and that's a good thing.  
How pleasant it was all those years to think that Jerusalem was ours alone. We did what we wanted, we enacted the Jerusalem Law, we annexed areas that were not ours and believed that this was enough to whitewash reality.  
Now, perhaps, it's over. Thanks to the Obama-Netanyahu team, questions will arise: What exactly is the difference between this occupation, which we never admitted to, and the occupation we have admitted to? What's the difference between the Shoafat refugee camp and the Deheisheh refugee camp? Why is it okay to issue blue ID cards to residents of the Shoafat refugee camp and allow them relative freedom of employment, and not to the residents of Deheisheh? Why does a Palestinian from Beit Hanina not endanger security when he drives on Israeli roads and even takes off from Ben-Gurion International Airport, while his friend from Abu Dis is a ticking bomb? After all, they are the same Palestinians - in Jerusalem as in nearby Bethlehem and distant Jenin.  
Why, in the framework of negotiations "without preconditions," are eastern and northern Jerusalem not up for discussion, when every provocative act of construction on the other side of the Green Line in the capital, which has hardly expanded westward at all, is intended to create unilateral "political facts" - in other words, preconditions? And we must not forget that this huge building project in Jerusalem is for Jews only; not one Palestinian neighborhood has been built in 43 years of occupation. Should that not be called apartheid?  
Even the new magic and foolish solution of the greatest master of words, President Shimon Peres, has persuaded no one: Israel, the president now tells his guests from abroad, has the right to build in "Jewish neighborhoods." And how, Mr. President, did they become Jewish, all of them on Palestinian land, if not by massive, illegal settlement, just like in Ariel, Ma'aleh Adumim and Gush Etzion, which are now within the "consensus" we invented for ourselves? Consensus? Only in Israel. And to a great extent this consensus, too, has been fabricated.  
And we have not yet said a word about "sanctity," another reason for demands for sovereignty and settlement. Since when is sanctity a value in a secular state? What does it have to do with sovereignty? And to how many Israelis in this city, in all its new Jewish neighborhoods and old Palestinian suburbs, is it indeed sacred? And is it sacred only to us?  
These are the questions. The answers may be given soon, thanks to Obama and Netanyahu.

<title>Our bleeding-heart prime minister </title>
<date>Fri May 28 00:52:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
How can we rely on those Palestinians? For 43 years, they have been building the settlers' homes with the sweat of their brows, paving roads for them and building their fences, and then suddenly, out of the blue, a boycott? Is that the way for partners to behave? Is that how they pay us back after we educated them for so many years to be our hewers of wood and drawers of water?
The prime minister, too, doesn't understand this ungratefulness. At the Likud faction meeting this week, he complained bitterly about the Palestinian Authority's decision to boycott 500 items produced in the settlements and to halt the work of the 6,000 people who are building settlers' homes. "They think they can do everything they want," the prime minister concluded angrily as his heart bled over the terrible injustice being done to us while the whole world looks on and says nothing.
But really, how can they do this to us? After all, we provide them with work, a living, a good life, wealth and happiness, and they respond with ill feelings. Do they not know that without Arabs it's impossible to build? After all, the boycott could force the settlers to build their homes themselves, and why should the lords of the land suddenly start working in construction? That's only good for the natives. That's why there's an occupation that can supply modern slaves who work for half price, just like during apartheid.
The Yesha Council of settlers also doesn't understand what the boycott is about. It responded with sharp words and denounced the "hostile act." MK Uri Ariel (National Union ) proposed a counter-boycott, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that it was "unacceptable for the Arabs to wage an economic war against us."
Shraga Brosh, the president of the Manufacturers Association, believes that it's a scandal; this view is shared by ministers Avigdor Lieberman and Benjamin Ben-Eliezer. Because only we are allowed to carry out a publicity campaign to buy "blue and white." They are forbidden to develop their economy because their very essence must be to support us, their good masters. It's a fact that we sell them all the surplus from our factories, all the rejects, as well as all the medicine that has expired. Otherwise where would they get medicine from? We also pass work on to them. They are the ones who sew our shoes and produce the coals for our barbecues on Independence Day, because, after all, any work is respectable.
During that Likud faction meeting, Netanyahu revealed a terrible secret, according to which "the Palestinians tried to prevent us from being accepted into the OECD." That's just one more scandal in a long series, because if this plot of theirs had succeeded, he wouldn't now be able to go to Paris, and then to Canada and the United States. He wouldn't be able to enjoy the expensive double bed that El Al installed for him on the plane because simple first class is not suitable for such a VIP.
Netanyahu doesn't understand why the Palestinians opposed our joining the OECD. After all, they must return us a favor for cutting down their olive trees and plundering their land, for the killings, curfews, roadblocks and administrative detentions. Don't they understand that when we join the OECD we will become richer, and then we'll raise their salaries, give them generous pensions, annual vacations, clothing and social benefits? After all, Netanyahu said at the faction meeting that "Israel is striving for an economic peace, and we are working all the time to advance the Palestinian economy." What nobility!
Netanyahu also doesn't understand how they can refuse to accept his generous offer for "economic peace" and continue to struggle for an independent state. It's true that economic peace means a peace between a horse and its rider, but after all, what does an Arab want? A pita and some olives. And we'll give them plenty of those. On the other hand, if they dare be independent, who can guarantee that enough olives will remain for them?
And Netanyahu has another reason for being angry with them. He said they are "polluting our water sources." Indeed, that is the height of inconsideration. After all, we invested hundreds of billions in the West Bank to set up fancy recycling plants for sewage water, and hundreds of billions more to improve the environment in their villages and towns. Just look at the fruits of our investments in the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, which are known for their quality of life, cleanliness, beauty, spacious classrooms and sewage and water facilities that work just like in Switzerland.
So how do they dare sidetrack the recycling plants and allow sewage to flow into the nearest wadi, which unfortunately leads the smelly water to "our water sources"? After all, everyone knows that all the water between the Jordan River and the sea is ours.
The high point of Netanyahu's bitter dirge about the Palestinians came when he explained that "they themselves will be harmed by the boycott," so it is wrong. At that point, it finally became clear to me that we are dealing with a humane and sensitive person of the first order. All his efforts are guided by concern for the Palestinians so that they should not be harmed by the boycott. And that's what doesn't allow him to sleep at night.
That apparently is also the reason he demanded that El Al install a special double bed on the flight to Paris. So that maybe, despite everything, he would be able to forget his concerns about the Palestinians for a few minutes and catch a little shut-eye.

<title>Pins in the Goldstone voodoo doll </title>
<date>Thu May 13 23:52:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
What will they come up with next? The campaign to discredit Judge Richard Goldstone, his fact-finding commission and the report that now bears his name seems to reach new heights every week. The latest installment in this high-drama farce has been the revelations about Goldstone's record during apartheid-era South Africa, and the implication that his report can therefore be disregarded. The mind reels at the intensity of attempts by Israeli officials and others to do everything to dodge the real questions of accountability, policy and justice that have been lingering inconveniently since Operation Cast Lead. But inconvenient questions do tend to linger, and the attempts to deploy an ever-thicker smokescreen usually only draw more attention to what may be hidden behind it.
And yet, the recent attacks on Goldstone have been helpful in re-introducing into public discourse what is perhaps the most important question of all: moral responsibility. How must individuals behave when faced with injustice? What do we expect from our judges, public servants and elected officials? And what do we expect from ourselves? The focus on Goldstone's past, far from enabling us to escape the lingering questions of Cast Lead - and other questions that must trouble anyone seeking justice - actually serves to throw them into sharp relief.
So here are some complementary questions about justice and those involved in its disservice. And mind you, these questions were not drawn from a far-away past, but from the here-and-now. It is the present that will determine our future - and to what extent justice will be a part of it.
Consider this: What is the reader's moral judgment of a law that allows some people to reclaim past ownership rights but denies the same rights to others? This is the question today in Sheikh Jarrah.
How just do we deem the conduct of legal advisers who approve the evacuation of longtime indigenous residents from the center of a thriving city, enforcing almost complete separation between the hundreds who have moved in and the thousands who were displaced? This is the question today in Hebron.
What do we think of military commanders who collectively punish more than a million human beings, systematically answering their nutritional needs with provisions that keep them just above a state-secret "red line"? This is the question today in Gaza.
What do you make of a court of justice that speaks in lofty terms of how wrong segregated roads are, but falls short of connecting principle and practice, and does not simply ban such wrongs outright? This is the question today regarding Route 443.
Morally speaking, how do you feel about a government that orders the arrest of leaders of nonviolent civil protest? This is the question in West Bank villages like Bil'in.
These were not questions about Goldstone's past. There are questions about our present. Standing knee-deep in moral quicksand may not be the most convincing of postures from which to question someone else's morality.
But let us not stop here. Let us go further and assume for a moment that Goldstone is indeed guilty as charged of having served an unjust regime. If you will, while at it, let us believe in the fiction that - as was falsely claimed by Im Tirtzu's extremists - a huge part of Goldstone's report was based on the work of Israeli human rights NGOs. So what? How does this information affect the real questions about justice and morality that should be concerning us? Do any of these diversions make the real questions about the Israel Defense Forces' rules of engagement during Cast Lead or about civilian, noncombatant casualties in Gaza during the military operation less urgent or essential?
At the end of the day, after Goldstone is finally exorcised as a witch and Israel's human rights NGOs shut down, what then? Won't accountability still be a cornerstone of the rule of law? Putting the diversions aside for a moment - and the author is appreciative of how difficult that is, given the government's urge to obsess on nothing but diversions - are we not still left with alarming suspicions, partial information, and a very real need for a credible, independent investigation into Cast Lead?
Not only Goldstone, but all of us, are morally responsible for our actions and inactions, for when we choose to speak out for justice and for when we keep our silence and help perpetuate what is unjust. South Africa's past became a part of its future through the truth and reconciliation process; but here in Israel not only is there no reconciliation process, there is no desire by the government nor among most of the public to confront inconvenient truths. Rather, the focus is on truth-dodging, which only serves to further steer us away from reconciliation or justice.
The growing distance between where the moral compass points and where we as a society are headed is no one's problem more than our own. We can stick pins in the Goldstone voodoo doll as much as we want to but, when we wake up tomorrow morning, the very same reality will still be right here, exactly as we left it. Morally speaking, it's high time for our wake-up call, for a sincere look at our own image as reflected in our mirror, for truth-seeking instead of desperately, cynically, self-servingly trying to hide it - and hide from it.

<title>Secret, and shameful, ties </title>
<date>Fri Feb 26 01:57:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
LONDON - The last time it was revealed that Israeli agents were using British passports, in 1987, Margaret Thatcher put her iron foot down. There was no intelligence exchange between the countries for a decade, and no Mossad station in London until its reestablishment here only a couple of years ago.
This time, with no one really doubting that Israel was behind the Dubai assassination of Hamas arms dealer Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, or that Mossad agents used fake passports from the United Kingdom and other states - Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been compelled, reluctantly, to express diplomatic indignation. Even initially sympathetic media outlets became outraged in their tone over last week's passport scandal, and since it is election season, the Conservative party leader, David Cameron, seized on the episode as a handy stick with which to beat Brown and his government.
Thus the Israeli ambassador was called in to provide explanations at the Foreign Office. Obviously, Ron Prosor had none to give, and the meeting was brief, though still, it should be said, convivial. No threats were leveled, apparently. There is still a long way to go down the carefully graded list of diplomatic demarche before anything serious will happen to bilateral relations.
Similarly, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband's 45-minute meeting with his counterpart Avigdor Lieberman in Brussels this week was just for show. The British don't take Lieberman seriously and have never asked to speak to him on any matter of genuine importance.
Of course, if further evidence of Israel's involvement in Dubai is uncovered, Jerusalem might have to own up discreetly, perhaps provide a few operational details. Some cooperation with the investigations of the Serious Organized Crime Agency and the Metropolitan Police might help placate Whitehall. A reprimand by the British government might follow, or a member of Israel's London embassy staff could agree to be made a scapegoat. But these are all diplomatic niceties, distractions from the real business afoot.
Mabhouh's absence may slow down arms shipments from Iran to Gaza, but the fallout from his assassination could make it harder for Israel to confront the much more serious Iranian threat. The worst-case scenario now is for bilateral intelligence-sharing to be suspended.
While the UK relies on Israel for much of its intelligence on Iran, not to mention other areas of interest in the Middle East, Israel also needs Britain on its side with respect to Iran, particularly because of its role in the European Union. With Russia and China blocking any serious action from the UN, Israel needs an EU initiative if sanctions are really to hurt Tehran. And Britain is both a permanent member of the UN Security Council and the EU 3+3 on the Iran issue, sharing that distinction only with France.
Yet Israel-Britain relations have not been at their warmest for the last year or two. For all Brown's repetitions of how he learned to love Zionism at his preacher-father's knee, bilateral links are not as close as under Tony Blair. Partly to blame for this were last year's Gaza incursion and the Goldstone report, which the UK declined to oppose in the United Nations; the requirement to label settlement-produced goods as such in the UK; and, of course, the attempted arrests of senior Israeli figures on war crimes charges.
As murky as this whole spy story has been, one thing is clear: The passports scandal has finished off any amendment to the law on universal jurisdiction, which is what allowed arrest warrants to be issued in the UK for alleged war crimes committed elsewhere. Theoretically, the necessary change in the law has the support of a majority in the House of Commons, including the shadow cabinet and most Labor MPs. But Brown is not going to risk a rebellion so close to the polls after such a public scandal.
"Israel has put the death of one Hamas guy over its relations with the UK," complained one pro-Israel lobbyist. "Why should the government stick its neck out for Israel when it's just done this?"
Even Israel's staunchest allies in Parliament are livid. "If it was Israel, it was outrageous," fumed MP Mike Gapes, a long-time member of Labor Friends of Israel and, perhaps more significantly, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. The illicit use of foreign passports, he said, "is one of the most appalling things another government can do. Our citizens around the world face the risk of being associated with an organization of criminal activity and murder."
For certain parts of the British establishment, open ties with Israel have always been awkward. One senior intelligence adviser tells of how he could not meet his Israeli counterparts at his office as it was frowned upon by his superiors, and was thus expected to receive intelligence from the Israelis in the backrooms of pubs and restaurants.
For now, Israeli diplomats in London can afford to be sanguine. But while the secret ties will remain strong, they will remain just that - secret, even shameful.
Israelis tire of being compared with apartheid South Africa, but they should remember that Britain once had clandestine intelligence-sharing links with Pretoria as well. That didn't make South African leaders welcome in London, even without the threat of arrest hanging over them. Jerusalem should be wary of becoming another dirty secret.

<title>Segregation of Jews and Arabs in 2010 Israel is almost absolute</title>
<date>Fri Oct 29 02:43:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Under the guise of the deceptively mundane name "Amendment to the Cooperative Associations Bill," the Knesset's Constitution, Law and Justice Committee this week finalized a bill intended to bypass previous rulings of the High Court of Justice. If indeed this legislation is approved by the Knesset plenum, it will not be possible to describe it as anything other than an apartheid law.
Ten years ago, the High Court of Justice ordered the town of Katzir to accept the family of Adel and Iman Kaadan, Arab citizens of Israel, as members of the community. Seven years later, the court issued a similar ruling against the Galilee village of Rakefet, which, like Katzir, is Jewish. Now, however, the legislature has come up with a proper "Zionist" response to the justices: If it becomes law, the amendment will give acceptance committees of communal villages the authority to limit residence in their towns exclusively to Jews.
Using polished and sanitized language, the bill would allow such committees in small rural suburbs to reject applications from families that "are incompatible with the social-cultural fabric of the community, and where there are grounds to assume that they will disrupt this fabric."
In other words, if admissions committees were previously forced to exercise some degree of creativity if they wanted to hide their national-ethnic grounds for rejecting Arabs, now, as Rabbi Akiva said, "All is foreseen, and freedom of choice is granted" (Pirkei Avot 3 ). Arabs? Not here. Sorry, the law is with us on this.
Those who feign innocence, including some from the center of our political map, will say, "The bill is not intended to keep out Arabs. What's wrong with supporting the right of communities to protect their unique way of life?"
Indeed, what is wrong with that? There's no argument that the vegetarians of Moshav Amirim, in the Galilee, have a right to defend themselves against an invasion of carnivores, just as the practitioners of transcendental meditation at Hararit, in the Misgav region, need to be able to meditate without interruption, but those communities are genuinely unique in character. This is not the case for the dozens of yeshuvim kehilati'im (literally, "community settlements" ) all over Israel, whose principal cultural feature is the fact that their residents are Jewish and Zionist - hardly a population under imminent threat, whose unique way of life needs protection.
Several months ago, we were given a glimpse of just how quickly the new law will be implemented, when several such villages, anticipating the Knesset's action, hurriedly established bylaws that effectively barred Arabs. In the communities of Yuvalim and Manof, in the Misgav area, applicants are now required to declare their allegiance to the Zionist vision, while in Mitzpe Aviv, a bit to the south, applicants must declare their identification with the values of Zionism and the definition of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.
It's not as if Arab families are standing in line to move to these gated communities, which were established mainly in the 1970s and '80s by Zionist organizations like the Jewish Agency and the Jewish National Fund for the purpose of "Judaizing" areas like the Negev and the Galilee. No one ever expected these towns to provide the answer to the horrendous housing shortage faced by Israel's Arab population. For them, not a single new town has been established since 1948, with the exception of a few impoverished Bedouin settlements in the Negev. Nor has the central government seen fit to assist or give approval to the existing Arab municipalities in the drawing up of master plans that would allow them to implement a program of growth and development to meet the needs of a growing population or mitigate their poor quality of life.
And this is without even mentioning cities like Upper Nazareth, Safed or Carmiel, where a variety of statements have been made - sometimes by the most senior municipal officials themselves - that are designed to push Arabs out or prevent their integration into these cities.
Segregation of Jews and Arabs in Israel of 2010 is almost absolute. For those of us who live here, it is something we take for granted. But visitors from abroad cannot believe their eyes: segregated education, segregated businesses, separate entertainment venues, different languages, separate political parties ... and of course, segregated housing. In many senses, this is the way members of both groups want things to be, but such separation only contributes to the growing mutual alienation of Jews and Arabs.
Several courageous attempts - particularly in mixed cities and regions - have been made to change the situation, bridge the rifts and promote integration. These range from efforts to develop mixed educational frameworks, to joint economic ventures and other interventions intended to foster good neighborly relations based on equal opportunity. Until now, these attempts addressed a situation of de facto segregation. From today, however, segregation will be de jure, to the shame of Israel.

<title>Settlers, tell us, what do you think will happen?</title>
<date>Sun Jan 03 01:10:18 IST 2010</date>
<content>
What constitutes the life of a settler? A house on the cheap; a standard of living above the national average; a job usually subsidized by the government; a fierce religious, nationalist, uncompromising conviction on the justness of his cause; a supportive, heavy-handed social environment; a highway system; transportation arrangements; socially enriching activities; and, at times, a life that comes with the risk of danger.  
The settler goes to and from his home without seeing anything. He does not see his neighbors, he does not see the danger he exposes his children to, he does not see the moral baggage he carries on his back. He does not want to see all this, and an entire system surrounds him that makes life easy for him despite his blindness.  
Some of the highways on which he drives are cleansed of Palestinians; he has never visited the neighboring villages, not one of whose names he would know were it not for traffic signs pointing in their direction. His teachers, functionaries and rabbis sketch out the scenery that is his world, leaving him no shred of doubt: the Arabs are terrorists, all of them are suspicious packages, and the Jews are allowed to do as they wish, for they are the lords of the land, and there is no other but they.  
He is convinced that he is a member of a special people, a light unto the nations, and that he, the settler, is the torch bearer at the vanguard. They preach to him on how his life is much more "principled" than that of other Israelis, those who have the misfortune of living in the sovereign State of Israel. There, they are Hellenizing, draft-dodging traitors and hedonists. And what of the settler? Well, he's a good Jew, the best there is, the last of the Zionists. Isn't that good enough? For he is also a victim, the only victim of terrorism, the victim of all Israeli society, constantly persecuted and deprived.  
It's hard to contend with such a well-oiled propaganda machine. Nothing can overcome it, not even cold, hard facts. Neither does the fact that the settler's residing in the territories violates international law, that most of the land on which his home sits was usurped from his neighbors by fraud or violence, that no country in the world recognizes his presence in the occupied territories. He will always explain how he was "sent" there by the government, even if he knew that moving into his new home sometimes was the result of deceit or invasion.  
The specter of being evicted from his home is what let him buy it cheaply in the first place, like all stolen property. Thus he should have known that his home is liable to be temporary, yet he sees his eviction as an "expulsion," "deprivation" and "an infringement of civil rights." The fat budgets devoted to him and the unfathomable political clout will certainly relieve him of his constant sense of injustice, as will the fact that no other Israeli minority group has extorted the majority and sown fear and terror for so many years. The settler is in his own domain: I am a superior individual and have been sent as an emissary to fulfill a commandment.  
Whether motivated by ideology or real estate, he is convinced that he will remain there forever. Now we must ask him in what direction (which is also our direction) is he headed? After years of hearing them say no - no to evacuation, no to a construction freeze, no to the High Court of Justice, no to international law, no to negotiations, no to America, no to the world - they must finally be made to answer the simple, cutting question: To what do you say yes? They will remain in the territories forever, there will be no negotiations, and of course there will be no peace, no to two states and no to civil rights for the Palestinians. Fine. Then what will there be, for heaven's sake?  
Go ask them. Try to get their opinion on how things will look here in another decade or two. For how many more years can 3.5 million people live without any civil rights? For how many more years will the world continue to turn a blind eye and remain silent? What will become of a state that is dependent on others like no other country? And what will happen when the Palestinians become the majority? The settlers will be evasive in their response. Make them give one.  
Let's ask and then try to understand. We will continue to indulge your religious whims and territorial lust, but give us an answer on where you think all this will lead. Will Jewish immigrants relocate to the territories by the millions? And if not? Will the Arabs continue to compromise, beg and submit? And if they don't? Will the Palestinians live forever under apartheid conditions? And if they don't? Will the world keep quiet and will America continue to act like Israel's patron state? And if not?  
Perhaps God will help. But what if he doesn't?

<title>Sharon's real legacy - keeping the Arabs out of sight</title>
<date>Wed Jan 13 02:31:15 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Let's assume the optimistic forecast by special U.S. envoy George Mitchell comes true and in two years the establishment of an independent Palestine is declared at a ceremony. The event will be broadcast on prime time, but most Israelis will opt to view "Big Brother 6," "Survivor 7" or whatever the next television hit is. Viewers will behave this way not because they oppose a Palestinian state but because they are indifferent. Palestine-shmalestine simply does not interest them.  
Most Israelis today are cut off from the conflict with the Palestinians and do not interact with them. From their point of view, the Palestinians are blurry figures during TV newscasts: Mahmoud Abbas and Ismail Haniyeh speak, women covered from head to toe mourn in a tent, men run with a stretcher after an ambulance, men concealing their faces fire Qassam rockets. Israelis have no interest in knowing anything further. Nablus and Ramallah are about 40 minutes by car from Tel Aviv, but in the eyes of Tel Avivians they are on a different planet. New York, London and Thailand are much closer.  
The settlers beyond the separation fence are the only Israelis who see Palestinians, mostly through car windows on the roads they share. The settlers, like the Palestinians, are disconnected from the residents of the Tel Aviv region, Haifa or Be'er Sheva, who hardly ever cross the fence. They have no business in Elon Moreh, Yitzhar or Psagot. The big settlements like Ma'aleh Adumim and Ariel can be reached almost without having to see Palestinians.  
The policy of isolation is the real legacy of Ariel Sharon, who built the fence in the West Bank, left the Gaza Strip and pushed the Palestinians out of the Israeli labor force. Sharon did not believe in peace and was not interested in links with the "Arabs." All he wanted was to protect the Jews from attacks by their "bloodthirsty" neighbors. Keeping them out of sight lets Israelis live as if there were no conflict, with only settlers on the periphery and soldiers on the firing line. 
The "demographic problem" also is not frightening when it is locked up behind walls and fences.  
In the past Israel's economy relied on Palestinian workers, but only older Israelis remember them at restaurants, construction sites and gas stations. Here and there one can still find friendships; waiters at Restaurant 206 in Kiryat Shaul sometimes gather their tips for a Palestinian friend who once waited tables and is now besieged in the Gaza Strip. Stories like this are almost part of folklore. The Israeli economy is geared toward Wall Street, not Shuhada Street. The stock market is hardly affected by routine security issues, and real estate prices are flying high as if this were Hong Kong, not a country under threat on a constant war alert.  
The Israel Defense Forces, who sent generations of Israelis to the territories, has minimized the exposure of its soldiers to the Palestinians. Fewer and fewer people do reserve duty, and even fewer in the West Bank. The regular army has minimized the activities of its units in the territories and transferred much of the policing duties in the West Bank to the Kfir Brigade. Air force crews, who carry the burden of the fighting in the Gaza Strip, see the Palestinians as silent spots on their screens fed from drone footage.  
Entertainment intensifies the gap in the way Israelis have come to regard their country, and the way it is seen in the world. The local media describes Israel as a Western high-tech superpower, an annex of Manhattan and Hollywood. The foreign media covers the conflict: terrorist attacks and assassinations, settlements and peace talks. When the Israelis who have never visited a settlement see themselves on CNN they are offended: We are not like that. This is anti-Semitic propaganda.  
Foreigners visiting Israel are amazed to discover the degree to which reality here is disconnected from what they heard at home. They expect a violent apartheid state, and are surprised that the toilets and buses are not separate for Jews and Arabs. They imagine a conservative, buttoned-up society and are shocked by Tel Aviv's nightlife. They walk in the street and realize that in London or Paris they see a lot more Arabs than in most Israeli cities.  
Because of the entertainment and indifference, the government doesn't face public pressure to pull out of the territories and establish a Palestinian state, and the opposition to the American peace initiative is being led by the extremists on the right. Most Israelis simply don't care; they gave up on the territories a long time ago. If Mitchell succeeds in his mission, they will hear about it and change the channel.

<title>Sometimes a frog is just a frog</title>
<date>Wed Jun 16 06:11:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Israel is finding it more difficult than ever to explain the righteousness of its actions to the world. No matter how hard it tries, the world refuses to believe our reasons for keeping Gaza under a blockade for so long. We explain that the Gazans are not suffering from a humanitarian crisis, and that if they are, it is their own doing. But those goyim, feeble-minded as they are, refuse to believe us. We prepare ‏(particularly for our guests from across the sea‏) full companies of soldiers dressed in white, reflecting our desire for peace and our inherent hospitality in the very color of their uniforms. Yet they, through a complete lack of understanding of our noble goals, find reason for condemnation even in that.
And it is not only with regard to Gaza and the flotilla: The folly of Israel-haters extends into every corner. We explain, simply and clearly, that most of the land in the West Bank is inhabited by our settlers, that they are the pillar of fire advancing before the camp, that the lands were not taken from their owners but are “state lands” − that is, areas that were ours from the beginning, promised to Abraham by God Himself. And if they were not ours from the beginning and were not promised to us by the Almighty, they were purchased from their owners with full payment, with deeds and receipts.
But the goyim, they of little faith, persist in believing what they wish.We pave roads for the benefit of those who enjoy a higher standard of living under our rule, but they, blockheads that they are, refuse to understand why we must then make those roads unavailable for their use. We build separation fences along the safest, shortest routes available, and they, idolaters that they are, become locked in an idée fixe about segregation and apartheid, as if those terms had ever cropped up in our darkest dreams.
They are not even intelligent enough to understand our most private, intimate lives. Out of a love of cleanliness and order, we separate our white, kosher girls from our less kosher Mizrahi cousins. For generations we have maintained racial purity in matters of marriage, protecting ourselves from every evil, and they, small thinkers, swallow all this chatter fed to them by those who are not even circumcised, while expecting us to hurt the feelings of Israel’s keepers of the faith.
We have always known how to look in the mirror with directness and courage. We must therefore admit that we sometimes appear − to a superficial, naive glance − a bit less attractive than we would like, certainly than we are entitled to look. Still, we wisely explain, with reference to the Brothers Grimm story, that something that looks, on first, distorted glance, like a frog, is to the penetrating eyes of the enchanted princess a prince. But they, with their bottomless hatred of our nation, reinterpret the story to mean that frogs live in this swamp who have never seen a royal palace, but were born in the swamp and will remain there forever.

<title>South Africa is already here </title>
<date>Sun Oct 31 01:29:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
How could the Israeli public allow a few dozen racists go down into the lion's den of Umm al-Fahm on their own? Do Michael Ben-Ari, Baruch Marzel and Itamar Ben Gvir represent only themselves or just the fringes of the extreme right? After all, thousands of Israeli citizens agreed when they heard the thugs' explanations of the reasons for their march.
Hundreds of thousands in Israel are pleased with the Citizenship Law, glad that the bill will, when it passes - and it will pass - allow discrimination against Arabs who will want to buy a home in a Jewish community, and the majority of the public considers MK Hanin Zuabi a traitor.
Where were all these people while the fascists marched through Umm al-Fahm? Suddenly they are not comfortable being seen with those who reflect precisely the zeitgeist?
Participating in this march should have been Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, MKs Anastassia Michaeli and David Rotem, the settler leadership, the followers of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the heads and residents of Jewish communities in the Galilee, as well as the owners of homes in Tel Aviv and Ra'anana who refuse to rent apartments to Arabs. This march should have carried the banner "[National] Pride Parade." Alas, only 1,300 participants showed up, along with the police force that protected them.
But they are certainly not alone. They simply do not need yet another demonstration. Israel's apartheid movement is coming out of the woodwork and is taking on a formal, legal shape. It is moving from voluntary apartheid, which hides its ugliness through justifications of "cultural differences" and "historic neglect" which only requires a little funding and a couple of more sewage pipes to make everything right - to a purposeful, open, obligatory apartheid, which no longer requires any justification.
In South Africa of the 1950s, the whites were afraid even of the white immigrants, lest they bring with them liberal ideas that would affect the local volk.
But mostly they feared the blacks. In a short period of time the insular white community adopted a series of laws that were meant to preserve their purity. In 1949, the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act was passed; in 1950 and 1957 the Immorality Act and amendment made interracial sexual relations a criminal offense carrying a seven year prison sentence. In 1950, in the Population Registration Act, each citizen was categorized racially. In 1953 the Bantu Education Act was passed which established that the blacks will receive a different and lesser education than the whites, and in 1950 the Group Areas Act was passed which determined "group regions," establishing where each racial group could live and which led to the expulsion of 3.5 million blacks from their homes.
This listing is presented here as a service to the racists in the Knesset, in case they did not know what kind of legislation to propose in order to complete their plan. This is also a public service for those who did not participate in the Umm al-Fahm march, so that they will know what they should require of their representatives.
With considerable delay, the South African Group Areas Act is now being copied into Israel's book of laws. An individual can no longer purchase land, build a home or even rent an apartment in small communities in which the absorption committee opposes their presence. According to Adalah - the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, the law will "protect" 68.3 percent of all communities in Israel from being "stained."
The remainder of communities, and especially the large cities, will have to continue, for the mean time, to make do with voluntary apartheid. But the days will also come, as they did in South Africa, when an appropriate solution was found for its cities. It will be possible, for example, to grant homeowners committees the authority to determine who can buy or rent an apartment in a building. After all, what is good about a small community should also be good in an even smaller building. And of course a law which encourages snitching will also be passed.
So, while the government of Israel is trying to gain Palestinian recognition for its Jewish identity, it is building within it the double identity of the state. A protected autonomy for the Jewish majority and a stunted autonomy for the Arab minority.
Israel is quickly defining the borders of the Arab autonomy and through apartheid legislation it is granting the Arab minority a legal standing of enclaves with lesser rights; of a cultural-ethnic region which, because it is being expelled from the broader who, can also demand international recognition for its unique standing.

<title>Take the masks off </title>
<date>Fri Aug 06 00:54:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
It's hard to know whether in our relations with the Palestinians we have reached a turning point of the kind that is termed "historic," but it's clear we're at a point where the sides have to take off their masks. A peace agreement is apparently closer than ever right now. The Arab states that are united in an anti-Iranian coalition want an agreement, as does Syria, which thirsts for the Golan Heights. The Palestinian leadership in the West Bank also wants an agreement; the secular Palestinian elite has apparently decided that an imperfect state right now is preferable to clinging to the dream of drowning the Jews in a flood of returning refugees in the future.
Thus the largest question mark hovers over the goals that the Israeli government and Israeli society have set for themselves. The number of answers to the question "what is Benjamin Netanyahu shooting for?" is equal to the number of people who speak with the prime minister. This fact suggests that the solution to the riddle will never be found behind closed doors; instead, it will arise in the noisy public square, where Netanyahu will have his back to the wall.
In the meantime, all the sane elements in Israeli politics must focus on taking down the obstacle that is so highly cherished by all the knights of the occupation: the claim that the dispute cannot be solved because the Palestinians seek to restore the situation in the country before 1948.
It is imperative that the Palestinian leadership and Israel's government begin direct negotiations immediately, accompanied by American and European pressure to ensure that the sides' national agendas are presented in public. The major issues are familiar: borders, Jerusalem and refugees. In the missile era, when the whole country is within range of the enemy's arms on all sides, local security arrangements of the sort Netanyahu loves such as holding on to the Jordan Valley are largely a pretext for killing time.
Beyond this, Israel's public must ask itself if it's legitimate to demand that the Palestinians engage in peace negotiations when next month the routine of land grabbing and settlement sprawl is destined to regain momentum. The worst mistake by Ehud Barak and his government 11 years ago was to proceed with negotiations when settlements were expanding and building was accelerated within them. That lesson must not be forgotten.
More than ever, a freeze on construction in the territories is a crucial prerequisite for progress in negotiations. With a chance to end a century of warfare staring him in the face, Netanyahu is worried about keeping his coalition together. This argument about coalition stability is so pathetic it says something about the lack of a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
If it turns out the government cannot hold together if it renews the settlement freeze, if it finally becomes clear that the settlers and the rest of the fanatics in the cabinet and Knesset are dictating the agenda, it will be best to put this government to rest. A prime minister can be replaced, if not in this Knesset, then in the next one. At any event, it's hard to imagine a government worse than the current one; it's a government whose legacy will include the selection of children of foreign workers for expulsion.
It could turn out that the next elections will usher in a yet more ultra-nationalist, clerical, fanatic and anti-democratic Knesset and government, but that result would have one advantage: It would make clear to everyone where we stand. Today more than ever the choice is clear. On the one hand, we can have a future of an apartheid-like state that is armed, "according to foreign sources," with Armageddon weaponry, while continuing on the path of a binational state steeped constantly in blood. Or we can have two states configured along the 1967 borders, with equitable land swaps. No other solution is viable.

<title>Teacher of a lifetime</title>
<date>Thu Jan 07 06:29:13 IST 2010</date>

There is a pedagogic poem in Tel Aviv; through the curtain of indifference and darkness, a ray of light. In an educational system that provides only grades and sterile surroundings, the encouragement of thinking is prohibited. It's a place where teachers are mute and educators blind in the stupefying brainwash of propaganda, evasion and ignorance in the curricula. But a courageous voice has been heard: The principal of Aleph High School of the Arts, Ram Cohen, called his 11th-graders to a meeting last week and gave them a real civics lesson, a real education in values. Instead of the usual blah-blah, cheap Zionism and cheaper democracy, cliches within hollow and specious cliches, Cohen spoke the truth to his students. 
Cohen told his students about the occupation. He told them that you can't brutally crush values the way Israel has been doing for 42 years and say we are educating for democracy. He asked them whether they would be willing to live under an occupation. He told them he does not justify terror but understands what leads to attacks. He called on educators to tell students that the occupation is cursed and called on students to serve in an army that protects security, not an army busy with the occupation. 
"Talk to each other, talk to your parents, go out and demonstrate," he told them, doing what any educator should do. But in the Israel of 2010, nationalist and militarist, Cohen's remarks raised a storm. MKs called for his dismissal, he was summoned for "clarifications" in the Education Ministry and the Tel Aviv municipality. He was not allowed to give interviews, which is outrageous in and of itself. 
Education Ministry Director General Shimshon Shoshani was also shocked. "A principal who thinks he can preach has no place in the education system," said our "educator" No. 1, comparing Cohen's civics lesson to the incitement preceding the death of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. "I'm not opposed to lessons with the homeroom teacher discussing the occupation as a concept," the director general squirmed. "Let people speak out for and against. Are we looking at what is happening in the West Bank as occupation?" 
The true face of the education system as collaborating with the occupation was suddenly revealed. The director general compares murderous incitement to remarks about human values; he still dares question whether the West Bank is under occupation. He still thinks there can be a "for" and "against" to the occupation. An education system that reconciles itself to yeshiva heads who preach nationalism and racism, rabbis who sanctify every stone in a land not ours, teachers who advocate the continuation of settlements that have been invalidated by international law - these are all proper and not considered "political." 
Teacher-propagandists who do not tell their students the whole truth about our history, who think democracy means voting on election day, civics means demonstrating for the release of kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit, Zionism means traveling to Auschwitz and values means taking part in a telethon for the Israel Defense Forces' welfare fund are accepted by the heavy-handed system. An educator who tries to infuse real content into his job is called in for clarifications. 
Principal Cohen once talked about how he came to change his positions: From his home in Modi'in, every day he saw a long line of Palestinian laborers heading home on foot after a hard day's work because they are not allowed on the apartheid road. Should he not tell this to his students? Is it not only his right, but also his obligation to do so? Is it not essential for his students to see what is going on around them, not only to go on the March of the Living wrapped in the national flag, but to see the march of our neighbors' lives? 
Cohen's high school has changed since the bygone days when I was a student there. Under his leadership it has become a school of thinking children. As opposed to his obeisant colleagues, Cohen has also come out against the militarization of the schools and their classification by the number of combat soldiers they produce for the IDF. In so doing, he has also done his job. 
Cohen is a real teacher of a lifetime, "the country's best teacher" as the cheap contest underway now is called, in which his name will certainly not be mentioned. Instead of sending him a letter of appreciation he is excoriated; instead of calling on all educators to follow his path, he is summoned to give explanations. If we had had a few dozen more educators like Cohen in our day, maybe we would not have had a Goldstone report.

<title>Thank you for bringing us together </title>
<date>Fri Oct 22 02:41:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In his October 13 opinion piece  ("The man behind Avigdor Lieberman" ), Aluf Benn proposed focusing on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in order to understand the proliferation of measures aimed at repressing the ambitions and aspirations of the Arab public in Israel. To my mind, this is a correct approach, but not sufficient. I also propose viewing the measures being taken by the current government as clear manifestations of the rise of a new right in Israel. This must be understood as a historical development that is beginning to change the face of the state and its attitude toward the Palestinians in general and the country's Arab citizens in particular, a development that will lead to a profound change among the Arabs themselves.
Israel's new right is fundamentally different from the classical revisionist right, which has almost disappeared from the country's political map. Taking its place is a right that closely resembles the European model represented by Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Pen or Austria's late Joerg Haider. It's a right that believes it is possible to subdue the minority only by force, and that emphasizes the racial superiority of the dominant ethnic group.
In its political propaganda, the new Israeli right relies on instilling among the majority fear of those perceived as alien. To the distress of those who hold democracy dear, among both the Jewish majority and the country's Arab citizens, this is not just a marginal rightist phenomenon, but rather a significant political force that supports the steps the government is taking.
The official policy coalescing here is aimed at hobbling the Arabs and bringing about a new violent confrontation with the Palestinians; those behind it are prepared to pay the price of conflict with the Arab world and the West in order to maintain their ideology of Jewish supremacy.
But not everything being done by the new right is negative. Here are two ideas that could earn Netanyahu a nod of gratitude from the Palestinians.
First of all, the demands and policies of the extreme right, as part of the government, will quickly lead to the exposure of the true face of official Israel - as an occupying state, one that tramples human and civil rights, abuses a part of its citizenry and is based on a belief in ethnic superiority that manifests itself in ways even more complex and effective than those employed in South Africa during the apartheid era.
Secondly, the right in power today is well on its way to negating Israel's earlier achievements in crushing the Palestinian people, and it will bring about their reunification. The Israeli left and center did quite a lot to split the Palestinian people and to transform them into distinct groups: Palestinians in Israel, Palestinians in the West Bank, Palestinians in Jerusalem, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Palestinians in the diaspora. Each of these groups became  focused on achieving distinct goals for itself, and in this way the Palestinian people have been prevented from creating a united front and working toward common goals.
Regrettably, a large part of the fragmented Palestinian elite bought into the Israeli policy and its members have each made the struggle of their respective group the main purpose for which they strive. Take, for example, the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, which today is the main demand of most of the Palestinians. This is a demand that accepts the principle of the splitting of the Palestinian people and is ready to accept that split as a permanent situation.
The Netanyahu government and the extreme right that has taken control of Israel's agenda are striving for two goals that in the end will constitute the main catalyst for the reunification of the Palestinian people, initially in terms of its political consciousness and later in its political agenda as well.
First, the aim of achieving a partial agreement with the Palestinian Authority - based on geographical separation and on the establishment of a "crippled state" - will not be acceptable to the Palestinians. Sooner or later, thanks to the policies of the current government, most will realize that the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel is past its time and no longer feasible, and that there is no alternative to going back to the idea of a single, binational, egalitarian state for Palestinians and Jews in historical Palestine.
Second, the demand to recognize Israel as a Jewish state will ultimately make Palestinians realize that the main problem lies not in Ramallah, but rather in Tel Aviv. Not in the occupation of one territory or another, but rather in the insistence upon extorting an acceptance of Jewish ethnic superiority, even from those who are not candidates for citizenship in Israel. The Palestinians will be obliged to merge their political platforms and pose a counterdemand.
The Palestinians' counter-proposal must be based on a demand for democracy as a humane solution for everyone. They must not content themselves with a territorial enclave between Nablus and Ramallah that will be called the "State of Palestine."
For all this and more, the Palestinians will yet say: "Thank you, Mr. Netanyahu."

<title>The center cannot hold</title>
<date>Fri Dec 03 10:29:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
LONDON − Another week, another broiges. Welcome to the wonderful world of the Anglo-Jewish community, where the latest rumpus is a rather manufactured debate around comments made by one Mick Davis, chairman of the United Joint Israel Appeal.
Speaking at a communal event in late November, Davis’ point was that he and others in Diaspora leadership were troubled, when it came to Israel, by such issues as settlement building, the proposed loyalty oath and the inequality suffered by the country’s Arab citizens. Prime Minister Netanyahu, in Davis’ opinion, lacks the courage to move forward toward peace, and he expressed concern that if a two-state solution was not enacted, Israel would run the risk of becoming an apartheid state, with the minority ruling over a majority.
So far, all pretty familiar sentiments. Israeli leaders from Ehud Olmert to Ehud Barak have gone further, and even among the notables of the Jewish Leadership Council − whose executive committee is chaired by Davis − there was a consensus that what Davis said wasn’t different from anything that anyone says behind closed doors. For all the squeamishness about that big Jewish no-no of airing your dirty shmattes in public and thus, as the cliche goes, giving succor to our enemies, Davis’ comments were made in a Jewish context, to a Jewish audience and on a panel with several other Jews ‏(including Peter Beinart, the author of a landmark polemic earlier this year on U.S. Jewish leadership‏).
Jerusalem remained sanguine in the face of this apparently novel liberalism with a number of Israeli officials rather pointedly swearing that they had never heard of this Mick Davis ‏(apparently multi-millionaire Jewish philanthropists are of no great interest in Israel these days‏).
The only real criticism heard here − loud as it was − came from what even establishment insiders variously describe as “the hard right,” the “lunatic fringe” and “mad mental right-wingers.”
But Davis’ comments are nonetheless of interest, reflecting as they do the fact that the Jewish community leadership in Britain finds itself in a bit of a pickle. A few years ago, during the intifada, when Israel seemed under constant attack, they could rouse enough enthusiasm among the troops to defend the Jewish state. Now, there’s a growing concern that younger members of the community, who would have once segued seamlessly into becoming the next generation of leaders, are drifting out of the mainstream-affiliated groups. People aren’t that fired up about Israel’s anticipated next battle with the amorphous demon of delegitimization.
That’s not to say that Anglo-Jewry is experiencing an outbreak of galloping anti-Zionism among its younger ranks, or that the community is set to devote itself to pursuing a binational secular state. U.K. Jews will still jump up and down as needed over issues such as academic boycotts and the need to deal with Iran. But all the comfort of feeling a wider connection with the Jewish state, of fond memories from teenage Israel trips and annual visits to Herzliya − and even the pleasurable sense of outrage elicited by comfort-zone grumbles about British media bias − none of this makes up for getting slapped down if you dare to criticize Israel’s policies or find yourself dumbfounded in the face of Deputy Prime Minister Avigdor Lieberman or his proposed loyalty oath.
People here are exhausted by self-censorship and a relentlessly monolithic obsession with anti-Zionism. The best proof of this was the July 2010 survey on Anglo-Jewish attitudes toward Israel by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research, the most definite study of its kind to date. It reflected a community with a strong attachment to Israel − 95 percent had visited the country − but one very far from the frothing ultra-Zionism evinced by some of our columnists.
While 77 percent felt that Jews have a special responsibility to support Israel, nearly the same number thought they also have the right to criticize Israel, even in the general media. Nearly three-quarters oppose settlement expansion, and more than half favor peace talks with Hamas. Previous “niche” interests, such as activism to support Israel’s minorities, are gaining ground, even among the communal establishment, and some canny Anglo-Jewish leaders well understand the danger posed by not shifting with the tide.
If they leave others to take over the center ground, then they will make themselves increasingly irrelevant − and not only to their own community. The Jewish leadership also knows that if they want the British government to take them seriously, they have to reflect a more nuanced view. A particular worry is the emergence of bodies such as the U.K. version of J Street, which is currently being organized. Like the American original, this political group aims to more accurately reflect what it says are the more liberal political views of the majority of the Jewish community in the U.K.
“The idea of J Street is not healthy for us in the establishment” says one Jewish leader, warning that the emergence of an alternative Israel advocacy group will have an erosive impact on the power and influence still held by mainstream communal groups.
Perhaps what Mick Davis has reflected is a growing awareness that the center ground has shifted in the U.K. Even within our own provincial little bubble of broiges, Jewish leaders need to move with it to maintain their legitimacy.

<title>The changing face of racism</title>
<date>Thu Mar 18 04:56:10 IST 2010</date>
<content>
 The most prominent example of a country that refused to allow Jews to marry non-Jews was Germany, when it enacted the Nuremberg Laws. While Israel makes sure it doesn't disengage entirely from the rest of the world by recognizing marriages outside its borders, marriages between Jews and non-Jews here are forbidden. Now, in an effort to address the "problem" of those who immigrated to Israel under the Law of Return but are refused status as Jews by the state, these people will have the option of entering a state-sanctioned covenant with their spouse, but only if the spouse is also classified as a non-Jew. 
It's as if there were never a guarantee in the Declaration of Independence that assured Israelis "complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex."  
The most outspoken opponent of Israel's becoming both a Jewish and democratic state was Rabbi Meir Kahane. The effort "to solve his problem" only pushed the country further into the abyss. To prevent his re-election to the Knesset, lawmakers launched an initiative to disqualify party lists that opposed democracy in Israel. This is a reasonable idea for a democracy that does not yield to those who seek to destroy it from within.  
Yet as a compromise between Labor, Likud and the religious parties, an addendum to the law banned any party that opposed Israel's standing as a Jewish state. Thus a new standard was reached via the tortuous, Israeli route. In principle, no party can run for the Knesset because it's clear that if most citizens want a state that is not tethered to Judaism, that's their basic right.  
Since then, the combination of "Jewish and democratic" has taken root in Israel and its laws. The phrase "Jewish" does not refer to the Jewish people in the same vein as it was applied in the Declaration of Independence and the UN Partition Plan calling for a Jewish state and an Arab state.  
Rather, it refers specifically to the Jewish religion, an entirely different matter than what the Zionist revolution had in mind. As such, Israel is disconnecting itself from the modern world by virtue of the 42-year-old reality of racist apartheid in the territories of Judea, Samaria and East Jerusalem - areas in which Jews are citizens and their non-Jewish neighbors are not. Denial of citizenship to non-Jews also contravenes the halakhic principle of ger toshav, which afforded special status to gentiles in the Kingdom of Israel.  
The dilemma of a state that is bound by ancient ties to a certain nation while promising "full equality of rights" for all its citizens is not unique to Israel. Many other nation-states such as France have experienced similar conundrums. The concept of the dominance of one religion within a single national entity was also not an Israeli invention. Catholicism traditionally played a much larger role in the identities of people living in Italy, Spain, France and Ireland. Having been drawn into the religious-racial-nationalist black hole, Israel now joins the Iranian-Afghan galaxy.  
From Sheikh Jarrah to the bones discovered during the expansion of Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon, from the so-called Nakba Law to the war on evolution being waged by the Education Ministry's chief scientist, from the foreign minister to the interior minister - Israeli democracy is losing its status as "a present absentee." The state still has a hand mirror that reveals the face of a young Dorian Gray. Yet in reality its racist defilement is changing its look.  
"The problem of timing" does not belong to the Jerusalem District Planning and Building Committee. In the run-up to the clash on the Iranian front, when the state will need all the domestic and foreign support it can muster, Israel is turning itself into an entity whose democratic right to exist is self-destructing.

<title>The illusion of 'Syria first' </title>
<date>Mon Feb 08 02:20:09 IST 2010</date>
<content>
What do these nagging Palestinians want from us? They should be thankful that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he supports two states for two peoples. So what if he also swore that Jerusalem will remain unified forever under Israeli sovereignty, vowed that Ariel is an inalienable part of the state and promised that the Israel Defense Forces will retain control of the Jordan River?  
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was not born yesterday; he understands that the prime minister does not really plan to continue the annexation of the Muslim Quarter in Jerusalem's Old City. It's clear that Netanyahu knows that it is unacceptable to thrust a long finger like Ariel into the heart of a Palestinian state. Surely he does not think that on the way home from Jordan a citizen of a sovereign Palestine would have to tell an Israeli security guard who packed his suitcase.  
Why do we believe Netanyahu when he makes peace noises and convince ourselves that he is only pretending when he hugs settlers? If the prime minister has no problem making baseless declarations for a domestic audience, why should he have a problem making empty statements for external consumption? If the prime minister is willing to take Jerusalem's name in vain to appease cabinet members Moshe Ya'alon or Avigdor Lieberman, who can promise to Abbas that the Bar-Ilan speech, which was only meant to shake off Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, is not just a ruse?  
These questions are for the U.S. administration to answer. It will not do what it must until it squeezes out of Netanyahu a clear stance on how he sees the basics of a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. Special envoy George Mitchell wasted too much time on the construction plans in the Old City's holy basin, in Ariel, and in the Jordan Valley. The time has come for him to ask to see the evacuation plans for the Jewish settlements and neighborhoods east of the Green Line. If it turns out that the Palestinian part of Netanyahu's two-state solution resembles the Bantustans from the dark days of apartheid in South Africa, Mitchell will be free to get on with mediating other conflicts. We will know that the games of the "peace process" are over and we will prepare for life under an apartheid regime.  
When Mitchell returns the mandate President Obama gave him to resume negotiations with the Palestinians, he would do well to also give back the mandate for reopening the Syrian track. Three prime ministers - Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Ehud Barak - encouraged Bill Clinton to bypass Yasser Arafat and try his luck with Hafez Assad. Netanyahu, too, tried his luck. What have we had since? Another intifada in the West Bank, another war in Lebanon, and another war in the Gaza Strip. How many days will Arafat's successors stay in power if Obama betrays them with Hafez Assad's successor? How long will it take for Hamas to take over the Dayton force after it becomes clear that the occupation has no expiration date?  
It's hard to believe that the Syrians are willing to cooperate via yet another round of negotiations at the expense of the Palestinians. Just a week ago, Syrian Minister Bouthaina Shaaban criticized Arab countries for ignoring the suffering of the residents of the Gaza Strip. In an article in the daily Al-Sharq al-Awsat, the spokeswoman for President Bashar Assad wrote that the Americans' talk about a peace process "clouds the fact that the Palestinians are prisoners of a racist occupation, of collective punishment and genocide."  
Every year since March 2002, Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization have reiterated their support for the Arab peace initiative. Hopefully they will do so again next month at the Arab League summit in Tripoli. The initiative offers Israel normalization with all Arab League members in return for a withdrawal from all territories occupied in 1967. It's doubtful whether the return of the Golan Heights will convince Assad to diverge from the Arab consensus and host an Israeli ambassador when his government perpetuates the occupation of the West Bank and Jerusalem.  
It's hard to exaggerate the contribution of peace with Syria to Israel's position in the region, especially to security in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Damascus channel must be reopened. This must be done in parallel with the Ramallah channel, not instead of it.

<title>The lie behind the right wing's truth </title>
<date>Wed Aug 04 02:16:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 
Some people are surprised at recent expressions of support on the right for a one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, through what appears to be a readiness to grant Israeli citizenship to Palestinians living in territories that would be annexed. I'm surprised they're surprised, because that has been the right wing's position since 1967. It's just that it hasn't been easy to openly advocate an explicitly annexationist stance. It has been much easier to speak of our right to the land, of the right of Jews to settle everywhere in the Land of Israel, while ignoring that this involves not only territory, but also people - millions of Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza.
Now the cat is out of the bag, comfortably out. For more and more Israelis, it's becoming clear that the chance negotiations with the Palestinians will produce an agreement to establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel is not great. If U.S. President Barack Obama's special envoy George Mitchell has not gotten the parties to the negotiating table after a year and a half of trying, it's clear, despite the American president's good intentions and commitment to solve the conflict, that his efforts do not look as if they are bound to succeed.
What's easier than announcing the failure of the vision of two states for two peoples, which the right has always opposed and is now using to propose its annexationist intentions, which have been its inner truth all along? It's just that now it is wrapped in flowery rhetoric supported even by champions of human rights. So when someone like former Likud politician Moshe Arens, with his American background, supports it, it even appears as if it has been inspired by the non-ethnic civil concepts of American democracy.
The annexationist truth now being revealed for all to see is accompanied by a lie hiding behind it. What is apparently offered by some right-wing spokesmen seems a commitment to civil equality, without a hint of nationalism. What is better than offering the Palestinian population of the territories Israeli citizenship? But if you examine carefully the pronouncements of right-wing spokesmen in the media, it turns out that no one is talking about granting automatic citizenship and the right to vote to the residents of the territories to be annexed to Israel. They speak of a "process," and some say it would take a generation.
What would happen in the meantime is clear. The Arab residents of the territories to be annexed might be offered citizenship, but it would be subject to conditions. They would be required to declare loyalty to Israel as a Jewish  (and democratic ) state. It can be assumed they would have to undergo a security check. It is reasonable to assume they would have to sever all ties, legal or otherwise, with their relatives in Jordan and other countries. It can further be assumed that those who are refugees from the 1948 War of Independence and their descendants would be required to declare they are forgoing both their right of return to Israel proper and their property claims.
In short, the annexation of the territories would take place, but equal citizenship wouldn't really be granted. No one on the right speaks of equal citizenship here and now. From a realistic perspective, it's clear Israel cannot possibly annex the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It's simply impossible from the standpoint of its foreign relations. Israel is not an apartheid state, but it turns out this is the dream of right-wing spokesmen who speak of one state from the Jordan to the Mediterranean. Self-righteous sweet talk cannot obscure either the inner truth or the lie that is associated with these ideas.

<title>The moment of decision nears </title>
<date>Sun Feb 07 01:55:13 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In his speech at the Herzliya Conference, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he thought negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians would be resumed in the coming weeks under American mediation. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said over the weekend that the focus of the talks would be the 1967 borders, with territory swaps.  
That formula was the basis of the previous Israeli government's negotiations with the Palestinians, but it is at odds with the stance of most Likud cabinet members in the current government, who have expressed support for the Land of Israel lobby in the Knesset. The revived lobby is preaching "strengthening the hold of the State of Israel throughout the Land of Israel and particularly in Judea and Samaria [the West Bank]." Of all the Likud cabinet ministers, only Netanyahu, Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor and Improvement of Government Services Minister Michael Eitan haven't come out with expressions of support for the lobby.  
A resumption of peace negotiations centered around an almost total Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank presents Netanyahu with a two-fold challenge. If he takes positions in keeping with the sentiments of the Land of Israel lobby, he will be thrust into a confrontation with the U.S. administration and denounced internationally as an opponent of peace. But if he takes the path proposed by Secretary of State Clinton, he will run into confrontation with his own Likud party and his right-wing coalition partners.  
Netanyahu has thus far avoided making a decision and for some time has relied on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' refusal to engage in direct negotiations. He has also relied on protracted discussions with the United States over the construction freeze in the settlements.  
Supporters of the right wing have made it clear to Netanyahu that they are not ready to countenance even the partial halt to new construction in the West Bank settlements. A new Haaretz-Dialog poll has shown that Netanyahu has lost the support of voters on the right, and even his West Bank tree-planting activity at Gush Etzion, in Ma'aleh Adumim and in Ariel has not returned them to the fold.  
Netanyahu's position in favor of the ultimate annexation of three West Bank settlement blocs and security surveillance on the border of a future Palestinian state are not at odds with proposals espoused by the previous Kadima-led government of Ehud Olmert. Netanyahu, however, has not yet managed to be convincing that he intends to realize a two-state solution through a partition of the land.  
Clinton's statement makes it clear that Netanyahu's grace period is nearing an end. Instead of senselessly courting the right, he should take a courageous stand and state clearly to his political partners that a withdrawal from the territories and the evacuation of the settlements are what is needed. Otherwise Defense Minister Ehud Barak's warning that without partition Israel will become a binational apartheid state will become a reality.

<title>The most Ashkenazi elite of them all </title>
<date>Sun May 16 01:18:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Gideon Levy raises an important issue: the incorporation of Mizrahi Jews into the elites of Israeli society. The picture he draws is depressing: "Our entire political, economic, legal, academic and even military leadership is made up of Ashkenazim, with a smattering of Sephardim as the exceptions that so remarkably prove the rule." ("And what happens in our community?" May 2 ) This picture is only partially true. The elites vary enormously in this matter. Some are more integrated, while others less so. The elite that is apparently the most Ashkenazi of all is that of the radical left.
In recent decades we have had ministers of defense, foreign affairs and finance who were Mizrahim. We have had chiefs of staff who were Mizrahim, GOCs, heads of Military Intelligence, commanders of the air force and Sayeret Matkal special operations force, attorneys general, directors general and senior officials at the Finance Ministry, heads of the Histadrut labor federation, and business tycoons. Even the Labor Party, a regular target for criticism in this respect, has twice elected a Mizrahi head, and the current Histadrut secretary general is far from being a "pet Mizrahi."
However, the elites calling for an international boycott of Israel, and the Israeli participants in Israeli Apartheid Week in cities around the world, and in general all those who tend to portray Israel as a despicable and failed state, solely responsible for the conflict - this indeed is an Ashkenazi elite "with a smattering of Mizrahim." It would be appropriate for the members of this elite, who excel at preaching morality, to show a little more humility and learn a lesson from Israel's business, political and defense elites on how to integrate Mizrahim.
As a rule, it can be said that all encounters in the modern era between the European world and the East, particularly the Middle East, have been unequal. Of these encounters, the one in Israel between those with origins in Europe and those from the Middle East was the least unequal because both sides shared the Zionist ideology that considered all Jewish communities as belonging to the same people. This approach did not, in practice, prevent prejudice, patronizing and discrimination, but it included an enormous advantage when compared to every other outlook, as far as integrating communities was concerned.
Among modern ideologies, only Zionism enables, and requires, that Polish Jews and Yemenite Jews be seen as one people. It is fashionable today to denigrate this philosophy that sees all Jews as one nation; it is fashionable to consider it a myth. But it is clear that when it comes to integrating people from Europe and the Arab-Muslim world, in nearly equal numbers, Israel is the most successful example of such an integration in modern history. From a Zionist standpoint, it could be said that this achievement is less worthy of wonderment; after all, it involves people of the same nation, despite the cultural differences between them. And it's not about the much more difficult integration of immigrants from different nations and cultures.
The more someone distances himself from Zionist ideology and considers less than obvious the Jewish national philosophy in its Zionist form, and the more that person considers the coming of Jews to this land as regular immigration rather than aliyah - the more that person should be impressed by Israel's achievements in building a nation. It is therefore better to embrace the Zionist outlook so there is room left to criticize the Israeli reality on this matter, not just be impressed by it. As an effort to integrate immigrants from the entire world, East and West, Israel is a phenomenal success story; Compared with the Zionist ideal of ingathering "the exiles" there is still a lot to be done.

<title>The spider, the road and the occupation </title>
<date>Thu Jan 14 01:14:19 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Even if the farce staged by Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and his deputy Danny Ayalon to make the Turkish ambassador feel small is forgotten, Route 443 is a better example of the wide gap between Israelis' self-image and the value of Israel and its arguments in the eyes of the international community. No propaganda campaign based on the cry "Gevalt, they're killing us" can save the occupation from the understanding that this is not a dispute about Jewish existence. Either way, Israel does not know how to defend this existence without groaning that "the spider of the settlements is proving burdensome, please help us handle it so we can continue settling everywhere, including in East Jerusalem."  
What does Israeli logic say about Route 443 and barring Palestinians from using it for years, in the best traditions of apartheid? (Which is flourishing here but which we are not permitted to call by that name.) Logic dictates that we need this road because it shortens the distance to Jerusalem and eases congestion on Highway 1. But because this efficient road passes through occupied territory, and has done so for 42 years - a temporary occupation, of course (here, in the script, the Supreme Court justices call for a wink) - it endangers the lives of Israelis. This is because the inhabitants of the occupied territory don't like the idea of their land being used without their permission.  
Therefore, for our convenience, we have to prevent Palestinian drivers from using the road. Here, too, the Israeli argument ranges from arrogant fury, as in "Who are you tell us how to defend the lives of our children?" to "After all, we do want to see two states for two peoples, etc." And as always, an examination of the argument reveals that what the Israelis call security, even when they are speaking absolutely sincerely, is not security but ownership of land cleansed of Arabs.  
Even when security reasons were not used in the usual demagogic manner, the removal of Arabs from territories inhabited by Israelis has always been described as "security." Anyone who carefully reads the debates about the military government in Arab-populated areas in the 1950s and '60s will see that even in the most penetrating documents written in its defense, security arguments are linked to preventing Arab farmers from entering the land in question. (This is why the military government in Haifa, Jaffa, Acre, Ramle and Lod, in which Jews were settled, was abolished quickly, and the Arabs there bunched together in remote neighborhoods, whereas in the rural areas the military government was retained until 1967.)  
Whatever the nature of the solution, from the Israeli point of view it always entails the removal of Arabs from areas where Jews live.  
Over the years, Israelis have learned to see any territory in which there are Arabs as endangering their security. To guard against them it is permitted to remove them, or fence them in, or settle in their midst, and then to protect the settlers from the danger to their security, namely the Arabs around them. Thus the barbaric wall that runs "almost" along the Green Line is perceived by Israelis as a security need; it's there to protect the security of Hashmonaim C, Maccabim D, Modi'in Ilit or Beit El. And for their convenience why should we care about the plight of the subjects of the occupation in Bil'in, Na'alin or Bani Saleh?  
As the moment of truth approaches, as Israel's role in Western politics becomes less important, Israel and its leaders are depicted as a nuisance when they maintain that this old land dispute is an issue of security. It's not a matter of security, but of a desire for convenience, for more land, more water. Our domestic consensus makes no sense to anyone outside Israel; it's seen merely as a national inability to see the sand running out in the hourglass.  
This is how we have arrived at the ludicrous conduct of the Netanyahu-Barak government toward the Palestinian Authority. The two-state solution was a gift the Palestinians offered Israel in the spirit of what Israel has always demanded: "You over there, we over here." But that's not what Israel really wants. Because if you have already conceded that, why shouldn't you concede more and more until you disappear completely behind the walls of your ghetto?

<title>The tyranny of the Israeli majority </title>
<date>Fri Dec 24 02:27:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In order to deal properly with the diplomatic dead end, we have to accept that the problem is not political in the narrow sense of the concept. It is not a question of right and left according to the common Israeli terminology: The problem is social and cultural, part of the structure of political culture in Israel. Therefore, it is unimportant who will be in the government in the near future, just as there was no importance to the identity of the coalitions that ruled during the Yom Kippur War, the two Lebanon wars and Operation Cast Lead in Gaza. The exception was the second government of Yitzhak Rabin.
The present political balance of power has created a Knesset that has become an assembly line of legislation that is dragging Israel down to the bottom of the list of civilized countries. In fact, the Israeli usually understands one thing about the concept of democracy: an unrestrained government of the majority. Here the principle of majority rule is considered the right of the stronger side to impose its authority on those weaker than it, without considering the limitations imposed by human rights.
The concept "majority" does not have the same moral and ideological meaning here that it has in Europe, where the right of the majority to rule was an expression of a liberation from the tyranny of the minority, which was acquired after long struggles and became another aspect of the right to freedom and equality and a means of guaranteeing the rights of the individual. That is not the case here: The average Israeli doesn't even understand why the same majority that elected the MKs is not authorized to decide who will sit on the judge's seat, or why Basic Laws have to protect the Arab minority from the majority.
The right of the stronger applies also, if not first and foremost, to our relations with the Palestinians. It is not only the settlement-oriented right that fails to understand why a great power like Israel even has to conduct discussions with the Palestinians, who are totally dependent on us. Even in today's Labor Party, which sees itself as the successor of Mapai, many believe the Jews are doing the Arabs a favor when they are even willing to discuss their demands.
That is why Israeli society is incapable of producing the moral and intellectual strength required to put an end to the occupation. Those who choose to hold on to the territories at any price are the minority, although a large one, but along with those who want to control as large a chunk of the territories as possible, there is a majority of society. Those who favor an apartheid state are a minority, but many have already accepted a situation of apartheid that does not call it by name, existing behind a smokescreen of being "temporary."
That is why the only significant argument between the left and the right was and remains primarily technical: How far, in terms of Israel's foreign relations, can we stretch the rope? As long as the gentile only barks and doesn't bite, there is no need to hurry. In that sense Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Revisionist boy from Rehavia, is a copy of another prime minister, Golda Meir, the "socialist" pioneer and the refugee from the land of pogroms in Russia, who arrived in Israel via Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Our American ally is not necessarily naive. Like President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in their time (see the article by Aluf Benn, "Better than Wikileaks," December 15 ), President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton know that Israel will not budge from its positions unless it feels that it is being bulldozed. Nixon and Kissinger wanted an Israel that was weakened and in mourning, but strong enough to enter negotiations with Egypt. Is it proper, is it worthwhile to wait for the day when Obama and the Europeans also reach the conclusion that it will be possible to talk only to an Israel that has suffered a stinging failure?

<title>Time to come clean </title>
<date>Fri Jun 04 02:02:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
NEW YORK - The revelations in my book, "The Unspoken Alliance: Israel's Secret Alliance with Apartheid South Africa," have angered Israelis across the political spectrum. Israeli politicians from Dan Meridor to Yossi Beilin, and writers from Haaretz's Anshel Pfeffer to the blogger Emmanuel Navon, have denounced my findings regarding cooperation between Israel and South Africa on nuclear issues, and dismissed them as false or inaccurate.
President Shimon Peres has said "there exists no basis in reality for the claims" put forward in my book. Beilin, despite praising the book on its back cover, has decided to stand by his former boss when it comes to the subject of nuclear weapons. As he told The New York Times: "The president's denial puts an end to the subject."
It does not.
Peres is being evasive. Although his signature does not appear on the minutes of a series of meetings that took place in South Africa and Switzerland between March and June 1975, the documents confirm his presence and record the statements he made there. They also show that one topic discussed at the meeting was nuclear-armed Jericho missiles. Peres' signature appears on a document dated just days after the first discussion of Jericho missiles took place, pledging to keep these and all other defense discussions secret.
To my knowledge, Peres has not denied his presence at these meetings, nor has he claimed that the South African documents are fake. If Peres is so adamant that his version of events is true, he should encourage the government to immediately release all Defense Ministry documents concerning Israeli-South African military cooperation between 1975 and 1990. The Israeli people deserve to see the historical evidence and draw their own conclusions.
A memorandum from the South African chief of staff at the time, R.F. Armstrong, written on the same day as the first Jericho discussion - March 31, 1975 - confirms the South Africans' exclusive interest in nuclear-tipped Jerichos. A South African who joined Israel Defense Forces' then-chief of staff Rafael Eitan at a 1979 missile test launch in Israel reiterates this narrow interest, writing that the Jerichos would only be worth the price if the warheads were extremely advanced, "with a nuclear warhead as the ideal."
The 1975 deal was never consummated, but there is no doubt Peres took part in the discussions and that the South Africans perceived Israel's proposal as a nuclear offer.
The Jericho missile program continued as a joint project based in South Africa throughout the 1980s, when Israeli rocketry experts went to the coastal town of Arniston. South Africa had by then successfully developed its own nuclear weapons and was seeking to miniaturize them for use as warheads. The Israelis helped with the missile development.
Furthermore, in 1976, Israeli intelligence officials approached Pretoria requesting that the safeguards be lifted on a 500-ton stockpile of South African yellowcake uranium that had built up in Israel over a period of 15 years. The South African minister of mines, Fanie Botha, traveled to Israel that July, where he met with Peres, then-prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and top army officials and nuclear scientists. Botha admitted to me in a 2006 interview that during this trip he lifted the safeguards, freeing Israel to use the yellowcake for military purposes.
In exchange, Israel provided South Africa with tritium - a substance that boosts the yield of thermonuclear weapons. Moreover, Israel funneled money to the nearly bankrupt Botha through a middleman in order to keep him in office until the deal went through.
Fanie Botha's visit to Israel is confirmed in a 1976 Israel Ministry of Defense document and in the records of a 1988 trial held in camera in South Africa's Supreme Court.
Haaretz columnist Anshel Pfeffer has criticized what he believes is "shoddy detail" in my book and conclusions that are "convoluted and tenuous at best" (May 28, 2010 ). He adds: "There are much more plausible explanations to Peres' cryptic reference to 'three sizes' of missile payloads, if that is indeed what he said in those secret meetings 35 years ago."
But Pfeffer does not offer us alternative explanations. Presumably, he believes that the phrase refers to the missile's range rather than its warhead. The documents themselves reveal this to be absurd, because in the same meetings Peres and Botha openly discussed the range of other missile systems. The term "payload" in English is not an ambiguous one: It refers to a warhead and not a missile's range.
Pfeffer goes on to misrepresent nuclear program expert Avner Cohen's views, suggesting that he "dismisses the claims" in my book. In reality, Cohen has praised my research and backed my conclusions. On May 25, he told The Independent: "The discussions between Israel and South Africa referred to in the documents seem to me authentic and refer, I believe, to nuclear weapons, even if euphemisms like 'correct payload' were used."
Thirty-five years later, it is time for Peres to come clean.

The flotilla affair would not have developed into such an unprecedented crisis were it not the last link in a long chain of failures and acts of folly. These cast a heavy shadow - one that's getting longer - on Israel's status as a responsible and level-headed power. The fact that hatred for the sake of hatred is mixed up with legitimate criticism does not allow Israel to claim innocence.
Indeed, since its foundation, Israel has enjoyed almost unlimited moral credit. It has also enjoyed the status of a responsible country whose leaders are careful about embarking on adventures and whose judgment can therefore be counted on. During the Yom Kippur War, Golda Meir and the veterans of the Mapai party refused to employ a special kind of ammunition to hold back an invasion. Yitzhak Shamir prevented an unnecessary imbroglio during the Gulf War, while Yitzhak Rabin determined that Israel must not become enslaved to its conquests.
Thanks to this worldwide recognition, Israel was able to develop without hindrance that ultimate defense umbrella that foreign reports claim it has. This "ambiguity" was also acceptable to the Soviet Union - the Arabs' ally and weapons supplier. It was possible to allow the Israel of David Ben-Gurion, Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir to develop the Dimona nuclear plant quietly. It was possible to allow the Israel of Menachem Begin to bomb Iraq's plant knowing that it would not cross any red lines.
On the other hand, Benjamin Netanyahu, Ehud Barak, Moshe Ya'alon and Avigdor Lieberman belong to a different species of politician, one that cannot be relied on blindly. This is one of the key motives behind the U.S. administration's support for international supervision at Dimona; it's also the reason our allies in Washington, Paris and Brussels want to see the Mavi Marmara incident investigated by international bodies. They have concluded that it is no longer possible to let Israel function without supervision and pressure, because only pressure brings results.
Indeed, it turns out that to avoid an international investigation, Israel is prepared to significantly ease the blockade on the Gaza Strip. But the root of the problem goes much deeper - the realization that every Israeli action since the Beirut campaign and the attack on the Syrian army in the summer of 1982 until Operation Cast Lead has the sole aim of defending the conquests of the Six-Day War. Since we ultimately carried out all our wars with the purpose of defeating the Palestinians by perpetuating the situation in the territories, we created the feeling that Israel sees itself as existing for the sake of its conquests.
As long as the foot-dragging regarding the Palestinians continues in the United Nations, as long as media outlets report on construction in the territories under a heavy cloak of lies and fraud, and as long as we hear about shameful decisions on the lists of goods allowed into Gaza, the stockpiles of goodwill that were accumulated in past years will be depleted. Public opinion is no longer prepared to tolerate not only the occupation, including the attempts to gain control of Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods, but also Israel's self-righteousness and complete assurance that it has the right to maintain an apartheid regime in the territories.
The bill is now gradually being submitted for payment. That's why Israel finds itself against the wall over existential matters. If we had a genuine and burning desire to end the colonialist situation in the West Bank, for our own sake and not merely as a wink to Washington, it's very possible that we would receive the West's support on the nuclear issue. If we had acted in a trustworthy manner and not tried at every opportunity to lie to and cheat everyone, maybe we wouldn't now be facing an all-out attack on our life-insurance policy.
Reliability is a weapon, but the Israel of today, blind to developments in the world, is relinquishing this weapon with incomprehensible lightness. After Operation Cast Lead, no one believes any longer in our ability to investigate ourselves, and justifiably so. But to the same extent, it can be said that official Israel does not investigate because its citizens do not want to know.
The problem is structural and cultural - most people do not want to look in the mirror. They prefer to believe that in every case, Israel is the victim the world is abusing, so it is allowed to do anything, and any demand to investigate its acts is some form of anti-Semitism. In this way maybe it's possible to calm one's conscience, but this is not the way to build the country's future.

<title>Undermining liberty </title>
<date>Thu Mar 25 03:20:10 IST 2010</date>
<content>
The Jewish people's national movement - Zionism - was born as a secular movement and conducted itself as such. The ultra-Orthodox, who made up the absolute majority of Jews at the time of its establishment, objected to it furiously. They saw it as a movement of heretics, instigators and false prophets. Even the Holocaust, whose extent would not have been so fatal had the ultra-Orthodox rabbis not prohibited emigrating to Palestine, did not change this fundamental approach. To this day, albeit more in theory than de facto, the ultra-Orthodox do not recognize the State of Israel - just like the radical left and factions in the Arab community.  
The ultra-Orthodox community's growing strength is spurring it to dictate behavior patterns to the public majority. In matters like the graves under Ashkelon's Barzilai Medical Center, this dictation proves how powerful - and absurd - the ultra-Orthodox leaders' sense of power is.  
Perhaps this will be a turning point that will bring us all, religious and secular, to block the ultra-Orthodox community's ambition. We have seen how the majority's outcry forced the prime minister to come to his senses about the Ashkelon graves.  
The majority in Israel allows the ultra-Orthodox to issue decrees in the most basic matters of identity because of their political power. This majority is doing itself a grave moral injustice, especially to ultra-Orthodox society. The majority can wean the ultra-Orthodox from their absolute dependence on the state, thus turning them, albeit against their will, into a productive community.  
If the majority does so, then by force of reality, like the ultra-Orthodox in America, in addition to scholars who study the Torah there will be ultra-Orthodox scientists, doctors, engineers and psychologists. They will be productive, rather than dependent. Thus, one may assume, their appetite to impose on the majority's lifestyle that it objects to will diminish.  
If the ultra-Orthodox are undermining the freedom of spirit in Israel, the radical left on the other hand is undermining the Jewish people's very freedom as a state. This left uses the generous financial assistance of foreign states and organizations - including Jew-haters - who act, under the guise of "human rights," to deny the Jewish people's right to sovereignty, destroy the Jewish state's moral basis, return the Palestinian refugees, make the world hate Israel and undermine the legitimacy of its existence.  
When the ultra-Orthodox go too far, as they did in the Barzilai Medical Center, the majority, pushed by the media, rebels. But when radical leftist organizations provide most of the false data in the Goldstone report and organize "Israeli Apartheid week" in campuses abroad, the public hardly knows about it. This is because the media, a considerable part of which sympathizes with them, is silent.  
When the Im Tirzu movement exposes the New Israel Fund's deeds, financed by subversive bodies, it remains a lone voice in the wilderness. When information erupts in a different way the media, instead of denouncing the subverters, denounces their exposers.  
Thus, for example, the public is not aware that the governments of Britain, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden and others finance Peace Now's demonstrations, the groups advocating draft evasion and the serial petitions to the High Court of Justice (and the High Court's cooperation with these groups). These countries also finance activity that encourages Israel's Arabs to set up nationalist, cultural, political and organizational infrastructures to separate from the State of Israel.  
The "vision papers" issued by Israel's Arabs, whose composition was encouraged and financed by the United Nations, European Union and New Israel Fund, are in fact Israeli Arabs' divorce papers from the state whose citizens they are. The radical Jewish left supports the separatist trends deriving from these papers. Thus the Jewish sector has remained almost unexposed to the danger that in the tiny space of Israel a Palestinian state could rise - supported by numerous countries - in addition to the one that exists de facto in Judea and Samaria.  
Following the wide media coverage, the Zionist Jewish majority is aware of what the ultra-Orthodox are doing, and one may assume that one day it will put them in their place. But this majority remains passive vis-a-vis the real danger to its political future's freedom, even in its reduced state. Thus it allows the subverters to destroy the identity - as a prelude to destroying the existence - of the state that tens of thousands of it have sacrificed their lives to establish and safeguard for the past 62 years.

<title>We are all Zuabi </title>
<date>Wed Aug 18 01:57:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 
During the visit by leaders of the Palestinian community to Libya a few months ago, MK Hanin Zuabi  (Balad ) stood out in particular - the only woman in the "Arabs of 1948" delegation invited to visit Muammar Gadhafi. When we met with Gadhafi in his tent in the town of Sert, this remarkable woman showed courage that is rare in these parts.
The leader preached to us and advised us to practice one of the tenets of Islam - marry four women and bring many children into the world to fight the Israelis. Zuabi, who is known for her struggle for the rights of Palestinian women in Israel, did not hesitate and pointed out to Gadhafi that his philosophy was not acceptable to her because it oppresses women. The tent went silent. It's not customary to interrupt the leader, we had been told in the briefing before the meeting. Gadhafi listened and simply went on with his speech.
This story proves that Zuabi is cut from tough and unyielding cloth - an uncompromising fighter for her party's principles both domestically and abroad.
It's only natural the targeted assassination campaign led by members of the Knesset, which transcends party lines and opinions and is aimed at expelling Zuabi from the Knesset, would gain momentum. Zuabi, like most Arab MKs, is a nuisance to the various racists, and the delegitimization campaign against her is an inseparable part of the official efforts, with a tailwind from the obsequious Hebrew-language press, to declare Balad illegal.
The remnants of what is called "Israeli democracy" are getting lost in the name of protecting the Jewish State of Israel. It's the Israelis' right to think what they want, but it's our obligation to defend our principles, even if this entails a high individual and collective price. The Palestinians in Israel will not agree to recognize Israel as a Jewish state. The Palestinians, the authentic owners of the land here, are an inseparable part of the Arab nation. They were here before Israel, they are not transients and they are certainly not guests in their native land.
The efforts to expel from the Knesset the Arabs who are representing their voters, in addition to the racist laws the current Knesset has promoted, are liable to turn Israel into a new model of apartheid state, like the despicable one that once reigned in South Africa.
Most of the anger toward Zuabi stems from her participation in the flotilla to the Gaza Strip. But in a properly run country they would have opened an investigation not against her but against the "anonymous individuals" who set up a Facebook group calling for her execution. Moreover, the Israelis must understand that Zuabi took part in the flotilla for breaking the blockade of Gaza because she believes that no law in the world gives an occupier the right, moral or otherwise, to put 1.5 million people in prison because of a soldier captured by the Palestinian resistance forces.
On the flotilla she represented the Palestinians in Israel, not only herself and her party. The Palestinians' Higher Monitoring Committee, the only body that faithfully represents them, chose her to represent more than a million Palestinians in Israel. So the campaign against her is a campaign against all the Palestinians in the Jewish state - hence the danger in it.
Astonishingly, Israel's knights of human rights are not speaking out, which is dangerous for both Israeli and Palestinian society in this country. If you support expelling Zuabi from the Knesset, we are sending you a razor-sharp message: We are all Zuabi.

<title>Welcome, Mr. Erdogan </title>
<date>Tue Jun 08 01:53:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
If Recep Tayyip Erdogan wanted to visit Gaza - even bearing a sprig of coriander, which for some reason Israel forbids bringing in - I would bid him welcome in the name of Hamas and all the residents of Gaza. I don't know whether Egypt, which also blockades Gaza - and especially the Palestinian Authority, whose employees were thrown off rooftops by Hamas - would welcome such a visit with open arms. But as far as we Israelis are concerned, this is no longer our top priority.
After all, we're no longer in Gaza. It cost us some NIS 10 billion to destroy all the houses and synagogues in Gush Katif, move the graves and compensate the settlers. We left Gaza five years ago, under Ariel Sharon's government, with no preconditions  (which is a lot more than one can say of Turkey's conduct with regard to the Alexandretta district).
But instead of turning the evacuated territory into a wonderful tourist destination, Hamas turned it into a base for launching Qassam rockets. For years, it fired on Israeli towns and terrorized Israel's civilian population. If Erdogan had at least helped to rehabilitate Gaza and persuaded its leaders not to launch Qassams at Israel, he would have helped to calm the situation and also promote peace. But in the eyes of Islamic radicals, and sometimes even in our own eyes, we are still controlling Gaza.
Israel's problem is its deteriorating position in international opinion, due to its weakness and its inability to make serious concessions. The government headed by Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, Avigdor Lieberman and Eli Yishai is not perceived as one capable of reaching an agreement based on territorial concessions, and very far from being able to forge a permanent border between two states.
The flotilla incident, and the worldwide grudge against Israel that it sparked, would never have happened if we had been engaged in serious negotiations with Palestinian leaders. But instead, we have imposed a blockade, deported famous visitors and caused well-known rock bands to cancel their performances here as if we were lepers. It's somewhat reminiscent of South Africa under the apartheid regime.
When leaders are seen as weak, then, like a flock of sheep, they invite the wolves to attack. Thus we have fallen victim to all kinds of bizarre organizations, and are falling into traps that should we never have fallen into. Thank God for the United States, which, despite all its disappointment at us, is not letting us fall into the abyss - or at least, not before the next election there.
Our problem is almost always the same: First we oppose a commission of inquiry, and in the end we are forced to accede to the worst possible terms. We shouldn't waste so much as another day debating and digesting the decision to set up an international inquiry commission, in which Turkey, Israel and the U.S. would all participate, to investigate the flotilla and the circumstances that led to its bloody outcome.
It's all more or less known. The pictures of our battered, bloody soldiers on the deck of the Mavi Marmara, which were published in the Turkish paper Hurriyet, are decisive proof of who ambushed whom. From a military perspective, Israel was indeed guilty of an intelligence failure: The naval commandos did not know in advance that thugs with knives, saws, batons and every other kind of lethal non-firearm weapon imaginable were lying in wait for them.
Whether or not the blockade of Gaza is legal is a separate question. But it is hard to believe that not a single one of Turkey's intelligence agencies knew that a group of terrorists like that was waiting for our soldiers on the deck of the Mavi Marmara. The Turkish government must also explain how it happened that only this ship, and not any of the others, boasted such a violent group. Do they also lie in wait for coast guard inspectors in Istanbul with knives?
The question we must ask ourselves now is, how did we reach a situation in which it is legitimate to pounce on us and condemn us at every opportunity? Israel must reconstitute its government to create a majority desirous of finally beginning serious talks with the Palestinians. For without an agreement on permanent borders, an agreement with Syria and the restoration of our strategic ties with both Turkey and Europe, we will be added to the list of leper states.

<title>What Naomi Klein really wants </title>
<date>Fri Mar 26 03:45:13 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Several weeks ago, my colleagues and I at the Reut Institute published a comprehensive report on the growing efforts to delegitimize Israel. Discussing our report on Canadian radio, I mentioned the writer and political activist Naomi Klein - an internationally prominent speaker for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel - as one of a few notable individuals in Toronto who promote Israel's delegitimization. Klein soon published a vitriolic denial, which turned into an angry exchange published on a U.S.-based blog.  
Klein's main argument was that I was attempting to equate "non-violent tactics like BDS with a military campaign to destroy Israel." Thus, Klein accused me of lying when I said she intended to delegitimize Israel and challenged me to search her writings for evidence to prove it, publicly proclaiming I would find nothing.  
Well, I did find something. In my response to Klein, I argued that despite never explicitly rejecting Israel's right to exist, the fact that in her work, she singles Israel out, demonizes it, calls it a perpetrator of apartheid, and suggests it was born in sin, leaves little room for doubt regarding her intentions. Moreover, on at least one occasion a few months ago, Klein wondered publicly, "How about a one-state solution?"  
The rest of the exchange, and Klein herself, are largely insignificant in light of the greater phenomena at work. However, by taking Naomi Klein as a metaphor, we can unravel the core of a broader dynamic - "Kleinism," if you will - which damages the quest for a two-state solution.  
"Kleinism" represents a simplistic, artificial view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that has led many who consider themselves human-rights activists to focus their criticism nearly exclusively on Israel. It brands Israel as the new apartheid state, so it can do no right and its adversaries no wrong. It frames Israel as uninterested in peace or in ending the occupation. It ignores any structural obstacles to peace unrelated to Israel, the most obvious being the sharp divisions among the Palestinians.  
Thus, "Kleinists" seem to have concluded that one-sided criticism of Israel is the best way to promote peace, and that pressurizing the state with all available means, including BDS, is both legitimate and effective.  
As a result, Israel's branding as a violent, aggressive and discriminatory state is increasingly gaining traction. Consequently, the entire political model of Israel as a Jewish state is framed as inherently immoral. Israel is compared with South Africa's apartheid regime with such persistence and intensity that many seem not to be concerned by the fundamental differences between the two cases, and call for a one-state solution based on the South African formula of "one man, one vote."  
This dynamic is well exploited by the "network of resistance" - primarily Iran and its clients Hezbollah and Hamas, which have adopted a strategy that targets Israel's political and economic standing. In recent years, these groups seem to have inverted their position toward the Israeli occupation, coming to view it as a strategic asset, believing that continued Israeli control over the Palestinian population will create an "overstretch" between the Jewish identity of the state, its democratic values, its territory, and demographic trends, all of which will lead to Israel's implosion. Therefore, these groups have consistently sabotaged the political process via terrorism and thwarted Israeli attempts to unilaterally separate from the Palestinians.  
Israel thus finds itself stuck between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, the country suffers from the permanent military threat posed by the network of resistance, which impedes the political process and threatens to frustrate the paradigm of the two-state solution. On the other hand, Israel is framed in the West as ill-willed and illegitimate, in keeping with purportedly "moral" and "liberal" values, which promote the one-state threat.  
Whether intentionally or not, the upshot of these processes is that some human rights activists are aligning with fundamentalist Islamists against Israel. One particularly bizarre example of how these groups' values conflict - differences that melt away when it comes to Israel - is the annual gay rights march against "the Israeli Apartheid," which has taken place twice now in Toronto, while homosexuals are being hanged in Tehran and forced to flee Gaza for Tel Aviv.  
It may be that many BDS supporters are genuinely looking to change Israel's policies from a human rights perspective, and do not seek to delegitimize Israel. Indeed, such criticism is important and legitimate, even when harsh and sometimes even when unfair. Yet, the idea of precipitating Israel's capitulation using the model that brought down South Africa's racist regime - which is the conceptual and strategic core of the BDS campaign - is simplistic and unfounded and is likely to cause more human misery, chaos and bloodshed.  
We should not be misled by "Kleinist" terminology. Those who really care about justice, peace, human rights and international law should reject the superficial apartheid diagnosis and its accompanying disastrous prognosis. Instead, it is those in both Israel and Palestine who promote the principle of two states for two peoples who could eventually bring about a true and stable peace in accordance with international law. It is we who encourage national, civil and human rights. It is we, and not those who demonize one side, reinforce intransigence and weaken the two-state movement by promoting unrealistic and destructive solutions.

<title>When 'safety' is a threat </title>
<date>Fri Nov 05 01:36:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Last year Jewish college students in San Diego were confronted with a significant escalation of anti-Israel activity at two of our large state universities. This included a divestment resolution, a showy student-run "Apartheid Week," which was co-sponsored by departments at one university, and a stream of high-profile anti-Zionist speakers, many of whom were themselves Jewish.
Hillel of San Diego, which serves approximately 5,000 Jewish students on eight campuses across San Diego County, has always taken pride in its proactive Israel agenda; last year at the University of California, San Diego, alone, students organized over 90 Israel-related activities, including musical performances, films, conversational Hebrew language instruction, displays showcasing Israel's contributions to technological advancement and humanitarian needs across the world - and yes, also political speakers offering a variety of perspectives. However, in the face of the divestment resolution  (which was not approved ) and the visibility of the other anti-Israel activities, some members of the local Jewish community expressed concern that Jewish students were not fighting back in a strong enough fashion.
The issue of how students should "fight back" against anti-Israel activities on college campuses raises a dilemma for thoughtful people who care about the future of both the State of Israel and the Jewish people. On the one hand, we obviously cannot let the virulence of anti-Israel propaganda go unchallenged. We all know the danger and the threat posed by the rise of delegitimation efforts against the Jewish state.
On the other hand, fighting fiery speech with fiery speech serves only to enflame the campus. A polarized campus quickly turns into small groups of activists screaming at each other while the vast majority of students, who are uninformed, uncertain or simply turned off by the rhetoric, flee to the perceived safety of apathy. "Safety" is the operative word. Many students do not have the option of choosing their roommates, classmates or dining-hall mates. While well-meaning advisors usually have the luxury of going home in the evening to people who likely share their views, this refuge is not available to many students.
As a consequence, we have found that in this environment of heightened conflict, it is more difficult to engage uninvolved students around Israel issues. Even worse, it becomes more difficult to engage Jewish students around any aspect of Jewish life, not just Israel-related issues. They just don't want to be associated with the hostility. Polarization significantly undermines our work of encouraging both a love of Israel and a love of Judaism.
On the third hand, Jews have a long and distinguished tradition of "mahloket leshem shamayim," an argument for the sake of heaven, or disagreement expressed in a civil manner. On campus, as in the larger Jewish world, there are many views about the Arab-Israeli conflict. In the midst of the heightened tensions, we recognized anew that left-leaning Jewish students often feel bereft of community because of their politics. They are uncomfortable both with Jewish leadership's unwavering political support of Israel and with the demonization of the country that they see among their friends on the left.
Hillel has long prided itself on being a pluralistic organization, where students can explore and experience a range of authentic Jewish perspectives so they can decide for themselves where in the Jewish world they want to belong. Where do progressive students fit into the spectrum and what is our responsibility toward them?
Over the past two months, the board of Hillel of San Diego has gone through an in-depth process to address these questions and to come up with guidelines for Israel programming on campus. The guidelines confirmed the importance of the partnership of Hillel staff and students working together to create a proactive agenda that includes a wide range of Israeli cultural, social, educational and political activities that serve to strengthen students' personal connection with the country. In addition, we continue to trust our students to engage thoughtfully in the  so-called marketplace of ideas by striving to ensure a balance of political views. We encourage the creation of a space in which Jewish students can explore their values and commitments with regard to Israel without fear of being ostracized.
There are, however, limits to our multi-vocalism. Hillel of San Diego will not support any speaker or program that delegitimizes the State of Israel, demonizes Israel or promotes racism or hatred of any kind. We also are strongly opposed to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which we see as part of the delegitimation effort. In the face of such activities, Hillel of San Diego staff will work with student groups to be prepared with a strong, directly targeted response.
In the face of growing polarization in the American cultural scene, the standard joke that two Jews will have three opinions is rapidly changing to the unfunny scenario of two Jews with two opinions. At Hillel of San Diego we deplore this polarization. We are looking for a new paradigm that fosters a lasting commitment to Jewish life, a deep and intellectually honest attachment to Israel and opportunities for the next generation of Jewish leaders to find their many voices. We hope our new approach will help create the kind of community in which that paradigm can emerge.

<title>Who will be our Bono? </title>
<date>Sun Jul 18 01:47:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Notice the difference. Israel's biggest pop icon, Shlomo Artzi, takes part in a vacuous march masquerading as a civic-political protest with the aid of a ratings-hungry media. There, in this well-advertised space, Artzi effuses about the "line of the heart" and implores "the gods of reason, feeling and mind to bring back Gilad so he can be free as a bird."
In Ireland and Britain, by contrast, pop icons use their success and admiration to effect political change. Front men Bono of U2 and Chris Martin of Coldplay do not fear engaging in political activism. Quite the contrary: They see it as a goal and are willing to use their power as celebrities to cause revolutionary change and try to create a more just and better world.
Around two years ago, Nathan Jackson published a book covering Bono's development as a political activist ("Bono's Politics: The Future of Celebrity Political Activism" ). In the 1980s, the Irish rocker's activism was limited to Ireland, but in the middle of that decade Bono became aware of Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela, and joined the fight against apartheid.
Has Artzi ever said anything against the denial of rights to Palestinians living under occupation, or against the government's brutal and aggressive policy in many different aspects of Israeli life? Heaven forbid. Has he ever spoken out against arrogant declarations of war, unnecessary military actions, settler violence and racism against migrant workers? Inconceivable.
In 2003, Chris Martin came out on the front page of The Daily Mail against then-prime minister Tony Blair and his decision to join the coalition that would attack Iraq. There's hardly a need to elaborate on Bono's inexhaustible energy in fighting poverty and HIV/AIDS in Africa.
These campaigns, Jackson says, make Bono an outstanding political celebrity. Bono led a campaign against nuclear power stations in the north of England, and used a documentary film he helped produce to protest against the siege on Sarajevo from 1992 to 1995. With Bob Geldof, Bono joined a series of concerts and events throughout the world dedicated to scrapping Africa's $70 billion in debt, and to sending 35 million children to school.
The U2 front man is not fond of titles like "celebrity" or "philanthropist." In an interview in 2005, he said political activism for him was a goal as worthy as musical achievement. Celebrity, he said, is the currency one uses to make political change. After all, what can a rocker make other than noise, he asked.
Have you ever heard Artzi use his popularity to offer an intellectual alternative to the paradigms of power that guide Israel's leaders? Did he ever take the risk of making a bold political statement? Don't we deserve fewer sugarcoated front pages with Artzi and more political activism of Bono's kind?

<title>With a victory like this... </title>
<date>Mon Aug 23 01:58:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Two years ago, a basketball tournament was held at Tel Aviv University with the participation of student teams from 14 countries, including a Palestinian team from the occupied territories. The games were purportedly held "without preconditions," and every team put its best players on the court and aimed to win.
But unsurprisingly, the Shin Ben security service permitted only seven Palestinian players, including bench players, to enter Israel. Some of the key players on the team were compelled to stay at home. After several losses  (by 30 to 40 points), when it was the Palestinians' turn to face a team from one of the Israeli colleges, their coach announced that he had decided to spare his players another humiliation, and requested that the game be canceled.
The illuminating movie "Friendship Games," to be shown tonight on the Yes Docu channel  (directed by Ram Levy, along with Ibtisam Mara'ana, Duki Dror and Yoav Shamir), documents the tournament, which was the initiative of Ed Peskowitz, an American Jew and co-owner of the Atlanta Hawks basketball team in the NBA. The camera follows the Israeli coach to the Palestinian locker room. After a long while, he tells his players that in order to even out the teams, two of them will join the other side. He tells two of the Israeli bench players, including one known as Fatso, to don the shirts of the Palestinian team. The game ends with a decisive victory for the Israeli team and a strong sense of missed opportunity.
The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, like the basketball game, have preconditions. Not the conditions demanded by the Palestinians, but conditions dictated by Israel. The refusal to freeze Israeli building in East Jerusalem is a precondition, just like the demand to freeze it. The refusal to resume negotiations from the point where talks between the previous prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas left off after the Annapolis conference is no less a precondition than the demand to resume talks from square one.
The head referee, the president of the United States, has twisted the arms of his colleagues in the Quartet and is dragging Abbas to Washington. Barack Obama decided that the negotiations will be held without any commitment regarding building in East Jerusalem, and will be opened without even a declaration of principles stating that the talks will be held on the basis of a general formula, like peace and security for Israel and a state along the 1967 borders for the Palestinians. It's time to jump into the fountain in Rabin Square and cheer: The Palestinians have been shafted!
If Benjamin Netanyahu's aim is to play around as much as possible with the ball, and sometimes kick the opponent, then he can really chalk up another victory. But Israel's success in the negotiations, like the success of the student team in the tournament, is not measured by the terms "victory" or "defeat." What is victory over a weak Palestinian team worth, if it was won in friendly games that ended with virtually no interaction between the participants? What is a political process with the Palestinians worth if it erodes Abbas' standing and leads nowhere?
What have we to gain from humiliating our partner before his constituency on the way to the negotiating table? If Israel's approach on every one of the core issues is that winning is everything, there's no point in bothering so many VIPs with another unnecessary summit. Let's assume that we'll succeed, with the help of the Jewish power around Obama, to twist Abbas' arm some more and extract, for example, an agreement in which he concedes sovereignty over the Temple Mount. How many hours would such an agreement last?
All we need is a few more "victories" like the invitation to the launch of direct negotiations, "without preconditions," and we'll lose our last partners to a settlement that will prevent Israel from turning into an apartheid state or a Palestinian state  (the binational model is a nightmare, as far as I'm concerned).
What will we do if Abbas announces that he's had enough of losing in purportedly friendly games, and that he's decided the time has come to step down? Will we declare another victory and invite Hamas leader Khaled Meshal and Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the party?

<title>Zionists are not settlers. Zionists are not racists </title>
<date>Tue May 25 04:02:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 
Israel Harel unsheathed the doomsday weapon that the right wing reserves for use when it feels threatened, in his article "Zionists are not tattletales" on this page on May 20. When Israeli patriots stand up and seek to end the occupation, with or without an agreement, and to establish an exemplary society here, that is when the right attacks.
Their weapon used to be din rodef - the Talmudic "law of the pursuer," which permits the extrajudicial killing of someone who endangers a life. But that ended with a pistol shot in a city square, when a Jewish terrorist shot prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in the back.
So now it's din moser, which permits killing a Jew who intends to turn another Jew in to the gentile authorities. Thus we witness the right calling the left "shtinkerim," i.e. "informers."
The uproar broke out 10 days ago, when the National Left, Peace Now, the Ofek student association and other leftist Zionist groups held a rally. Instead of demonstrating in our own little area, Tel Aviv, we decided to gather in Zion Square, in downtown Jerusalem. We came wearing white shirts and waving Israeli flags and placards saying "Zionists, not settlers," and we sang "Hatikva." And we paid for everything from our own Zionist sources, without any help from foreign governments.
This infuriated Harel and his cohorts. The national flag and anthem have been the exclusive property of the right for years. That is why they won the elections.
But the right is not the "national camp"; it's the binational camp. The national camp is the left, which wants to get out of the territories. For though the left fears Qassam rockets, it is terrified by the fact that since 2008, there has been a Jewish minority between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea - and by the fact that if we do not leave the territories, Zionism will drown in a binational ocean and Ahmed Tibi will be prime minister.
Harel claims that Ofra is the equivalent of the prestate "tower and stockade" settlements, that today's settlements in the territories are a continuation of the pioneering enterprise of that time.
But when David Ben-Gurion and the Jews in Palestine encouraged settlement under the nose of the British, they were building Jewish sovereignty and creating a Jewish majority in places that the world had designated for a Jewish state. When Harel and his friends establish settlements, they are undermining the Jewish state's sovereignty and its internationally recognized borders, and aiding the Palestinians in perpetuating an Arab majority. And they are thereby fostering the declaration of a binational state.
Harel accuses us of "hatred." The founding manifesto of the National Left, he charges, is phrased in the language of excoriation. But Harel himself headed the Yesha Council of settlements back in the 1980s - when, in a politely worded resolution, it demanded that the territories be annexed, and that "the legal status of Jews who reside permanently in in Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] and Gaza be set as [making] them subject to Israeli law, courts and administration." In less-laundered language, like that of the above-mentioned manifesto, Harel and his council were demanding that we become an apartheid state. We refused, because that isn't Zionism.
Since that unfortunate resolution, that stain on the people of Zion, Israeli law has still not been applied to those Jews. But Harel and company still seek to impose a settler law code on the Arabs. For example, when a soldier removes a caravan from an illegal outpost, there is a "price tag": A mosque will be torched, or a Palestinian wheat field set alight. Harel, who tries to depict himself as a settler with a Jewish heart, doesn't hear of such things, or see them or smell them.
But when something is said about the settlers, he is quick to react: "Shtinkerim! Zionists are not tattletales!" And other similar sentiments, all in refined Hebrew.
We prefer to reply in our Rabinesque language: Zionists are not settlers. Zionists are not racists. Let the Zionists return to their own borders.

<title>A free nation in our land </title>
<date>Sun Jan 23 01:20:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Since 1967, Israel has effectively become two states: Israel within the Green Line, a democratic, multi-party state whose citizens enjoy freedom of speech and movement; and next to it, the Palestinian territories under military rule, where the exact opposite is the case. At first it seemed that this would be a temporary situation until a settlement of one sort or another was worked out. For that reason, the internal contradiction between the two kinds of authority wielded by Israel was not profoundly understood. The Oslo agreements only deepened the perception that the situation was temporary.
But a situation that persists for decades has its own internal logic. Add to that an expanding population of settlers - about a quarter of a million today - who live in the West Bank under Israeli civil law, and not military rule. Hence, a situation has been created under which two populations live in the same territory under two legal systems, with national affiliation the deciding factor. Not exactly apartheid, but certainly not equality before the law.
For decades it seemed to most Israelis, including those who support a withdrawal from the West Bank, that this is a tolerable situation - not exactly what we would like to see, but temporarily, certainly not the worst option. Increasingly, this appears to be an illusion, because what goes on in the occupied territories is now starting to seep into Israel proper. Many who during their military service got used to treating Palestinians as an occupation army treats the occupied, began to treat - at least mentally, if not in practice - Israeli Arabs in the same way. The tolerance shown by the authorities for the violence of some of the settlers against Palestinians shaped a worldview that became acceptable to many with regard to Israeli Arabs. Shady deals aimed at taking over land in the territories became a model for taking over Arab properties in East Jerusalem, supposedly an integral part of Israel. And there are plenty of other examples.
The Green Line has been blurred in such a way that the norms that exist in the reality of the occupied territories have became increasingly acceptable norms within Israel proper. It is clear that racist legislative initiatives in the Knesset, as well as despicable statements made by some rabbis, are fed by the atmosphere created by Israel's rule over the territories. McCarthyist proposals to investigate the funding sources of NGOs that criticize IDF actions in the territories are obviously connected to the simple fact of the ongoing occupation. Indeed, how true it is that he who represses another people ultimately loses his own freedom. It doesn't happen overnight, but gradually, bit by bit.
Perhaps the people of Yisrael Beiteinu do understand what ruling another people means for the future of Israel. But Netanyahu, who comes from a different background, should be aware of the consequences and object to them. For him, it seems, the challenges facing the Jewish state are perceived exclusively in narrow security terms: balance of power, firepower, deterrent capabilities and amassing territory. He has never uttered a word that might suggest he understands that the problem - a problem that had contributed in no small measure to the delegitimization of Israel - is not the control of territory, but ruling people against their will.
Not for the sake of the freedom of the Palestinians must Israel make every effort to reduce and minimize as much as possible its rule over another people - but for the sake of our own freedom. And this must be done even in the absence of negotiations.

<title>An Israeli process of reconciliation </title>
<date>Fri May 06 01:46:54 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
 The Palestinian factions have reached a power-sharing deal - albeit a fragile one. Regional developments helped, affecting the calculations of both Fatah and Hamas. The role of post-Mubarak Egypt and its emerging independent regional policy cannot be underestimated. Israel's current government, though, is key to the glue binding Fatah and Hamas together. While the peace process has long been moribund, the Netanyahu government's refusal to indulge in the make-believe of possible progress rendered obsolete even Fatah's well-honed capacity to suspend disbelief. 
 Yet if the deal is to last, the Palestinian factions will eventually have to address substance: their national goals and the strategies to be pursued in attaining them. A real political dialogue will force both Fatah and Hamas out of their respective comfort zones. Fatah will have to elaborate a post-negotiation and  (one imagines ) non-violent plan for freedom, and decide how such a plan co-exists or breaks with existing donor and international relations, including coordination with Israel. Hamas will have to confront the requirements of international law  (including abandoning the use of violence against civilians ), and ultimately resolve its own verbal acrobatics regarding a Palestinian state alongside Israel - if a serious deal becomes available. 
 Not surprisingly, unity is also popular in Israel. Israeli unity that is. Palestinian unity has been met with almost blanket condemnation at the political level. But in reacting to Palestinian developments, we Israelis should first of all be asking what the problem is that we need to address. For the Netanyahu government that major problem, apparently, is Israel's international image and the prospect of pressure being exerted on Israel to advance peace. In the community of nations, Israel's standing has further plummeted under the tutelage of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman. The intra-Palestinian deal therefore offers a delightful opportunity for Israel to register some big points on the "Who's to blame for no peace?" scorecard and to fend off any such pressure. 
 Israel's challenge, though, goes way beyond public relations. Israel's challenge is how to adapt, shape and secure its future in this region. 
 For that reason alone, we would benefit from our own national reconciliation dialogue, one focused on what Israel's aspirations and strategies should look like. 
 As tectonic plates shift around us, Israel is clinging to an illusion, namely that when and if the Palestinians are ready, Israel will be able and willing to deliver a dignified two-state solution. The truth is less comforting. Currently there is no political path to an Israeli governing majority that could deliver a mutually acceptable two-state outcome. And there is no status quo: Israel's predicament is deteriorating, not stable. It is time for Israel to engage in the exercise that Palestinians have begun, and to ask what it is that we really want for ourselves. 
 Such a conversation might go in a number of directions. 
 Perhaps, in an honest dialogue regarding our future, enough of a consensus could be reached to allow for the actual evacuation of at least 100,000 settlers, a withdrawal from the vast majority of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and agreement on a two-state border delineation  (with equal land swaps ), even as other outstanding issues and a full end to conflict are left to future state-to-state negotiations. 
 A second option could be to build on the above, taking it in a more challenging direction - that of a full truth and reconciliation process with the Palestinians, addressing all claims. That would necessitate a difficult preliminary phase of Israeli introspection - are we ready to come to terms with the Nakba, with sharing Jerusalem's holy sites, and with being a fully democratic state, including for our Palestinian citizens? 
 If significant settler evacuation has become a red line that is impossible for Israel's political realities to cross, and alongside that a two-state solution is still preferred, then a third set of possibilities come into play. Israelis might develop a sufficient consensus that, while being unwilling to uproot fellow citizens, we are still willing to cede sovereignty over the '67 Palestinian territories. One might then enter into a negotiation over the rights and responsibilities of former settlers as residents in Palestine and what Israel would offer in exchange for these arrangements. 
 Alternately, we could pursue the two-ethnic-states model to its logical conclusion and call for a border that would be a modern-day version of the 1947 partition plan - and probably closer to a 50-50, rather than a 78-22, divide on the percentage of territory. This would be an intellectually honest platform for Lieberman's party. 
 If Israel cannot remove settlers, cannot engage in a genuine truth and reconciliation process, cannot cede sovereignty on the '67 lines to the Palestinians, or ask the United Nations to re-partition Palestine, then we must be honest and translate the existing one-space reality into a political plan for a one-state democracy - whether on the basis of a federal system, a cantonal system, a binational democracy, or a still more creative formulation. Perhaps just having such a conversation will help generate a governing majority for the more conventional two-state outcome, perhaps not. The more we avoid this conversation, the more we endanger our future in this democratizing region, and the more we entrench a reality of apartheid-by-stealth. 
 It is doubtful that such a conversation can evolve without an external impetus. It took Egyptian intervention to revive a serious Palestinian national dialogue. Is it too much to suggest that our American ally, apparently politically unable to lead a solution, could at least help lead a conversation?

<title>Arab world is deposing rulers, Israel is blowing leaves</title>
<date>Thu Apr 28 01:46:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Sometimes I'd watch him, the leaf blower. Making a racket, raising clouds of dust but doing a wonderful job of cleaning our streets. Crouching along the sidewalks of the city, he would never get anything but barrages of curses from passersby. Yesterday his work ended. The new noise prevention regulations went into effect, and with them, the end of the leaf blower.
I loved them, but apparently most Israelis thought otherwise. The Environmental Protection Ministry declared this nothing less than a "revolution" - the leaf blower revolution. The Arab world is deposing rulers and we are deposing the leaf blower. Now they will inundate the streets with thousands of African sanitation workers, who will sweep our streets in a hush and clean up after us ever so quietly with their wretched brooms of twigs, these sub-contracted workers, who earn the very minimum of the minimum wage and do not receive any social benefits or health insurance. But what's important is that our rest is not disturbed and our tranquility is preserved, no matter the cost.
This is how we are, we Israelis. We love to eat our cake and have it, too. We love the artfully achieved natural "look." We want someone to clean up after us but without making noise; we want someone to sweep up after us in conditions of near enslavement and without making a sound. It's not Israeli raucousness, the persistent honking of car horns, and the music blaring out of these cars - all the work of our own hands - that disturbs us. What disturbs us is the leaf blower. It's not the sounds of the seething environment that disturbs us. Not the outcries of the oppressed among us, not the mutterings of the world that opposes us and not the moans of those under our occupation. These do not disturb our serenity. Only the leaf blower does.
This leaf blower is, indeed, a metaphor. There are many other leaf blowers and brooms out there that Israelis would want to "do their work" for them, to clear away the fallen leaves and the piled up garbage, but they better not disturb their tranquility.
The separation wall is a case in point. They are there and we are here (and also there ), but the main thing is that the Palestinians disappear from our sight - separation and sweeping without any noise. Every time the occupation has the gall to proclaim its existence and make a racket like a leaf blower, we hasten to issue regulations to muffle it and use violent means to silence it.
Like the cleanliness of our cities, we want the occupation to continue but without making noise. We want violent wars and brutal military operations but without a peep from the world in their wake. We want crude violations of human rights but without the clamor of criticism; to preach to the world to boycott Hamas but to be against international boycotts. We want democracy but without the background noises of the minority. We want to live in a near theocracy, one of the most religious countries in the world, and to imagine we are living in a secular and liberal democracy. We want to consider ourselves enlightened and to vote for Kadima - a rightist, nationalist party in every respect, only without the leaf-blowing racket of the undisguised right-wing nationalists.
We say that most of us are in favor of the two-state solution, but we vote for parties that will do nothing to advance it. We vehemently oppose a one-state solution but we live, in fact for decades, in an apartheid state. We favor free access and worship at Joseph's Tomb but not at Al Aqsa. We remember 1948 but without the Nakba. We oppose returning Palestinian property from before 1948 but we evict Palestinian inhabitants in Hebron and Sheikh Jarrah on the grounds that their homes were under Jewish ownership before 1948. We shoot passengers in Palestinian cars who refuse to stop at roadblocks, but when the Palestinian police do the same, we call it a "murderous terror attack." We call the Israeli army Defense Forces, while most of its work is occupation. We live without a civil society but believe that tying a yellow ribbon onto our car mirrors for Gilad Shalit is an act of protest. We support Shalit's release but oppose the release of 450 terrorists in exchange for him. And we sweep and sweep, but without making any noise.
I loved the leaf blower, but not only for his effectiveness: Sometimes it is, in fact, the silence that is rubbish. I, too, love quiet but not imaginary quiet, not quiet that sweeps things under the rug and deceives. If it is necessary to clean, let us do it with the necessary clamor, without disguising anything. Hence this desperate cry that stands no chance: Bring back the leaf blower.

<title>Before the lights go out </title>
<date>Mon Mar 21 02:27:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
 
On Wednesday, Meretz party chairman Haim Oron will retire from the Knesset. On Sunday, the central committee of the Labor Party will convene. The connection between these events is indirect, but it is there. The invitations sent to the delegates gives the agenda of the confab as follows: "1. Rescind the committee's decision of August 5, 2009, regarding the introduction of a new party constitution  (the Barak constitution ), and the reinstatement of the previous constitution, from January 1998."
The rest is irrelevant. Oron is gone, Labor is getting rid of Ehud Barak once and for all. No historians are needed. All that is required is to look at the list of those who have left - Oron, Shulamit Aloni, Yossi Sarid and Yossi Beilin from Meretz; Barak, Shimon Peres, Dalia Itzik, Haim Oron, Shalom Simhon, Matan Vilnai and Orit Noked from Labor - and to look at where they are now, and recall the reasons for and circumstances behind the fall of the left.
But in order to grasp the depth of the pit it fell into, we must also add Amram Mitzna, Avraham Shochat and Uzi Baram to the list. It's a bad story that is a jumble of ego, ego and ego, naivete, manipulation and aggression, all of which were never in short supply on the left.
In recent days, much ink has been spilled celebrating Oron. He, on the other hand, did not spare associates near and far from his sharp tongue during an interview in Haaretz Magazine  (Gidi Weitz, "No hard feelings," March 18 ): Oron spelled out, in great detail, why Barak "is the most dangerous person in Israel"  (Shochat said the same thing a few months ago ), Avigdor Lieberman "frightens" him and Shelly Yachimovich earned a remark on the limits of social democracy: "I don't know what kind of a social democrat is very sensitive to the poverty and suffering of his own people but is not equally sensitive to the poverty of someone who lives a mile away, in the occupied territories."
Today, three days after publication, the response from a Barak spokesman that accompanied the article reads very badly  (and not only in the communities bordering the Gaza Strip ): "The facts are that during Ehud Barak's tenure as defense minister, Israel has enjoyed quiet such as has not existed for many years ... " Another part of this response, as well as Yachimovich's full response, deserve their own column in order to examine their extraordinary arrogance and condescension  (Yachimovich, in the Hebrew version: "Haim Oron is considered an impressive individual, but to our regret ... " ).
The vote-getting talents of the successors to Barak and Oron are still an unknown quantity. What is known is that the left has been sliding down a slippery slope for 15 years. If it persists in whining about the damage wreaked by Barak and to babble on about what's more important, an apartheid state or social democracy, and does not transform the party institutions and with them its Knesset candidates, any possibility for the formation of a legislative bloc large enough to block the right - in other words, to redraw the political map - will be lost.
Oron, contrary to what some people say, was not Meretz's gravedigger. Yachimovich alone cannot save Labor. Oron was too weak to lead his movement to the creation of a new movement. His colleagues shot him in the foot, and he, with characteristic quiet, didn't provide cover for his other foot. His supporters outside the party were no big help, either.
The distance between expressing political support at a public event and closing a thriving law practice, resigning from a board of directors or taking a leave of absence from academia in order to run for election, was and remains great. If it cannot be bridged this time around, the left will disappear. Shochat and Oron continue, each in his own way, in what could be a last attempt to foment such a change. If it fails, well-meaning, enlightened leftists with justice on their side will be able to tell their children and their grandchildren where they were and what they were doing when Israel's lights went out.

<title>Deconstructing some pet theories </title>
<date>Fri Dec 02 03:50:48 IST 2011</date>
<content>
 Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken's essay in last Friday's paper  ("The necessary elimination of democracy," November 25 ) represents a contrived attempt to shoehorn current events to fit pet theories long endorsed by the Israeli left. 
 The left has consistently argued that if the settlement project over the Green Line was maintained, its baleful influence would eventually seep back within the Green Line and contaminate Israeli democracy. As the Israeli government per Schocken is merely the cat's paw of Gush Emunim, the settler movement, it has endorsed the current legislative campaign and its three major thrusts: preventing foreign meddling via politicized NGOs; restoring the Supreme Court to the relative judicial restraint that characterized it before the Likud took power in 1977; and redressing the balance between the press and the victims of press libel. 
 Having taken the thoroughbred endangered democracy hobby horse for a canter, Schocken also trots out two venerable nags: the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, which he says abruptly terminated a process that would have extricated Israel from its descent into dictatorship and apartheid; and, the fact that Israel paid for abandoning the "Rabin legacy" by sustaining aggravated isolation and helplessness when confronting the Iranian nuclear program. 
 Schocken's major thrust recalls the old joke about the Jew who voraciously consumed the anti-Semitic press. When pressed to explain his perverse delight, the Jew replied that he enjoyed discovering that Jews wielded such power. The settlement movement can similarly only dream of the power Amos Schocken attributes to it. 
 Had Schocken made this argument in 1980 rather than 2011, he would have still have been wrong but less wildly implausible. Then, the settlement movement was at its zenith, after Menachem Begin's ascent to power in 1977 and his festive promise of many Elon Morehs  (the flagship settlement nucleus of the long-deceased Gush Emunim that Schocken resurrects from the dead in his opinion piece ). In their period of peak power, both the Begin government and Gush Emunim acquiesced to the Supreme Court, which then enjoyed a better reputation for impartiality, in its ruling on the 1979 Elon Moreh case, in which it mandated the evacuation of a settlement built on private land without convincing security justification. 
 Ever since, the settlement movement has been in retreat, rather than steadily accumulating power, as Schocken argues. Jewish communities are now confined to the "pale of settlement" carved out in the 1980s, and building has effectively been frozen by the Netanyahu government to the extent that an announcement of construction in Efrat  (deep in the consensus settlement blocs ) or even Jerusalem arouses attention. Conversely, Arab construction continues without any restrictions, with the new Palestinian city of Rawabi providing convincing testimony. 
 If apartheid roads do exist in Judea and Samaria, it is Jewish travel they effectively bar, sometimes onerously extending a commute to work or school. The major arteries that serve Jews are open to Palestinian traffic. We experienced in 2005 a disengagement/expulsion that razed the Jewish communities of Gaza and northern Samaria. A further installment was in the offing under Ehud Olmert, who announced in the midst of the Lebanon campaign the following year that the war's success would further accelerate the expulsions of Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria. It was only the failure of the Second Lebanon War that discredited Olmert sufficiently to thwart the plan. 
 Paradoxically, it was the same Olmert government, whose policy on settlements was largely congruent with Amos Schocken's, that sought to reclaim spheres of authority usurped by an activist court. The point man for this policy was then-Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann, a law professor whose political home was Meretz. Friedmann could in no way be depicted as an ally or tool of the settlers. He simply felt the need to restore the balance between the various branches of government. 
 It is incredible that anyone can still claim that Rabin's assassination thwarted Oslo, rather than providing it with a new lease on life. Rabin, who bribed two Knesset members to cross the aisle and pass Oslo B  (a ploy which, since it advanced a cause favored by the left, could not be considered a threat to democracy ), was sinking in the polls like a stone following the suicide-bombing offensive. He would have lost badly in an election, or he may have gone the route of Generals Moshe Ya'alon and Uzi Dayan, who originally supported Oslo but ultimately became critics of it. 
 Rabin's assassination ushered in a period of intellectual terror sponsored by the same people who currently bewail the purported threat to democracy. It provided a spurious "Rabin legacy" to enshrine and radicalize Oslo that was as manipulative and fraudulent as Stalin's recruitment campaign following the death of Lenin. 
 Equally fantastic is Schocken's argument that by sacrificing the settlements, Israel would have secured greater international support against Iran. Actually, Olmert peddled this grand bargain at Annapolis and received in return the U.S. National Intelligence Assessment downplaying the Iranian nuclear program. Europe was not about to abandon its critical and lucrative dialogue with Iran before it had become an obvious farce in the previous decade; the Obama administration - irrespective of settlements - would still have wasted years on engaging Iran, while China and Russia have remained wedded to a policy prioritizing energy security, trade and twisting Washington's tail over curbing the centrifuges. 
 The ideological gulf between my viewpoint and Amos Schocken's is wide, but what makes it more tragic is that it no longer centers on different conclusions one draws from the facts but on the facts themselves.

<title>Ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, or, democratic Israel at work</title>
<date>Thu May 12 02:04:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
It happened on the day after Independence Day, when Israel was immersed in praise of itself and its democracy almost ad nauseam, and on the eve of (virtually outlawed ) Nakba Day, when the Palestinian people mark the "catastrophe" - the anniversary of the creation of Israel. My colleague Akiva Eldar published what we have always known but for which we lacked the shocking figures he revealed: By the time of the Oslo Accords, Israel had revoked the residency of 140,000 Palestinians from the West Bank. In other words, 14 percent of West Bank residents who dared to go abroad had their right to return to Israel and live here denied forever. In other words, they were expelled from their land and their homes. In other words: ethnic cleansing.
While we are still desperately concealing, denying and repressing our major ethnic cleansing of 1948 - over 600,000 refugees, some who fled for fear of the Israel Defense Forces and its predecessors, some who were expelled by force - it turns out that 1948 never ended, that its spirit is still with us. Also with us is the goal of trying to cleanse this land of its Arab inhabitants as much as possible, and even a bit more. After all, that's the most covert and desired solution: the Land of Israel for the Jews, for them alone. A few people dared to say it outright - Rabbi Meir Kahane, Minister Rehavam Ze'evi and their disciples, who deserve a certain amount of praise for their integrity. Many aspire to do the same thing without admitting it.
The revelation of the policy of denying residency has proved that this secret dream is in effect the establishment's secret dream. There one doesn't talk about transfer, heaven forfend; nobody would think of calling it cleansing. They don't load Arabs onto trucks as they once did, including after the Six-Day War, and they don't shoot at them to chase them away - all politically incorrect methods in the new world. But in effect that's the goal.
Some people think it's enough if we make the lives of the Palestinians in the territories miserable to get them to leave, and many have in fact left. An Israeli success: According to the Civil Administration, about a quarter of a million Palestinians voluntarily left the West Bank in the bloody years 2000-2007. But that's not enough, so various and sundry administrative means were added to make the dream come true.
Anyone who says "it's not apartheid" is invited to reply: Why is an Israeli allowed to leave his country for the rest of his life, and nobody suggests that his citizenship be revoked, while a Palestinian, a native son, is not allowed to do so? Why is an Israeli allowed to marry a foreigner and receive a residency permit for her, while a Palestinian is not allowed to marry his former neighbor who lives in Jordan? Isn't that apartheid? Over the years I have documented endless pitiful tragedies of families that were torn apart, whose sons and daughters were not permitted to live in the West Bank or Gaza due to draconian rules - for Palestinians only.
Take Dalal Rasras, for example, a toddler with cerebral palsy from Beit Omar, who was recently separated from her mother for months only because her mother was born in Rafah. Only after her case was publicized did Israel let the mother return to her daughter "beyond the letter of the law" - the cruel letter of the law that does not permit residents of Gaza to live in the West Bank, even if they have made their homes there.
The cry of the dispossessed has now been translated into numbers: 140,000, only until the Oslo Accords. Students who went to study at foreign universities, businessmen who tried their luck abroad, scientists who went abroad for professional training, native Jerusalemites who dared to move to the West Bank temporarily - they all met the same fate. All of them were taken by the wind and expelled by Israel. They couldn't return.
Most amazing of all is the reaction of those responsible for the policy of ethnic cleansing. They didn't know. Maj. Gen. (res. ) Danny Rothschild, formerly the chief military governor with the euphemistic title "coordinator of government activities in the territories," said he heard about the procedure for the first time from Haaretz. It turns out that not only is the cleansing continuing, so is the denial. Every Palestinian child knows, and only the general doesn't. Even today there are still 130,000 Palestinians registered as "NLR," a heartwarming IDF acronym for "no longer a resident," as though voluntarily, another euphemism for "expelled." And the general who is considered relatively enlightened was unaware.
This is an absolute refusal to allow the return of the refugees - something that would "destroy the State of Israel." It's also an absolute refusal to allow the return of the people recently expelled. By next Independence Day we'll probably invent more expulsion regulations, and on the next holiday we'll talk about "the only democracy."

<title>Goldstone regrets</title>
<date>Mon Apr 04 00:42:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Retired Judge Richard Goldstone chaired a three-person fact-finding mission to investigate charges of war crimes on the part of Israel and Hamas during Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip two-and-a-half years ago. The commission disbanded after the report was submitted, and there is no procedure in place for revoking or revising it. Neither have its other members made their voices heard. As in other cases involving "water under the bridge," there is little weight given to regrets after time has elapsed or circumstances have changed.
Given these reservations, and in the spirit of the current tides sweeping the region, (in Libya, for example ), Goldstone's comments in The Washington Post should be taken for what they are worth. Goldstone was invited to chair the committee because of his standing as a jurist in South Africa, which moved from an apartheid regime to democracy (with all the problems that entails ), and because of his Jewish roots and basic sympathy for the State of Israel. The "Goldstone commission" and "Goldstone report" are brands associated with his name.
The dispute surrounding the report, published in September 2009, was concerned less with the facts on the ground and more with the significance attached to them. There was a bit of debate about the definition of "civilians" - for example, did it include Hamas people who earned their living as police in the daytime and were active in the terror attack system after work? But the main dispute was over the question of why civilians were being harmed: Was it a matter of intentional policy, an overriding order that was translated into implementation? Or were these exceptional cases, mostly unintentional, and had the minority of cases that turned out to be intentional properly addressed in legal or disciplinary forums?
The government of Israel and the Israel Defense Forces General Staff adhered from the outset, and rightly so, to the narrative of exceptions and investigations. The Goldstone report seemed to adopt as its working assumption, however, that these incidents were the outcome of policy - a view reinforced by rash declarations by government ministers. Also contributing to this interpretation was Israel's refusal to cooperate with the work of the fact-finding mission, lest this be taken as an endorsement.
Israel does not need a comparison with Hamas, whose members launch rockets at civilian sites in order to exculpate themselves. Its internal, moral obligation - and not just for reasons of international utility - is to do everything in its power to avoid harming the innocent. A certain amount of regret on Goldstone's part must not cause Israel to regret the limitations it has imposed on its army.

<title>Gov't protects the people, not the other way around</title>
<date>Fri Jan 14 02:35:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
The campaign of intimidation being waged by the right against left-wing organizations - which ranges from arbitrarily arresting activists and throwing them in prison, as in the case of Jonathan Pollak, to establishing parliamentary committees of inquiry - has one clear objective: to identify opposition to the government and its policies with rejecting the legitimacy of the state. The right is trying with all its might to inculcate the public consciousness with the idea that the government is the state and the government's interests are identical to the aims of Zionism.
It is a national duty to denounce this crude lie, both in Israel and abroad. It is a national duty to recite and teach that not every Knesset decision is legitimate. In a democracy, restrictions must be imposed on legislation, because the purpose of a liberal democratic regime is to protect human and civil rights and ensure equality.
When the legislature ignores these basic duties, it undermines the very reason for democracy's existence. Since the 17th century, liberal thought has recognized the right to oppose a government that infringes on fundamental rights, and this is a basic tenet of any free regime.
Similarly, it is a duty to resist legislation that would prevent non-Jewish Israeli citizens from living in Jewish communities. Now the old slogan "Yesha ze kan" [the West Bank and Gaza are here] is coming true: The settlements are taking over Israel. After all, for a regime of ethnic and religious separation to be established within the Green Line would be just a natural continuation of the apartheid regime that has been in effect in the territories for more than 40 years. Once that happens, it will be a mockery to continue to speak of Israeli democracy in the present tense.
Therefore, those who collaborate with this creeping Lieberman-ism, whether actively or passively, will bear responsibility for the real delegitimization of Israel worldwide. And we should not be surprised, or complain of anti-Semitism, when the European Parliament proposes drastic changes in Europe's relations with Israel. In these difficult times, it is only the human rights organizations that are saving Israel's honor.
One immediate conclusion is that when a parliamentary committee of inquiry whose only purpose is to intimidate the left is set up, it would be best to ignore its existence and refuse to appear before it. This committee has neither the moral nor the legal authority to force any citizen to attend its sessions.
If the committee wants to keep up an appearance of objectivity, it will have to open probes into all foreign sources of funding for all Israeli political bodies, including the sources that fund the Likud and Yisrael Beiteinu election campaigns. An investigation of left-wing bodies only, due to both its discriminatory, violent nature and the cheap demagoguery that will accompany it, does not deserve any kind of attention.
Finally, since there has been a great deal of talk recently about the analogy to McCarthyism, it is worth stressing that the situation here is worse than it was in the United States in the 1950s. On one hand, the Israeli Supreme Court lacks an entrenched constitutional status and contempt for it is only growing, while in the United States, it was the Supreme Court that eventually put a stop to this phenomenon. On the other hand, unlike McCarthy, Avigdor Lieberman is one of the pillars of the government, and McCarthyism has gained control of the political establishment itself.
Just as was true in Europe in the past, Lieberman-ism will most likely gradually destroy the last vestiges of the liberal right. And Israeli society will pay a heavy price for a political elite that has lost its way.

<title>Heading toward an Israeli apartheid state</title>
<date>Mon Apr 04 00:42:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
It has been 60 years since the apartheid state was established in South Africa. In March 1951, a few years after the racist National Party came to power, racial segregation was anchored in law. As was common in other countries that adopted racist laws in the 20th century, those in South Africa were accompanied by "laundered" explanations.
Hitler declared after the Nuremberg Race Laws were passed in 1935 that they would create a suitable basis for a separate but worthy existence for Jews in Germany alongside German society. The race laws in South Africa established that people of different colors cannot exist when mixed with each other - only in separate, protected spaces.
The tsunami of racist laws passed by the Knesset in recent months is also being explained by reasoned and worthy arguments: the right of small communities to preserve their own character (the Acceptance Committees Law ); the state's right to prevent hostile use of the funds it allocates to education and culture (the Nakba Law ); and the right to deny citizenship to persons convicted of espionage or treason (the Citizenship Law ). But I believe that as in other historical instances, the aim of this legislation is the gradual establishment of an apartheid state in Israel, and the future separation on a racial basis of Jews and non-Jews.
An apartheid state is not created in the blink of an eye. What was created in Germany in 1935 was the outcome of a long and sometimes violent debate, which had been ongoing since the middle of the 19th century, about the place of Jews in modern Germany and Europe. Indeed, the desire to isolate and distance the Jews from society - legally and socially - was part of the belief system of anti-Semites in Europe for decades before Hitler came into power.
In this respect the Nazi regime, along with other regimes that passed racial separation laws (among them those in Romania, Hungary, Italy and Vichy France in 1940 ), only anchored in legislation a reality that had already been enthusiastically received by the populace. Of course, when such laws were enacted, the regimes involved did not support or imagine that at the end of the road, a "final solution" was waiting in its Nazi format. However, once the seeds were sown, no one was able to figure out what fruit they would bear.
The historical background of the Israeli apartheid state-in-the-making that is emerging before our eyes should be sought in 1967. It is part of a process that has been going on for about 44 years: What started as rule over another people has gradually ripened - especially since the latter part of the 1970s - into a colonialism that is nurturing a regime of oppression and discrimination with regard to the Palestinian population. It is robbing that population of its land and of its basic civil rights, and is encouraging a minority group (the settlers ) to develop a crude, violent attitude toward the Arabs in the territories. This was exactly the reality that, after many years, led to the establishment of the apartheid state in South Africa.
In her book "The Origins of Totalitarianism," Hannah Arendt draws a sharp picture of the process of the development of the society of racial segregation in South Africa, from the start of the Dutch Boer colonialist settlement there. Assumption of racial superiority - the subordination of the black population - was the only way the "whites" could adjust to life in the midst of that race. The nurturance of feelings of racial supremacy, to which were added the belief in cultural superiority and the justification for economic exploitation - these are what, in a decades-long process, gave rise to the need to anchor this situation in proper legislation.
Thus, the dehumanization of the blacks, who at the start of the colonization period were perceived as no more than enhanced work animals, led to the establishment of a regime of racial separation 60 years ago in South Africa, which for decades left tens of millions of black people mired in a situation of harsh poverty, exploitation and atrophy.
It is not hard to identify this sort of worldview developing - with respect to Arabs - among widening circles of settlers in the territories and among their supporters within the (pre-Six Day War ) Green Line. It also has quite a number of supporters in the Knesset, even if they will not admit this outright.
Israeli racism, whose natural "hothouse" is the colonialist project in the territories, has long since spilled over into Israeli society and has been legitimized in the series of laws recently passed in the Knesset. Only people who avoid looking at the broad historical context of such a process are still able to believe it is possible to stop the emergence of an Israeli apartheid state without getting rid of the colonialist-racist grip on the territories.

<title>In dealing with flotilla, Israel is anything but smart</title>
<date>Thu Jul 07 03:16:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
CRETE - Like an anti-Semitic caricature, Israel has extended its long tentacles around the globe in an effort to stop 10 decades-old ships from sailing to Gaza. Many Israelis interpreted this as a great victory.
The story could be read as follows: The Greek government wanted to save people whom it surely views as eccentrics and professional trouble-makers, even if naive, from a traumatic and perhaps even fatal experience. The Greek foreign minister rejected claims that Israeli pressure led his government to ban the flotilla's departure. He explained that Greece wanted to prevent a "humanitarian disaster" in the event of a clash between the Israel Defense Forces and the protesters.
Indeed, a Greek police officer - one of those who tried  (in vain ) to discover from passengers on the Tahrir who was piloting their ship - did not beat around the bush. We wanted to save you from the Israeli army, he told one of them. The Jew of the blood libel, of whom one must be wary, has been replaced by an Israeli navy commando.
In anti-Semitic caricatures, the cunning Jew is doomed to lose and his control over the world is fated to come to an end. But Israel's government is revising the caricature and sketching a glorious victory. A war of attrition, in the form of mysterious breakdowns and unprecedented red tape by the Greek authorities, thwarted the flotilla's original plan to anchor off the Gaza coast. When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu openly thanked the Greek government, he knew full well what he was thanking it for.
We must now await future media leaks to know what exactly Greece received in exchange, other than closer military ties. Perhaps money, to complete the caricature?
This is a convenient time to be using pressure tactics. Greece's socialist government is in a fragile situation, as the European Union and the International Monetary Fund are forcing the country to adopt an austerity plan that most of its people oppose. True, the fact that Greece has become a subcontractor of the Israeli army did not bring the masses into the streets, but there is no doubt about it: The sympathy of the Greek soldiers who arrested the Tahrir's passengers and of the bureaucrats who delayed them was with the flotilla and with Gaza, not with their government's orders. That's all we need: another country whose government gets along well with Israel in complete opposition to popular sentiment.
The flotilla's organizers added a term from the world of business and globalization to their description of Israel's domination of the Palestinians. Israel, they said, was outsourcing the industry of the blockade on Gaza. In exchange for reward, a foreign government - Greece - took on an active role and adopted a deliberate policy of keeping the Gaza Strip one huge prison.
Logic dictates that a government whose policy validates anti-Semitic stereotypes ought to worry Israelis and Jews worldwide. But the Israeli government is doing what its voters want and believe in. For there is one stereotype that has not been recycled here: that of the wise Jew.
Outsourcing, aggressive and vocal diplomacy and ridiculous lies thwarted the flotilla, but they have not taken Gaza off the international agenda. If Israel - which knew full well that there was not one gram of explosives aboard the ships - had let them sail to Gaza, the flotilla would not have preoccupied the international media as it did.
Blocking the flotilla did not discourage the organizers, who are graduates of the anti-apartheid and anti-white supremacy struggles. Rather, it provided ample proof of how white Israel is. As a result, blocking the flotilla only increased their motivation to keep placing the Palestinians' demand for freedom at the forefront of the international agenda.

<title>In lieu of a holiday interview </title>
<date>Wed Apr 20 01:01:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for agreeing to answer our questions, despite your tendency to avoid interviews with the print media. We'll open, of course, with the diplomatic situation.
"Our political situation is excellent. The wave of revolutions in Arab countries and the expected collapse of those regimes still standing show the West that Israel is its only dependable ally in the Middle East."
The situation is excellent? The defense minister has warned of an approaching "diplomatic tsunami" in September and that Israel will be denounced and ostracized as an apartheid state - and you think everything is fine?
"We have disagreements with our friends in the West over the settlements in Judea and Samaria, but that is nothing new and it is not expected to change. What has changed is the strategic situation in the region. Iran is growing stronger and the moderate regimes have disappeared. We've seen the poor job the NATO forces are doing in Libya. They don't have enough strength or determination to fight even a legitimate target like Muammar Gadhafi. The only power protecting Western interests in the Middle East and preventing the region from falling to Iran is the Israel Defense Forces."
Next month you will address the U.S. Congress. What do you plan to say?
"Exactly what I have just told you: That America has no better partner and ally than Israel, and that the current situation in the Middle East proves this."
What partnership? Everybody knows that President Barack Obama can't stand you, and sees you as responsible for the diplomatic freeze - which makes his Nobel Peace Prize look like a joke.
"Politics is comprised of interests, not love. Churchill and Roosevelt couldn't stand each other, but together they defeated Hitler. Beyond Israel's strategic importance, Obama also has domestic considerations. He's running for reelection, and Israel enjoys great sympathy among the American public. Why would he irritate his voters and supporters?
"I don't know what Obama thinks of me deep down, but his practical policy supports us. He vetoed the condemnation of the settlements in the United Nations; he postponed the meeting of the Quartet that was to have moved a forced solution forward. Before the Passover seder, he called to wish me a happy holiday; we talked about our cooperation in the war against terror and the success of Iron Dome. I'm sure our relationship will only continue in this way."
Why will you speak in English on Capitol Hill and not in Hebrew?
"Because the public at home accepts my evaluation of the situation - that we do not now have a Palestinian partner for an agreement, and that with the region in flames, we must not take any chances. We have to keep the Palestinian Authority under our control in Judea and Samaria, continue with controlled settlement construction and deter Hamas in Gaza, while keeping open the option to attack Iran during the summer."
But even if you persuade Congress, and Obama offers his support, you'll still have a serious problem in Europe. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel don't believe you, and British Prime Minister David Cameron is ignoring you.
"That's why I'm looking for a nice fat bone to throw to the Europeans so they won't support the declaration of a Palestinian state in September; a package of steps on the ground, maybe even a withdrawal from a few hilltops, just so they'll calm down."
Did I hear you correctly? Withdrawal? Would Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman let you withdraw - and not use the situation as an opportunity to bring you down and take over as the leader of the right wing?
"What right wing? Lieberman is scared of going to jail and he's trying to kowtow to the prosecution and the leftist media. He only just heard about the indictment against him, and he's already proposed formulating a final status agreement with Tzipi Livni, who supports withdrawal from almost every inch of the territories. He lashes out at me sometimes, but he doesn't really have anywhere else to go. He will support whatever decisions I make."
And finally, we must ask you about your trips with your wife Sara to fine hotels and castles, traveling abroad via private jets. Looking back, don't you think you overdid it a bit with the minibars, the spas and the laundry service?
Netanyahu unwraps a cigar and smiles. "Nu, I got out of that nicely, didn't I? The comptroller is investigating everyone's trips, [journalist] Raviv Drucker is busy defending himself against my libel suit, and now everybody's preoccupied with Lieberman's indictment."
Thank you very much and enjoy your Passover holiday.
"The same to you and your readers - and don't forget to grab a copy of the booklet 'Talking Facts,' which I wrote about the government's achievements."

<title>Israel has become a society of force and violence</title>
<date>Thu Jun 30 01:46:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Are we listening to ourselves? Are we still aware of the awful noise coming from here? Have we noticed how the discourse is becoming more and more violent and how the language of force has just about become Israel's only official language?
A group of international activists is slated to sail a flotilla to the shores of the Gaza Strip. Many of them are social activists and fighters for peace and justice, veterans of the struggle against apartheid, colonialism, imperialism, pointless wars and injustice. Just stating that is difficult here, since they have already been described as thugs.
There are intellectuals, Holocaust survivors and people of conscience among them. When they fought against apartheid in South Africa or the war in Vietnam, they won admiration for their actions even here. But to say an admiring word now about these people, some of whom are elderly, who are risking their lives and investing their money and time for a goal they see as just, is considered treason. It's possible that some violent people have intermingled with them, but the vast majority are people of peace, not haters of Israel but those who hate its injustices. They have decided not to remain silent - to challenge the existing order, which is unacceptable to them, which cannot be acceptable to any moral person.
Yes, they want to create a provocation - the only way to remind the world about Gaza's situation, in which no one takes an interest unless Qassam rockets or flotillas are involved. Yes, the situation in Gaza has improved in recent months, in part because of the previous flotilla. But no, Gaza is still not free - far from it. It has no outlet to the sea or air, there are no exports, and its inhabitants are still partially imprisoned. Israelis who freak out if Ben-Gurion International Airport shuts down for two hours should be able to understand what life without a port is like. Gaza is entitled to its freedom, and those aboard the flotilla are entitled to take action in an effort to achieve this. Israel should be allowing them to demonstrate.
But look at how Israel is reacting. The flotilla was described immediately, by everyone, as a security threat; its activists were classified as enemies, and there was no doubt cast on the ridiculous assumptions that defense officials are making and the press has lapped up eagerly. We haven't heard the last of the campaign to demonize the previous flotilla, in which Turkish citizens were killed for no reason, yet the new campaign has already begun. It has all the buzzwords: danger, chemical substances, hand-to-hand combat, Muslims, Turks, Arabs, terrorists and maybe some suicide bombers. Blood and fire and pillars of smoke!
The unavoidable conclusion is that there is only one way to act against the passengers aboard the flotilla: by force, and only by force, as with every security threat. This is a recurring pattern: first demonization, then legitimization (to act violently ). Remember the tall tales about sophisticated Iranian weaponry coming through arms-smuggling tunnels in Gaza, or those about how the Strip was booby-trapped? Then Operation Cast Lead came along and the soldiers hardly encountered anything like that.
The attitude toward the flotilla is a continuation of the same behavior. The campaign of scare tactics and demonization is what contributes to the violent rhetoric that is taking over the entire public discourse. For what will Israelis think about when they are spoon-fed scary stories about the flotilla, if not about the use of force? Those activists want to kill Israel Defense Forces soldiers? We'll arise and kill them first.
Now the politicians, the generals and the commentators are competing with one another over who can provide the most frightening description of the flotilla, who can most inflame the public, who can best praise the soldiers who will save us, and who can deliver the most pompous rhetoric of the kind one would expect before a war. One important commentator, Dan Margalit, has already waxed poetic in his newspaper column: "Blessed are the hands," he wrote of the hands that sabotaged one of the ships meant to take part in the flotilla. That's another thuggish and illegal action, one that wins immediate applause here, without anyone asking: By what right?
This flotilla, too, will not get through. The prime minister and the defense minister have promised us this. Once again Israel will show them, those activists, who's more of a man - who's strongest and who's in charge, in the air, on land and at sea. The "lessons" of the previous flotilla have been learned well - not the lessons of the pointless killing or the violent and unnecessary takeover of the ship, but of the humiliation of Israel's military.
But the truth is the real humiliation lies in the fact that naval commandos were deployed to intercept the ships in the first place, and that is something that reflects on us all: how we have become a society whose language is violence, a country that seeks to resolve nearly everything by force, and only by force.

<title>Israel has to choose: Mideast peace or apartheid </title>
<date>Fri May 13 03:22:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Having all Palestinian political factions come together for national reconciliation was an emotional experience for all Palestinians who witnessed the events taking place in Cairo. The Arab Spring has finally reached Palestine. The left, the religious right, and the nationalist camp − across the Palestinian political spectrum − with the support of the new Egyptian government, reached an agreement to establish a technocratic administration in order to hold elections within one year and rebuild the Gaza Strip. This is a critical step in our path toward freedom and independence.
This ceremony was a representation of the will of our people. After the reconciliation ceremony, a young boy from Gaza was reported to have said, “I call on Fatah, Hamas and the rest of the factions to march hand in hand toward independence, to open and build our country.” From the mouths of babes come the most simple and powerful sentiments. In this case, that sentiment represents those of Palestinians everywhere, from Chile to Lebanon.
As President Mahmoud Abbas said in Cairo, with the establishment of a government of national unity, we will have closed one of the darkest periods in the history of our people.
Palestinians are looking forward now. We will continue to work hard on gaining international recognition for the State of Palestine in the 1967 border with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Today, we have received such recognition from 112 countries. The latest vote in the UN Security Council calling for an end to settlement expansion ‏(14 countries voting in favor and the United States against‏) shows unprecedented support for the Palestinian position: The Israeli occupation of Palestinian land must end.
Under the leadership of President Abbas, we are concluding the process of building Palestinian institutional capacities. According to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations and the European Union, Palestine has reached a point where it is ready to take the reins of state. Only the Israeli occupation stands in the way of our progress.
In September 2011, a united Palestinian people will go to the United Nations to request that the State of Palestine be admitted as a full member of the UN. It is time for Israel to stop denying freedom to the Palestinian people. We deserve to live free just like all other peoples in the world. Our message is very simple: The Palestinian people will not remain hostage to Israeli intransigence and unilateralism; settler violence and expansion are not going to stop us.
National reconciliation will also re-energize and empower our nonviolent struggle for justice and peace. We have been inspired by the determination shown weekly by young Palestinians and Israelis, Europeans and Americans, demonstrating together every Friday against the Israeli occupation policies in dozens of places, from Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan to Bil’in and Nabi Saleh.
So as we continue our efforts at uniting our people and building our state, we call on Israel not to interfere in domestic Palestinian politics. Israelis are free to elect whomever they choose to represent them, whether they be from the peace or the anti-peace camp. We have respected their choice by negotiating with every single Israeli government since 1991, including with the current Israeli coalition government, not a single member of which recognizes Palestinian national rights.
The choice is not between Hamas and Israel, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested. The choice is between settlement-colonies or states: between accepting two states with the 1967 border outlining the shape of the future for Israelis and Palestinians where real peace is possible, or maintaining an apartheid regime that will define our relationship with Israelis as one of oppressor and oppressed. We have clearly made our choice; we are waiting for Israel to do the same.
Only days before our national reconciliation, Prime Minister Netanyahu complained to the international community regarding the lack of a unified Palestinian government. He asked, “Shall I make peace with Gaza or with the West Bank?” To Netanyahu we can now reply, “You shall make peace with the State of Palestine.” Netanyahu may persist to find excuses why he will not negotiate in good faith with us, and we will persist to take our case to the United Nations.
Gaza is not to be regained by bullets but by the ballot box. The way to peace is through reconciliation and democracy. I hope that Israelis and the international community will stand shoulder to shoulder with us in order to support peace and reconciliation between Palestinians and Israelis by ending the Israeli occupation and consolidating a sovereign Palestinian state in the 1967 border.
The writer is the chief Palestinian negotiator.

<title>Israeli courts must end anti-Arab discrimination</title>
<date>Wed Aug 03 02:42:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Israeli courts discriminate against Israeli Arabs. If there had been any doubt left about this, a comprehensive, first-of-its-kind study commissioned by Israel's Courts Administration and the Israel Bar Association just determined it decisively.
According to the study, whose main findings were reported by Tomer Zarchin in yesterday's Haaretz, Arabs are given jail sentences more often than Jews convicted of the same offenses, and Arabs receive longer sentences than Jews who are jailed. The study's authors conclude that their most conspicuous finding is the tendency of Israeli courts to treat Arab defendants more harshly: When Arabs wind up in court, they are more likely to be convicted; when convicted, they are likely to receive a stiffer sentence than a Jew normally would. It's hard to imagine a more disturbing fact.
This is no longer just a matter of discrimination on the basis of national identity by small communities' admissions committees or by bouncers at nightclubs. This isn't just a matter of budgetary discrimination. This worrisome paroxysm has already reached its pinnacle: the court system itself, which is supposed to serve as society's beacon of law and justice.
The Courts Administration and the Bar Association did well to commission the study. But now, it is incumbent upon the court system to eradicate this plague of systematic discrimination.
Israel's judges dwell among their people, but they must not allow themselves to become infected by the racist mood that is spreading through Israeli society. On the contrary, the court system must battle against this morally reprehensible attitude.
Arab citizens must have equal rights in every regard - but first and foremost when dealing with the law enforcement system. They must know they will never face discriminatory sentencing because of their national identity. This essential condition, however, is not currently being met.
Every level of the court system, from the Supreme Court down, must designate this as one of its most pressing and important missions - to grant equal treatment to all who appear before it. Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch must send an urgent and unequivocal message to every judge in Israel: Sentencing discrimination against Arabs must end. Racism? Not in the courts.
Because otherwise, those who accuse Israel of maintaining an apartheid regime will be justified with regard to Israel's own Arab citizens.

<title>Israeli policy will end up isolating it to the point of sanctions</title>

<content>
In an op-ed piece in yesterday's New York Times, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas wrote that the Palestinian initiative to obtain international recognition for an independent state along the 1967 borders is not a stunt.
Approaching the United Nations, he wrote, was aimed at assuring the basic right of the Palestinian people to live freely in an independent state along the June 4, 1967 borders, i.e., in 22% of Mandatory Palestine.
Abbas repeated the Arab League formula for a just and agreed-upon solution to the refugee problem on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 194. He also said that the decision to approach the international community came after years of fruitless negotiations with Israel about permanent arrangements, and Israel's continuing control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to the Knesset plenum on Monday strengthens the Palestinian claim that direct diplomacy with Israel is a dead end, and justifies the Palestinians' petition to the United Nations.
Only minutes after praising Theodor Herzl, who in fact knew how to adapt his vision to changing realities, Netanyahu sketched out a diplomatic plan devoid of vision and totally detached from the new reality developing in the region.
On the eve of his meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama and his address to a joint session of Congress, Netanyahu presented obsolete positions. He refrained from mentioning the 1967 borders as a starting point for a final-status arrangement, and committed to demanding a military presence along the Jordan River, to perpetuating the annexation of East Jerusalem and to demanding Palestinian recognition of Israel as the home of the Jewish people.
The prime minister even made canceling the reconciliation agreement between Fatah and Hamas a condition for resuming negotiations.
Government policy, as expressed in Netanyahu's speech, will end up isolating Israel to a point that it could face economic and cultural sanctions similar to those once imposed on apartheid South Africa. Responsibility for such a crisis will lay squarely on the shoulders of the prime minister and his colleagues at the top of the diplomatic ladder. The price will be paid by the public, partying on a slippery slope.

<title>Israeli right-wingers, you're in control, so stop whining</title>
<date>Sun Jul 03 02:19:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
 
A foreigner who heard Israel's  (very shallow ) political debate would surely conclude that the left has been ruling the country unchallenged for many years. All aspects of government are in its hands, and it runs them as it sees fit. The legal system is left-wing, the army is left-wing, the police are left-wing, the prosecutors are left-wing, the education system is left-wing and the media is horrifyingly left-wing.
The right is all but obliterated, its activists arrested and their rights trampled on. The settlement enterprise, discriminated against and dejected, groans under the brunt of the leftist regime, the Arab citizens are blissfully overprivileged and rabbis are wantonly persecuted. A foreigner hearing all this moaning and groaning would conclude that the right-wingers are ruthlessly oppressed.
This was always the rightist way - the way of the robbed Cossack, the rich and cruel robber who not only robs but protests that he is the real victim. The right has never admitted that it took power 34 years ago and has hardly been out of power since. It has never acknowledged that the country has been galloping to the right for years; neither does it recognize that Israel today is ruled by the most rightist-nationalist government in its history, one of the most right-wing, nationalist governments in the world, and the parliament barely rests between one piece of anti-democratic legislation and the next.
Weep and legitimize, weep some more and acquire more loot - this is the way of the robbed Cossack. The cynical manipulation has proved itself: Quite a few of the right's achievements have been won through complaining and blackmailing, weeping and self-victimizing. All these methods have been breaking records in recent weeks. Anyone listening to right-wing spokesmen would think Israel is an apartheid state - an apartheid against the disenfranchised right-wingers.
Just take the settlement project. No group seems to complain about its woes as incessantly as the settlers. Their construction is frozen, their houses are demolished, their movements are constrained, their leaders are persecuted, their produce is boycotted. Gewalt - they even get called "settlers."
Reality, of course, is the exact opposite. No group terrorizes all sides of government as incessantly, plotting and extorting. Its enterprise is blooming, receiving constant investments in the billions of shekels, practically untouched by the law, feared by the army, police, government, prosecution and courts. Violent settlers roam free, murderers are freed from prison almost immediately, land robbers and arsonists are not even questioned.
But for this group nothing is ever enough. Let's start an almighty din over the hour-long detention of a rabbi, in the robbed Cossack tradition. And this method is proving itself: Next time, the police will think twice before they dare.
The right-wingers portray the courts, which discriminate for the settlers and against the Palestinians, as persecutors. They portray the Supreme Court, the one that has never called the settlement enterprise illegal, the one that decade after decade has rejected petitions demanding human rights and law enforcement in the territories, the one that has yielded every so often to the military - even that court they audaciously portray as left-wing. Even Deputy State Prosecutor Shai Nitzan and Col. Nitzan Alon are lefties, it turns out.
The same description is applied to the media. Preposterously, the media, which on some matters takes an establishment, not to say governmental, propagandist and biased line, which blindly and automatically recites the defense establishment's positions on nearly every issue, is described as "a leftie mafia." The same description is applied to the military radio station, in which debates between "left" and right are conducted between the right and the radical right. And this method is proving itself, of course: The media apologizes, gets defensive and drifts ever further to the right.
So here's a reminder for right-wingers. You're in control. You've been in control for years. You'll probably be in control for many years to come. You're legislating right-wing laws and running a right-wing policy, and there's nobody to stop you. So please, stop your wailing, the moan of the robbed Cossack. You don't need it anymore.

<title>Israel's diplomats are spineless propagandists</title>
<date>Sun Mar 06 01:53:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
This happened long ago: I wanted to get accepted into the Foreign Ministry's cadets course. Israel was a different country then, my views about the state were not the same as they are today and Israel's envoys abroad were actually ambassadors. Lots of champagne has flowed since then; and, fortunately, I was not accepted. Of course, it would be impossible for me to ever explain the country's policies today. Somewhat belatedly, Ilan Baruch, a veteran Israeli diplomat, acknowledged his inability to represent or explain these policies either. Last week he handed in his resignation letter, a resonating and impressive document that ought to be studied in the next cadets course.
His vision may be impaired - Baruch was wounded in one eye during the War of Attrition - but he managed to see something that still remains opaque to his colleagues: Israel's "malignant dynamic," as he phrased it. As a result of this dynamic, he summoned the courage to resign - a decision that should be commended. Baruch's resignation and the cowardly silence of his colleagues exposed the decrepit state of Israel's choir of ambassadors.
Our diplomatic corps today is comprised primarily of spineless propagandists void of values or a conscience. Certainly there are some diplomats among them who identify with the current government's policies, and perhaps even the scandalous behavior of its foreign minister. But the truth is apparently more sordid: A large portion of them oppose the conduct of the state they represent. They are nothing more than puppets in an ugly show window, backup singers for Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman.
Probably better than any other Israelis, the diplomats know what the world thinks of Israel, and why. They know that under Lieberman's watch the Foreign Ministry has become a vessel of rage toward the entire world. They know that no ambassador is sufficiently adroit to explain the brutality of Operation Cast Lead, or the pointless killing on the Mavi Marmara ship. They know that no country on the planet actually accepts the occupation, the settlements or the indications of Israeli apartheid. They know that no diplomat out there can persuade anyone that Israel is truly aimed toward achieving peace. They know that there is a new world alignment out there - one with no patience for tyranny of the kind enforced by Israel's occupation.
They know all of this, yet they keep quiet. We already have pilots who refuse to carry out orders, and soldiers who refuse to serve against their conscience; yet until the patriot Ilan Baruch spoke out, Israel did not have a single diplomat who refused to carry out policies that conflict with his or her moral sense.
True, in this new era, an ambassador's role has lost much of its substance. The connection between a diplomat's swollen sense of self-importance and his actual task has become tenuous. Virtually all that remains is power, prestige, fancy cars, opulent residences and other relics from the days of great empires, when ambassadors served at great distances from their home countries. Most diplomats stationed around the world today are simply policy advocates. But, as opposed to advocates who represent criminals in court, ambassadors need to identify to a large extent with those who send them on their diplomatic errands.
It can be assumed that a certain portion of Israel's diplomatic corps lack such an ideological and emotional sense of identification, but simply keep quiet about it. Many simply want to serve their country faithfully, and thus they try to peddle, despite everything, the product of "beautiful Israel." The result can be pathetic.
I recently caught an interview conducted at one of our consulates in the United States with the Israeli who created the "Zenga Zenga" clip lampooning Muammar Gadhafi (the latest YouTube sensation ); following that, they presented a winning Israeli recipe for an eggplant dish. Excellent! Such ambassadors warrant the disparaging "cocktail-shmocktail" description David Ben-Gurion allotted them.
True, it's not easy to be an Israeli ambassador in this day and age - not because of the world's hostility toward us, but because of the country's policies. What is an ambassador supposed to say about his nation's "efforts for peace" when his foreign minister states before the United Nations that such efforts have no chance? And what is a diplomat supposed to say about the democratic character of his state at a time when the Palestinians live without rights?
It's not easy to stand in judgment of others, and demand that they relinquish their careers and their ephemeral glory. But is it excessive to expect that they make their voices heard and show some fortitude? Some integrity? They should look at their colleague, Baruch, the blessed.

<title>Israel's left now has a chance to awaken the public</title>
<date>Wed Aug 24 03:02:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Were Shelly Yachimovich the only one to raise the banner of selective justice, there would be no need to state here that the settlements are no sin in exactly the same way that traffic in women is no crime and concentrating Jews from Arab lands in weakened towns on the periphery is no injustice. There would be no reason to recall that once, there was a consensus over slavery, and that there is ever only one Master; he merely changes his name from time to time: men in a patriarchal society, whites in South Africa, Jews in the state for Jews-above-all.
Unfortunately, however, many activists in and supporters of the Israeli protest movement accept the logic of social-nationalist justice. Were Yachimovich in the minority, at least 10 percent of the quarter-million demonstrators would have protested against the wall of sin in Walaja, Bil'in, Na'alin and Ma'asara. They would have marched en masse to the stolen Nebi Saleh spring and liberated it. Then, they would have returned home with the soldiers, together prevented the destruction of houses in Lod and demonstrated in front of the Interior Ministry until its bureaucrats were ordered to immediately prepare a master plan for every unrecognized village, starting with Al-Araqib. It's so simple.
Because Yachimovich represents the many, does that mean that leftists  (both Jewish and Palestinian ) ought to desist from their internal debate over whether to participate in a protest movement whose justice is selective and simply walk away? If this new social movement were a final paper awaiting a grade, the answer would be "Yes. This is a movement that launders the dispossession of Palestinians both past and present with superficial yuppie charm. We do not belong in it, so we'll return to the tear gas, the rubber-coated steel bullets and the arrests."
But the social movement that sprung up in Israel this summer is not a final paper. Nor is it a political party. It is a process, a new and developing situation that reinvents itself frequently, an intensive course in developing political understanding. It must not be left to the new-old social right.
In effect, the challenge goes much deeper than merely conflicting opinions. Yachimovich frankly enunciated our position as Israeli Jews: We are profiting from the occupation even as we groan under regressive taxation. Whether our families came from Katrielevka or Baghdad, we are profiting from the structural discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel and from the very fact that they have become a minority in their own land.
So is the solution to this troubling existential dilemma simply to leave? To emigrate to countries free of injustice and dispossession, like the United States of America, Germany or South Africa, in which apartheid based on class is competing successfully with its predecessor, apartheid based on race?
Internal contradictions are the daily fare of liberation struggles, and purist excuses for not participating don't resolve them. As the female activists of every national liberation struggle know quite well, patriarchy is not a secondary, negligible mechanism of oppression compared to colonialism. Sexism was present in the Solidarity Movement in Poland and the African National Congress in South Africa. Nevertheless, women joined these movements and were active in their ranks.
The role of the left - for whom the value of equality is its Ten Commandments - is not to look on from the sidelines and make do with handing out grades. The left must try to influence this new, dynamic process. Its role is to learn from other people's struggles and to teach, without lowering itself, while abandoning the arrogance of the past and bearing in mind the terrible wrongs committed in its name.
Leftist activists are educated to make use of their excess privileges insofar as possible to fight the whole system of privileges. Now, when, there is a collective awakening from long years of apathy, the left can and must use the experience, knowledge and human and cultural capital it has accumulated. For there is now a great chance of proving to at least parts of this awakening public that the benefits of occupation today are the strategic danger of tomorrow.

<title>Israel still has a partner for peace </title>
<date>Tue Jan 25 00:56:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
On Sunday, Haaretz reported on Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman's proposal to promote a long-term interim arrangement with the Palestinians. A few hours later, Al Jazeera and the Guardian published documents detailing the negotiations over the final-status arrangement held between the previous government and the Palestinian leadership headed by Mahmoud Abbas.
The documentation, conducted by the Palestinian team heads, illustrates the serious and down-to-business approach of the Palestinians with regards to the central core issues - borders, Jerusalem and holy places.
The documents testify yet again that Israel has found a pragmatic Palestinian partner, interested in implementing the two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders. This solution consists of border adjustments that would enable annexing a considerable part of the settlements, in this way gaining international recognition for annexing the Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem.
The Palestinians even said they were ready to discuss a special regime in the Old City. The documents point to the isolated West Bank settlements of Ma'aleh Adumim and Ariel and to the Har Homa neighborhood at the Jerusalem city limits - established after the Oslo agreements - as the main obstacles to a fair, sensible demographic partition.
The documents include a transcript of the statements made by Negotiations Department head Saeb Erekat at a meeting with American officials about a year ago. It reflects the Palestinian leadership's deep frustration with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to open a serious debate on the central issues. Without a solution to these issues, Netanyahu's declarations in support of a two-state solution are devoid of meaning.
Lieberman's argument that the documents prove a long-term interim agreement is the only realistic solution is groundless. Olmert's government ended its term before having completed the final-status negotiations. There is not, nor will there be, a Palestinian partner to a 20-year - or more - interim arrangement without delineating permanent borders and reaching an agreed upon solution to the refugees problem.
If Israel continues to prefer expanding the settlements to ensuring its status as a Jewish democratic state, we will lose the last Palestinian partner who could prevent its perpetuation as an isolated, condemned apartheid state.

<title>Itamar murders don’t justify stripping Palestinians' rights  </title>
<date>Wed Apr 20 01:01:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
The Israeli settlement enterprise does not need the murder of Jewish families in order to strip Palestinian families of their land and endanger the future of both peoples. But when such a murder "falls into its hands," the settlement enterprise knows how to make the most out of it, by building new neighborhoods and outposts, blaming Palestinian nature and education, and dropping biblical terms like "bitter enemies" and "Amalek."
The history of white settlement in other peoples' countries is full of sickening murders carried out by individuals who belonged to the indigenous peoples or by African slaves. These actions did not prevent the systematic expulsion and near extinction of the original inhabitants. It is not acts of murder that brought an end to slavery or apartheid. At the same time, abominable murders in Algeria did not make French colonialism, or any other colonialism, legitimate.
At the time, the whites attributed the murders to the nature of the savages, their inborn viciousness and their lowly race. The takeover and murderous enslavement were regarded as a divine and courageous mission and as a means of preserving law and order. Now, decades or centuries later, many recognize the brutality that characterized the settlement enterprise of their forefathers.
The attempt to guess what will be in 150 years is best left to soothsayers. We are interested in today and tomorrow. And today we must take seriously the words of the former chief rabbi of the Israel Defense Forces, Brig. Gen. Avichai Ronski, one of the founders of Itamar. Speaking in an interview with the Walla news website, even before the release of the names of the suspects in the murder of the Fogel family, Ronski said: "A village like this, like Awarta, from which the murderers of the Fogel family and of the Shebo family emerged, must suffer as a village. A situation must be created whereby the inhabitants prevent anyone in this village from harming Jews. Yes, it is collective punishment. They must not be allowed to sleep at night, they must not be allowed to go to work, they must not be allowed to drive their cars. There are many ways."
Not a single word about the two murderers who came from Itamar or about the Authorities of Law and Order which excelled at not finding the murderers of two other Palestinian farmers who had been shot to death near Itamar.
Even before the suspects were caught, the soldiers punished Awarta collectively. After all, in the jargon of Israeli street judgments, a Palestinian is convicted even before he becomes a suspect.
The gag order on the investigation of the murder did not allow us to write what the army did in the village during the past month. But why, in order to collect fingerprints or DNA samples, did soldiers have to break washing machines, refrigerators, televisions and toys? Why should bags of rice, sugar and bottles of oil be emptied on the floor?
But for our former chief military rabbi this is not enough. He is demanding more. Will his former colleagues, still in uniform, not follow orders? Will his spiritual pupils not translate his words into deeds? And whoever protests will be accused of condoning the slaughter of infants.
But even without murder, the Palestinian villages suffer, as do the cities and towns, at the hands of the settlers and the Israeli authorities. There is abuse by individuals and structural and institutional abuse. All are exacting revenge on the Palestinians because this is their land. The individuals are taking over olive groves and water springs, and they expel people from their homes. The authorities are prohibiting construction and planting, confiscating land by the force of decrees, destroying houses and expelling. The water sources have been taken over long time ago. And everything is immersed in a mikveh of court rulings.
Our law and order authorities do not protect the Palestinian villages from the thugs who "exact a price" from Palestinians in revenge for the razing of an unauthorized settlers' hut by authorities. How can we expect them to protect the Palestinians against the avengers of the murder of the Fogel family? The settlers are sent there by the state. How can we expect the state to prevent them from continuing to do what they have been sent to do? To plunder, abuse and sabotage the future for all of us.

<title>It isn't about the camel </title>
<date>Fri Feb 25 02:10:48 IST 2011</date>
<content>
 I was at Ben-Gurion airport, about to board a return flight to Paris recently, when I spotted a brochure rack - the last item that caught my eye before I entered the ramp to the plane. It displayed colorful pocket-size leaflets in Hebrew. The title on the cover, "Masbirim Israel"  (Explaining Israel ), seemed intriguing enough. Ever the curious mind, I picked one up. After all, I spent a whole decade of my life in Israel, now I come to visit from France twice a year, most of my relatives and friends live in the country, and I'm still not sure what to make of Israel's many contradictions. Maybe this would enlighten me? 
 Surprise! The leaflet wasn't aimed at explaining Israel to departing visitors  (which would have been odd, but funny ). Rather, it is intended to prompt traveling Israelis to speak well of their homeland when journeying abroad - a most noble mission now made a lot easier, with all of Israel's achievements conveniently listed in a pamphlet small enough to be carried in a pocket or purse. The brochure, the brainchild of the Ministry of Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs, is the latest government effort to revamp Israel's image across the world. Data on Israel's global leadership in software development and technological innovations, on agricultural miracles in the desert - it's all in there, all of the modern-day Israeli public-relations razzmatazz. 
 One statement, though, truly stands out: "Since its creation," the leaflet says, "Israel has inscribed on its flag the respect of human rights and minority rights, and has been an outstanding democracy." Really? Why then did I see so many Israelis watch in anguish as a democratic tidal wave swept through Egypt from Tahrir Square? Why did a panicked Netanyahu keep waving, as the events unfolded, the red flag of an Islamic threat - one of two pillars of legitimation for his brand of leadership, the other being Ahmadinejad's Iran? 
 What Middle Eastern nation should have been the first to rejoice but the one that claims to have been an outstanding democracy - the only democracy in the region - since its inception? Why all the fear and guardedness, just at the dawn of such a movement, which might constitute the birth of the "third way" that Arab societies have been waiting for, to break away from the either-autocracy-or-else-theocracy conundrum? Why the hostility when this movement might, in fact, be the best news in a long time for Israel - a chance to perhaps see new Arab regimes that won't use the suffering of the Palestinians as a diversion to stall development and deny their own people a share of the global cake? It's far too early to tell, but is it completely impossible to imagine that Arab governments to come might not have hatred of Israel as their overriding guiding principle? 
 Of course, Israel's murky preference for autocratic regimes didn't start yesterday. It was already in evidence in the 1970s and 1980s when the country was a major arms and warfare expertise supplier for the military dictatorships of Latin America and Africa, and for the apartheid regime in South Africa. Israel's history has been enmeshed in the support of nondemocratic regimes. Not to mention its own record. Outstanding democracy? For Jewish Israelis only. Respect of minority rights? Ask the Bedouin in the Negev and the Palestinians in East Jerusalem about house demolitions. And, of course, there's the icing on the democratic cake: the occupation. 
 Despite all this, Israel wants to be seen as a full-fledged democracy. Of course pathetic propaganda campaigns reminiscent of Soviet days will never do the trick. So why does Israel even bother to create them? Perhaps because, most of all, Israel needs to convince itself. Its politics are more and more out of tune with the world. The West it so much wants to be part of now strives to achieve a form of democratic society based on inclusiveness and respect for people from all walks of life. Meanwhile, Israel is moving in the opposite direction. As its sense of isolation grows in the future, it will gradually lose the ability to comprehend how it is viewed from the outside. Self-delusion can protect it from having to face up to these harsh facts. But for how long? 
 One sign that Israel's march toward an increasingly autistic version of its former self is already under way may be the photo on the cover of the leaflet: A Western-looking man is seen holding the halter of a camel, and the caption above says, "The camel is a popular means of transportation in Israel." It takes the reader a few seconds to understand that this is an example of the myths the campaign was devised to debunk. Is this the kind of misperception the current government believes the world has of Israel, that it is some kind of backland in need of development and modern technology? Is this what they really think the problem is with Israel's image abroad? Think again, Ministry of Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs. It isn't about the camel.

<title>Katsav, not the president, is a rapist </title>
<date>Thu Jan 06 03:30:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
With former President Moshe Katsav's foolish behavior and his decisive conviction by the court, a new tune can now be heard in the public discourse: questioning the institution of the presidency. Who needs such a thing, a rapist president? We're wasting money that could instead be channeled into more positive ventures, such as helping the poor, they are saying. But these comments are not rooted in a profound discussion of the significance or symbolic value of the institution, but the fact that a convicted rapist served as president of the country.
This formula is based on a combination of words: Moshe Katsav the man, who committed rape, also served as president of Israel. The analogy has been made, and the phrase has begun to dominate the discourse: a rapist president. This phrase indicates our problematic use of language and the way in which our thinking is dependent on it. We shoot out words every day, we release them easily - after all, there is ostensibly no danger in the flow of words; with so many words out there, maybe nobody even notices one word or another.
But this is an illusion, that words are simply erased into thin air. In effect, we etch words into our consciousness. Words can construct a reality. For example, asking for forgiveness at a critical moment of tension will likely lead to reconciliation and the turning of a new leaf in relations.
In South Africa, during the transition period between the despotic apartheid government and the democratic government, which was still fighting for its establishment, the words "I'm sorry" coming from the former oppressors provided an opening for forgiveness and cooperation. Our reality is constructed in our minds from words, our thought processes are composed of words, and these words guide our perception of the world around us and the ways in which we orient ourselves on its complex paths.
And so the saying that words can kill is true, especially when these words include stereotypical terms, like racist or rapist. When certain rabbis issue a flyer that is defined as racist, suddenly all the rabbis become racists and the generalization is perpetuated. Over time, the word loses its dictionary meaning and becomes part of a new context, a magic word.
Eytan Sheshinski, for example, is no longer the man himself, but a symbol and expression of the pressures exerted by business tycoons and of surrendering to the omnipotent. A rapist president has now also become a symbol - and the reaction is that we should abolish the institution of the presidency. Journalists of all people must be particularly careful about the phrases they coin and perpetuate.
So many women are jumping for joy. "Skipping around the house like an idiot," says Merav Michaeli, quoting her friends, because they convicted the rapist, and all women everywhere are now "extremely excited." What is that, if not a generalization itself? Did the Katsav case provide an ultimate characterization of the rapist male sex? Don't these women understand that by using the stereotype, by generalizing that all men are rapists, by saying that only now, thanks to Judge George Karra  (oy, a man ) and his two female colleagues  (luckily women ), the men were caught before being able to carry out their evil intentions - don't they realize they're only reinforcing the gap between men and women?
The language of generalization is dangerous; it's the language of propaganda, the language of hatred, the demonic rhetoric of fascist regimes which fans the brotherhood of the masses through incitement against the other, based on stereotypes that reinforce such hatred. Generalization versus specifics. We of all people, here in Israel, must insist on specifics. Moshe Katsav himself was accused of rape, and was found guilty by the court. That's all; not every single male nor every single president.

<title>Left can unite to lead Israel once again</title>
<date>Fri Feb 25 02:10:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
For the first time in a long while, a real buzz is being felt among the left in Israel. Groups are getting organized with the intention of showing a presence in the street. The Labor Party, too, is waking up from a long period of paralysis imposed on it by Ehud Barak. However it will not be able to be a relevant force again in the politics of the left unless it separates itself, once and for all, from all those who cooperated with Barak in setting up the Netanyahu-Lieberman government.
True, not everyone who believed that the old-new leader would succeed in dragging Netanyahu to a peace agreement with the Palestinians deserves to be denounced at the pillory, but those who continued sitting in that government until they were thrown out, must go. In that way it will be possible to begin gathering the forces for establishing a credible social democratic party.
The major obstacle is the lack of willingness on the part of people with a coherent ideology to reach a compromise among themselves. There are a number of bodies currently active in the Zionist left that are divided by differences of nuance, and sometimes also of real content, but not by critical differences.
From the Sheikh Jarrah group to the "National Left"  (this term when translated into one of the European languages sounds really bad ) and including Meretz and those people from Labor who are sick and tired of the opportunism of their leaders, there is a sufficiently broad common denominator that can create a tool for changing the reality.
Indeed, they all share the opinion that an end must be put to the occupation and a Palestinian state must be established. They all have in common the understanding that a continuation of Israeli rule over the Palestinians will create an apartheid state here or destroy Israel as a country in which the Jewish majority enjoys sovereignty and self-rule.
They are all repulsed by the burgeoning racism that is spreading through this society at the initiative of the right wing. And what is no less important, they are all convinced that economic neoliberalism is a recipe for social disaster and eventually also for economic collapse. They also all believe that society and the state exist for the benefit of the individual, and that the human being is the objective of social and political activity. Likewise, they all know that democracy is based on human rights.
Such a principled outlook produces clear political conclusions, which form the basis on which it is possible to unite the forces.
It should be emphasized that a political party is not a pressure group for achieving one goal, no matter how lofty it may be. A party must reflect a comprehensive view of the social and political reality, and needs basic guidelines in all spheres of public life.
This remark is aimed specifically at Knesset member Shelly Yachimovich; she is a determined and courageous woman but turning her back on the existential need to reach a peace agreement with the Palestinians will not be to her benefit. If she wishes to lead the left, she must not ignore the disaster that the occupation produces and hope that by virtue of closing her eyes in this manner, the lower income groups will rush to her side.
Those who wish for inspiration for a new start would do well to look toward the West rather than backwards. The Israeli labor movement was an ad hoc invention for the purpose of achieving independence, but no more than that.
Even in the distant past it would seem from time to time that the Histadrut labor federation was closer to being a corporation than a workers' organization fighting to change the face of society.
In principle, it would be appropriate to build the new party on different ideological streams. The differences of opinion would find expression at the local level and in various elected central bodies, and every year a convention would discuss the proposals for policy, and this is where the platform and directives for action would be formulated. All the opinions would be aired and the decisions would be binding on all.
The party that would be established would not be a ruling party immediately, but its influence would be much greater than what there is today, and as a beginning, that is not something negligible.

<title>Netanyahu is fanning the flames of religious incitement</title>
<date>Tue Dec 27 03:17:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Benjamin Netanyahu is not guilty. He learned that trick the first time he was elected. After he took part in orchestrating the rallies inciting against Yitzhak Rabin  ("With blood and fire we will expel Rabin" ), along came the assassination. Netanyahu recognized the significance of the role he played and was certain the right wing was going to collapse in the next election. But miraculously, the non-right didn't raise the assassination or the incitement during the election campaign - the shooting was reduced to the act of a single bad apple - and Netanyahu became prime minister.
Netanyahu is not the first to identify the formula. In the 1980s several fires broke out on Israel Air Force bases. It was always the same firefighter who was the first to notice the fire, arrive, put it out and reap the praise. As the incidents piled up, an undercover investigation began. The firefighter, it turned out, was the one setting the fires.
The Hasidic man from Beit Shemesh who was interviewed for a TV news segment that aired Friday has revealed the truth even to those who excel at repression. He is the product of an educational system that incites its students, creates segregation between boys and girls from childhood, and teaches boys that religious law states that spilling their seed is the worst of all sins - and that the spilled seed of sinning Jews gives rise to all the demons in the world, which are responsible for every tragedy, including, of course, the Holocaust. When the Israeli government allows itself to fund such an educational system, a place like Beit Shemesh can be expected to flourish. It's clear to the product of this incitement that if a "normal man" like him doesn't forcibly cover the arms of an 8-year-old girl, the world will be filled with his demons.
This normal man from Beit Shemesh continued to cover the arms of truth when he said "we have rabbis, and they're the ones who order us to take action." And that is the essence of the incitement. In the rallies that led to Rabin's assassination, Netanyahu was assisted by Rabbi Dov Lior and his followers. Menachem Livni, the operational head of the Jewish Underground in the early 1980s, who was convicted of killing Arabs, has said Lior was the one who pressured him to kill and sent him out to do so. Lior was not questioned seriously, nor was he put on trial. He later went on to announce that his former student - Baruch Goldstein, who massacred 29 Muslim worshipers in the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron in 1994 - was a martyr, greater than all the martyrs of the Holocaust. And several rabbis have said Lior was the rabbi who ruled that Rabin should be killed because he was a rodef and moser, meaning that he was seeking to kill Jews and give up Jewish land. Rabin's would-be assassin, Yigal Amir, attended many of Lior's gatherings.
Today, the Netanyahu government is giving Lior tens of thousands of shekels a month in the salaries he receives in various capacities. When Netanyahu returned to Israel as a victor after confronting U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this year, he went straight to Mercaz Harav Yeshiva, pointed to the podium where Lior was sitting, and said that was the elite commando unit leading the Jewish people.
The "normal" bad apples who called Israelis soldiers "Nazis" also have rabbis. Lior has ruled that soldiers who evacuate outposts are like Nazis, and should be treated as such. The Netanyahu government is continuing to waste millions of shekels on education that passes on the kind of values embraced by Lior - who also heads a large hesder yeshiva, combining Torah study and military service. And it's not just Lior. This week Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Netanyahu's "moderate" partner, ruled that Jewish doctors should not treat non-Jews or secular Jews on Shabbat. In 1997 Netanyahu told the late Rabbi Yitzhak Kadouri that Israel's leftists had forgotten what it means to be Jewish. In that spirit, most young Jews are now being taught what being Jewish is all about: segregation, and the creation of hierarchies that fervently discriminate.
If I wanted to establish a school system that separates redheads from everybody else and teaches them that they are inferior, that the sight of them causes demons to be born and so they should not be seen, I would probably be either hospitalized or arrested. But the Israeli government is sending most of the first-graders it classifies as Jews to religious schools, whether Orthodox or ultra-Orthodox. Those schools are doing essentially the same thing; they are operating an apartheid system that discriminates against girls.
At the end of the McCarthy era, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that separate is not equal. For all that he was a Republican, President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent federal troops into Arkansas to uphold the right of black students to attend the same schools as whites. In Israel there's no need to send in the army; it would be enough to stop funding every segregated school. No so-called education system that segregates boys and girls should get a single shekel from the state. That would be enough to stop the madness.
Israel has a clear choice to make. It can continue with the Netanyahu government - which is igniting, fanning and subsidizing the rabbinical flames of incitement and, as the fire consumes all, promises to take care of the bad apples - or another government can step in and put out the fire.
Each of the three instances since 1977 in which the right lost the vote all had something in common: In all three cases, the public became more aware of the domestic threat, consisting primarily of religious extremists threatening to take over. By now it's no longer just a threat. Israel only has a very brief time left while change can still take place. It must either stop feeding the fire that is consuming it, or the country will cease to exist.

<title>Netanyahu's policies have turned Israel into Iran</title>
<date>Fri Nov 18 02:40:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
I don't know if Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Rabbi Ovadia Yosef have their dressy robes and turbans made by the same tailor and milliner, and whether the gold decorations woven into their clothes symbolize some sort of rank in their divine status or are just foppishness. Some say it's both. They have adopted the Ottoman tradition of clerics who vied in their day with the dandyish sultans. In any case, both Khamenei and Yosef have influence on questions of war and peace. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad isn't going to push that button without authorization from Khamanei, just as our prime minister and defense minister make pilgrimages to Our Master and Teacher on the issue of the Iranian threat.
The advice Khamenei gives is within the realm of the secret. Some believe that he will not lightly approve what we fear. As for Rabbi Ovadia, his solution has been cited as the Holy One, Blessed Be He, will thwart them: "Their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bows shall be broken"  (Psalms 37:15 ). Interior Minister Eli Yishai, one of the eight decisive votes in the cabinet that will determine whether or not to attack, has declared: "We have no one upon whom to rely except for our Father in Heaven." Information about what our father in heaven thinks is not really in our hands.
About two weeks ago 19 retired Israel Defense Forces generals published a letter to the defense minister and the chief of staff demanding a stop to the continuing harm to the military service of women in the IDF.
The generals warned of damage to women's motivation to serve and to the basic values of Israeli society. They noted that they cherish the contribution of religious IDF soldiers and respect their rights but these must be ensured without imposing a religious way of life on the rest of those serving in the military.
Maj. Gen.  (ret. ) Mendi Meron has said that everyone who has commanded soldiers from hesder yeshivas - an arrangement whereby conscripts split their time between religious studies and active service - knows there are no words to describe their dedication, but that has nothing to do with the exclusion of women. Nonreligious people also have rights in the army. Exclusion of women in the IDF is just the tip of the iceberg. At the base is the question: Who gives the orders in the army - the commanders or the Holy One, Blessed Be He?
Former Mossad chief Efraim Halevy observed, "The ultra-Orthodox are scarier than the Iranian bomb." It goes without saying that before you could say Jack Robinson he had to apologize. It is hard to believe we are getting close to a situation in which nonreligious people don't even have the right to be caustic.
With the start of the Knesset session, a series of proposed laws are leading the country into dangerous realms. Add to this the apartheid developing between men and women in Jerusalem and Kadima MK Avi Dichter's proposal to declare Israel a Jewish state and not count its Arab inhabitants. This statement won him compliments from one MK, who said that at long last we see the Likud is in control.
The prime minister and several of his extremist colleagues have come back from their summer vacation brimming with ideas for laws about holding hearings for candidates for the Supreme Court and restrictions on foreign funding of the  (mainly leftist ) non-profit organizations.
It is odd to hear a demand like that from the right. During my time as diplomatic correspondent for Haaretz in Washington I was amazed at the skills demonstrated by the heads of the Israeli right in raising funds from strange and sundry non-profit organizations. The law for drying up funds will anger Europe and the liberal donors in the United States. There is fear that donations to hospitals and universities will cease. The attorney general has made it unambiguously clear that these proposals are unconstitutional and damaging to the political discourse, freedom of expression and the freedom of association.
On the other side, Minister without Portfolio Yossi Peled says Israel must not agree to foreign donations to organizations like Breaking the Silence, for example, which persecutes IDF soldiers. Following this argument, an American citizen could wonder whether it is necessary to continue providing financial aid to a country that is not lifting a finger for peace.
Prime Minister Benjamin  (Bibi ) Netanyahu is acting to neutralize all the mechanisms that aren't under his government's thumb, like the Supreme Court, the media and the non-governmental organizations. In the meantime, he has retreated slightly in the face of the public's reaction. However, recent events add to the sense that Iran's spirit is taking control of us, through rightist legislation, creeping ultra-Orthodox extremism and disrespect for minority rights. Iran is already here.

<title>Netanyahu's 'speech of truth' at the UN</title>
<date>Mon Sep 19 03:49:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised that in his speech at the United Nations on Friday, he will "tell the truth." This is no trivial matter when it involves a politician who invented an encounter with British soldiers that happened before he was born. Nor is it obvious for a person who retroactively brought Rehavam Ze'evi into his government after the latter had already passed away.
One of the rare times Netanyahu told the truth was when he admitted that he had  (also ) misled his third wife. Then, too, he did so out of fear of the release of a tape supposedly revealing an extra-marital affair. After the fact, Bibi learned that he did not have to tell the truth, since the tape was nothing but a rumor.
The following lines are an attempt to formulate Netanyahu's truth ahead of one more speech of a lifetime.
"I came to this chamber, in which 64 years ago the nations of the world declared the establishment of a Jewish state, although the Arabs have an automatic majority here. Yes, I know that that does not matter much, since we have the automatic veto of the United States in the Security Council. More importantly, we have an automatic majority in the U.S. Congress and our lobby, AIPAC, has a grip on President Obama in a sensitive place. But how can we even compare the automatic majority against Israel to the automatic majority for it?
"Having already made Sara come all the way to New York, I will present to you my truth with regard to the Palestinian request that you recognize, ostensibly, a state of their own in the 1967 borders whose capital is East Jerusalem.
"I do not understand why they are making do with one country. I am ready to offer them at least four: one in Gaza, the second an enclave in the Nablus area - with perhaps a tunnel to Tul Karm, the third in the Ramallah district, and the fourth in the Hebron Hills, without, of course, Baruch Marzel and the Tomb of the Patriarchs.
"You can learn about my truth with regard to the Jordan Valley from the tape of the meeting with settlers in Ofra 10 years ago. I told them that during my first term as prime minister, the Americans promised me that I would be the one to sketch the borders of 'defined military sites' in the territories that according to the Oslo Accords would remain in Israel's hands. I told the settlers that the way I see it, the entire Jordan Valley is a military zone and I boasted that 'from that moment I stopped the Oslo Accords.'
"I said in my speech at Bar-Ilan University that I support a two-state solution. That was shortly after President Barack Hussein Obama's Cairo speech, when I was afraid he would call my bluff and go all the way with his Muslim friends.
"I understand that if I keep wasting my time distributing macho pictures to the media, even Glenn Beck, if he is elected president of the United States, will not be able to ensure that the State of Israel does not become a pariah state like apartheid South Africa. And so I have to toss the ball into the Palestinian court.
"Despite the political price I will pay for this, and the rebuke I'll get from my father, I will reveal to you today for the first time things that were unknown until now: I told Obama I was willing to withdraw from 95 percent of the West Bank and to conduct negotiations over exchanges of territory. But don't get too excited, since I conditioned this revolutionary proposal on two things: First, the Palestinians' express agreement that the negotiations will result in a peace treaty between the state of the Palestinian people and the nation state of the Jewish people; and second, a pre-understanding that the agreement on the establishment of a Palestinian state will constitute the end of the conflict without hearing any more about the return of refugees. From my perspective, these are iron-clad conditions.
"I know that from the point of view of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, accepting these conditions is like suicide. No Palestinian leader can allow himself to give up at the outset on the right of return and alienate himself from Israel's Palestinian citizens, particularly at a time when we are settling Jews in all parts of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The truth is that this is the reason I invented these conditions. It is clear to me that among the Arabs, just like with us, politicians are prepared to kill and be killed on the altar of their country. See you at Masada."

<title>NGO bill aims to create a democracy for Jews only</title>
<date>Mon Nov 21 03:25:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
The NGO culture is part of globalization: Money flows from financial centers to all kinds of corners, in a mixture of philanthropy and business, idealism and cynicism. The left is being destroyed by this culture, which dictates a rupture between the community in whose name it acts and its coterie of professional activists, whose funding comes from abroad.
The separation between the professional activists and the grass-roots kind and the need to show donors a "return" on their money have given rise to all kinds of fake activity - demonstrations whose participants are activists in or employees of "neighboring" nongovernmental organizations, or, alternatively, free-of-charge "mass" Internet petitions, which no one reads except the signatories  (in place of the old-fashioned method - signing people on a petition to the newspaper that involved real communication and raising money from the signatories; in short, genuine political activity ).
The culture of "Europe will pay" has also intensified a kind of nihilism on the left. For instance, from time to time, the Zochrot organization used to put out a journal, Sedek, which was extremely extravagant in its use of color plates. Aside from its political material, it consisted mainly of colorful  (and apolitical ) plastic art, thanks to "generous funding," in the journal's words, from a Danish organization for... eradicating hunger.
This is also the background to the rise of the executive director, who is chosen via a "human rights" tender. Today, it's refusing to serve in the army; tomorrow, it's torture; but it's all part of the same status quo. That is equally true of the "campaign managers," aka "media experts" - which means they have a lot of numbers in their cell phone's memory.
But the epitome is the use of journalists in place of grass-roots activity in the streets. Success is measured by being "mentioned on television" - a reflection of the world of advertising.
Peace Now provides an excellent example of this transformation from a mass political movement into an NGO focused on monitoring: Instead of grass-roots activity, it monitors settlement expansion  (though this is important ). This is one of the reasons for the right's success. The government does as it pleases, while opposition from the left is becoming commercialized, because the left has too many NGOs  (to obtain more and more donations ). It has a lot of generals and very few soldiers.
Why nevertheless is the government attending to these NGOs? Because the most important of them represent the Palestinian people in the cellars of the military dictatorship.
B'Tselem is the most noteworthy of these NGOs. It tries to represent the occupied population, which has been without representation during almost 45 years of occupation, against the jackboots. Other NGOs try to find breaches in the law, and, in addition to mobilizing public opinion, take them to the High Court of Justice  (which has proven to be a broken reed as far as the territories are concerned ). This is the only representation the Palestinians have in Israeli politics, in which, ostensibly, all are represented, since it is democratic.
This is also the context in which one must view the so-called NGO Bill: It isn't necessarily an attempt to suppress the left, but rather an attempt to eliminate representation for residents of the territories. And that is why bills to change the composition of the High Court have flowed in the wake of this legislation: Because the destroyers of the constitutional court aren't concerned over its ethnic make-up, but over the manner in which, on rare occasions, it defends the Palestinians, thanks to B'Tselem, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Yesh Din or the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel. It's a kind of broken telephone amid the lawlessness that the Palestinians inhabit, in the absence of the rule of law.
Nor does the work of destruction stop there. In the current fight over various bills relating to the High Court, both sides have tended to forget the most important fact of all: Israel has no constitution that would impede the tyranny of the majority.
It has no constitution because the state continues to deny its Arab citizens equality before the law. They, unlike residents of the territories, can expect help from the High Court from time to time. Yet, ever since the 1995 Katzir ruling, which for the first time told this state without a constitution that communities for Jews only are unconstitutional - or in other words, that apartheid is illegal - the war on this ruling has gathered speed, first in academia, then in the cabinet and Knesset.
Therefore, we must not dismiss the NGO Bill, even if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly come to his senses and opposed it. This bill truly intends to create a democracy for Jews only. If it were passed, no Arab - whether resident of the territories or Israeli citizen - would have access to the law.
And, therefore, we also shouldn't make light of the drowning of Begin-style liberalism in the Likud. The goalposts of the right-wing torrent will continue to move. Its horizon also includes annexing the territories; it even has a vision of denying Arab citizens the right to vote in Israel. And at the entrance to this hell - if not beneath it - Meir Kahane and Avigdor Lieberman are waiting.

<title>Obama is letting Netanyahu off the hook</title>
<date>Mon May 30 02:45:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Who said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hasn't changed? Who would have believed that the dear son of that combative family would utter indecent words like "Palestinian state" without spitting immediately after? Who would have dreamt that the prince of the right would even hint at the possibility that settlements would be evacuated? A veritable revolution. Instead of brandishing a thorn-filled club, Netanyahu is waving a fresh olive branch; he has learned that there is no better way to perpetuate the frozen peace process, expand settlements and increase his political longevity.
The prime minister is no longer the man Ehud Barak designated "Mr. No." We are now dealing with a new leader, a much more sophisticated and dangerous one. Meet "Bibi I'll Have It Both Ways."
This Netanyahu is in favor of a stable and prosperous Palestinian state and against a two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders with an agreed exchange of territory. He is concerned about the Jewish and democratic character of the State of Israel, and is also busy turning it into a binational state  (or an apartheid state ), through his doomed and unprecedented demand that the Palestinians declare that Israel is a state for the Jewish people. He supports having Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas represent the population of Gaza in negotiations, and is opposed to the unity agreement between the Fatah government in the West Bank and the Hamas government in Gaza.
The "both ways" doctrine of the right is not new. Twenty years ago, U.S. President George H.W. Bush asked Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to choose between expanding settlements and securing financial guarantees to help Israel take in new immigrants. The Likud leader, who was essentially dragged to the Madrid peace conference, sought to prove that it is possible to build settlements in the midst of peace talks as well as receive special assistance for the absorption of immigrants.
With the help of Jewish American political activists, Shamir rallied congressional support in his campaign against the administration. He believed that Israel's friends would bring the president to his knees. But instead of getting everything he wanted, Shamir ended up getting none of it, ending up without guarantees and out of government.
Even though he was in the midst of the struggle for his second term in office, Bush refused to abandon the fragile peace process and risk U.S. interests in the Middle East. The president defeated Congress, and Israeli voters defeated the right at the polls. When there is a leader in the White House who is willing to take political risks and makes it clear that there is a cost to trying to have it both ways, Israelis know to distinguish between the good and the bad.
But Obama enabled Netanyahu to return home from Washington without paying any political price for trying to have it both ways. Moreover, he allowed the prime minister to laugh all the way to Jerusalem over the statement that the 1967 borders, with agreed territorial exchange, should serve as the basis for negotiations. Netanyahu knows that statements that are not accompanied by political action, and which come with no bill for time lost, are worth about as much as the pledge in the 2003 road map to freeze all settlements and dismantle the outposts.
The PLO Central Committee has already decided to accept the parameters set out by Obama in his latest speeches as the basis for negotiations toward a permanent agreement, demonstrating its commitment that the reconciliation deal with Hamas does not alter its political positions. Abbas made it clear recently that negotiations on the basis of the 1967 lines and a three-month freeze in settlement construction would lead the Palestinians to abandon their effort to win support for an independent state at the United Nations in September. He also said: "In my calendar there is no October."
In other words, if serious negotiations about borders do not begin by September, in October the Palestinians will no longer agree to cooperate with Israel on either political or security matters. There will no longer be a semblance of a peace process even as Palestinian lands are stolen in broad daylight.
Obama said last week that a true friend must tell Israel the truth. A true friend has not fulfilled his obligation if all he did was describe the abyss to which Netanyahu is leading us. A true friend does everything in his power to prevent the mad rush to the abyss. The time has come to show that the emperor has no clothes, to strip the garments off the King of Having It Both Ways - before it is too late.

<title>One doesn't boycott the only free society in the Mideast </title>
<date>Fri Jan 28 03:10:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Since it is necessary to spell things out, let’s do so.
Obviously, I have never, directly or indirectly, pressured anyone to cancel a meeting in support of the partisans of the boycott of Israel, with Palestinian Leila Shahid, Frenchman Stephane Hessel and others scheduled to appear, at the Ecole normale superieure in Paris.
This would have been all the more absurd because, by nature and by conviction, I believe in the power of ideas and, even more, in that of the truth. In such circumstances, I am always in favor of debate, the clash of opinions, even the confrontation of convictions − hence, not of censure.
And the fact is that, in this particular circumstance, that is to say in the matter of the BDS ‏campaign that was to be the main subject of the Ecole normale meeting, I would have been more than happy to be able to present those who speak sincerely with facts and, basically, evidence that seems to have escaped them: namely, that we are faced here with a skillfully orchestrated but calumnious, bellicose, anti-democratic and, in a word, despicable campaign.
Why?
First, because one boycotts totalitarian regimes, not democracies. One can boycott Sudan, guilty of the extermination of part of the population of Darfur. One can boycott China, guilty of massive violations of human rights in Tibet and elsewhere. One can and should boycott the Iran that is oppressing Sakineh and Jafar Panahi − a country whose leaders have become deaf to the language of common sense and compromise. One can even imagine, as we once did with regard to the fascist generals’ Argentina or Brezhnev’s USSR, boycotting those Arab regimes whose citizens’ freedom of expression is forbidden, and punished, if necessary, with blood.
One does not boycott the only society in the Middle East where Arabs read a free press, demonstrate when they wish to do so, send representatives to parliament, and enjoy their rights as citizens. Regardless of what one thinks of the policies of its government, one does not boycott the only country in the region and, beyond the region, one of the unfortunately limited number of countries in the world where voters have the power to sanction, modify and reverse the position of said government. To such an extent that finding, like Mr. Hessel, in his recent best-selling book, the source of his “main indignation” in the workings of a democracy that, like all democracies, is by definition imperfect but perfectible ‏(yet, on the contrary, having nothing to say about the millions of victims of Africa’s forgotten wars, about the persecution of Christians in the Middle East, or about the massacre of Bosnia’s Muslims‏) is at best profoundly stupid and at worst, disgraceful.
And then, because, in any event, this boycott campaign is in reality indifferent to the stance of Mr. X or Mrs. Y. on their government. It is unaware of, nor does it care to know, what Israeli citizens themselves think, for example, of the resumption of settlement construction in the West Bank. It doesn’t give a hoot about demands, parameters, actual conditions of peace between the citizens in question and their Palestinian neighbors. Of the latter, their aspirations, their interests, their possible hopes and the way the Hamas regime has smashed those hopes in Gaza, it doesn’t give a tinker’s damn and never says anything, either.
No. Regardless of what its promoters and its useful idiots say, the only real, accepted, hackneyed goal of this boycott campaign is to delegitimize Israel as such. That is what the comparison with the South Africa of apartheid implicitly expresses. That is what the anti-Zionist rhetoric that serves as the common denominator of all the groups constituting the BDS movement explicitly says, and, if words have any meaning, what signifies their intent to undermine the very idea that today, like it or not, binds the Israeli nation. And that is why this campaign, in fact, contravenes the customs, rules and laws of international and, in this case, French or American national law.
And then, lastly, there are those at the heart and, sometimes, at the origin of this campaign whose inspiration is, to say the least, not that of de Gaulle’s Free French nor of those who penned the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, nor of those in favor of a just peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.
I submit, to whomever wishes, the declarations of Omar Barghouti, one of the founders of the Palestinian BDS campaign, affirming that his goal is not two states but two Palestines. And those of Ali Abunimah, co-founder of Electronic Intifada and also opposed to the two-state solution, who does not hesitate to compare Israel to Nazi Germany and this or that of its philosophers to the columnists of Der Stuermer. And the declarations of the leaders of Sabeel, that group of Palestinian Christians firmly implanted in North America, who, anxious to lend the idea of “responsible investment” a “theological” basis, do not hesitate to subtly but surely reactivate the stereotype of the Christ-killing Jew. Not to mention some rather shady initiatives whose purpose is to mark Jewish − sorry, Israeli − merchandise with supposedly derogatory stickers intended for the attention of the vigilant French consumer.
All that is deplorable and, once again, indisputable. Presenting the promoters of this discourse of hatred as victims speaks volumes of the current state of confusion − intellectual and moral − of a Western world one would have hoped had been cured of its worst criminal past.
Philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy is the author, most recently ‏(together with Michel Houellebecq‏), of “Public Enemies: Dueling Writers Take On Each Other and the World” ‏(Random House‏).

<title>Open Rabin's grave </title>
<date>Fri Jul 08 01:57:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Yitzhak Rabin was murdered, and his philosophy along with him. Nobody has had so many presumed heirs: Who hasn't donned his mantle only to remove it at the first opportunity and toss it by the wayside? Who hasn't remained loyal to him only to betray that loyalty out of fear and self interest?
Murdered and buried, at least six feet under. Even a criminal gunned down in an underworld vendetta merits a more serious investigation. Although the gunman was tried and imprisoned, those who supported him are walking around free and self-satisfied among us, and are continuing to cause harm as they did in the past. Having replaced Rabin, they are being fruitful and multiplying and inheriting the land.
Now rabbis are being summoned for futile interrogations. Back then they were not interrogated properly. Nobody ever found out what was said in talks between them and the murderer - what they allowed the scoundrel to do in the name of the Torah.
And what was the lethal influence of politicians, who walked behind his casket when he was still alive; who heard the voice of the people in their enthusiasm, tearing him to shreds in the city square, in SS uniform. They all joined forces at the time to bring an end to the events of 1994-1995, to consign them to oblivion, and even the Shin Bet security services and the police poured dirt over the ground to cover his blood. Rabin is today the deadest of dead men - his memory forgotten.
In late 1998 the subcommittee on intelligence and security services received a report about "the rabbis' activity in connection with Rabin's murder." That is how it appeared on the agenda, at my request. The committee was told, among other things, that already in January, 1995 rabbis from the committee of rabbis of Judea, Samaria and Gaza wrote to 30 of the leading rabbis in Israel and the United States and asked them: Does the law of "rodef" and "moser"  (a Jew who betrays and endangers other Jews ) apply to the prime minister? The Shin Bet stammered and couldn't say whether replies were received and what their contents were. No contact was made at the time with the questioners and the respondents, in order to deter them from this sick preoccupation with dangerous halakhic decisions calling for murderers.
Rabin's assassin Yigal Amir met with additional rabbis - times and names were placed on the committee's desk - but the files were actually empty and closed. No real investigations began before the murder, nor afterwards. The Shin Bet did not fail in its role - it betrayed it. To this day, more is hidden than known.
The time has come to investigate. Most of those involved have resumed their evil ways - if they ever abandoned them - and sin lies at their doorstep. If we had a spirit of national conciliation now, as in post-apartheid South Africa, it would have been possible to continue licking our wounds without opening them. But an ill wind is blowing, which must be eliminated before it sweeps up everything in its path and leaves behind a wasteland.
If the late Prime Minister Menachem Begin decided to investigate the murder of Chaim Arlosoroff after 40 years to settle past accounts, then the murder of Rabin must be investigated after only 16 years because of future accounts. And if the ship Altalena is now being dredged up from the depths, then the three- bullet pistol also has to be brought up from the depths. Can not only a cannon but a pistol become sacred?
Recently the remains of Chile's late elected President Salvador Allende were exhumed, in order to examine them: Did he commit suicide 38 years ago, as was officially claimed, or did Augusto Pinochet's soldiers murder him on the general's orders? The circumstances of the death of poet Pablo Neruda will also be investigated there once again: Was he poisoned or did he die of cancer? Chile wants to know. Does Israel?
We should open Rabin's grave, where the conspiracy woven against him by his internal enemies was buried. He didn't die in his bed from an illness, nor did he commit suicide. The country was very sick, and hasn't been able to recover since then - its fever is only rising, it is bleeding. And any attempt to make peace in its name is like an act of suicide.

<title>Palestinian unity is a chance for Mideast peace between equals</title>
<date>Fri May 06 01:46:00 IDT 2011</date>

Meretz met its demise on January 10, 2009, at the end of the second week of Operation Cast Lead in Gaza. Only then did the chief supporter of a peace agreement with the Palestinians urge its members to publicly oppose the war, after supporting it because it was a war "against Hamas." At the funeral, its spokesmen at the demonstration stood opposite the Defense Ministry and, instead of speaking against the war, they went into contortions to justify it - and themselves.
Then came the elections, and the voters went to Kadima. If the rationale was "negotiations with the Palestinian Authority and war against Hamas," why not Kadima chairwoman MK Tzipi Livni?
This wasn't the first time a peace movement evaporated during a war. One upon a time, there was an organization called Courage to Refuse, born to great yuppie fanfare. But it disappeared with its support for the Second Lebanon War - the first war to cross the officers' paths after they had finished being interviewed everywhere about their courage to refuse. Courage was something they didn't have, not even the courage to say: "This isn't our war."
Granted, there's a herd instinct at work here, and this instinct can be found everywhere - on the right and on the left, in the East and in the West. Just look at the citizens of the greatest power in the world capering as though they had won some tournament.
But this explanation does not suffice. Every manifestation of the herd instinct has a call-up code, and apparently the Israeli herd's code is not only sad songs on the radio. Another element of this herd consciousness has its source in military thinking: The Palestinians are partners only when they are submissive.
The Oslo agreements were signed when the Palestine Liberation Organization was on the brink of economic and political bankruptcy. Thus the agreement's supporters perceived it as an organization that would come crawling and would even import its forces from Tunis to serve as collaborators and control the "locals." As a result, there was an increase in support for Hamas - which, to put it mildly, is not a likable organization.
The collective wail over the agreement just signed between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority is the code the herd will use when the next uprising erupts. Alas and alack, they are refusing to dance to our tune. Yet the truth is that the Palestinians are refusing to crawl mainly because by crawling, they achieved nothing: They bought their legitimization, at least among certain segments of Israel, at the price of total surrender and relinquishing nearly everything.
The rightist lie to the effect that the Palestinians "only take" and "don't give" is logical according to the school of thought that believes if you repeat a lie enough times, it will eventually come true. Nevertheless, the Palestinians have not received anything. On the contrary: Ever since they began the peace process with Israel, their situation has become much worse - ghettoization, poverty and military oppression without any law restraining their Israeli overlords.
When our leaders, especially those who advocate surrender as a condition for peace - President Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Ehud Barak - say it is impossible to reach an agreement with Hamas, they are not only being cynical  (as though they had reached an agreement with the PA ), they are also using the tattered slogans of the 1980s. Yet the fact remains: One doesn't make peace either with friends or with slaves. Moreover, the greater the oppression, the more appalling the opponents of that oppression will be, to match the oppression.
Anyone who doesn't understand that the agreement between Fatah and Hamas reflects a will to live - a preference for Egypt, a relinquishment of reliance on Syria, a search for power - is refusing to understand that the conflict will not end without an agreement between equals. The long adventure of incorporating the occupied territories as downtrodden apartheid zones must end, out of recognition that we, too, are weak.
With Egypt, the establishment wanted an agreement from a position of power. The terrible price tag is written in the military graveyards. Colonialism is dead. And wherever it is maintained, traffic jams clog the roads to the memorial ceremonies.

<title>Philosopher for hire </title>
<date>Fri Sep 09 05:25:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
There is a popular belief that a philosopher's aim is to seek universal truth in a world of competing narratives. As early as the time of Socrates, Western culture viewed the figure of the Sophist, a "philosopher for hire," as contrary to that of the genuine philosopher: While the latter searches for the truth, the former uses his talents to promote interest groups. When Nietzsche taught us that behind every philosophy is a philosopher with his own particularity, he undermined the concept of universal truth and assigned a different purpose to philosophy. After that, many philosophers could only try to reconstruct and deconstruct the shards of truth that remained.
A number of genuine philosophers tried to  rehabilitate the term "universal truth" from the debris, but at the same time, mass culture invented the philosopher of mass communications. This new model cynically exploits the public's trust in the "philosopher" - and its belief that that figure seeks truth - in order to serve the centers of power.
In the same way that the Israel Defense Forces conducted itself when it had the philosopher Asa Kasher create his immoral "ethical code," thus Nicolas Sarkozy and the Ehud Olmert government allowed Bernard-Henri Levy to stamp as "kosher" some of the most unethical codes in Western liberalism.
Last May, Levy published an article in defense of Dominique Strauss-Kahn in Haaretz Hebrew Edition  (it appeared in English in The Huffington Post ). The article contained a repetition of the words "I am angry," along the lines of "J'accuse." Here is my own "I am angry":
I accept the Bernard-Henri Levy who figuratively marched in solidarity with the armed rebels in order to free the Libyan people from the tyrannical rule of Muammar Gadhafi. But I am angry that he chose to march with the Israeli army of occupation when it invaded Gaza during Operation Cast Lead. I'm angry that, instead of joining the flotilla to Gaza, he accosted the unarmed activists who sailed as a solidarity coalition to free the Palestinians from the rule of the violent and prolonged occupation.
I applaud the Bernard-Henri Levy who, in his writings, condemned the dictatorship in Tehran, but I'm angry that he denies the fact that Neda Agha-Soltan, the young woman who was shot to death there by the dictatorship in 2009, and Bassem Abu Rahmeh, who was shot to death by Israeli soldiers in Bil'in that same year, are both victims of a similar oppression.
I applaud the Bernard-Henri Levy who  eloquently described the face of Gilad Shalit - his glance, his fragility and humanity - as it appears in the heartbreaking video from captivity, but I'm angry that, at the same time, he erased the faces of thousands of Palestinian prisoners who have been humiliated for decades in the prisons of the occupation.
I agree with the way in which Bernard-Henri Levy, in an attempt to help his friend Strauss-Kahn, attacked the legal system and media in the United States, claiming that they embody a kind of cannibalism that sacrifices the individual on behalf of slogans and stereotypes of justice. But I'm angry about his thunderous silence when, in an odd, rapid judicial procedure, his friend - a man whose trustworthiness is no less in doubt than that of the woman who accused him - was released without restrictions.
Furthermore, I'm angry that he invented a false theory about the priority given to the victim  (the migrant, the black, the woman ) in the American system - merely to defend his aggressive compatriot. In that way, he collaborated in wiping out the daily injustices done by the American capitalist judicial system to millions of poor, blacks and migrants who are jailed or deported from the country.
I'm angry that, on behalf of a friend, Levy took it upon himself to undermine the credibility of  another woman, Tristane Banon, who filed a  criminal complaint against Strauss-Kahn for alleged attempted rape and who courageously dared to go to the media. In this way, he set the struggle for rape victims' rights back a full generation.
These are the reasons why, in the eyes of many people, Bernard-Henri Levy is perceived not as a philosopher who fights for universal truth, nor as a journalist who seeks justice, but rather as a Jewish soldier in the European foreign legion. He is the servant of two masters who are actually one and the same: the colonial liberal ideology and the Zionist ideology.
Therefore, I call on Bernard-Henri Levy: Kindly be a human being always and everywhere. March with us in September to free Palestine from the occupation and Israel from Zionism. I am not, heaven forbid, asking Sarkozy to send his forces to Israel as he did to fight Gadhafi in Libya; I'm merely proposing that the West stop selling arms to the Israeli army, and that Israel's soldiers refrain from using their weapons when we march to bring down the walls of apartheid.
The Middle East is looking for a new space where there is freedom for all. Bernard-Henri Levy, you said that dictatorships do not remain forever. Therefore, we too shall not stop until, between the Jordan River and the sea, there is justice and equality for every human being.

<title>Protests in Israel are not only legitimate, they're vital</title>
<date>Sun Jul 10 01:32:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Really, why? It's noisy, sometimes dirty, it may even, God help us, cause traffic jams. Tires may even be burned, and in extreme cases, things even get a little violent. It disturbs the peace and wrecks the public order, polluting the air and souring the atmosphere. So why do we need protest, anyway?
The common perception of protests in Israel is that of an irritating public nuisance - superfluous, party-wrecking, wrong and illegal. Only rarely can Israel stomach a demonstration, provided it's a properly organized popular rally, a cultural gathering on a square, obviously with a license from the police. We hear Israeli songs on the PA system, a message from the president at the podium, and only after the end of Shabbat, in good weather.
The protests should be on issues everyone can agree on; either Gilad Shalit or the Rabin assassination, an excellent subject for Israeli protests. Only these two can you demonstrate about and still hope for popular support. This is our civil society and this is the degree of its involvement.
Governments don't like protests, and this is only natural. In Israel, the public doesn't like protests either, which is seriously disconcerting. Any protest here is met with a hostile reaction from the decent public. Protest? Yuck. Whether it's right or wrong, we're better off without it. So any protest at all, minus Shalit and Rabin, is met immediately with a violent reaction from the authorities, who enjoy the backing of much of the media and public.
A rabbi wouldn't come to a police questioning? Get him! A young man throws stones at the police and doesn't hurt anyone? Eight months behind bars  (unless of course he's a settler ). A women's rights activist "interrupts traffic"? Suspended sentence. And of course, a bunch of activists trying to demonstrate in Gaza or the West Bank prompts a hysterical deployment of forces. Anything but protests, thank you very much. We're Israelis and we don't know what democracy is about.
Protests are not only legitimate - they're vital. They're unpleasant and not nice, and they're not always perfectly legal. They can't be any of these things, after all; they're meant to disrupt, not preserve, the existing order. That's what they're for. It's almost embarrassing to write things like this that should be obvious.
A true protest stems from an outpouring of rage, something that hardly ever occurs at protests here. The test of a protest is its righteousness, not its means. Rabbi Dov Lior shouldn't be put on trial for conducting his own sort of protest and refusing to show up for questioning; the rabbi should only be judged for preaching about the killing of Gentile children, not his failure to arrive at a police station - but the important and the marginal have been reversed in this affair.
Virtually the only question that should be asked is: In the name of what? Does Lior protest in favor of killing children? The protest should be condemned. Do draft objectors protest against the killing of children? Their protest is commendable. Do settlers protest in support of a landgrab? Their protest is criminal. Do women break the law in their fight against the imprisonment of a neighboring nation? Their protest is commendable, and to hell with the means they use. The law cannot be above everything if it discriminates and does wrong.
A boycott is also a legitimate instrument, as long as it's for a worthy cause. Even Israel admits it: It boycotts Hamas, Turkey, even overpriced cottage cheese. But boycotting fruits and vegetables from the settlements? This is already illegal, as of this week. History is full of protesters and lawbreakers who became icons. The protests of the blacks against apartheid in South Africa and of their brothers against racial discrimination in the United State were not law-abiding protests. We bow our heads to them in deep appreciation.
One day, Israelis may yet bow their heads to the few protesters, boycotters and lawbreakers here, when they understand that their weapons were legitimate and their cause was right, even when they made noise in the quiet hours between 2 and 4 P.M.

<title>Siege of Gaza has become a moral blockade of Israel</title>
<date>Tue Jul 05 03:13:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
 
Israel is indeed connected to the centers of power in the world. The predictions of a tsunami at present seem to be exaggerated, but nevertheless, before the victory ball, it is worth remembering - the Israeli occupation is the longest military occupation of modern times. The subjects of the occupation in its two forms - the West Bank and the Gaza Strip - live under a brutal regime that few other occupations allowed themselves, without any law - the blockade and the morbidity rate among children, the roadblocks and the arbitrariness of the soldiers, breaking in to people's homes  (imagine your children being awakened at night by the shouting of armed men, breaking down doors and blinding them with flashlights; imagine living without any protection ), the prolonged occupation, a disaster for us and for the Palestinians - because Israel enjoys the support of the West.
The settlements have turned the occupation into something insolvable, at least in the next few decades, so that the occupation will not merely raise another generation of Israeli troopers, egged on by the rabbis of the rabble, but also a third and fourth generation of Palestinians without another kind of life.
The fact that the Gaza Strip has become an international symbol of cruelty is yet further proof of the stupidity of our leaders. Operation Cast Lead and the blockade of Gaza - both of them with broad national consensus - have turned Gaza into a symbol that no longer needs coordination on the part of the Palestinians. Israeli democracy appears as it actually is: In the name of the majority  (six million Jews ) it is permitted to do to the minority  (five million, in Israel and the territories ) almost anything.
The national minority in Israel has the right to vote but it does not have television of its own ; it has health insurance but also heavy unemployment and infant mortality rates that are much higher than among the Jews  (8.3 compared with 3.7 for every 1000 births ). Tel Aviv, which sells itself to the world as a liberal city, is the only metropolis in the West that does not have a Muslim population. Its "coolness" is racist - the 20 percent minority does not appear at all in the life of the city. And it is advisable for propagandists not to point to Jaffa as proof of diversity - Jaffa with its yuppie immigration is a perfect example of apartheid carried out by "secular" and "liberal" Tel Aviv.
Official propaganda, too, will not help. The more pressure Israel brings to bear on centers in the West - countries and media giants - the more the wave against it grows, because the hatred of the occupation and of Israeli racism springs from the knowledge that what Israel does is funded by the West, gets assistance from the West, and from connections with the focuses of power - as a living memorial to colonialism. There is nothing better than the way in which the Greeks thwarted the Gaza aid flotilla's departure to reinforce this. It was not just Greece that thwarted it.
The coalitions that are being organized against Israel in the West include members of the left. There are also many others and not all of them are humanistic. They are not always Jew-lovers. These coalitions will continue to grow as long as the western political community presents itself as "helpless" in the face of Israeli obduracy. Of course it is not helpless, and when it has actual interests, it is capable of behaving in typically western barbaric fashion, as it is doing now in Libya and in Iraq.
The loathing of Israel fits in with the growing anti-establishment wrath, within the context of politics where there is no difference between the parties. The protests in Greece are an example of lack of faith of this kind, which does not spring from the Israeli occupation but from the powerlessness of the masses to influence what is taking place in their countries - economics and war.
Israel is merely one subject out of several that the political - or the apolitical - complaining is busy with. Very few people join flotillas, but many more participate in sending them and even more internalize their oppression. The complaining and mumbling is part of a burgeoning anti-establishment consensus. The record of what is always known as "the hypocritical politicians" has been joined by the hypocritical attitude toward Israeli cruelty.
It is not surprising therefore that the blockade of Gaza is getting tighter in the form of a moral blockade of Israel. Slowly but surely, in a world filled with injustice and war crimes and racism toward minorities and migrants, Israel has learned, during decades of stupidity, how to become the symbol of injustice and these crimes. We are no longer the embodiment of progress, as we were trumpeted as being for a long time, but the exact opposite. And this is truly just the beginning.

<title>Silent no longer </title>
<date>Fri Jul 01 02:11:33 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
 Several weeks ago, in Prague, I participated in a meeting of young Jewish leaders from all over the world. None were part of any political party, although we all belong to a well-established organization affiliated to the World Jewish Congress, and are all committed to the well-being of Israel and Diaspora Jewry. The agenda was rich: discussions on how to fight anti-Semitism and the delegitimization of the Jewish state, and on the Iranian threat and interfaith relations - to name only a few. It was heartening to see these bright and enthusiastic young people prepared to offer the best of themselves to worthy Jewish causes. 
 Naturally, one of the issues that came up was the "unilateral" declaration of Palestinian statehood expected in September at the United Nations. Many mainstream Jewish organizations were eager for us to tackle the issue, and so it was supposed to be one of the first items on the agenda. Except that most of the participants were not enthusiastic, to put it mildly. Not that we thought that the unilateral declaration  is a good thing in itself. But we felt that what was being asked of us - because it was at the heart of the political debate in Israel as well as in the Jewish world - put at risk the cohesiveness of the whole gathering. For what was being demanded was to obey an Israeli injunction to lobby our respective national governments without debate. As if we were soldiers in a battle in which we had no say. And what's worse, soldiers in a unwinnable battle. The unease, however unspoken, was palpable. 
 And then, the most senior of us, a former high-ranking American Jewish official, and a hard-liner at that when it comes to Israel, spoke up. "Drop the issue," he said, "leave the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to the Israelis. You focus on the core, consensual issues of Jewish concern. Otherwise, we are doomed to split." A sigh of relief was perceptible. 
 What a strange phenomenon, I thought. There we were, a group of dedicated Zionist Jews, veterans of all the relevant battlegrounds of our time - Durban I and II, the Red Cross, Interpol and the UN Human Rights Council - now reluctant to embark on a campaign that had been classified by the Israeli government as its top diplomatic priority! 
 A week later, another gathering, in another European capital. Delegations from all over the EU came to Paris to mark the first anniversary of JCall, the European version of the American J Street. The hall was full of people very different from my colleagues in Prague. They included prominent intellectuals and other luminaries of Jewish civil society. The mood was bleak. 
 One after the other, the orators expressed their feeling of deep love for and commitment to the Jewish state, and at the same time, bewilderment in the face of the erratic, if not suicidal, behavior of its government. They talked about the growing isolation of Israel, the prospect of a third intifada that seemed inevitable considering the current stalemate of the so-called "peace process," the mounting wave of Arab protest - and yes, the rapidly approaching September vote. They complained about the sheep-like kowtowing of self-styled Jewish leadership in the Diaspora to the empty slogans of the current Israeli government. And they stated, once and again, what should be obvious: Being a Zionist does not necessarily mean being a Greater Israel activist. Quite the opposite, in fact, as the settlement frenzy is likely to bury the Zionist dream altogether. 
 In a way, the Paris event was the answer to the uneasiness we felt in Prague. The September unilateral declaration is not the real problem. The truth is that more and more Jews outside Israel have simply ceased to understand what on earth the government in Jerusalem stands for and where it is leading its nation, and with it, the whole Jewish people. This is not even a matter of left or right, but of plain logic: No country can "dwell alone" forever, not even North Korea. And Israel, "the only democracy in the Middle East," is not North Korea. 
 No country can survive in a hostile environment when it dooms itself to be a binational state. A binational state will eventually have to choose between equally unacceptable alternatives of apartheid or civil war. And no country can nurture a vibrant democracy at the same time that it is an occupying power. Democracy, after all, is about freedom and equality before the law. 
 Israeli brothers and sisters: Don't let yourselves be misled by the standing ovation that your prime minister enjoyed on Capitol Hill in May, for that was all about American politics. And don't get excited by the unflinching support of AIPAC, for that's all about Jewish American politics. Do listen to the mounting murmur of despair from the Diaspora, from the depths of the Jewish silent majority, which is less and less silent. 
 JCall was founded around an "appeal to reason." Isn't it about time to take heed of the voice of reason?

<title>The gap is narrowing between IDF and ultra-Orthodox customs</title>
<date>Fri Oct 28 03:49:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Never has the evil inclination been so evil and contagious. Kids turn into billy goats and heroes must struggle to overcome their urges on all fronts.
A month ago cadets left a pep rally after a female soldier-singer exposed her nakedness - with her voice. And last week, during the post-Simhat Torah celebration, hundreds of female soldiers were ordered to stay away from the celebrants and gather in a fenced-off area. The female commanders left in protest and returned to their base. It's a shame they didn't go home for good until they received an apology from the two brigadier generals who were present and didn't intervene. What's happening here all of a sudden? Have the emergency warehouses run out of baking soda to suppress our sexual urges?
The distance between the Israel Defense Forces and Mea She'arim is getting shorter. Although that ultra-Orthodox neighborhood in Jerusalem doesn't have any draftees, its spirit hovers over the ranks. In both places there is a separation between women and men, between masculine and feminine areas, while the High Court of Justice says this is forbidden. How very nice of it to do so.
And why shouldn't they expand the boundaries of separation if the gender-segregated buses continue to operate - young men in front and virgins in back - and the government subsidizes this gender-based apartheid. In New York too there was a report this week about a segregated bus line, and the mayor immediately declared: "Private people: You can have a private bus. Go rent a bus and do what you want on it."
It's clear that New York will mend its ways before Jerusalem, because the shtreimel-wearing shebab bow their heads before the authorities, and only here will they raise their heads. For from Zion shall exclusion come forth, for in Jerusalem ethnic and gender-based purification is taking place, women are disappearing from the public space, erased from ads and billboards. And the mayor fires his deputy for daring to turn to the courts to avenge the honor of her sisters.
"Don't judge someone until you've stood in his shoes," and we are trying to reach it, if not the place itself, then nearby. It's very hard to be a Jew who both guards his homeland and strictly observes the commandments; it's hard to be a brave soldier when there are so many Jewish Delilahs around.
It's hard to see 6-year-old child Liliths studying together with boys their own age; the holy community of Beit Shemesh is already working to change the situation. And it's hard to be a bagger standing behind the female cashiers at the supermarket, who stand or sit, and sometimes bend over, may God preserve them, and us.
Even religious Zionism has fallen victim to ultra-Orthodox fanaticism. More educational institutions are separating the sexes, and religious Zionism's youth movement is also trying to save young souls. It would be preferable for Bnei Akiva's girls to wrap themselves in black rags like the Taliban.
The modesty brigades go outside the walls, and now they're attacking the kibbutzim. I couldn't believe a friend who told me about Kibbutz Ashdot Ya'akov  (Ihud ), which recently held a Simhat Torah celebration in strictly Orthodox style - men in one place, women in another. Who will remove the dust from the eyes of the pioneer women who chiseled stones on the Tzemah-Tiberias road, who with the sweat of their brows cultivated the vegetable garden at the Kinneret farm? Had there not already been so many eulogies for the kibbutz movement, another one would have been added here.
Never has the status of women in Israel been so high, and never has it been so low. A woman is the president of the Supreme Court, while women head the protest movement and two political parties, with a third on the way. The day will come when they are asked to sit in the balcony of the Knesset, like in the synagogue. Male MKs won't protest their marginalization too loudly for fear that pious rabbis will attack them in their sermons.

<title>The mistake of what's left of the left </title>
<date>Tue Apr 26 01:53:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Benjamin Netanyahu's weak spot involves Israel's dependency on "world opinion," meaning the opinion of the Western establishments, and the fact that most of them do indeed disagree with Israel's conduct, which has hardly changed over the years. The deepening occupation, which is clearly becoming apartheid, despite the legal reservations about the word's definition, are the Labor Party's heritage. Some of the party's leaders are still causing damage, including Ehud Barak, under whose term as prime minister the settlements expanded the most; Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, who started building the apartheid "bypass routes" and founded the East Jerusalem settlement at Jebl Abu Gheniem, now known as Har Homa; and Shimon Peres, the ambassador who makes the occupation kosher.
The Israeli intelligentsia, a remnant of the former Israeli left, still influences the media  (why deny this? ). Its dissatisfaction annoys Netanyahu because it keeps him from appearing as the representative of all Israelis. Currently the West does not care how much he represents Israelis, because he does not represent the millions of Palestinians under Israel's boot. These people have no representation at all.
Netanyahu's weakness stems from the fact that he does not offer the West phrases with two meanings like Peres does - phrases like "when people talk, they don't shoot." The love between Peres and Western officials was forged amid idle chatter about peace, as the occupation entrenched itself. And thus, if Western governments want an agreement, or if they need the politics of peace with its champagne and shrimp, due to "the anxiety over the dreadful bloodshed in the region," Netanyahu is not providing. This is his main weakness.
Wars do not really worry the Western peace-lovers so long as oil prices are steady and their vacations are uninterrupted. The Israeli elites are much the same. They are not concerned about the Palestinians under the prolonged military dictatorship and the risk of war. The hopes that many Israelis - the remnants of the left - pin on the West stem from a false image: "We" fulfill the values of the enlightened West in our country, they say, so why does the enlightened West not act according to its/our values and do something?
After all, the occupation is morally wrong, so why not bring back forced withdrawals, say the remnants of the left as they sit in front of their televisions, which broadcast images of prospering settlers, and save us from fighting the right's main power base? Why shouldn't the West release us from the daily politics of persuading Israelis, including the settlers, that the settlements are indeed the main obstacle to peace? Well, nothing of the sort is going to happen, only assassinations, terrorist attacks, funerals, arrests, torture, roadblocks, F-16 attacks and "precise" shellings.
After 44 years, Israel and the occupation are a huge tank that cannot reverse and can only advance. Only together can the Israelis and the Palestinians can be freed from the occupation. It cannot be done through a lie about "direct negotiations," only by a popular Palestinian struggle against the occupation, with patriotic Israeli help. The Israeli slogan must be "The intifada is not against us and we are not against it," in the name of a good life. It is doubtful whether the prayer books of any other people include a daily prayer for earning a living and having a good life.

<title>The necessary elimination of Israeli democracy</title>
<date>Fri Nov 25 08:20:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Speaking in the Knesset in January 1993, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said, "Iran is in the initial stages of an effort to acquire nonconventional capability in general, and nuclear capability in particular. Our assessment is that Iran today has the appropriate manpower and sufficient resources to acquire nuclear arms within 10 years. Together with others in the international community, we are monitoring Iran's nuclear activity. They are not concealing the fact that the possibility that Iran will possess nuclear weapons is worrisome, and this is one of the reasons that we must take advantage of the window of opportunity and advance toward peace."
At that time, Israel had a strategy - which began to be implemented in the Oslo accords, put an end to the priority granted the settlement project and aimed to improve the treatment of Israel's Arab citizens.
If things had gone differently, the Iran issue might look different today. However, as it turned out, the Oslo strategy collided with another, stronger ideology: the ideology of Gush Emunim  (Bloc of the Faithful ), which since the 1970s, apart from the Oslo period and the time of the withdrawal from Gaza, has established the concrete basis for the actions of Israel's governments. Even governments that were ostensibly far removed from the Gush Emunim strategy implemented it in practice. Ehud Barak boasted that, in contrast to other prime ministers, he did not return territory to the Palestinians - and there's no need to point out once again the increase in the number of settlers during his tenure. The government of Ehud Olmert, which declared its intention to move toward a policy of hitkansut  (or "convergence," another name for what Ariel Sharon termed "disengagement" ) in Judea and Samaria, held talks with senior Palestinians on an agreement but did not stop the settlement enterprise, which conflicts with the possibility of any agreement.
The strategy that follows from the ideology of Gush Emunim is clear and simple: It perceives of the Six-Day War as the continuation of the War of Independence, both in terms of seizure of territory, and in its impact on the Palestinian population. According to this strategy, the occupation boundaries of the Six-Day War are the borders that Israel must set for itself. And with regard to the Palestinians living in that territory - those who did not flee or were not expelled - they must be subjected to a harsh regime that will encourage their flight, eventuate in their expulsion, deprive them of their rights, and bring about a situation in which those who remain will not be even second-class citizens, and their fate will be of interest to no one. They will be like the Palestinian refugees of the War of Independence; that is their desired status. As for those who are not refugees, an attempt should be made to turn them into "absentees." Unlike the Palestinians who remained in Israel after the War of Independence, the Palestinians in the territories should not receive Israeli citizenship, owing to their large number, but then this, too, should be of interest to no one.
The ideology of Gush Emunim springs from religious, not political motivations. It holds that Israel is for the Jews, and it is not only the Palestinians in the territories who are irrelevant: Israel's Palestinian citizens are also exposed to discrimination with regard to their civil rights and the revocation of their citizenship.
This is a strategy of territorial seizure and apartheid. It ignores judicial aspects of territorial ownership and shuns human rights and the guarantees of equality enshrined in Israel's Declaration of Independence. It is a strategy of unlimited patience; what is important is the unrelenting progress toward the goal. At the same time, it is a strategy that does not pass up any opportunity that comes its way, such as the composition of the present Knesset and the unclear positions of the prime minister.
The term "apartheid" refers to the undemocratic system of discriminating between the rights of the whites and the blacks, which once existed in South Africa. Even though there is a difference between the apartheid that was practiced there and what is happening in the territories, there are also some points of resemblance. There are two population groups in one region, one of which possesses all the rights and protections, while the other is deprived of rights and is ruled by the first group. This is a flagrantly undemocratic situation.
Since the Six-Day War, there has been no other group in Israel with the ideological resilience of Gush Emunim, and it is not surprising that many politicians have viewed that ideology as a means for realizing personal political ambitions. Zevulun Hammer, who identified this ideology as the way to capture the leadership of the National Religious Party, and Ariel Sharon, who identified this ideology as the way to capture the leadership of Likud, were only two of many. Now Avigdor Lieberman, too, is following this path, but there were and are others, such as the late Hanan Porat, for whom the realization of this ideology was and remains the purpose of their political activity.
This ideology views the creation of an Israeli apartheid regime as a necessary tool for its realization. It has no difficulty with illegal actions and with outright criminality, because it rests on mega-laws that it has adopted and that have no connection with the laws of the state, and because it rests on a perverted interpretation of Judaism. It has scored crucial successes. Even when actions inspired by the Gush Emunim ideology conflict with the will of the government, they still quickly win the backing of the government. The fact that the government is effectively a tool of Gush Emunim and its successors is apparent to everyone who has dealings with the settlers, creating a situation of force multiplication.
This ideology has enjoyed immense success in the United States, of all places. President George H.W. Bush was able to block financial guarantees to Israel because of the settlements established by the government of Yitzhak Shamir  (who said lying was permissible to realize the Gush Emunim ideology. Was Benjamin Netanyahu's Bar-Ilan University speech a lie of this kind? ). Now, though, candidates for the Republican Party's presidential nomination are competing among themselves over which of them supports Israel and the occupation more forcefully. Any of them who adopt the approach of the first President Bush will likely put an end to their candidacy.
Whatever the reason for this state of affairs - the large number of evangelicals affiliated with the Republican party, the problematic nature of the West's relations with Islam, or the power of the Jewish lobby, which is totally addicted to the Gush Emunim ideology - the result is clear: It is not easy, and may be impossible, for an American president to adopt an activist policy against Israeli apartheid.
Legalizing the illegal 
 
Because of its inherent illegality, at least in democratic terms, an apartheid regime cannot abide opposition or criticism. The Gush Emunim ideology is obliged to eliminate them both, and to prevent every effort to block its activity, even if that activity is illegal and even criminal, and intended to maintain apartheid. The illegal activity needs to be made legal, whether through the emendation of laws or through changing their judicial interpretation − such things have occurred before, in other places and at other times.
 
Against this background, we are now seeing the campaign of legislation against -- and the unbridled slandering of -- the Supreme Court, against human rights organizations and against the press, as well as the passage of the so-called Boycott Law, which is aimed at preventing the possibility of Israeli apartheid being dealt with in the same way as South African apartheid. It is against this same background that we have seen the advancement of legislation directed against the Arab citizens of Israel, such as the Loyalty Law and the proposal for a “Basic Law of Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People.” And it is against this background that a campaign of incitement and intimidation is being waged against the necessary and justified critique being voiced by members of academia.
 
The Supreme Court, which permitted the settlement project and effectively collaborated with the Gush Emunim ideology, has now become an obstacle that needs to be removed - in the eyes of those who still adhere to that ideology - primarily because the court refuses to recognize the possibility of settling on privately owned Palestinian land and did not overturn the government decision to evacuate the settlements in the Gaza Strip. Because the land belongs to the Jews by divine decree  and history (from this perspective, there are similarities between Gush Emunim and Hamas ), there is no choice but to elect to the Supreme Court justices who live on Palestinian land, possibly private land, and those who understand that there is no such thing as "land under private Palestinian ownership."
Similarly, this line of thinking goes, the Supreme Court's interpretation of human rights laws also requires its elimination in its present format. Judgments such as those relating to the Kaadan family  (allowing an Arab family to build a home in a Jewish community ); the selling of Jewish National Fund land to Arab citizens of Israel; the amendment to the Citizenship Law  (no ruling has yet been handed down, but there seems to be a possibility that a majority of justices will rule it illegal ); the opening of a highway to Palestinian traffic - all these rulings conflict with essential elements in Gush Emunim ideology: the discrimination between Jews and Palestinians  (in Israel and the territories ) and the deprivation of the Palestinians' rights, which transform them into second-class people, absentees or, best of all, refugees.
Does an Israel of this kind have a future? Over and beyond the question of whether Jewish morality and the Jewish experience allow such circumstances to exist, it is clear that this is a flagrantly unstable and even dangerous situation. It is a situation that will prevent Israel from fully realizing its vast potential, a situation of living by the sword - a sword that could be a third intifada, the collapse of peace with Egypt and a confrontation with a nuclear Iran. Yitzhak Rabin understood that.

<title>The right context </title>
<date>Fri Nov 25 02:03:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
The government frequently tries to justify its anti-democratic bills by comparing them to laws in democratic states.  For example, it contends that the newly proposed bills  regarding the nomination procedures for Supreme Court justices reflect the process used in the United States. When the coalition passes anti-Arab legislation like the "Nakba law," which lets the finance minister cut the budgets of publicly funded institutions that commemorate the Nakba, it argues that we have to defend Israel's values as a "Jewish and democratic" state, by citing the German legal principle of "militant democracy." The government also has made similar comparisons to justify bills that would severely limit foreign funding to local human rights organizations.
It is important for governments to compare themselves with other nations. Given the current state of affairs, it is perhaps even a good sign that the Netanyahu coalition still believes it needs international legitimacy to justify these bills. However, when a comparison does not consider the other nations' social, political and historical circumstances, it can be inaccurate and misleading. It is true that some of the worst crimes against  humanity have been committed by "Western" democracies: the Holocaust, slavery, apartheid and segregation. But today, regimes such as those in Germany, South Africa and the U.S., whatever their defects, are based on fundamental civil rights and respect for separation of powers.
The U.S. Supreme Court has a long and distinguished history of constitutional review; it has intervened in numerous laws passed by Congress and in executive political decisions. A decade ago, in Bush v. Gore, it even decided who would be president, based on a majority vote of just one justice. No political leader called for limiting the court's power in response to this decision, which was fully implemented.
While U.S. citizens elected an African-American president, in Israel the Knesset tries to disqualify the Arab minority's political parties from every election because those parties advocate full equality and inclusion, "a state for all of its citizens." When  Germans use the term "militant democracy," they are referring to defending the rights of ethnic minorities from racist politicians. And while the EU wants to promote human rights abroad, the Netanyahu government seems far less committed to these values than it does to limiting the EU's ability to promulgate them in  Israel, by its repeated attempts to restrict NGO funding.
The disingenuity of the government's international comparisons is evident when one compares politicians' rhetoric for audiences within Israel with the diplomatic discourse they employ abroad. At home, this government harshly criticizes the Supreme Court; abroad, the Foreign Ministry boasts proudly that Israel has the world's strongest high court. While officials criticize former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak's rulings regarding  Palestinian cases, the Foreign Ministry hands out a booklet at conferences abroad listing these same cases as evidence that Israel is committed to the rule of law and democratic values. While right-wing lawmakers incite daily against Arab Knesset members,  Israeli officials support their argument that Israel is not an apartheid state by raising the fact of Arab Knesset representation.
An American friend reported happily to me how he had heard an Israeli right-wing diplomat praising the NGO I lead, Adalah: The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, as an  example of Israel's commitment to its Arab citizens' rights. What my friend did not know is that at home, the foreign minister attacks Adalah and other human rights groups daily.
In the past, we human-rights litigators tended to cite progressive rulings by Western countries' national courts when we argued before Israel's Supreme Court. Lately, we have been finding that the most effective comparisons are to Western nations during their darker days. Even during segregation and apartheid, these countries' national courts sometimes succeeded in defending  human rights. For example, to challenge the new anti-boycott law, which prohibits publicly promoting boycotts of Israeli institutions and settlements, a good comparison would be to the U.S. during segregation, when the Supreme Court defended the freedom of expression of black institutions such as the NAACP when they boycotted racist white companies and state services. In making the case against the Israeli citizenship law, which banned family unification in Israel between Palestinian-Israeli citizens and their Palestinian spouses from the West Bank and Gaza, the best comparison is a landmark decision by a South African court that struck down the apartheid-era policy, which banned family unification between blacks in urban cities. During the Supreme Court  hearing on the Nakba law last month, the state argued that no country would allow some of its citizens to mark its Independence Day as a day of mourning. We responded that not only do many natives in settler countries such as the U.S., Canada,  Australia and New Zealand still perceive the national Independence Day as a tragedy, but those states have in many cases apologized and recognized their historical injustice, and even fund some of the native populations' commemorative days.
Regarding the NGO funding laws, apartheid South Africa  behaved entirely differently than Israel's government is seeking to do now: There, the regime did not prohibit the U.S. and  European countries from funding human rights organizations; rather, the human rights organizations threatened the donor states that they would stop taking funds from them if these states did not boycott the apartheid regime.
Maybe it is better, therefore, when comparing this government's legislation, to do so in the right context.

<title>The settler leader who led Israelis to disaster</title>
<date>Fri Oct 07 04:31:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
There were so many accolades and so much praise that I found myself getting confused. Was this the same Hanan Porat that I also knew? True, he was an idealist, and charismatic, and modest, and he always said what he felt in his heart. True, also, that he was the great leader of Gush Emunim. But we must not forget, and this is the tragic part of the story, that his biggest success - covering the West Bank with a carpet of Israeli settlements - was also the greatest disaster that befell the people of Israel.
My father used to say that Hanan Porat was a very dangerous man. He looked so nice, so handsome, and he always smiled a smile of pure olive oil, so that you would become confused and charmed by him and wouldn't notice that he was leading you, pied piper-style to a disaster.
His admirers pointed out this week what a gigantic contribution he had made to the settlement enterprise on the West Bank. But Porat did not make do with Judea and Samaria. He was a maximalist. He wanted everything. When Menachem Begin signed the peace treaty with Egypt, he attacked him with fury and joined MK Geula Cohen, who bolted the Likud to form the rightwing Tehiya Party. Because even in return for peace with Egypt he believed it was forbidden to return even one grain of sand in Sinai. Imagine our situation in the 32 years that have since passed without  (even a cold ) peace with Cairo. How many soldiers would have been killed, how many wars would have broken out, how many tens of billions of shekels would have been wasted?
That was also Porat's approach with regard to evacuating Gush Katif. From his point of view, even the Gaza Strip, with its 1.5 million Arabs, was ours and we should not give up even one clod of its earth, despite the fact that it was not part of the Land of Israel.
Immediately after the Yom Kippur War, Porat understood that if he could fill Judea and Samaria with dozens of settlements and hundreds of thousands of settlers, no government would be able to evacuate the territories and arrive at a peace agreement because no government would have sufficient strength and resources to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people. In that way, we would remain forever in Judea and Samaria and continue to live  (or to die ) by the sword.
Porat and Moshe Levinger, with their messianic enthusiasm, began to realize this strategy at the train station in Sebastia, in the winter of 1975, when then-Defense Minister Shimon Peres bowed to the pressures and granted permission to set up a temporary settlement at the Kadum army camp near Nablus. From that one settlement, Kedumim, 150 settlements have since sprung up and they have turned Israel into an apartheid state that is despised in the world, threatened from every direction, and left  (almost ) without a single friend. Turkey lashes out at us, Egypt expels our diplomats, the Jordanian monarch is in despair, the German chancellor reprimands us, and only American President Barack Obama is still suffering in silence. But there is one achievement - it is not possible to arrive at a peace agreement.
The continued occupation and the cruel acts in the territories - from stealing lands to burning mosques - are threatening our very existence. Because world public opinion is turning against us, and in democratic regimes public opinion, at the end of the day, determines the tune for the government. The abuse in the territories is also in total contradiction to the moral teachings of Israel's prophets - Amos, Isaiah, and Jeremiah - but Porat and his colleagues knew only the Book of Joshua.
The settlement in the territories also has an economic angle. That is because the massive and expensive construction there comes precisely at the expense of the Negev and Galilee. The construction of the settlements, the expensive infrastructures in the mountains, paving the roads, giving the settlers houses that are half free, the huge security expenses, the reductions in taxes for settlers and investors, the granting of excessive rights for education, the double budgets for the local authorities - all these tens of billions have come at the expense of the residents of Israel's outlying regions and at the expense of budgets for education, welfare and infrastructures within the Green Line. When will we comprehend that?
Indeed Porat was an honest man, and he had a vision which actually managed to change the face of reality. But all of that merely strengthens the need to argue with his opinions and deeds. In Barbara Tuchman's famous book, "The March of Folly," there are several examples of historic decisions which changed the face of reality, but led people to disaster. The settlement enterprise in the territories is another chapter in that book.

<title>Time to focus on transparency </title>
<date>Fri Jul 22 02:21:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Since the notorious NGO Forum of the 2001 Durban Conference on racism, a wide spectrum of nongovernmental organizations have implemented a coordinated isolation and demonization strategy against Israel, of which the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement is a key component. Influential and well-financed Israeli and Palestinian NGOs are very active in their use of this strategy, and in a democratic society such as ours, their claims and agendas should not be immune from criticism and debate.
However, two pieces of legislation - the newly passed "anti-boycott law" and a proposal, sponsored by MK Fania Kirshenbaum of Yisrael Beiteinu, that aimed to open an official inquiry into the funding of NGOs accused of being involved in delegitimization - are more likely to polarize Israelis, as well as Diaspora Jews, than to shed light or encourage informed criticism. The parliamentary and public debates surrounding these initiatives demonstrate their intense political nature, as both ends of the ideological spectrum ignore the complex and substantive issues that are involved.
Many on the right tend to portray NGOs that use the language of human rights as enemies of Israel, without distinction, while on the left, the tendency is to paint criticism of their actions as "McCarthyist" and as heralding the "death of Israeli democracy."
Neither of these ideological responses helps Israel combat the real threat from delegitimization - in the form of lawfare, BDS, Durban III and various other "mini-Durban" conferences held by the UN - nor do they address the root problem of foreign government funding to political advocacy NGOs. Instead, these partisan activities, which ignore broad and legitimate concerns, feed the demonization, and increase the divisions within Israeli society.
The right's tactics provide more ammunition for Israel's most ardent critics to assert that Israeli democracy is under siege, further contributing to the country's isolation. Attacking the legitimacy of Israel's parliament and judicial system are common tactics in the Durban strategy, and both new pieces of legislation provide more examples for critics to reference.
On the left of Israeli politics, the intense condemnation of the new BDS law, and the plan to challenge it in the High Court, are indicative of a strong democracy, not of its decline. Many NGOs on the left also misrepresent the new law and the BDS movement by saying that the boycotts' targets are limited to "settlements" and occupation. But, instead of engaging in substantive public debate on how foreign government funding to NGOs sustains the BDS movement, manipulates Israeli politics, supports lawfare campaigns, and amplifies rhetoric of "apartheid" and "war crimes," these NGOs divert attention through false claims.
The problematic, nontransparent nature of massive foreign government funding to political NGOs continues. It is too soon to know whether earlier legislation, based on the public's right to know, and adopted February 21, 2011, will bring an end to this secrecy. However, the litany of new Knesset legislation on NGOs and boycotts is likely to divert attention from the funding transparency issue.
While preaching democracy and good government to others, European officials blatantly violate the basic principles of funding transparency and open debate. Great secrecy hides all aspects of the processes through which the EU funds groups such as Yesh Din, Adalah - the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, as well as many Palestinian groups.
Swiss parliament members, for example, recently held an unprecedented debate on their government's funding of the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic activities of the BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and Refugee Rights. BADIL promotes BDS, rejects the U.S. roadmap for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative, and also employs demonizing language such as "Israel's colonial apartheid regime" and "systematic ethnic cleansing." BADIL awarded a prize to a crude anti-Semitic cartoon in its 2010 Al-Awda Nakba competition, and published it on its website.
In May 2011, the Swiss government reportedly froze funding for BADIL. The British government has also ended funding for some political advocacy NGOs. There are many other examples of NGO funding throughout Europe, however, that have not been addressed. Instead of initiating a flood of problematic legislation, Knesset members should raise this with their European counterparts.
Neither the anti-boycott law nor the proposed inquiry committee will change funding practices of European governments for political advocacy NGOs. Rather, a parliamentary inquiry into abuses of NGO funding would be most useful in the European context, since this is the main source of money for the BDS campaigns and other forms of demonization. But until that occurs, Israeli politicians should refrain from counterproductive legislation that encourages the delegitimization movement, instead of providing effective mechanisms to combat it.

<title>Toward a new settlement enterprise </title>
<date>Mon Mar 14 01:31:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
In a typical Pavlovian reaction, the ministerial committee on settlements has decided to build 500 housing units in response to the murder at Itamar. We are so accustomed to this conduct that we may not even realize how destructive it is, sticking Israel deeper and deeper into territories not its own, wasting public money and impeding any possible future solution.
But what are 500 housing units compared with 50,000? This is the destructive building impetus that Netanyahu has offered in his new plan, which has already earned heaps of scorn: a year and a half of accelerated permits, hasty planning, trampling of open spaces, construction of white elephants and prices that will not go down.
As the son of an historian, Netanyahu should start internalizing: The settlement enterprise is over. It is possible to insist on adding to it housing units, roads and laws against boycotts, but it is over - be this in an agreement with the Palestinians, in a war with a state they will establish unilaterally, in the waning and evaporation of the Apartheid state, or in a binational state. In any case, this is the end of settlements by the State of Israel in Judea and Samaria.
To a large extent, the settlement project in the occupied territories is the Jewish-capitalist pendulum reaction to the secular-socialist settlement project in Israel's early years - all part of the internal Jewish struggle for ownership of the state and the land. Both of these grand projects have had destructive effects on those who were not partner to them. Now the time has come for the pendulum to stabilize in the middle, in a place where it is possible to live. What needs to be built today is the next phase of the State of Israel.
The plan that should be coming out today is one for resettlement of the Jewish settlers in the territories. Not "evacuation-compensation" that gives them money and then forgets about them, but rather a call to rise up and walk within the boundaries of the state and seek their next home. A call to resettle, in their own free time, as individuals or as groups, in one of the wonderful locations the State of Israel has to offer. It is an opportunity to leverage the fact that the settlers are not residents of the overpriced and overcrowded center of the country and offer them an excellent quality of life in the Negev or the Galilee.
The committees that should be formed are regional committees, which in consultation with the heads of the local authorities, existing planning bodies (which should be supplemented with professional manpower ) and representatives of government offices will meet with the re-settlers and offer them apartments, homes and neighborhoods suited to the way of life they seek, as well as a package of incentives to give them the best possible start when making their move. Perhaps it is even possible to think about a new role for the kibbutzim in this context.
Of course, the hardcore ideological third of the settlers will not agree to meet with any committee. But two-thirds of the 330,000 people now living outside the borders of the state will be glad to have the opportunity for a good life without the risk of evacuation. Such a plan would bring excellent people to communities hungering for people like them, it would provide an opportunity to upgrade social services in communities they join, and it would enable good, good, yet gradual, development for all concerned.
When Israel wants to do things like this, it knows how: Just witness the relocation of the Israel Defense Forces to the south, to the metropolis of Be'er Sheva. The army is evacuating land in the center of the country, receiving new and upgraded infrastructures and bringing excellent people and worthwhile employment opportunities to areas where they are welcomed them with open arms.
Instead of throwing away hundreds of millions on 500 destructive housing units, the same money could be used to construct cultural, educational and health facilities in Mitzpeh Ramon, Carmiel, Dimona and Tiberias for the benefit of the inhabitants there and those who will join them. Such a plan could be carried out today even without committing to a future agreement with the Palestinians, just by looking inwards, at the state of Israel, at its needs and at what will advance it in the future. And no emergency plan.
Enough with emergencies. Israel needs space to breathe, reasonable planning and a gradual transition. Not a disengagement and not staking claims to bits of land in the dark of night. It needs a phase of sanity.

<title>Why should anyone believe Netanyahu?</title>
<date>Mon Nov 14 02:39:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
If the law enabled putting leaders on trial for serial defrauding of the public and obtaining support through deception, Prime Minister Benjamin   Netanyahu would be keeping company with Moshe Katsav in prison. The former president has been convicted of raping women who were his subordinates and misuse of his authority. Netanyahu is having his nefarious way with Israeli democracy and using his status in order to lead Israeli society astray, all the way to diplomatic and economic isolation. From there it is but a short way to regional war and apartheid - the only question is which will come first. Yet nevertheless, a whole country is continuing to give in willingly to a liar who does not cease to harass and endanger it.
Have I exaggerated? How many politicians, media people and ordinary citizens believe Netanyahu is sincerely interested in reaching a peace agreement with the Palestinians? The reference, of course, is not to an agreement that will include Israeli control over the Jordan Valley for 40 years, as Netanyahu proposed recently to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
During the course of a condolence visit to one of the Jewish settlements at the end of the 1990s, Netanyahu bragged that he had succeeded in deceiving the Clinton administration during his first term as prime minister, in order to destroy the Oslo Accords. Believing the microphones and cameras had been turned off, Netanyahu related how he had extorted from the Clinton administration, in exchange for the Hebron agreement, a promise that Israel would be the sole entity entitled to define what the "military sites" are that will remain under its control. With a sly smile spread across his face, Bibi added: "I said that as far as I am concerned the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military site," and explained: "Why is this important? Because from that moment I stopped the Oslo Accords."
Yitzhak Shamir, Netanyahu's predecessor in the Likud leadership, put this in simple words: "For the Land of Israel it is permissible to lie." Netanyahu, a student of conservative American media advisor Arthur Finkelstein, has a more sophisticated formulation. In a lecture at a Likud conference in Eilat in July 2001, Bibi instructed the activists: "It doesn't matter if justice is on your side. You have to depict your position as just."
Eventually he gave this procedure the broadest possible interpretation. Though in all likelihood he had not forgotten when he came into this world  (October 21, 1949 ), he was able to recount a formative encounter with British soldiers near his childhood home, even though the Mandate had ended well before his birth.
The things French President Nicolas Sarkozy told United States President Barack Obama sum up the reputation he has acquired abroad. The microphone that had been left open by mistake pulled away the diplomatic mask and revealed the two important leaders' opinion of the prime minister of Israel. This was preceded by a meeting between Sarkozy and President Shimon Peres at the beginning of 2010 at the Elysee Palace, during the course of which the French president said: "I don't understand where Netanyahu is going and what he wants."
An equally important European leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, also joined the club of people affected by Netanyahu's lies. Her opinion of the prime minister's peace declarations did not make its way to the microphones, but according to a report by Barak Ravid in Haaretz in February, Merkel told Netanyahu in a phone conversation: "You have disappointed us. You have not taken a single step to advance peace."
On the eve of the most recent meeting between Netanyahu and Obama in New York, it was leaked to The New York Times that Obama had told his advisors he didn't believe Netanyahu would ever be prepared to carry out compromises leading to a peace agreement. Prior to that Steven Simon, Senior Director for Middle East and North Africa at the White House, revealed in a conference call with Jewish community leaders in the United States that the Palestinians had agreed to renew the negotiations on the basis of Obama's outline  (the 1967 lines and agreed exchanges of territories ) and that the ball was now in Netanyahu's court.
As is known, Bibi depicts President Abbas as refusing to enter negotiations. With a trove of lies like this, is Bibi expecting "the world" to believe he intends to attack Iran's nuclear installations and tighten the sanctions on Iran? Why shouldn't they suspect that maybe all the ruckus about the bomb is intended only to distance the threat of peace, and therefore not lift a finger against the Iranian threat?

<title>World looks at Israel as it looked at Apartheid-era South Africa</title>
<date>Wed Mar 09 00:50:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Whether or not Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu uses "a supertanker against the bureaucracy," as he calls it, to alleviate the housing shortage, a no-fly zone for supertankers already exists. It exists whether his idea crashes in the Knesset debates on housing reforms, or flies high above the railway line that's supposed to be extended to Irbid in Jordan - in the East, where there are no procedures or bureaucracy.
Here is its description, from an article in these pages earlier this ("Gilad Farm has been sacrificed," Karni Eldad, March 6 ): "At age 15, they expelled Elisaf Orbach from his home in Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip. He was paid a small amount of compensation and went to Samaria, to build a small, 90-square-meter house to meet his needs until he gets married and has children." Despite the sad continuation - "With his hands bound, on the way to the police van, Orbach heard a tractor destroying his house, five years after his house in the Gaza Strip had been leveled" - I clicked "Like."
The concepts and the division of labor did that to me: expulsion and settling. A small house and a comfortable future, and even a twist in the plot: The forces of evil (police, army, Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak ) gang up on Elisaf and his friends and destroy all that good. And the Palestinians? In this story there are no Palestinians. Go see another movie.
Stealing land and illegal construction, evacuating a few buildings and rebuilding them, the state's report to the High Court of Justice that by the end of the year it would evacuate all outposts built on private Palestinian land - all this is not new. These events repeat themselves like the periodic table. And yet, who would have believed that Netanyahu would get stuck in his second term in the construction business, of all things: freezing construction in the territories, the real-estate bubble, the housing shortage and the sky-rocketing prices. And who would have believed that the housing shortage, of all things, would threaten his coalition?
A few days ago he was still acknowledging that the U.S. veto at the United Nations showed that Israel's status was in trouble. So to reduce political pressure, he sent up a trial balloon by talking to the media about a second Bar-Ilan speech on the peace process. The trial had not yet begun, Shas was already threatening to join in a no-confidence motion, and along came another trial balloon: the National Housing Commissions. Give that man a supertanker and he'll leap the bureaucratic hurdles.
If the Hebrew children's book "The Story of Five Balloons" had been written about Benjamin, the number of his balloons and their colors would have doubled, if not tripled, over the years. And that's how many would have burst. Netanyahu, to his credit or discredit, is still able to create news from a non-item and extricate himself from crises. But another day is waiting. The sun will rise from the region where supertankers do not fly - the territories. The occupation.
On the day this week when the BBC released a survey ranking Israel at the bottom of a list of countries by popularity, Britain announced that it had upgraded the Palestinian delegation's status in London. With this came, apparently coincidently, interviews with our ambassador to Britain, Ron Prosor, who is on his way to the United Nations. "After the fall of apartheid and the the Communist bloc in Europe," he told radio and television journalist Yaron Dekel, "Israel is meeting the need of the British, the Spanish and the Scandinavians to be against."
Here's the problem: The world is not interested in Israel's housing and bureaucratic problems, or in the achievements of its students in mathematics. The world is looking at how the only democracy in the Middle East conducts itself in the occupied territories. It's looking at events in Bil'in and Sheikh Jarrah, at the olive trees that are uprooted, and at the checkpoints. It's looking at the settlers who are shooting and setting fires, and at their leaders, MK Michael Ben-Ari, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Baruch Marzel, bullying their way through Jaffa and Umm al-Fahm.
The world is looking at Israel as it looked at South Africa during apartheid. And the world that doesn't know what Bar-Ilan 2 is will eventually find out. That's not unpleasant, it's terrible.

<title>You and I will piss on the world </title>
<date>Fri Dec 16 03:15:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
The raven doesn't always wait for the starling to come to him; sometimes he invites him over. So here they are, two men in a lordly pose.
"You and I will piss on the world. Soon the microphones will be removed and we'll be able to exchange jokes about that woman, who has developed a bad habit - she sticks her nose everywhere and has something to say about every country. She thinks Israel resembles Iran, and that Russia holds fraudulent elections. We'll show her from where the beluga secretes its caviar.
"It's true we get the money and weapons we need from that presumptuous woman and her Obama, whereas you, Comrade Vladimir Vladimirovich, help Iran and Syria as much as you can.

<title>You and I will piss on the world</title>

The raven doesn’t always wait for the starling to come to him; sometimes he invites him over. So here they are, two men in a lordly pose.
“You and I will piss on the world. Soon the microphones will be removed and we’ll be able to exchange jokes about that woman, who has developed a bad habit − she sticks her nose everywhere and has something to say about every country. She thinks Israel resembles Iran, and that Russia holds fraudulent elections. We’ll show her from where the beluga secretes its caviar.
“It’s true we get the money and weapons we need from that presumptuous woman and her Obama, whereas you, Comrade Vladimir Vladimirovich, help Iran and Syria as much as you can. But we can’t let ourselves be confused by unfortunate facts. We, the Israelis, distinguish between those who pretend to be friends and a true friend like you. Please, continue to see me as your representative in Jerusalem. We are brothers, heirs to the KGB tradition − let’s raise a glass of Stolichnaya to your life and the life of your 25 years in power, at least.”

<title>A case of leftist 'McCarthyism'? </title>
<date>Fri Jan 13 03:38:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
One of the most notorious newspapers ever published in America was The Spotlight, founded in 1975 by white supremacist Willis Carto. For many years the country's premier hate rag, it peaked at 330,000 subscribers in the early '80s. Alongside support for South African apartheid and exposes of the Bilderberg group, the paper was a regular purveyor of Holocaust denial, with stories like "Jewish Groups Can't Defend Position on '6 Million' Debate" and "Anne Frank Fable Losing Credibility; Establishment Continues to Push 'Diary' as 'True Story.'"
The Spotlight, which thankfully ceased publication in 2001, wasn't just concerned with falsifying history. When not questioning the existence of the gas chambers, it focused on the "Jewish lobby." And its writers had two terms for describing U.S. Jews and their activism on behalf of the Jewish state: "dual loyalists" who were for "Israel first."
When Zaid Jilani was recently informed that his use of the latter term had anti-Semitic implications, he professed ignorance. Jilani, a blogger at the Center for American Progress  (CAP ), claimed to be "unaware of all the connotations it carried." That a young blogger at a prominent liberal think tank would see nothing wrong with such language is understandable. It's an indication of just how deep the rhetoric of the far right has seeped into the discourse of the mainstream left.
Jilani is one of several individuals who have come under fire for their commentary regarding Israel and Jews. The controversy started in early December, when Politico detailed how two "core institutions" of the Democratic Party - CAP, a farm team for the Obama administration, and Media Matters for America, a self-described "progressive research and information center" - "are challenging a bipartisan consensus on Israel."
Rather than addressing the substantive criticism raised, CAP tried desperately to change the subject, turning its guns on those airing concerns, particularly Josh Block, a lifelong Democrat and former American Israel Public Affairs Committee spokesman whose criticism of the groups was quoted in Politico. The episode approached the status of Washington "scandal" when liberal website Salon published a dossier Block had disseminated documenting a series of blog posts, articles, and Twitter messages in which CAP and Media Matters employees batted around rhetoric and accusations as if "it's now just natural to talk about Jewish money in politics, about treasonous politicians."
To judge from Block's collection, the worst perpetrator is Media Matters' "senior foreign policy fellow" M.J. Rosenberg, whose "analysis" largely amounts to name-calling. Newsweek reporter Eli Lake is an "agent of influence." Playwright David Mamet is an "Israel first Likudnik." Indeed, any U.S. Jew to his right  (including Democratic congressmen ) is an "Israel-firster." When one journalist complained about Rosenberg's calling her a "dual loyalist," he responded by saying, "I say DUAL which is generous." No wonder he best expresses himself in the Twitter medium of 140 characters.
Block took considerable professional risk in challenging these two influential liberal organizations. The Truman National Security Project, a once-promising initiative to promote a hawkish sensibility in the Democratic Party that has since become little more than another greasy pole for young D.C. opportunists, expelled Block from its fellowship program.
In the Forward, Sarah Wildman attacked Block, writing that "When we debase the term [anti-Semite] by using it as a rhetorical conceit against those with whom we disagree on policy matters, we have sullied our own promises to our grandparents." But it is those who use the term "Israel-firster" who are debasing the debate by accusing anyone who disagrees with them of treasonous impulses. Wildman also argued that the offensive comments had been "taken out of context" - as if there were ever a context, other than that of, say, Jonathan Pollard, in which it would be appropriate to label an American Jew an "Israel-firster" or "dual loyalist."
Ultimately, however, Block was vindicated. While CAP publicly denied that its employees were trafficking in anti-Semitism, an e-mail from the organization's vice president, obtained by The Jerusalem Post, deemed "Israel-firster," to be "terrible, anti-Semitic language."
The left is constantly complaining that the debate about Israel is restricted, that one can't criticize Israel without "risking" his career. Reality is in fact the opposite. Figures ranging from University of Chicago professor John Mearsheimer to journalists Peter Beinart and Andrew Sullivan have all seen their careers blossom as a result of their harsh and unrelenting criticism of Israel. Indeed, obsessively attacking Israel is a bona-fide way to resuscitate one's career, not destroy it. As a measure, consider the fact that employees at mainstream liberal institutions feel comfortable using the sort of language popularized by white supremacists and Holocaust-deniers.
It isn't just figures on the medium and lower rungs of think tanks using such foul rhetoric: "Israel-firster" and "Likudnik" are favorites of Time's Joe Klein, as well as Salon's Glenn Greenwald, one of America's most popular liberal bloggers, who refers to "the many Israel-firsters in the U.S. Congress."
Since the 1950s, liberals have routinely accused conservatives of "McCarthyism." Now the tables have turned, and it is leftists questioning the loyalties of American Jews. Judging what's in a country's "interest" is highly subjective; it is the very reason why there exists such passionate and necessary debate about the purpose and tactics of American foreign policy. So-called "progressives" should stop mimicking the far right and engage in that debate without questioning the allegiance of their fellow Americans.

<title>Again that guy with his peace talk </title>
<date>Mon Nov 05 02:53:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	It's true that you can't rely on the Arabs. It was so much fun toying with the idea of Moshe Kahlon, who opposed the Gaza disengagement and supports annexing the settlements. We really enjoyed touring with Yair Lapid in Ariel, which is stuck like a bone in the throat of the occupied territories. We had started to convince Shimon Peres that at the age of 89 it might be worth dropping the prefix, "honorable president," for the old suffix "will divide Jerusalem."
	And suddenly Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas pops up on Channel 2 and totally confuses us with his version of peace.
	Only a couple of months ago we learned from historian Benny Morris (Haaretz Magazine, September 21) that Abbas is stuck on liberating the homeland through a "policy of stages," and insists on demanding the right of return. And from nowhere, in the midst of an election campaign seemingly focused on the price of cottage cheese and cellphone discounts, Abbas decides to publicly renounce his right to return to his childhood home in Safed.
	Just last month, the right found support for its claim of "no partner" in remarks by Meron Benvenisti, who said, "You cannot tell the Arabs to forget about Jaffa and Acre. They will not forget," (Haaretz Magazine, October 12 ) and that we should just forget about dividing the land (after which he tries to calm us by saying the opposite - that "most of the refugees don't even want to return" ).
	But just as the public was beginning to absorb this reinforcement of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that "the conflict is about '48, not about '67," the Palestinian president decides to declare that whatever is not part of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem is the State of Israel.
	The biggest surprise is the surprise with which Abbas' remarks were received. In January of last year, protocols published by the Al Jazeera network were already providing evidence of his pragmatic approach to the refugee issue. It was reported there that during one of the conversations he had with then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Abbas said, "It would be illogical to ask Israel to absorb five million refugees, or even a million refugees ... the result would be the end of the State of Israel."
	Moreover, during an internal debate on March 24, 2009 (an event that cannot be suspected of trying to deceive the Israeli Jewish public ), Abbas answered in the negative when asked by a Palestinian visitor from Nazareth whether he would be able to eventually get Palestinian citizenship.
	"You don't need a passport to prove you're a Palestinian," declared Abbas, adding, "You need to raise two banners: the banner of equality and the banner of an independent state for your brethren in the occupied territories."
	Last April, former Shin Bet Security Service head Yuval Diskin backed Abbas when the latter said Netanyahu had refused to launch real negotiations and never bothered to respond to the Palestinian positions on borders and security, nor even glanced at the documents the Palestinians had submitted in response to the Mideast Quartet's demands last year.
	"Don't listen to those stories they're trying to sell you about how Abu Mazen [Abbas] doesn't want to talk," said Diskin during a filmed encounter in Kfar Sava. "I was there until a year ago and I know what's happening from up close. This government has no interest in resolving anything with the Palestinians, and this I can say with certainty."
	Although Hamas officials and no few senior members of his own Fatah faction have in the past condemned Abbas in the most hateful terms for daring to renounce the right of every refugee to return to his ancestral home, the PA leader remains defiant. The Channel 2 interview is part of a comprehensive diplomatic and media offensive whose purpose is to pave the way for upgrading the Palestinians' representation in the United Nations.
	It would also be worth noting his statement that as long as he is Palestinian president, there will be no new intifada. That was a warning to the right-wing government which has threatened to respond to any "unilateral" moves at the United Nations by annexing territory: When you get a third intifada, which is likely to set the whole region on fire, don't blame me.
	Yes, Abbas' intent was to interfere in the Israeli election campaign, and that's a good thing. (Is only Netanyahu allowed to trespass on another nation's political playing field? ) Abbas was doing the work of those Zionist parties who have joined the foolish march of the right toward the abyss of a binational reality and apartheid.
	Truly, you can't rely on the Arabs. Their "no" might actually turn into a "yes." By us, no is no.

<title>Alice Walker's true colors </title>
<date>Sun Jun 24 04:00:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Through her decision not to have her book "The Color Purple" translated into Hebrew, Alice Walker is choosing to keep silent and absenting herself from Israel's crucial public discourse about racism and the occupation.
	Literature at its best should be a Trojan horse. Good authors don't just tell us a story to pass the time in a pleasant way. They offer ideas that insinuate themselves into the reader's mind, sometimes unconsciously, sometimes in the form of a tale that disguises its moral and cultural lessons. Books can provide readers with a mirror in which they can see something they hadn't seen before, and give them the uncommon opportunity of subsequently seeing themselves and their surroundings in a different light.
	Alice Walker relinquished the possibility of becoming a literary Odysseus when she announced recently she would not agree to have her book "The Color Purple" translated into Hebrew. Walker explained her decision on the grounds that Israel is an apartheid state, adding she hoped the boycott would have an effect on civil society here.
	Let us set aside the proposition that Israel is an apartheid state, though to me this doesn't seem an accurate definition. The background to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not racial. It would have been enough to talk about the Israeli occupation. There is no need to bandy slogans around in order to strengthen the argument that the occupation must be ended.
	But let us use Walker's assumption that Israel is indeed an apartheid state. If South Africa was still under an apartheid regime, would it not be smarter to enable the people there - by any means possible - to read what Walker has to say about racial discrimination?
	Boycotting is easy. A herd of boycotters is a comfortable herd. Being anti-Israeli these days is fashionable. As a boycotter you join a popular crowd, and you're safe in the knowledge that you will get automatic applause from your intellectual and literary milieu. Clearly the issue of Israel/Palestine is important to Alice Walker - she was due to participate in last year's (aborted ) Gaza flotilla - but she and others involved in the arts who are implementing a cultural boycott of Israel are accomplishing the opposite of what they believe in.
	What is Walker achieving by preventing Israelis from reading "The Color Purple" in Hebrew at this specific time? What punishment does she, and all the boycotters of Israel, think they are meting out to us? To be blunt, most Israelis don't have any special interest in Alice Walker, and her specific boycott won't make waves.
	But the cumulative trend of boycotts does have an effect on Israeli life. By isolating Israelis, boycotters are creating a renewed sense of unity and self-worth among Israelis, and greater antagonism and withdrawal from the outside world. The boycotters are feeding the flames of Israelis' eternal bonfire of victimhood. Victimhood is one of those mental constructs which is so hard for Israelis to rid themselves of - and therefore, one which the Israeli establishment itself nurtures because it is convenient. When someone boycotts Israel, Israelis immediately see themselves as victims of anti-Semitism, which unites them in the general sense of lamentation and the rightness of their way.
	Some say that when a writer prevents publication of his book in Israel, or refuses to participate in literary festivals here, s/he is in fact punishing precisely those - in the center and on the left, who are disproportionately represented in literary circles - who support peace and oppose the current government's policy.
	I'd like to suggest a different argument, using the example of the Trojan horse. I believe Alice Walker's aspiration, and that of other major cultural figures, should be to have her books read precisely by those people with whose actions and beliefs she does not agree. Walker, of all people - who has confronted racism and has written a powerful fictional critique of it - is preventing Israelis from being exposed to the very kind of literary work that it is crucial for them to read. Walker should want her books to appear not only in bookshops and on private bookshelves but also on huge billboards along highways in the state of Israel. For whose edification is she talking about racism and segregation? Is her aim only to preach to the converted, to the liberal masses of Scandinavia? It is precisely here in Israel that her voice needs to be heard, and in Hebrew.
	Israelis don't like to hear criticism. Maybe that's true of every nation in the world, but maybe the dislike is stronger than for other nations - I haven't conducted enough research globally to make a judgment, even an anecdotal one, on that. To paraphrase a local saying, anyone with butter on his head shouldn't go out in the sun.
	Had Walker herself done more serious research, she would have certainly discovered that the occupation is just one of our problems. Perhaps it's the most acute of our problems, but the manifestations of racism in Israeli life are far more extensive than solely attitudes toward Palestinians. The incarceration and deportation of African migrants living in Israel is an intense current issue and is eliciting unprecedented racism - and not only from the mob in the streets but also in the Knesset and from senior government ministers, who have actively fanned the flames of race hatred.
	Maybe this public and humiliating demonstration of primitive racism to the world is Israel's punishment for the occupation. Something inside us is sick. The situation is disturbing as well as infuriating - but the way to fight it is to make your voice heard. Not to be silent. In her decision not to have her book translated here, Walker is choosing to keep silent, absenting herself from Israel's crucial public discourse about racism and the occupation. This is a strange and disappointing choice for an activist writer.

<title>Anti-Semitism in academic guise </title>
<date>Sun Mar 11 03:07:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Every Israeli student who comes to study at a university in the United States very quickly learns that the truly important academic events are those that happen during the noontime break. In addition to a free lunch, you get additional fare that broadens your horizons a bit.
	Recently, an event of this sort was held at the Harvard Law School, devoted to the case of Khader Adnan, an Islamic Jihad operative who held a hunger strike and petitioned Israel's Supreme Court to protest his administrative detention in an Israeli prison. (Adnan has since been released.) I left this event with a bitter taste in my mouth. For about an hour, in a hall filled to capacity, the meeting's organizers depicted Israel in an extremely bleak light and did not let the facts confuse them. I am convinced that an outside observer who is not familiar with the intricacies of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict believes that Israel makes a hobby of detaining Palestinians under administrative arrest.
	Not a single word was said about Palestinian terror or about the fact that no country in the world allows an administrative detainee to petition its Supreme Court directly, as in the case of Adnan, for example. The double standard was also glaring, as only a few dozen kilometers from the bed where the hunger-striking Adnan was hospitalized, Syrian President Bashar Assad continued to slaughter his own countrymen. But of course it is Israel that is in serious violation of human rights, requiring an urgent academic discussion.
	Everyone has the right to express criticism of Israel and in some cases it is justified - this is the essence of democracy. However, the recent events at Harvard give the sense that something else is hiding beneath the guise of academic debate. I felt this even more palpably when I spoke to the organizers of the event and introduced myself. The smile on the face of the Palestinian woman who had organized the discussion faded away immediately when I said the words "I am from Israel."
	That event was only the beginning. On March 1 the topic of the annual faculty debate at the law school was: "Can Israel be both Jewish and democratic?" At this event, which was balanced, there were also harsh opinions expressed undermining Israel's legitimacy, with hints of a parallel to Germany in the 1930s.
	But the peak came a few days later at the "One-state solution" conference. Organized by a student but held under the aegis of the university, this event tried to give an academic seal of approval to the delegitimization of Israel. At this meeting, the words "apartheid" and "Israel" were paired. The Israeli side was represented by "supporters" of Israel and Zionism like anti-Zionist historian Prof. Ilan Pappe. (As Prof. Alan Dershowitz noted, it would be interesting to know what Harvard's reaction would have been had a group of students held a conference under the heading "Does a Palestinian people exist?", inviting only academics who contend that the answer is no.)
	This is not real academic discussion nor is it legitimate criticism, but rather simply an attempt to hold a debate on whether the Jewish people has the right to a state - and to answer that question in the negative. This was not a conference at some obscure institution or an event held in Europe, where the outcome is a foregone conclusion. This was a conference with an anti-Semitic hue, held at one of the most important academic institutions in the world.
	Therefore I am proud to be part of a group of students organizing the first "Harvard-Israel" conference. This event aims to present Israeli innovativeness and entrepreneurship and, more importantly, to present original solutions and economic developments for peace and coexistence between the peoples. If both sides - Israelis and Palestinians - develop a positive approach, recognize the other's legitimacy and do not engage in spreading hatred, perhaps there will be a better future for all of us.
	The writer is a lawyer studying for a master's degree at Harvard Law School.

<title>Before we lose the protective shell </title>
<date>Tue Apr 17 01:43:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Some Israelis have hard hearts when it comes to the many Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremonies and restrictions in place for tomorrow night, when movie theaters, restaurants and cafes will be closed and only certain programs will be screened on television. There are those who want us to stop dealing with "Shoah business" and be a bit more normal, and others who lament the excessive "holiday" atmosphere surrounding the March of the Living to Auschwitz, saying the time has come for us to purge ourselves of this annoying "Holocaust syndrome."
	Mostly, I'm not with these detractors. The Holocaust is, indeed, a syndrome, and it also turned us into something a bit abnormal, but that is entirely warranted. After all, this is an unfathomable event, one that is unprecedented in history: a systematic act of genocide.
	Hundreds of years of anti-Semitic propaganda, persecution, blood libels and pogroms set the stage for the Final Solution. Even when Germany's military circumstances turned bleak and defeat was on the horizon, Hitler rejected requests made by army commanders to divert some trains from extermination missions and use them for military purposes on the front. The annihilation of the Jewish people was his supreme prerogative.
	Nor was this the obsessive lunacy of one crazed leader who swept up an entire people. It suffices to mention the pogrom in Kielce, a Polish city located between Warsaw and Krakow. Dozens of Jewish survivors of concentration camps returned to Kielce after the war, trying to rebuild their lives. But a rumor broke out in the city, suggesting that Jews kidnapped a Christian child to use its blood for Passover matza. A mob surrounded a house where several Jewish families lived and slaughtered the 42 Jews inside; the massacre was so vicious that the bodies could not be identified. All this happened in 1946, a year and two months after the end of the war and the liberation of the camps.
	So it's no wonder that remembrance of anti-Semitism old and new - the persecutions, blood libels, pogroms and, more than anything, the Holocaust - constitutes the bond between Jews in Israel and the rest of the world. Moreover, the Holocaust is part of a sequence that gave us life: had it not been for feelings of guilt around the world, the United Nations would not have decided in 1947 in favor of partition, and other countries would not have helped us during the critical hours of the War of Independence. Had there been no Holocaust, European countries would have long ago imposed paralyzing economic and military sanctions, a la South Africa, against us. European governments and companies would have ceased to do business with us, and would not have supplied us with arms or conducted normal diplomatic relations with us. After all, they bitterly oppose everything that is done in the territories: the occupation, the continued settlement construction, the apartheid policy and the lack of interest in proceeding with the peace process.
	Israel's polices in the territories would not be condoned to the extent that they are, were it not for the deep feelings of guilt that other countries feel about the Holocaust. They know that Germany initiated the events, but that other countries either willingly collaborated in the extermination or didn't lift a finger to prevent it. But will this immunity last forever? Will these feelings of guilt persist for eternity?
	Clearly not. The generation of Holocaust survivors and World War II veterans is vanishing, in Israel and everywhere else. Soon there will be no living witnesses to the atrocities, and a new generation will say: Our hands are not soaked by this blood, we know of nothing like this that occurred in our lifetimes, we have no such guilt feelings.
	In democratic countries, public opinion is what ultimately determines leaders' policies. So when these guilt feelings disappear, and events of the apartheid occupation continue and grow worse, the result will be ferocious anger toward Israel. The result: South Africa-type sanctions that will cripple us. The deadly takeover of the May 2010 flotilla to Gaza, the provocative attempted "fly-in" of a few days ago, and the tape of the senior military officer hitting an activist in the face with the butt of his rifle on the Jordan Valley's Route 90 are just early signs of changes afoot in the world.
	Since this change is inexorable, it behooves our leaders to show prudence and forge an agreement with the Palestinians soon, before the world's guilt vanishes - along with the protective shell of the Holocaust.

<title>Bibi and the Bulgarian proverb </title>
<date>Fri Sep 14 02:00:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu crossed the red line, acting wildly irresponsible by causing his relationship with the American president to deteriorate. He presented himself as someone who can force President Obama to do his bidding, and in doing so, overstepped the traditional boundaries, those that prevent Israeli politicians from interfering with the U.S. presidential elections. If it does turn out that we are changing our policy - the one that says that we will cooperate with whomever is elected president - we're making a serious mistake.
	A president who does not want to set red lines for Iran, as Bibi Netanyahu wants, is correct. A great power will maintain ambiguity in order to have freedom of action. Everyone knows that it can exercise force - certainly it has more means to do so than we have; it doesn't have to publicly announce that fact. It certainly doesn't have to let Bibi call the shots.
	It's enough for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to see the aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf in order for him to understand that the United States will choose the timing and the nature of an activity, if there is one, even without the panic being conveyed by Bibi. Obama is being portrayed as a "dove," but this is the president who spent billions on the hunt for and assassination of Osama bin Laden.
	During South Africa's years of apartheid, a senior government official there told me that "if we had five million Afrikaners in America we would never have surrendered." That is the insane type of thinking that motivates right-wing extremists and the proponents of Greater Israel who support Bibi. The prime minister's conduct toward Obama could definitely be interpreted as behind-the-scenes meddling aimed at preventing Obama's election to a second term.
	Obama's aides are not blind to the phenomenon called Sheldon Adelson, who is spending tens of millions of dollars to defeat the incumbent president, in favor of the Republican candidate. This is the same man who finances the free newspaper in Israel that supports Netanyahu and his views, and is indirectly responsible for the Israeli newspaper crisis. There is no shortage of presidential friends and advisers who are whispering in his ear that Bibi is inciting American Jews against him.
	Nobody in the world is happy about Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons. It's not only Israel's problem. Iran is building long-range missiles that cover Europe. The leaders of the European countries have reason for concern and are afraid that the Israeli initiative will drive the Iranian leaders crazy, and cause them to launch missiles in all directions in the name of Allah. The leaders of Germany, Great Britain and France, not to mention the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are rightly warning Bibi, in unequivocal terms, not to act and not to present Iran with an ultimatum.
	In a full-page spread in one of the newspapers here, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. James A. Winnefeld, is seen pointing out to a smiling Bibi a map that includes Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Yemen and Turkey, as well as tiny Israel. A news editor with a macabre sense of humor would caption the photo: Look how small we are within the huge Islamic world.
	Defense Minister Ehud Barak is no coward. But as opposed to the impression that he is leading Bibi into battle, he has recently turned out to be the responsible adult. He is not enthusiastic about Bibi's ultimatum. "Great powers don't like ultimatums." He sees the very fact that the Iranian issue is on the world agenda as an achievement. Barak believes that our situation would be better if there were progress on the Palestinian issue. As opposed to Bibi's view, Barak also says that we could have repaired relations with Turkey a long time ago, were it not for Israel's insistence on not apologizing.
	Barak claims, according to an unconfirmed rumor, that during Obama's four years, the peace process with the Palestinians was nonexistent. Every past president engaged in some type of peace-promoting activity: Bill Clinton - Oslo 2; George W. Bush - a road map and Annapolis; George Bush Sr. - the Madrid Conference. Is it possible that there is veiled criticism of Bibi in Barak's reported comment? Perhaps. If Obama does end up meeting with Bibi in America, there won't be any great love lost there.
	When Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borisov stood next to Bibi during his official visit here, he probably recalled the Bulgarian proverb, "When God wants to punish someone, the first thing He does is take away his brains."

<title>Decoding Bibi's West Bank agenda</title>
<date>Wed Aug 01 13:40:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
The prime minister’s policy of de facto annexation of the West Bank will end badly for everyone, and there will be no way out.
It took a while, but the prime minister’s political ideology seems to have been decoded. The designation of a university in the West Bank city of Ariel, Judge Edmond Levy's report that Israel is not an occupier, the construction of more than a thousand new buildings in the settlements and intensive Israeli activity in Area C in the West Bank, all indicate the fundamental political principles that guide Benjamin Netanyahu.
Despite the comfortable situation at present – no terror attacks, international pressure or political opposition – Netanyahu understands the ground is quaking beneath the feet of the Zionist project. Even he can put two and two together. Israel cannot absorb millions of Palestinians and remain a Jewish country. What is the solution? In the past, Netanyahu was firmly opposed to a Palestinian state. But he has supported a two-state solution since first endorsing it in a speech at Bar-Ilan University in 2009. We were supposed to rejoice over the triumph of the Oslo Accords' ideology. The problem is that Netanyahu's application of the ideology on the ground is putting Israel's existence in danger.
Defective, partial implementation of the Oslo Accords has created the current situation, where the Palestinian Authority only controls the territory known as Areas and B, comprising 40 percent of the West Bank. These areas are scattered like an archipelago in the ocean of Area C – the 60 percent of the area under Israel’s control – cut off from each other and at the mercy of the Israel Defense Forces. Area C includes many settlements, few Palestinians and mainly open areas. The Oslo Accords required these open areas to be handed over to the Palestinians by 1999. This was never done.
Israel's new approach can be called "Bibi C." Netanyahu's overarching goal is simple, the tactic is clever and the results are disastrous. The aim is to control as much territory with as few Palestinians as possible, and to claim that the Palestinians can establish a state on the remaining land.
In this scenario, Israel controls the Palestinian state's entrances, exits and water supply, the Jordan Valley, the Dead Sea, the air space, most of Jerusalem and the border with Jordan. The room for flexibility in final status negotiations will decrease to the point where tunnels and bridges will be needed to create a territorially contiguous Palestinian state and the Palestinians will be left asking Israel how much of Area C it is willing to part with (very little).
The placement of 124 settlements and a hundred outposts, together with what academics used to call a "stakeholder analysis," indicates that Netanyahu is interested in annexing about 40 percent of the West Bank.  
We should remember that in the talks between Palestinian leader Abu Mazen and former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, which almost led to an agreement, Olmert offered to annex about six percent of the West Bank with an equal amount of territorial compensation elsewhere. United States President Bill Clinton’s proposal spoke of three to six percent annexation, with compensation.
Israel has already de facto annexed Area C. The route of the separation barrier is no longer relevant. Creeping annexation is taking place deep within the West Bank, coming right up against Palestinian population centers in Ramallah, Nablus and Hebron. Israel is investing billions of shekels in land in Area C and deliberately preventing the development of Palestinian infrastructure there. At the same time, a sophisticated campaign is under way to change the way the public regards Area C, and the Levy report is part of that. Also, in light of proposals to apply Israeli sovereignty to “all the communities in Judea and Samaria,” Netanyahu will be able to portray his plan as relatively moderate.
A situation is taking shape on the ground from which there will be no way back. If this trend continues, even if leaders like Yitzhak Rabin or Ehud Olmert come to power and wish to go back to the two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders with territorial exchanges, the situation will not allow it. A downward slide toward the occupation of the West Bank, the crumbling of the Palestinian Authority and an apartheid regime are not far off.
The policy of de facto annexation will further weaken the moderate Palestinian camp, which will be forced to admit there is no way to bring about the end of the occupation and establish a sustainable Palestinian state by holding peace talks. At the same time, the Western and Arab world will realize where Israel is headed. The ramifications could be devastating, with Egypt and Jordan severing relations, Europe and the United States implementing boycotts and the world coming to view Israel in much the same way it did South Africa's apartheid regime.

<title>Do we need to tone down the rhetoric? </title>
<date>Fri Jan 06 02:50:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
On a recent trip to Israel, law professor Alan  Dershowitz complained about the cognitive dissonance between the Israel as presented by the local media, with headlines about democracy in danger and brewing fascism, and the Israel of serious and unrestricted debate that he experienced during his stay. The overheated rhetoric not only gives a false image to friends and foes worldwide, but feeds the international anti-Israel campaigns, Dershowitz suggested. If Israelis call their own government fascist or their society apartheid, our enemies would argue that it must be so.
Dershowitz gives us fair warning that Israel's delegitimizers exploit the careless use of politically-loaded epithets. And we probably should be more sensitive to the fact that our harsh self-derision sounds different to non-Israelis than it does at home. But toning down the discourse is not easy and may not always be desirable.
Israel is an in-your-face society. People prefer directness to subtlety, they tell you what they think, they talk over each other, and rudeness begins far beyond what some Americans and Europeans are used to. Israelis reject as insincere what are elsewhere considered social niceties and diplomatic language.
If a public figure in the U.S. or Europe is observed to be angry, he or she is presumed to have lost control. But here, expressing anger is often taken as a sign of passion rather than weakness. Rhetoric routinely reaches the highest decibels, and raising one's voice is part of the patter. An outburst might quickly be followed by a rapprochement.
The etiquette of civility, which for example limits the hostilities in Republican debates to candidates challenging each other's records and low-flame sniping, is not the norm in our political discourse. Demagoguery rules from left to right. Leaders like Yitzhak Rabin, who shunned demagogic vocal tricks and emotional manipulation, are the exception.
The escalating use of the language that disturbs Dershowitz - terms like "fascist," "democracy-at-risk" or "apartheid state" - comes from the increasing frustration felt by many who feel that nobody's listening. Dershowitz sees himself as fighting the good fight against those seeking Israel's destruction, which could explain why he didn't criticize the far more vindictive language used against the left and liberal center in the right-wing and ultra-Orthodox press: Terms like "traitor," "abomination" "or self-hating Jew" probably do not serve the delegimitizers.
But we Israelis are operating in a different arena. Both the left and the right use alarmist discourse to stir things up, as a call to arms, to mobilize the base and to reassure that base that they are not the only ones who feel things are spinning out of control. It is deployed tactically, to link issues that may grow out of the same soil - think of the summer's social protest or the anti-democratic legislation - or to simplify issues so it is easier to rally support. While it would be best to examine each issue in its full complexity, in most cases, neither the media nor its consumers are up to this task.
But ultimately, bombast is popular, even when inflammatory and dangerous, because the democratic process of reasoned debate that Dershowitz suggests he sees in Israel is increasingly absent from our political process. If citizens and politicians do not have the basic trust that one side will either persuade the other through discourse or reach a tolerable compromise when persuasion fails, then there is little cause for discussion. Part of our current government's real culpability lies in its efforts to prevent reasoned debate on our most existential national challenges.
Many of us tune out scorched-earth rhetoric, yet it's effective. Witness the protests over gender segregation. While any violence resulting from media coverage of the subject is abhorrent, the country is now debating an issue that extends from bus lines to city streets to billboards and down to some first-grade classrooms in state religious schools. It's not likely that our citizens or leaders would have responded to less overblown reactions or more moderate commentary.
We are far from fascism, and our imperfect democracy is still operating, but eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. While we do not have to write our detractors' tirades for them - we could, for example, side with Amos Schocken  (in his piece in Haaretz English Edition of November 25, 2011 ) in making more careful distinctions, when he wrote that Israel is not an apartheid state, but that some aspects of the occupation do indeed resemble apartheid - we cannot afford to muzzle ourselves either. So long as we are still at liberty to be vigilant, we must sound the alarm when we feel the need. Our enemies will find ammunition to use against us, with or without our help.
Perhaps at this stage in our evolution, we can only begin to analyze our internal conflicts more deeply once we have finished yelling our heads off. And perhaps we need a government that seeks to promote discourse, rather than to stifle it.

<title>Freedom for Jerusalem, the capital of Israel and Palestine</title>
<date>Mon Apr 02 04:51:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	On the first night of Passover, the festival of freedom, the song "We were slaves but now we are free" will waft from homes throughout the country as Jews sit down to celebrate the seder. But every year, these words lose some of their luster. Every year, more Israelis go from being free men to slaves.
	They're slaves to the urge for power and the instinct of fear, slaves to the land, slaves who rule another people. A nation that after thousands of years in exile won its political freedom has become the slave of Jewish zealots, the slave of gravediggers who have made a blood pact with Muslim zealots. The slave of a government that has turned the words of the Hagaddah - "In every generation they rise up against us to annihilate us" - into foreign policy and domestic propaganda.
	For a short period, too short a period, we smelled the blossoms of true freedom. This was from 1966, when Israel abolished its military government in Arab areas, until the establishment of the military government in the occupied territories a year later. It was a period of freedom from official discrimination against the Palestinian minority at our mercy. Freedom from the fear of a neighbor and the terror of the demographic demon.
	Levi Eshkol, the prime minister who was considered a vacillator if not a coward, understood then that there could be no democracy with first-class citizens who enjoyed full freedom and second-class citizens whose freedom was restricted. Eshkol wasn't a leftist. Nor was legendary Finance Minister Pinhas Sapir, who warned that if we continued to hold the territories we had occupied in 1967, they would soon hold us.
	In view of Israel's hawkish governing coalition and the Palestinian leadership's long crisis in the territories, it's hard to believe that next year we'll be free people in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel and Palestine. The "diplomatic process" has become the code name for a process of enlarging the settlements and building outposts.
	Senior security officials predict that the lack of hope for a solution to the conflict will produce a new round of violence in the territories. Diplomats predict a decline in Israel's international status. The common excuse of "there is no partner" has turned into an alibi for the policy of sit and do nothing; it has become a surefire recipe for perpetuating the situation of masters and servants in the territories. The more negotiations on a solution recede , the closer we are to the day when the number of servants exceeds the number of masters. How do we get out of this mess?
	The movement Atid Kahol-Lavan (A Blue and White Future ) is led by Ami Ayalon, a former cabinet minister, head of the Shin Bet security service and commander of the Israel Navy; businessman Orni Petrushka; and attorney Gilead Sher, who headed the talks with the Palestinians for Ehud Barak. They have created a paradigm for a diplomatic solution. Their blueprint is not conditional on renewing negotiations. They propose "constructive unilateral steps" to reach a solution to the conflict. In other words, moves that promote a gradual reality of two states.
	The main points of the plan:
	b A declaration by Israel's government that it is not demanding sovereignty over the territories east of the separation fence, and a willingness to bring back the settlers who live in those areas or outside the big settlement blocs;
	b A construction freeze east of the fence and in Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods;
	b Continued construction inside the settlement blocs as an incentive to renew talks, without which the fence will become the permanent border;
	b Implementation of a law for evacuation by choice and compensation to residents of isolated settlements, with no link to a final-status solution;
	b Preparation of a national plan to absorb settlers who return to Israel proper, with or without an agreement.
	The movement's leaders assume that the dynamic will stir hope and encourage the sides to open serious negotiations based on the 1967 borders and land swaps. They are striving to carry out the plan through a dialogue with the settlers, whose ideological leaders they are in close contact with. Economists working for them have learned the lessons of the evacuation from Gaza and have spotted housing solutions and employment opportunities in the center of the country (other than Tel Aviv ) for residents of the isolated settlements.
	The blueprint proposed by Atid Kahol-Lavan isn't perfect. But in view of the suspicions and gaps between the sides, it seems to be the only alternative to the stalemate and/or apartheid and/or futile negotiations leading to violence. Perhaps at the next festival of freedom we'll complete the story of the Exodus from Egypt for our children with news of the exodus from the settlement of Yitzhar. If you will it, it is no Passover dream.

<title>Guilt-tripping the world is dangerous for Israel</title>
<date>Thu Mar 22 04:04:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	As if the horror in Toulouse wasn't enough, as if the suspicion that Al-Qaida was involved in the attack wasn't enough, and as if the constant criticism of Israel wasn't enough, we've invented another imaginary enemy: Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief.
	Ashton made some distasteful remarks about the cruel fate of children who had been killed, unintentionally mixing road-accident victims (Belgium ), war victims (Syria, Gaza and Sderot ) and hate-crime victims (France ). And immediately, I mean immediately, Israel fomented an international scandal, despite France's very impressive stand with the Jewish community, first and foremost by its president.
	Not a very important stateswoman, but apparently a good-intentioned one, Ashton misspoke. We realize that her intentions weren't bad, certainly not anti-Israel. Listening to her full remarks proves this. Ashton bemoaned the fate of children killed for nothing, as politicians like to do. But the thunderous attack from Jerusalem (and Tel Aviv ), orchestrated by the prime minister and the foreign minister, and backed up by a chorus of journalists and pundits, was wrong and unnecessary, no less than Ashton's remarks.
	Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs Minister Yuli Edelstein said that if he weren't a minister, his attack on Ashton would have been even harsher than his "Israel is the most moral country in the world" (no less ). Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman let loose with another nationalist pronouncement, and they all demanded that Ashton get down on her knees and beg for forgiveness.
	Even when she did this, even when the EU's ambassador to Israel, Andrew Stanley, tried unsuccessfully to explain, it wasn't enough for Jerusalem. Ashton was marked as an enemy forever.
	The day after the crime in Toulouse, Israel should have praised the French authorities and been gratified by their solidarity. The Jewish people and the State of Israel don't see such displays very often. Israel has never stood at attention the day after a hate crime; never has there been such a show of solidarity with a minority community that was attacked. Ashton's remarks should have been ignored, or maybe we simply could have taken modest note of them.
	But Israel doesn't act like that. It's enough that we suspect that an unfortunate remark has been made, especially if it comes from a relatively weak politician who isn't American. No one would have ferociously attacked Ashton if she had been a representative of the United States.
	This attack on Ashton and others like her is suspect; it probably wasn't sincere. Perhaps once again we're cynically using a statesman's faux pas to wring more and more guilt feelings about Israel, to instill more and more fear into the world's statesmen and to make more and more worthless political hay.
	Israel hunts down such remarks as if it were the Anti-Defamation League. The long-term implications are dangerous. Ashton, who was never perceived as an enemy of Israel, but rather a typical European stateswoman who believes that the Israeli occupation should end, might watch her tongue, but now she'll hold a big grudge against Israel for humiliating her. That's not good for Israel.
	Israel must never be compared to anything else - not to apartheid and not to other oppressors of freedom around the world, not to other occupation regimes and not to other colonialism. We're always something else. The children of Sderot must not be compared to the children of Gaza, the children of Toulouse must not be compared to other children who are slaughtered elsewhere in nationalist hate crimes.
	Our children are different, not only to us - that's natural. But they must be different to the whole world. That's our uncompromising demand. Neither must the Palestinian struggle be compared to any other fight for liberation elsewhere around the world. Anyone who dares compare Israel to anything else - their fate is sealed.
	The Ashton mini-storm will be forgotten in a day. Israel will celebrate another minuscule victory, but the residue will build up. It wasn't Ashton who lost her senses, but rather Israel, which is playing the role of the eternally offended party, once again seen in a maudlin light. And this happened just as the world was responding compassionately to the victims and was remarkably empathetic toward Israel.

<title>Human beings whose bodies are one big black star </title>
<date>Fri Jun 01 04:26:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	We bought a basket of cherries at the greengrocer's, and on our return home we noticed the label: "Yattir Forest Cherries." No name of the grower, no phone number, no post office box, nothing. Is someone out there in the South Hebron Hills, beyond the Green Line, trying to hide? Do they intend to deceive us?
	And what will we do with the suspicious cherries - eat them or throw them into the garbage can? Even if they're sweet, a bitter taste will remain in our mouths. For a moment I thought of consulting with Ovadia & Sons, with the w"Beit Yosef" kashrut supervisors, but they specialize in a different kind of swinishness, and give a seal of approval to different abominations. Oh, holy impurity: It's all in the family, Kosher Nostra.
	And then I thought of contacting the South African ambassador, maybe he knows: What do Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu do in such cases? What do they do when they don't want to eat pickles, to drink stolen water, or wine from the vineyard of Naboth?
	But over the radio I heard that the ambassador had disappeared. After he found out about the meeting in the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem where he would be reprimanded, he went underground; where is he? The Danish ambassador is also thinking of changing his address and cutting off contact. The low-chair method is proving itself - they're afraid.
	Because what will they have to say in their defense? They have no chance of leaving this inquiry safely. "This is singling out Israel unfavorably on a clearly political basis," said the spokesman when the scandal was revealed: They are plotting to force us to engage in truth in advertising, to distinguish between products of the settlements and Made In Israel. And who has ever heard of a government that decides "on a political basis," and of another country that offers the fruits of stolen land.
	And here is a reminder: The Israeli government promised 10 years ago to mark the difference clearly - Yesha (Judea and Samaria ) is not here. Since then the government has been using our money to compensate factories in the settlements for their losses. But the Ahabs who are being robbed insist on both benefiting and deceiving. Israel did not keep its promise, blurred the borders and mixed up the products. And they still come with complaints to those who have been deceived, who wanted to buy grapes and cherries and were sold rotten fruit.
	And perhaps the ambassador is hiding out somewhere and refusing to go up to Jerusalem because he fears for his safety. He is liable to look like a foreign worker, a cancer or a microbe, and Miri Regev is liable to stone his car on the way and shatter the windshield. Never mind that she is now a Knesset member, but only yesterday this cow was a brigadier general in the Israel Defense Forces, and we can wonder why she wasn't appointed a major general on the basis of her profile. I won't forgive her and her girlfriends, MKs Ronit, Tzipi H., Anastasia, Yulia and Limor for undermining my hope for a better world under female leadership.
	The South African government, with all due respect, is also not exempt from suspicion of ulterior motives - is it possible that they remember there what Israel did to them? Do they still bear a grudge against us for remaining among the last of the collaborators with the racist regime? Do they know in South Africa how to smell apartheid-like regimes from afar?
	The moon of Alabama is shining on Tel Aviv and Eilat. How fortunate that its light did not reveal crystal dishes, mahogany furniture and pianos. After all, what are we talking about here: about human beings who are in any case broken and battered, whose bodies are one big black star.
	And another good thing: For a brief period another "other" has been found to whom we can condescend and whom we can blame for everything, and a million "non-Jews" who live among us will enjoy a temporary respite. Xenophobia is a permanent variable, only its victim changes from time to time, and he doesn't have to be an Arab, who is harder to identify in the street, whereas all the blacks have the same face, especially at night.

<title>If only Israel were South Africa </title>
<date>Sun Sep 02 03:49:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
When did you last cry at a movie? It happened to me two days ago: Three times the tears flowed during one film, which is no trifling matter. The first time it happened was during a film at the Tel Aviv Cinematheque when the screen showed Adriaan Vlok, former minister of law and order in South Africa's apartheid regime, kneeling to wash the feet of Maria Ntuli. His people had poisoned Ntuli's teenage son, then blew him up together with nine other youths in his car, and he, one of the most reviled and apparently cruel figures of the Apartheid era, now spends his days distributing food to the families of his victims. When Vlok entered Ntuli's home she recognized him and went into shock; later he washed her feet in a Christian and humanistic ritual that could leave no one indifferent.
The second time the tears welled up was when one of the leaders of the violent opposition to apartheid, Rashid Ishmail Abu Bakar burst into bitter tears when he heard the story of his Israeli interlocutor, Robi Damelin, whose soldier son David was killed during the second intifada, and is now active on the Parents Circle forum of bereaved Israeli and Palestinian families.
The third time my eyes dampened was when Desmond Tutu began crying while telling Damelin that the day will come when Truth and Reconciliation Commissions will be set up in Israel and Palestine, as in his country.
Watching Miri and Erez Laufer's documentary "One Day After Peace" on Damelin's journey to the country of her birth, South Africa, is not only emotionally moving; it also reflects sadly on the abyss between Israel and South Africa. Just imagine Ehud Barak kneeling one day in the Jenin refugee camp to wash the feet of a bereaved Palestinian father; try to imagine Shaul Mofaz distributing food in the Deheisheh refugee camp, or Moshe Ya'alon doing the same in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. After last week's summer day dream in which Israel allowed hoards of Palestinians to come to the Tel Aviv beach, the fantasy of establishing truth and reconciliation commissions here seems farther away than ever, yet at the same time it sparks the imagination.
When comparing the similarities and differences between the occupation regime in the territories and the apartheid regime in South Africa, one must include the endings: There, it is a good one, while here an ending seems so far away. For the sake of reconciliation, Damelin, a noble and brave woman, is prepared to accept the release of Ta'er Hamad, the sniper who killed her son and nine other Israelis at the West Bank roadblock, even though he replied to her with a vitriolic letter from prison. But here one can still only dream of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions like the one in South Africa.
Israel does not cease to tongue-lash South Africa. Only last week Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon announced that "the apartheid regime has not ended" (because South Africa dared to mark goods manufactured in the settlements ). But even this ridiculous, boorish declaration by the deputy foreign minister of a state that cooperated with apartheid cannot blur the impressive lesson that this country could bequeath to Israel. But in Israel such a possibility seems hallucinatory and cannot be considered as long as the occupation continues and the injustice does not end.
And despite all of that, let us imagine, even for a moment, that far-away day when Israel will kneel and ask for forgiveness. The moment when the heads of the occupation regime admit their iniquities to the Truth and Reconciliation Commissions that will be formed here too. The day when the whole truth is revealed by its instigators, and in the footsteps of truth, and only in its footsteps, can come reconciliation. This sounds crazy? Yes, but toward the end of the 1980s, not a long time ago in historical terms, no one would ever have imagined seeing Adriaan Vlok enter the homes of blacks, kneel down to wash the feet of his victims, and watch as his victims hug him.

<title>Islamism is the real enemy of Muslims and Israel</title>
<date>Sun Sep 09 10:52:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
Islamism, and not ‘Islamophobia,’ is the real enemy of Israel, in contrast to the opinion published in Haaretz recently. Islamism is also my enemy: the enemy of all free-willed Muslim humanists.
Consider the latest stronghold of political Islamism - Ahmedinejad’s Iran, where last month 77 programs at 36 universities promptly became ‘single gender,’ instantly banning women from their studies. Ideologically, Iran is increasingly Islamist, promoting a way of thinking that is both ferociously misogynist and anti-Semitic. The global threat posed by Islamism is a central focus at this year’s International Institute of Counter Terrorism’s 12th Annual World Summit in Herzliya, Israel, that begins tomorrow.
I first encountered gender apartheid ‘in the name of Islam’ when practicing medicine in Saudi Arabia, an experience I explored in my first book. My upbringing as a pluralist Muslim daughter by liberal, yet devout, British Pakistani parents was poor preparation for Saudi Arabia indeed. Saudi Arabia excludes women from the public space by fallaciously claiming a ‘foundation’ in Islam. Saudi Arabia blatantly disregards Islam’s enshrinement of those rights of women most likely to be trampled upon by men.
Shia Iran’s confinement of women is identically motivated. Rather than faith-based however, both the extremist Shia administration in Iran and the Sunni Wahhabi theocracy in Saudi Arabia pursue identical political goals. The elimination of women from Iran’s universities solidifies increasingly Islamist-centric policies, while in Saudi Arabia, the traditional tribal monarchy relies heavily on legitimacy borrowed from a fundamentalist and misogynistic interpretation of Islam. Both demand first the bridling, and later, the complete subjugation, of the Muslim woman.
A Muslim public tightly coiled against an increasingly strained and hysterical leadership, Iran fears the growing power of its female intelligentsia, which presently outcompetes its male counterparts in Iran’s universities. These women trigger rising anxieties in a brittle leadership acutely aware that non-Arab Iran remains vulnerable to the aftershocks of the Arab Spring, never forgetting that the female Iranian university graduates who led the 2010 electoral protests were the vanguard of the uprisings in the Arab world, though sadly their protests would be brutally quashed as a disengaged West looked on.
Examining Iran’s constitution explains the intensifying Iranian Islamist appetites of which gender apartheid is integral. Originally born in the Sunni Islam of 1928's Egypt, political Islamism has only recently penetrated the Shia psyche. Today, Iran’s constitution is now brazenly Islamist, as Richard Horowitz, former Israel Defense Forces officer and New York attorney - who represents Iranian dissidents and former Iranian political prisoners - describes in the World Policy Journal. Speaking to Horowitz in New York City this week, he cited Article 20 of Iran’s constitution:“All citizens of the country, both men and women, equally enjoy the protection of the law and enjoy all human, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, in conformity with Islamic criteria.”Horowitz immediately observed to me that “the essence of ‘constitutional rights’ is that they are not subordinate to legislation or theology. Article 20’s ostensible protection of equal rights for women is immaterial if it must be ‘in conformity with Islamic criteria,’
Political scientist Dr. Bassam Tibi, a renowned global expert on Islamism, has also noted the vacuum on women’s issues within the political Islamist canon, a gap indicating the complete dismissal of women in Islamist society, even from the mere effort of discussion.
Just as perverse, Islamist anti-Semitism is an essential construct for political Islamist ideology. Make no mistake: just as the Iranian regime actively seeks to expunge the Iranian  woman so too it seeks to expunge the Israeli and the Jew.
Islamized anti-Semitism is more dangerous than the lethal Eurocentric Nazi or neo-Nazi ideology with which the world is more familiar. Because Islamist anti-Semitism wields invented religious currency, (lending it false, but hugely influential import) it become orders of magnitude more dangerous. Religionized in this way, Islamist anti-Semitism can be localized whilst being camouflaged in the rites and responsibilities of the observing faithful – a grand deception indeed, and one which invests enormous cultural and spiritual capital in subscribing to anti-Semitism.
The new Islamist anti-Semitism is indeed rooted in Eurocentric origins, deriving inspiration particularly from genocidal Nazi ideologies. Initially transplanted during the Nazi era, Eurocentric anti-Semitism was first embraced by secular Christian Arabs and later by secular Muslims as an accepted tenet of pan-Arab nationalism seeking to overthrow the vestiges of European colonialism. It was thus disengaged from religious belief.
Present-day Islamized anti-Semitism is a different animal. Despite valiant Islamist efforts to portray an ancient origin to the contrary, the new Islamized anti-Semitism is very much a modern allegory standing in stark contrast to Islam’s scriptural texts or Islam’s recorded history of interaction with global Jewry.
While Islamists (including Iran) express global intentions seeking a borderless, supremacist Caliphate and are thus mortally opposed to secular nationalism, they are unscrupulous ideological plagiarists, borrowing multilaterally when it comes to anti-Semitism.
Infusing anti-Semitism with religious overtones amplifies both its legitimacy and palatability to the unthinking Muslim masses. Further, Islamists’ strenuous laboring to manufacture a fictional point of origin of this Islamized anti-Semitism - as an article of faith - is a serious attempt to retool anti-Semitism as an authentic integral component to Islamic belief, rather than reveal its modern Western Eurocentric origins. Cloaking Islamist anti-Semitism in religious rhetoric simultaneously seduces the uneducated Muslim, while shielding these offensive ideas from scrutiny. Any inquiry into these beliefs triggers cries of Islamophobia that both distances these beliefs from a thorough examination while also defiling the enquirer.  
The Iranian university ban is a final canary in the proverbial mine - a deepening of Iran’s embrace of increasingly extreme Islamist ideologies. As hardships exacted on Iranian women accumulate, so too will the anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric escalate. Iran's leadership is neither mincing its words nor attempting to appease its long-disenfranchised public, which has languished in misery since the Revolution. No, the Iranian public does not move the Iranian leadership. Instead, in the hands of Islamists, Iran's administration is clearly articulating its foreign policy intentions.
Understand: Iran’s is not an anti-Zionism nor an anti-Semitism based on aspirations of Palestinian self-determination. Palestinians are as irrelevant to the Iranian government as are their own women. It is for this reason that even the achievement of a two-state solution would not free Israel from the threat of Islamism, whether from Iran or elsewhere. Rather, these are the cries of an Islamist superstate.
The world is long inured to an 'acceptable' level of hatred of Israel - and many warning canaries in the mine will continue to die, unnoticed. Extreme speech, however, precipitates extreme action. Dyadic discourse becomes increasingly simplistic and bipolar as conflict approaches. We can already see the diminishing nuance in the Iran-Israel discourse today.  
In Islamists, the secular Muslim, the anti-Islamist Muslim, the Israeli and every woman everywhere shares the same opponent - one that can be defeated only by joining forces both intellectual and military. At this critical moment, liberals here and abroad face a pivotal choice. They can either advance public dialogue within vibrant liberal democracies as we consider how best to scrutinize and head off the challenge of political Islamism. Or, if liberals choose to condemn such critical debate and analysis of Islamists – not of Islam in general - as ‘Islamophobic’, then we are handing a victory to the Islamists themselves who seek to silence this very discourse. Such liberals should know that our silence means we are colluding with those who seek our shared destruction even, so help us God, as we shield our nascent destroyers.

<title>Israel can't seem to kick the West Bank settlement drug</title>
<date>Sun Feb 12 04:42:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Today - a few days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the reconciliation deal between Fatah and Hamas a sign of Palestinian refusal of the peace process - the Ministerial Committee for Legislation will discuss another project showing Israel's addiction to the settlement drug.
Coalition Chairman Zeev Elkin and his Likud colleague Zion Pinyan have proposed an amendment to the law governing tax breaks on contributions to foster the growth of communities. Donors will be able to deduct 35 percent of their contribution. Thus the state's tax exemption to institutions that promote public goals will be expanded to include organizations that promote the settlements.
The initiators of the legislation say the amendment has a "negligible" significance on the budget. But its political significance cannot be overstated.
The proposed amendment, like declaring the settlements a preferred development area and promoting the legalization of outposts, is a crude breach of Israel's international obligations. Ariel Sharon's government, in which Netanyahu served as finance minister, pledged in 2004 to U.S. President George W. Bush to stop allocating resources to encourage settlement in the occupied territories. This move was designed to stop creating hasty facts on the ground that would make it difficult to implement a two-state solution.
What are your thoughts on this issue? Follow Haaretz.com on Facebook and share your views.
Elkin and Pinyan say the tax break for contributions is intended to bring progress to communities throughout the country and strengthen "Zionist values." Hopefully the cabinet is aware of the contradiction between Zionist values on the one hand and fostering settlements and erasing the Green Line on the other. The de facto annexation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem undermine Israel's Jewish and democratic character and threaten to leave it with a choice between a binational state and a pariah apartheid state.
The day after his victory over Likud's extremist wing, headed by Moshe Feiglin, Netanyahu boasted that the party's members had shown their faith in his policies. The initiative to encourage the settlements and defend the outposts, like the moves to dodge diplomatic negotiations, make it hard to spot the difference.

<title>Israeli Arabs have never been equal before the law </title>
<date>Tue Jan 17 03:49:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Last week's decision by the High Court of Justice to uphold the amendment to the Citizenship Law that keeps Palestinians apart from their Israeli spouses has closed a chapter in the life of Israeli democracy. The Supreme Court no longer wants to protect Israel's Arab citizens.
Racists sitting in the stands at soccer games who yell "Death to Arabs" have never ripped a mother away from her children. But Justice Asher Dan Grunis and his friends have rendered such expulsions kosher, and the representatives of Israel's Arab citizens will now have to bring the issue to the international community.
Of the amendment upheld by the High Court, Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken wrote in this paper in May 2005: "Ostensibly the amendment to the Citizenship Law is equitable. It prevents a man from Haifa from marrying a woman from Ramallah and living with her in Haifa, and does not distinguish between Jews and Arabs. But it's clear that it isn't equitable: Jews rarely marry Palestinians."
For three days afterward, in a hysterical response, Maariv's entire opinion page was devoted to wild attacks on Schocken and his piece. Only one of the opinion pieces is even worth quoting: that of Prof. Amnon Rubinstein, author of "The Constitutional Law of the State of Israel."
"Every state, even if not by law, has the right to prevent immigration of any kind from an enemy state or enemy territory," Rubinstein wrote at the time. "Must Israel permit immigration from Syria? Of course not. Was England, during World War II, obligated to permit immigration from Germany, or even from German protectorates? Of course not. So why doesn't this rule apply to Israel?
"It's true, the Palestinian Authority is not a state, but if a ban on immigration applies to an enemy state, it applies even more so to an enemy territory."
Afterward, Rubinstein published statements to this effect as part of a scholarly academic article, which expanded the argument with the help of numerous references and citations. He later chaired a government committee that justified this wrongdoing.
Why is Rubinstein worth quoting? Because before leaving the Knesset in 2002, he was an MK representing Meretz, the last significant political party of the Zionist left; because his words are cited by Grunis in his ruling; and because Rubinstein is considered a veteran analyst, a member of a select group of legal commentators who sat quietly for eight years, since the amendment came into force as a "temporary emergency measure."
Even now, these legal commentators are not commenting. The looming expulsion of thousands will be carried out with the silent agreement of enlightened members of society. This silence does not stem from their deep respect for the High Court of Justice. Its cause is that maintaining a Jewish majority is an ideological common denominator for the overwhelming majority of Israelis, and this ruling is a symptom of the demographic arguments made on their behalf.
But in effect, Rubinstein was lying. In order to discriminate against the Arab citizens of Israel, Rubinstein wrote about residents of the territories, who do not live in an enemy state. They live in an Israeli ghetto, a bantustan, without the right, as blacks had in apartheid South Africa, to earn a living from their masters.
The State of Israel is officially in its 64th year. But it can be more accurately seen as an imaginary entity that existed in reality only for the 19 years between 1948 and 1967.
Temporariness is an illusion. For jurists it's also a cynical trick.
The expulsion of women and children from their homes will be carried out by a state that has never held Arabs to be equal before the law. That's the real reason an Israeli constitution was never written. That inequality was the wound. Now it's just pus.

<title>Israeli roulette </title>
<date>Mon Jul 30 03:47:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Recently I had a heart-to-heart talk with a beloved relative who was born in this country, in an effort to persuade her to return and bring up her children in Israel. I was reminded of this conversation when I read the speeches made last week by the two leaders of the nation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak, at the graduation ceremony of the National Security College.
	In his speech Netanyahu presented the five leading challenges that threaten the country: the Iranian nuclear program, the missile threat, cyber warfare, problems near the borders and the stockpiling of weapons in the region. He promised Israel would do its utmost to stop the Iranian nuclear program. He vowed that, to the extent that it is necessary, Israel would surround additional parts of the country with security fences, alter the composition of its forces and increase the defense budget.
	Barak went even further in enumerating the disasters that confront us and could destroy us. The challenges we face, he said, are among the most complex and complicated that the state has faced in its entire existence. He warned that the Iranian nuclear plan could turn into an existential threat against the state, prophesized that neither diplomacy nor sanctions would be able to stop it, and promised not to remove any option from the agenda to thwart it. For dessert, the minister promised that Israel would not stand by idly watching while sophisticated weapons systems are transferred from Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
	The prime minister ended up his lecture by expressing his belief that the sons of Israel would be ready "to throw themselves into the mission of defending the country in a way unequalled in any other country." Barak told the graduates that at the moment of truth, if faced with the ultimate test, Israel would be able to rely only on itself.
	A country that has promised to provide Jews who have gathered there from all corners of the globe with peace, security and welfare, is offering them more blood, more sweat and more tears. They would not have phrased the national vision better at the graduation ceremony of the National Security College in ancient Sparta.
	Three years after his Bar-Ilan speech - in which Netanyahu repeated the word "peace" 44 times - he added it again at the end of this speech, like a leftover, when promising to safeguard Israel's security "and also our ability to preserve peace and to achieve peace with other neighbors."
	The prime minister mentioned the State of Israel's existence as a state, and as a Jewish and democratic one, only in the context of the need to guard the borders "from illegal infiltrators."
	Solving the conflict with the Palestinians won no mention in the list of national security challenges that the two most influential people in Israel presented to the graduates of the college. They did not even pay lip service to the "peace process" or a "two-state solution" which also has been imprisoned in quotation marks.
	In a hair-raising report about her experiences in Syria, published last week in The New York Times, the courageous writer and war correspondent Janine di Giovanni wonders: "When does life as you know it implode? How do you know when it is necessary to pack up your home and your family and leave your country? And if you decide not to, why?"
	Is life in Israel where we wanted to raise our children - a peace-loving country that believes in democratic and Jewish values and in a society of solidarity - not imploding on us? How do Netanyahu and Barak intend to revive these values on the morning after the bombing of Iran and the bombing in retaliation? Will it perhaps enter their minds to relate after all this time to the Arab peace initiative that has been waiting embarrassedly for more than a decade - or will they allow Israel to sink even deeper into the reality of apartheid?
	Who wants to go to sleep with the nightmare that he may be among the 500 victims of the confrontation with Tehran or to awaken in the morning with the fear of a missile attack from Lebanon? How many Israelis believe that another round of violence in the territories, with its danger of deteriorating into a regional conflict, will not be a war of "peace for [the outpost of] Migron" - that magical Israeli term that turns every war into peace and every occupation into a vision.
	How many Israelis ask themselves why they remain in a country that has become the most dangerous place for Jews? And who is prepared to recommend to a beloved relative that she should come home and raise her children here?

<title>Israelis can be angry with Gunter Grass, but they must listen to him</title>
<date>Sun Apr 08 00:51:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	The harsh, and in some parts infuriating, poem by Gunter Grass of course immediately sparked a wave of vilifications against it and mainly against its author. Grass indeed went a few steps too far (and too mendaciously ) - Israel will not destroy the Iranian people - and for that he will be punished, in his own country and in Israel. But in precisely the same way the poem's nine stanzas lost a sense of proportion in terms of their judgment of Israel, so too the angry responses to it suffer from exaggeration. Tom Segev wrote in Haaretz: "Unless Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad recently confided in him, his opinion is vacuous." ("More pathetic than anti-Semitic," April 5 ). Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu mentioned Grass' Nazi past, and Israeli embassies in Germany went so far as to state, ridiculously, that the poem signified "anti-Semitism in the best European tradition of blood libels before Passover."
	It is doubtful that Grass intended his poem to be published on the eve of Passover. It contains no blood libel. In fact, it is the branding of it as anti-Semitic that is a matter of tradition - all criticism of Israel is immediately thus labeled. Grass' Nazi past, his joining the Waffen SS as a youth, does not warrant shutting him up some 70 years later, and his opinion is far from vacuous. According to Segev, anyone who is not a nuclear scientist, an Israeli prime minister or an Iranian president must keep silent on the stormiest issue in Israel and the world today. That is a flawed approach.
	Grass' "What Must Be Said" does contain things that must be said. It can and should be said that Israel's policy is endangering world peace. His position against Israeli nuclear power is also legitimate. He can also oppose supplying submarines to Israel without his past immediately being pulled out as a counterclaim. But Grass exaggerated, unnecessarily and in a way that damaged his own position. Perhaps it is his advanced age and his ambition to attract a last round of attention, and perhaps the words came forth all at once like a cascade, after decades during which it was almost impossible to criticize Israel in Germany.
	That's the way it is when all criticism of Israel is considered illegitimate and improper and is stopped up inside for years. In the end it erupts in an extreme form. Grass' poem was published only a few weeks after another prominent German, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Sigmar Gabriel, wrote that there is an apartheid regime in Hebron. He also aroused angry responses. Therefore it is better to listen to the statements and, especially, finally, to lift the prohibition against criticizing Israel in Germany.
	Israel has many friends in Germany, more than in most European countries. Some of them support us blindly, some have justified guilt feelings and some are true, critical friends of Israel. There are, of course, anti-Semites in Germany and the demand that Germany never forget is also justified. But a situation in which any German who dares criticize Israel is instantly accused of anti-Semitism is intolerable.
	Some years ago, after a critical article of mine was published in the German daily Die Welt, one of its editors told me: "No journalist of ours could write an article like that." I was never again invited to write for that paper. For years, any journalist who joined the huge German media outlet Axel Springer had to sign a pledge never to write anything that casts aspersions on Israel's right to exist. That is an unhealthy situation that ended with an eruption of exaggerated criticism like Grass'.
	Grass is not alone. No less of a major figure, the great author Jose de Sousa Saramago opened the floodgates in his later years when, after a visit to the occupied territories, he compared what was going on there to Auschwitz. Like Grass, Saramago went too far, but his remarks about the Israelis should have been heeded: "Living under the shadow of the Holocaust and expecting forgiveness for everything they will do in the name of their suffering seems coarse. They have learned nothing from the suffering of their parents and their grandparents."
	After we denounce the exaggeration, after we shake off the unjustified part of the charge, we must listen to these great people. They are not anti-Semites, they are expressing the opinion of many people. Instead of accusing them we should consider what we did that led them to express it..

<title>Israel is fighting a losing battle over victimhood</title>
<date>Mon Mar 19 01:28:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	With regard to A.B. Yehoshua's extraordinary remark - that he had "never heard the Jews analyze the Holocaust as a Jewish failure, which was not anticipated" - I can only wonder where the renowned author was when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu waved the "Auschwitz letters"? Yehoshua didn't hear that Netanyahu said that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is the new version of Adolf Hitler? He didn't know that Netanyahu had promised that he would not, under any circumstances, allow Iran to carry out a second Holocaust? Doesn't Yehoshua understand that Shoah equals victimhood - not guilt, not failure, and without any doubt whatsoever - and that the ability to play the victim is a strategic asset with an existential value?
	In her new book, "Who is Afraid of Historical Redress: The Israeli Victim-Perpetrator Dichotomy," Dr. Ruth Amir wrotes that the perception of Israeli-Jewish victimhood, which was always present in the Jewish narrative and Jewish thought, became even stronger after the Holocaust and serves to give Israel political legitimacy.
 What are your thoughts on this issue? Follow Haaretz.com on Facebook and share your views
	Amir, who heads the Department of Multidisciplinary Studies at the Jezreel Academic College (full disclosure: This writer is a member of the college's board of governors ), notes that the fact that Israel sees itself as a victim justifies its aggression and injustice. With the help of guilt-neutralizing mechanisms, Israelis disengage the circumstantial link between an action and its consequences, and absolve themselves of responsibility. That is why they aren't interested in trying to correct injustices and reconcile with their neighbor.
	The death of John Demjanjuk recalls the declaration that Shulamit Aloni attributes to the late Prime Minister Golda Meir after the Eichmann trial: "Now, when everyone knows what they did to us, we can do anything we want, and no one has the right to criticize us and tell us what to do." Meir even apparently commented that she would never forgive our enemies for "forcing" us to kill them - another victim-like comment.
	Prime Minister Menachem Begin said before the bombing of Beirut during the first Lebanon war that "No country that fought in World War II has any right to preach morality to us, since they did nothing to stop the killing and extermination of the Jews."
	Victimhood purifies the victim of any guilt and enables him to request empathy - even if he is the stronger, victorious, occupying party. This duality is the reason that for years, victimhood speeches by Israeli leaders have succeeded in bringing American Jews to their feet, applauding, and getting them to open their wallets.
	The problem is that since World War II the language of human rights has been gradually taking the place of the Holocaust in diplomatic and moral discourse. Even in Germany it's getting harder and harder to play the role of occupier-victim. Sigmar Gabriel, the chairman of that country's Social-Democratic Party, who has his eyes on the chancellor's seat, visited Israel and the territories last week and didn't hesitate to write on his Facebook page that in Hebron there is an apartheid regime.
	If you remove the Holocaust and victimhood from the debate, Netanyahu's claim that "Israel has the right to defend itself," turns into a double-edged sword. How then, are we meant to respond to the Palestinian leader who will claim: "It's the right of a people without a state to defend itself?"
	True, there is a difference. Israel is not threatening to destroy the Palestinians. It is "only" taking their lands and has "only" been holding them under a regime of occupation for 45 years, without basic civil rights. From another perspective, if it's justified to impose sanctions on Iran because it desires nuclear deterrence, why is it forbidden to impose sanctions on Israel so as to stop settlement in the territories?
	Remove the Holocaust and victimhood from Israel and then ask yourself: If it's permissible for this country to bomb Iran to free itself from a nuclear threat, then why are the Palestinians forbidden to launch rockets against Israel to free themselves of the occupation? Does Jewish construction in the occupied territories accord with the law and international consensus any more than the Palestinian request to be accepted as a UN member? For how long will the Holocaust save the world's last colonialist government from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, when it is trying to withhold nuclear power from Iran?
	Without entering into self-righteous symmetry, it must be said that many of the Palestinians have yet to wean themselves from their addiction to the Nakba (the so-called catastrophe of the creation of the Jewish state ) and their own victimhood. The key to their old house in Sheikh Munis (now Ramat Aviv ) that they wear around their necks will not open the door for them to a Palestinian state.
	In this endless battle, the battle over victimhood, everybody loses.

<title>Israel needs a few more lessons in apartheid </title>
<date>Mon Jan 30 03:01:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Scholars of the social sciences know how to defend a public opinion survey. In their way of thinking, this is a scientific tool with which it is possible to assess feelings and understand positions and trends at any given time. Together with these "quiz shows" that supply the masses with a glimpse of the mood of the public, we are also able to familiarize ourselves with the personal feelings, points of view and tendencies of those who conduct the polls.
Zionism did not merely pave paths of ethnic discrimination in the occupied territories. Discrimination against civilians exists in every corner of the country. Research institutes and the media, whether intentionally or not, cooperate with this discrimination and also perpetuate it. In parallel to that, the slogan "a light unto the nations" is repeated here ad nauseum. It is therefore worthwhile comparing the situation in Israel with that among "the nations."
Take, for example, the Population Registry Law. During the era of apartheid in South Africa, the citizens of that country were forced to register themselves with the authorities on the basis of their skin color: white, black or colored. In Israel it is not possible to oblige people to sign up in the registry according to their race or color, since the Jews themselves belong to assorted colors and races: Some are white because they came from Poland or Russia, and others are dark skinned - from Yemen or Ethiopia. With no other option, the Zionist mind was forced to invent a unique solution that was suitable to this place, and which answers the need for separation, and thus it was that the registration was born, of Jews, Arabs, Druze and so forth, in the Israeli Interior Ministry.
Another discriminatory law that was enacted in South Africa allotted separate living areas to different races. One can compare it with the local law about selection committees, whose entire objective is to make it possible for various community settlements to chose who will be allowed to become members - based on ethnic background.
Recently the state has managed to peek into the bedrooms of the Arab citizens via the Citizenship Law, which places restrictions on their marriages. And the last word has not been said on this matter.
The election season is drawing close here. This will no doubt bring blessings and money to all who deal with it, first and foremost the polling institutes. From reports about the surveys we can learn that ethnic separation is alive and well, both in these institutes themselves as well as in most of the Israeli media. Indeed, the latter will pounce on the polls' findings. Politicians will rush to check their popularity among herds of voters. The disappointed politicians who lack inspiration and intelligence will turn to recipes supplied to them by the witch doctors known as media advisers. These witch doctors will instruct the aspiring politicians how to win the support of the masses. Between them and their followers, they will no doubt explain that a political platform is not as important as the show: The more the hopefuls sweat, run around and appear on every screen, the greater their chances of influencing the average voter.
The public opinion surveys also tell us, as noted, about those who conduct them. "If elections were to be held now," the pollsters tell us, this party would get this number of seats, and that party would get that number of seats. Then, at the very end of the detailed report about this and that, within the context of the "menu" of Jewish-democratic parties, will come the eternal sentence: "And the Arab parties will receive such and such a number of seats." Because in the eyes of every "educated" Zionist, every single Arab is an Ahmed, or is assumed to be an Ahmed.
It is therefore not clear why so much time and money is being spent. After all, the election results are a forgone conclusion: 110 Knesset seats to the Jewish parties and 10 seats to the Arab parties - is that not so? Here is yet another lesson in the apartheid sciences.

<title>Israel's 'agricultural apartheid'</title>
<date>Sun Mar 25 04:13:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria can be broken down into a number of periods - the settlement period, during which dozens of communities were established (mostly under the Labor Party, and much of it due to President Shimon Peres ); the agricultural period, during which settlers took over land, cleared stones, planted and sowed; and the period of tourism, during which wineries, bed and breakfasts, restaurants and tourist attractions were built under every tree.
	The agricultural period began some 15 years ago and has continued to this day. Some of the settlements described as agricultural, like Ofra, Carmel and those in the Jordan Valley, started their relationship with the land about 35 years ago. However, there are good people in the military advocate general's office who do not look favorably upon Jewish farmers in Judea and Samaria and are doing their best to remove Jewish presence from the area. Agricultural apartheid. One of the most important and creative means is the "directive for disruptive usage."
	According to Israeli law it is possible to evict someone who has entered an area that is not their own for 30 days after the fact. However, the directive for disruptive usage states that Jews can be evicted from land they have cultivated for as long as three years, and later this period of time was extended to five years. This applies even if the land has never been cultivated before, even if for years no single Arab has claimed ownership of the land, and even if there is no proof of another person's ownership.
	This directive discriminates against Jews. It is a racist directive. The head of the Civil Administration, Brig. Gen. Moti Almoz, recognized the fundamental problem and has so far avoided implementing it. This act, or more precisely the avoidance of taking action, has angered the legal advisers at Central Command and especially Col. Eli Bar On, who wrote a sharply worded letter to the Civil Administration head, reminding him of his role and of who runs things. He apparently forgot that he is a legal adviser. His role is to advise, and only when he is asked.
	In the letter Bar On tries to explain the reasons why the directive should be implemented - an absence of court proceedings, a lack of legal tools and an inability to access a land registry. Of course these are ridiculous claims and are fundamentally exaggerated. The courts are full of Palestinians submitting complaints all the time. And they have a fleet of top-ranking lawyers from the most moonstruck of the left-wingers.
	The fourth argument in Bar On's letter is that it is necessary to "minimize the number of conflicts and their intensity." In other words, the honored brigadier general says it is possible to prevent Palestinian violence if the Jewish side surrenders in advance, instead of holding a fair trial as is accepted throughout the world.
	Sometimes an appeal against implementation of the directive is filed with the military appeals committee. In some cases the appeals committee accepts the appeal but the state evicts the Jewish farmer nonetheless. Why should we bother with trivialities since we are in the business of justice?
	The directive of disruptive usage embroils the Civil Administration in civilian land disputes. This is not its role but the role of the courts. If someone has a claim and proof, then he should turn to the authorized organ for a decision. There is no way this directive would be accepted through proper legal proceedings. It would not pass legal evaluation at an earlier stage since it contradicts the fundamental principles of human rights.
	I think Bar On has become confused on a number of levels: a. The head of the Civil Administration should not intervene in civil land disputes; b. A legal adviser should not forcefully intervene in the decisions of the head of the executive authority on the ground; c. He apparently has forgotten that this is a Zionist state.

<title>Israel's irrational defense establishment </title>
<date>Mon Apr 30 02:05:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	It's safe to assume that when former Shin Bet chief Yuval Diskin spoke of the "two messianics" leading the country, what he really meant to say was that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak are acting on irrational motives.
	During this week's Independence Day celebration, Barak - who invented the image of Israel as a villa in the jungle - suggested the prerequisites for being accepted into the rational leaders club, insofar as rationality is defined "in the Western sense of the word." He explained that it isn't enough for rational leaders to be "sophisticated and calculating, aspiring to remain in power, and aiming for their goals with unending cunning while continuously gauging the steps and intentions of their rivals." They must prove, he said, that "they are seeking peaceful solutions to the problems on the agenda."
	Barak was referring, of course, to the ayatollahs who rule Iran. It would never occur to any of our leaders to employ calculation and cunning to break up a party while remaining in power. We clearly have a government that has been turning every stone in search of peaceful solutions.
	The following questions ought to help Barak determine whether he and Netanyahu are indeed worthy of the title "rational in the Western sense of the word":
	Would rational leadership deny the risk that intensifying the occupation and freezing negotiations with the Palestinians - combined with the growing solidarity of the general Arab public with their brethren in the territories, the regime change in Egypt, and the increased pressure on Iran - might put an end to Israel's monopoly on nuclear weapons in the region (according to foreign sources, of course )?
	Is it rational to ignore the possibility that a change in U.S. government and the rise in oil prices will generate international pressure on Israel to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and to eliminate weapons of mass destruction from the Middle East?
	Would rational leadership toss out a peace initiative that has the support of all the Muslim countries, an initiative that offers our little state recognition within borders that will be accepted by the whole world, with some territorial exchanges, normalization and security arrangements?
	Would rational leaders ignore the fact that the absence of a Syrian partner offers Israel an opportunity to come to a separate agreement with the Palestinians, without having to address demands that it give up the Golan Heights?
	Does rational leadership - whose raison d'etre is to preserve its country's Jewish and democratic identity - spend massive resources dispersing its Jewish population in a manner that advances the post- or anti-Zionist concept of turning it into a binational state, or a leprous apartheid regime?
	How rational is it to calmly accept the Knesset speaker's declaration that he would prefer a binational "Whole Land of Israel" to a Jewish state within the 1967 borders, while expelling foreign visitors who come to support a similar arrangement?
	Would a rational leadership talk day and night about "Judaizing Jerusalem," while angrily attacking those who suggest returning to the West Bank the Arab neighborhoods that were annexed to Jerusalem after the Six Day War, and whose population constitutes a third of the city's residents?
	Does anyone know a rational person who dares to seize his neighbor's land and then expects to find a judge who will take seriously his claims that expelling squatters from the property would have far-reaching social consequences?
	Would a rational leadership gamble that the hybrid creature called the Palestinian Authority - which was meant to be part of an interim arrangement - will forever serve as the occupation's subcontractor?
	What's rational about assuming that Greek taxpayers who can't make their own ends meet will pay the salaries of Palestinian teachers and policemen, instead of Israeli tycoons (the price, based on a cautious estimate, would be NIS 12 billion a year )?
	The tragic failure of this test is not just the failure of Netanyahu and Barak; it is the failure of most of Israeli society. What's rational about "social leader" Shelly Yacimovich denying that there's a connection between peace and social welfare? The tens of thousands of Israelis who demonstrated to improve their quality of life, but who refused to say a word about life itself, are irrational men and women.
	There is no great measure of rationality in the way the heads of the defense establishment are conducting themselves, quietly serving irrational leaders and divulging the bitter truth to us only after they take off their uniforms.

<title>Israel's legal 'abuse' of Arab minority is undemocratic</title>
<date>Mon Jan 23 03:38:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
It is difficult to compare the democratic State of Israel to a dark dictatorship. Nevertheless, they have one thing in common: People don't sleep well at night under either regime.
In dictatorships, they fear a revolution on the part of the majority, and in Israeli democracy they do not stop studying the graphs of the birth rate among Arabs, in case the demographic balance is upset.
And there is another commonality: Both groups of the population are oppressed. In a dark dictatorship, the minority oppresses the majority while in Israel, the regime which is supported by an ethnic majority that oppresses the minority.
For 63 years, Israel has not stopped abusing its perfectly pleasant minority, and all of this is completely legal. Every dunam that has been expropriated was approved in the Knesset, every house that was destroyed was sanctified by a court. Local governments in Arab areas are discriminated against in their budgets on the basis of ministerial procedure. All of this is able to take place because the representatives of the ethnic majority are in control in the Knesset, the government offices, the economic institutions and the legal system.
Thus, and also as a result of the demographic phobia, another chapter was written this month in the attempt to harass the minority. The Citizenship Law prohibits Palestinians from living with their Israeli spouses within Israel proper. So, in the guise of an innocent "regulation," women are separated from their husbands and children from their parents, and their lives are turned into an ongoing nightmare.
In the enlightened world, a regulation of this sort would have been thrown out immediately. In Israel it gets the blessing of the Supreme Court of the ethnic majority. The Supreme Court, which is supposed to be the court of last resort for the downtrodden, has left the Arabs without succor. And the Arabs who have learned from their long years of suffering, say: "If your judges deprive you, then to whom can you complain?"
To whom will the Arab citizens complain when the liberal flank - Yair Lapid, Tzipi Livni and Shelly Yachimovich - do not say a word in the face of this injustice, while the right-wing jumps for joy at the suffering of the Arabs?
Meanwhile, the children want to grow up. They cannot wait until the weather is fair. And with the intoxicating smell of the Arab Spring, another arena for struggle is growing - the international arena, with all its institutions. But a hypocritical cry will issue forth from the majority, as if the Arabs are undermining the country's right to existence. No, the Arabs are merely complaining about the right of the majority to abuse them.
No regime has the right to oppress part of its residents, whether it is a corrupt dictatorship or a blooming democracy. But like an abusive husband who forbids his wife to go to the police because one does not air dirty laundry in public, so Israel would like its Arab citizens to behave. Let the laundry smell inside.
And there are people who hope that the minority will move to another apartment because of the smell. The ones who are invited to move to another apartment are those who are disturbed by the crying of a newborn baby, whether it is Arab or Jewish. An Arab baby that is born is not the product of a conspiracy. An Arab baby, like a Jewish baby, is a blessing.
It is important to note that the expression "ethnic majority" is a rough generalization, since many Jews are courageous partners to the struggle against racism. The call for international public opinion to raise its voice completes the struggle of the democratic forces here. This will make it clear to all that the right-wing establishment in Israel has crossed a line in the direction of apartheid.
When Menachem Begin was prime minister, there were intellectuals who pinned their hopes, in vain, on the American administration restraining him. Like then, we cannot wait for salvation to come from the White House. Only the enlightened public opinion of the world can help. And that is for the benefit of the entire family, including those members who on the face of it are not deprived.
Karl Marx said that a people which oppresses another people cannot be free. This is also for the benefit of the ethnic majority which is entitled once and for all to sleep well, without nightmares about demography, and which is entitled to be a people that is free from abusing Arabs.

<title>Israel's suicidal left</title>
<date>Mon Jan 02 02:38:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Most people support having separate showers for men and women at the pool, object to walking naked in the street, and believe that the norm for modest dress is defined by whatever is acceptable in Western countries. That is a short summary of the stupidity over gender separation.
It's ironic that a nation whose life is founded on the cruel separation between citizens and those subject to occupation is capable of anointing anyone a Rosa Parks, as though we were blacks in Alabama and not the ladies and gentlemen of the last remaining apartheid, whose end is nowhere in sight.
Every few months, the Israeli anti-Semitism comes out of the closet and takes the form of what sociologists call "moral panic," which seems to give people license to distort and confuse various issues, especially when you add the beards and traditional dress of ultra-Orthodox men into the mix. Those who are especially meticulous even make sure to give the Jew-boy in their cartoons a hooked nose. This isn't the first time this has happened. There was the uproar about the mother who starved her child, about the Taliban sect, about the pervert who tortured children, about separate classrooms.
The fact that ultra-Orthodox women work in professions including teaching, social work and occupational therapy while the men are increasingly cooking and taking care of the children - even those alternative gender roles are thrown into the distorting pot of incitement.
The enlightened revolutionaries demand a single set of standards for everyone - their own standards. "How much are they costing us?" ask the learned professors, who enjoy financial benefits that no yeshiva head  (or professor in France or Germany ) gets.
During the 1998 "One People, One Draft" campaign, the leftist herd marched to the notes of political correctness, and in the process rehabilitated the image of the army, which had reached a low point during the first Lebanon war and the first intifada. What started with serving in the army as a condition for equality has ended up with efforts to pass a law requiring a loyalty oath.
It should be no surprise, then, that the periodic incitement against the Haredim leads to right-wing extremism. Incitement always ends up with adoration of the state. Thus, Meretz's efforts in the 1990s to make Ashkenazim scared of Shas gave birth to the centrist and secularist Shinui party, which swallowed up the left-wing Meretz party and then itself was swallowed up by Avigdor Lieberman's right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu.
It's about time that the average liberal acquired some historical perspective and asked himself, "What are we really doing when we pursue Haredim and make believe we are battling the right wing?"
There are indeed thugs in Beit Shemesh, and there are a few bus lines that have come to represent those territorial battles - characteristic of all the Jewish contradictions of the Zionist project - that exist between the Haredi minority and other parts of the population. But what does this have to do with the "social protest"?
It's true, the religious are gaining power within the Israel Defense Forces. Some of the army's policies - and not just the draconian prohibition of leaven on Passover - tend to accommodate them. But the liberals can calm down: The army needs soldiers, including religious ones, to separate the Palestinian men from the Palestinian women at the checkpoints, but on the other hand prides itself on the advancement of women. Now women can also sit in front of plasma screens and carry out assassinations at the push of a button, perhaps even while singing. Women's liberation at its best.
So the question isn't who needs the constant incitement against "the Haredim." There are different interested parties at different times, and television, for its part, needs to have a steady target so it can glorify freedom of the press - and promote equality for women, as espoused by beautiful female broadcasters who will be tossed as soon as they show a few wrinkles.
The question is, how does this periodic panic succeed in becoming anti-Semitic psychosis?
The imperative is modernization, which gives Israelis a good part of their identity and self-image. Being modern is the keyword to naturalization in our imaginary Western society.
True, we have left the Arab minority alone, as long as they let us steal their land and turn them from small farmers into poor proletarians, but the Jews who were brought here were put through a process of violent modernization. While there was usually no resistance, there are bitter historical memories.
The Haredi community is the only one challenging the state's modernist ethos. The conflict between modernism and anti-modernism appears to be inevitable, and it has turned the left into the persecutor, as if it were the state, as if the opposition doesn't need an alliance with those who object to state policies - including Haredim, Mizrahi Jews and Muslims. This is the weakness of the Israeli left: It is rooted in the ruling elites who hate minorities.
It's easy to travel to Europe and be postmodern there. It's harder over here. But more important, the right wing and the religious Jews that are the components of what is commonly referred to as the "natural alliance" don't need more fodder for incitement against the left. What the common folk call "condescension" is simply modernist discourse, as if there is only one worthy criterion for social values and only through it can we communicate.
You'll never build an opposition that way.

 Nefesh B'Nefesh bashing
	In response to "Land of Milk and Money," Haaretz Magazine, October 26
	It is with great sadness that I write this letter. I was frankly horrified at the mean-spirited journalism in Haaretz concerning Nefesh B'Nefesh. Nefesh B'Nefesh in partnership with the Jewish Agency has done so much to bring Jews to Israel in the last 10 years. They have smoothed the way and cut red tape and other obstacles so that we in Israel can be blessed with more olim.
	Why your newspaper saw fit to be so vicious and provocative in its presentation of Nefesh B'Nefesh is beyond me. At a time when Israel needs all Jews on deck, at a time when we're searching for good news, Nefesh B'Nefesh is on the scene with one goal only: to bring more Jews to Israel and help them stay in Israel, live and work here and be productive citizens.
	Tony Gelbart's home in Florida bothers you? That Rabbi Fass has a beard is a problem for you? These are men with a vision, and they have made many people's dreams come true. They are devoted to a lofty cause, and I say more power to them.
	My dear editor, what was really bothering you to have such a piece of journalism like that appear in your paper? Is NBN too successful? Your article smacked of intense jealousy and yellow journalism, and you can do much better. I hope not to have to see articles of that doubtful caliber again in your newspaper.

 Where the funding should really go 
	In response to "How to best spend Jews' money," October 26
	The second to fifth words in Anshel Pfeffer's column are "120 most important Jews" who will be in Jerusalem October 31-November 1 for the Jewish People Policy Institute meeting. Who are these 120? Except for a few names, we are left in the dark. Will Home Depot's owners be here, will Mark Zuckerberg be here, will Martin Gilbert or Philip Roth be here, will the real Hollywood David Geffen or Bobby Dylan be here?
	The wispy theme running through Pfeffer's story is that there is plenty of money out there for world Jewry to spend on Israel, Judaism and a strong Jewish future. He is unhappy with how all this money is being spent, so he showers us with his Big 5 list of where the cash should really flow.
	I happen to agree with his point that indigent Holocaust survivors who made it through hell are being shortchanged. He mentions that some of the money is being applied to "education" or "commemoration." But he could have told us that if this money goes to the survivors, its holders will have to give up elaborate banquets, five-star hotels, deluxe seating on flights and a multitude of other perks.
	He also emphasizes that Jewish money should stop going to dinosaur organizations. Sad but true, we the Jewish people are saddled by unrepentant groups who still believe their message should get through since they are sure it is the truth. The continual funding for these agencies is what drives many young Jews away from Judaism. They know what "the real thing is."
	His other three points have no attraction for me. For all three, I would substitute a major investment in Jewish education in the Diaspora. Synagogues and temples are still the largest educators in every locale Jews might live. But the schools, for the most part, are weak because Jewish religious institutions are poorly funded in this area. Give a $25,000 grant to every synagogue and temple in the world for innovative learning programs in Jewish education.
	About 35 years ago, Prof. Marcella Brenner z'l, a talented U.S. educator and philanthropist, met with officials from the Education Ministry. She was prepared to donate major sums of money and increase it regularly so Israeli teachers could create innovative programs for their students. The program offered teachers a chance to think outside the box; many of their pilots have become Ministry courses. If we could do it here, why not all over the world? Look out this week as the modern Sanhedrin lands.

 Akin to a blood libel 
	In response to 'Most Israeli Jews advocate discrimination against Arab citizens,' October 23
	As a long-time subscriber to Haaretz in English, the respected paper's shift from left of center to far left pains me. October 23's lead headline is outrageous. It is based on a minuscule survey of 503 Israeli Jews and interpreted by Gideon Levy in a front-page article.
	The 503 respondents were divided into five distinct groups. How many in each group? How many men, how many women? Young, old? Levy doesn't tell us. Was it conducted by phone or by questionnaires? The questions' formulations are not revealed, so we can't tell whether "most" Israeli Jews actually "advocate" discrimination of Arab citizens or merely tolerate it (bad enough! ).
	Now, by "most," most people think of a number way above half, say around 70 percent. Let's see: In the beginning of the article, the percentages of Jews who supposedly advocate various forms of Arab discrimination are 59, 49 and 42. Frightfully too many, but certainly not "most." On the contrary, toward the end, the percentages of secular Jews who oppose various aspects of Arab discrimination are 68, 73 and 50. Since the secular Jews are a majority, one can conclude that most (regrettably not the vast majority ) of Israeli Jews actually oppose Arab discrimination.
	But most outrageous is Levy's conclusion that "we're racists" and "we practice apartheid." Now, a bigoted person can be called a racist. A person who intentionally blows up a bus filled with passengers can be called a mass murderer, a terrorist, an activist. But "apartheid" is not subject to interpretation. It is a documented system of odious laws and sanctioned practices imposed on the large majority of blacks in South Africa by the small ruling minority of whites.
	Throwing apartheid at Israel is akin to the medieval blood libel, to equating us with the Nazis. According to the article, "the survey conductors say perhaps the term apartheid was not clear enough to some interviewees." It obviously was not clear. Is it clear to Levy?

 Dangerous nostalgia 
	In response to "Native Son," Haaretz Magazine, October 12
	Meron Benvenisti's nostalgia for the Israel of the founders is temperamentally undemocratic. How dare the present generation create its own culture in defiance of the visions of the founders? This is not only Benvenisti's problem. Nostalgia has become the sickness of our time. As Eric Roll wrote in "A History of Economic Thought":
	"It is [during] ... rapid and radical changes in the economic and social structure that there can be found those who are distressed ... but who cannot rise to more than an idealization of the past. They want to re-establish a mythical golden age, since they cannot understand the forces which are transforming their own society."
	Benvenisti confirms Roll's analyses when he says: "I don't understand exactly what is happening. Everything is different. Not what we wanted it to be." His fetishism of the land is reminiscent of Knut Hamsun's and Heidegger's views and not much different than Gush Emunim's.
	He might consider the political and cultural consequences of this land fetishism and how it resulted in some of the greatest crimes in history. This nostalgia for a simpler soil-based existence is dangerous. As historian Peter Gay has written: "Nostalgia is the most sophistic, most deceptive form that regression can take."
	In any case, his claim that the Arabs have a more "authentic" relationship with the soil (as opposed to the invented Zionist relationship ) is just another kitsch version of Orientalism. The truth is that second-generation educated Arabs have no more attachment to the land than Manhattan apartment dwellers.
	As for the one-state constitutional communalism he hints at, one only has to look at Lebanon to realize how impractical the concept is. Given the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, constitutional communalism would be an oxymoron.

 Who's really guilty of blood libel? 
	In response to Gideon Levy's piece "Survey:Most Israeli Jews advocate discrimination against Arab citizens," October 23
	Mr. Eliezer Kreindler calls it "akin to a blood libel." In fact Mr. Kreindler's letter is a libel.
	When was the last time he visited Hebron? Streets for Jews only, roads in the West Bank where no Palestinian can drive. Of course this is apartheid. Rabbis that call for punishment for anyone who rents or sells their home to an Arab - this is apartheid. Calling this "blood libel" is more horrific than any article even if there were a few errors, corrected today by Levy himself.
	There are laws on the books that would have me arrested if I call for a boycott of goods manufactured in the occupied settlements. And the attitude of cabinet ministers to refugees escaping countries to stay alive - is that not apartheid?
	Sorry Mr. Kreindler you should study what blood libel is. We are slowly moving towards an apartheid single state. And there are many politicians calling exactly for that.

 My family's extraordinary days at Emory U 
	In response to "Emory University apologizes for anti-Semitic past" (JTA, October 11 )
	I found the October 11 article about the Emory University Dental School's apology very interesting. Notwithstanding the unacceptable behavior of Emory, I want to share my family's history with the university starting in the 1920s. My mother, Annette Geffen Raskas, was born and raised in Atlanta, GA. She and five of her seven siblings attended Emory and received a total of eight degrees from the university. At that time Emory was a Methodist University and women were not generally permitted to enroll. My mother's father was Rabbi Tuvia Geffen, Chief Rabbi of Atlanta, and he approached Emory's President, Bishop William Candler, asking if there was any possibility that his daughter Annette could attend Emory. The Bishop explained that there were three options for women. Women in the Methodist religious order could attend; relatives of Emory staff members were admissible (but the Bishop apologized that no Jewish studies department existed for Rabbi Geffen ); and lastly, employees of the University could enroll.
	Bishop Candler proceeded to arrange a job for my mother in the University library, which enabled here to earn an undergraduate and masters degree in biology. She was fortunate that there were no longer any Saturday classes at that time, so she did not have to walk the many miles each Shabbat that her three older brothers had to tread while earning their degrees at Emory before her. Six of Rabbi Geffen's grandchildren and their families now live in Israel including journalist David Geffen of Jerusalem, who is also a graduate of Emory.

 Khenin is the best MK to vote for 
	In response to "There's no one to vote for," October 16,
	The juxtaposition of a photo of MK Dov Khenin with the title of this article represents extremely poor journalistic judgment and editing. Although Dov Khenin may not be the perfect candidate for "a secular, liberal, democratic and fair-minded Arab [or Jewish] citizen," he comes closer than any of his 119 fellow MKs, any one of whose photos would be a more appropriate illustration.

 Letters to the Editor  Time for Russian-speaking Israelis to dump Lieberman 
	Of all the things said about the Avigdor Lieberman's joining the Likud, there has been no mention of the Russian-speaking sector. The lack of media interest in this sector stems from a misinterpretation: The media see the move as a merger of the right-wing parties, whereas in practice Lieberman merely transferred the Russians' "home" from the State of Israel to the Likud party. Political critics viewed the move as exposing the radical nature of the Likud, while left-wingers rushed to urge all the abandoned moderates to find a new political home.
	The Russian-speaking voters saw once again how someone who presumes to be their representative uses them to accumulate personal power and then sells them for a seat with another party. For two elections, Lieberman has been appealing to the Russian population in their language and enticing them to support him. His slogan, which brought him power, is simply, "Da, Lieberman." For years he has been a senior minister and talked to the Russian community using the same determined rhetoric, while in practice, ignoring the issues of concern to them.
	With the support of immigrants from the CIS, Lieberman became foreign minister. Now he has decided "it is much more appropriate to run the country with large parties." In other words, he has had enough of being the representative of a specific group.
	It seems that Lieberman has realized that he now faces a glass ceiling; as the representative of Russians, just like any sectarian representative, there is an upper limit to the number of voters he can attract. The polls also indicated that at most he would maintain his current standing.
	If so, in a smart move for his political survival, Lieberman is dropping the Russian connection at the height of the sector's support for him. After he used that support to gain a comfortable position in the Likud, he expects to hand over the Russians to Benjamin Netanyahu. Like a flock that moves from one shepherd to another.
	Russian speakers should free themselves from Lieberman as their representative. The man who spoke Russian to them, sold them out to Netanyahu behind their backs in order to be able to return to the Likud's embrace.
	The Russian public should change the way it votes and stop searching for a representative, because these always end up exploiting them. Every Russian-speaking person should vote independently, checking which of the parties is closest to representing his positions and which one will place the welfare of the immigrant population as a whole and specifically, of the Russian immigrant population, at the forefront.

 'Superficial' errors in op-ed on Israeli support for apartheid 
	In response to "Errors and omissions excepted," by Gideon Levy, October 29
	In his op-ed piece, Gideon Levy attacks right-wing elements for focusing on superficial errors in his article which, in the Hebrew edition, ran under the headline "Most Israelis support an apartheid regime in Israel." Levy criticizes the focus on a few isolated errors that appeared in the article instead of on the essence and significance of the content of the piece. He claims the right-wing grabbed onto "negligible errors" rather than looking at the broader picture, in order to deflect criticism.
	Indeed, if Levy is aware of this method, why does he offer right-wing elements the same loophole? If, as he writes, the findings should in any case cause a scandal why not get the facts right?
	The same "unfortunate mistakes" are not only professionally damaging, but also provide right-wing supporters with the knife the writer claims they are using to stab the nation in the back.

	***
	The comparison Gideon Levy makes in his article between a survey he reported on and a theoretical survey in France are misguided. The Jews never initiated violent acts against the French; the opposite is true. Israelis' attitude stems from their accumulated knowledge of Arabs, the violence they use, the hatred, the education toward religious wars, the unwillingness to recognize Israel and to compromise. The Arabs are the ones who time after time came out against us with acts of violence and continue to act against us.

 I prayed for the planes to bomb 
	In response to "Maybe Roosevelt couldn't have saved the Jews from the Nazis after all," October 26
	Tom Segev cites historian Prof. Yehuda Bauer as saying that during the Holocaust it was not possible to bomb the concentration camps, among other reasons, because thousands of Jews imprisoned in them would have been hurt. I was "there." After the Nazi conquest, I was imprisoned in the Vilna ghetto for two years and before it was emptied, I fled and fought with the partisans in the forests of Belarus, some 180 kilometers away from Vilna.
	In the fall of 1941, one night Soviet planes passed over the Vilna ghetto heading westward toward eastern Prussia. I prayed, and many others did as I did, that the pilots would bomb the city, knowing that a bomb could fall on the ghetto and injure us. And I still ask: why didn't the allied planes, including those of the Soviet Union, drop fliers in the local language on the occupied territories on which they could have written that the gentile neighbors of the Jews and the various informers would bear responsibility for collaborating with the Nazis and their helpers?
	Given my experiences then, this would have encouraged the Jews and especially those who found shelter with the gentiles, who would later on become Righteous Gentiles. I have yet to receive an answer to this question. Anti-Semitism in America surged during the war; this is a fact. I was "asked to wait" four years to receive permission to immigrate because of the well-known quota. Prof. Bauer says a person can ask why the U.S. did not intervene with the British during the war when two million Indians died of famine. However one injustice does not cancel out another injustice.

 Guilt by association 
	In response to "Apartheid, by any other name," November 11
	Gideon Levy's article is based entirely on the most blatant logical fallacy, "guilt by association."
	It reminds us of that brilliant BBC sitcom "Yes, Prime Minister" in which Sir Humphrey Appleby spoofed this type of illogic by saying "All dogs have four legs. My cat has four legs. Therefore my cat is a dog."
	The arguments quoted by Levy are equally fallacious. For example, his argument is absurd that because the Boers in South Africa and the Zionists in Israel based their right to the respective lands on divine decree, Israel practices apartheid in the West Bank.
	The article's historical statements are as inaccurate as its purported logical arguments. Levy's statement that Israel and the Boers conquered territory (South West Africa ) in violation of international law is untrue. Israel's War of Independence and the Six-Day War were undoubtedly legal defensive wars.
	South Africa did not conquer SWA in 1910. It was a German colony since 1884. During World War I, SWA was taken by South African forces acting on behalf of Britain. After the war it was declared a League of Nations Mandated territory with South Africa responsible for administration.
	The statement "The violence of the African National Congress and the Palestine Liberation Organization, respectively, was reactive" cannot remain unchallenged. The PLO was not reactive. It was founded in 1964 before there was an occupation or settlements to react to. Its declared objective was to destroy Israel within its internationally recognized 1948 borders by armed struggle as the overall strategy, not merely a tactical phase.

 Fact-checking the fact checker 
	In response to "Bennett gets his kingdoms wrong; Maoz his empires, November 12
	Chaim Levinson writes that Habayit Hayehudi Chairman Naftali Bennett was wrong when he said Israel was the only country where "judges appoint judges." But then, as a good journalist, Levinson notes that in Spain, for example, judges are appointed by a committee in which over half are chosen by parliament, thus creating a balanced system. "Only in Israel do judges control appointments to the Supreme Court," Levinson concludes, which seems to prove Bennett correct.

 In praise of architect David Reznick 
	I was shocked and saddened by David Reznick's obituary that appeared on November 6. In a word, he deserved much more praise.
	I met David and Rachel shortly after they left the kibbutz. We became good friends and partners in about 1953. Our first project was to build some 60 houses for the members of the Americans and Canadians Association in Jerusalem. Despite a very low budget, the buildings were very successful except for one thing. We never imagined that one day each family would probably own one car, let alone two. Parking design was not a success.
	David went into partnership with architect Heinz Rau; they built many fine buildings together. David's influence on Israeli architecture over the years has been very strong. Many of the best architects today worked in his office or were students of his. There is no other architect in Israel who designed buildings with terraces as an integral part of Jerusalem's slopes as did David Reznick.
	Two examples are the Mormon Center and the Hyatt Hotel. David was asked to design the Holyland development, and I am sure he would have made a building of the hill and not on the hill. He was asked to stop designing and was paid off, as the gentlemen in charge knew he would never agree to anything that wasn't exactly according to the rules. His integrity was absolute.
	He richly deserved his Israel Prize and much more respect than he was granted in your distinguished newspaper.

<title>Meet the Israelis </title>
<date>Thu Oct 25 03:27:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Nice to make your acquaintance, we're racist and pro-apartheid. The poll whose results were published in Haaretz on Tuesday, conducted by Dialog and commissioned by the Yisraela Goldblum Fund, proved what we always knew, if not so bluntly. It's important to recognize the truth that has been thrown in our faces and those of the world (where the survey is making waves ). But it's even more important to draw the necessary conclusions from it.
	Given the current reality, making peace would be an almost anti-democratic act: Most Israelis don't want it. A just, egalitarian society would also violate the wishes of most Israelis: That, too, is something they don't want. They're satisfied with the racism, comfortable with the occupation, pleased with the apartheid; things are very good for them in this country. That's what they told the pollsters.
	Until a courageous leadership arises here, the kind that appears only rarely in history, and tries to change this nationalist, racist mood, there's no point in hoping for change to come from below. It won't come; indeed, it can't come, because it is contrary to the desires of most Israelis. This fact must be recognized.
	The world must also recognize this. Those who long to reach an agreement and draw up periodic peace plans must finally recognize that Israelis are plainly telling them, "No thanks, we're not interested." The Arab world must similarly recognize that this survey (and others like it ) is Israel's real Bar-Ilan speech.
	It's hard to blame Israelis. Years of brainwashing; the demonization and dehumanization of Arabs in general and Palestinians in particular; coupled with years of vicious terror, have left their scars. What, for heaven's sake, do you want from Israelis, who are exposed daily to the media telling them, for instance, that the recent visit to the Gaza Strip by the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, who came to donate hundreds of millions of dollars to build roads, is "Qatar for terror" (as the lead headline in yesterday's Hebrew edition of Israel Hayom put it )? Why would they want to make peace with those who for decades have been systematically portrayed to them seeking only to annihilate them?
	Why would the average Israeli agree to have an Arab student in his child's class or an Arab family in his apartment building if he has never met an Arab and knows of them only as terrorists, criminals or primitive people - the only images of Arabs to which he has been exposed? Why would he think that discrimination against Arabs by government ministries is a bad thing if the only reality he knows is one where Arabs are sewer workers or street sweepers, and he doesn't know that Arabs are capable of more than that?
	After all, even secular Israelis, who displayed the most tolerant views in the survey, don't actually know who they're talking about. When have they ever met an Arab? When have their children met one? And if they have, what kind of Arab have they met besides the delivery boy from the grocery store, the owner of the neighborhood greengrocer, the car-wash employee, Ahmed the plasterer or scaffolding builder? And that's without even talking about Palestinians: The last time (and also the first ) they met a Palestinian, if ever, was during their army service, through the sight of a rifle, as a suspicious and dangerous object.
	Nevertheless, this brainwashing doesn't absolve Israelis of responsibility. It's true that the education system, and even more so the media, incite and inflame, sow hatred and fear. But they do so to conform to their audience's tastes. It's a depressingly vicious circle, in which it isn't clear which came first.
	After all, if the Israeli media thought their brainwashing was repulsive to its customers they would long since have abandoned it. But it knows its customers' hearts. The political establishment, too, understands the nature of the beast. That's why we are now caught in a mad, dizzying race to the right: Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid is vying with Labor Party leader Shelly Yacimovich over who is more right-wing.
	Thus the situation can't be excused on the grounds of incitement: Israelis are always happy to be incited against the Arab from Baka or the Palestinian from the casbah. Ratings-conscious media and politicians facing primary battles are only hitching a ride on them.
	One-third of Israelis want to deny Arab citizens the right to vote; about half of Israelis favor a policy of "transferring" Arabs out of the country; and a majority says there is apartheid here. We need to finally give up on the hope that things will get better.

<title>Netanyahu's hypocritical sermon </title>
<date>Tue Oct 02 04:40:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	What will future historians say about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech at the United Nations General Assembly last week? Not clear. This is the risk he took on - to turn himself into a laughing stock but to be remembered as part of a tragedy.
	Meanwhile the prime minister has inserted himself into the evangelical tradition of demagogic preachers. After he spoke so dramatically about King David, and about some eternal matters that are understood as facts in church sermons, he pulled out the images of Satan who threatens Paradise. It is doubtful whether anyone else since Bush-Blair coalition has dared to prepare the world for a crusade in so cynical a fashion.
	In his arrogant description of Islam (only the militant Islam, of course) he pointed to its many branches "from the rulers of Iran with their Revolutionary Guards to Al-Qaida terrorists to the radical cells" that lie in wait in all corners of the globe. "But despite their differences," said the rewriter of the "protocols," "they are all rooted in the same bitter soil of intolerance."
	The danger to our existence in our ghetto has become even greater, our national life has become more fragile, and over the course of the speech the Palestinians have gradually become the spearhead of this very Islam. In short, an Israeli leader has again managed to describe his pitiable, nebech country with Popeye-like megalomania.
	And as if this were not a speech to those who boycott Darwin's theories throughout the United States, the history lesson continued: "Some 500 years ago, the printing press helped pry a cloistered Europe out of a dark age. Eventually, ignorance gave way to enlightenment."
	True, this was war propaganda and election propaganda, but it was also shamelessness. The printing press and ignorance did not merely make way for enlightenment, and enlightenment was not merely the technological revolution that we heard about, of course, later in the speech - as befits the leader of a technological power that is preaching morality to the savages.
	But let's set aside these details. Here is the breakdown: The leader of the last colonialist country on earth speaks to the representatives of the nations that have freed themselves of the "Western heritage." Who needed to hear about this? The victims of the English, French, Belgians, Dutch and Italians? Are they the ones who have to hear what was done to them in the name of enlightenment?
	If there is something which is central to the "enlightenment" that Netanyahu represented, it was the possibility of standing in New York and talking rubbish in its name while at home there is an apartheid regime and his army is continuing to trample on the Palestinians' hope for freedom, to knock down doors every night, to send people to jail through a ridiculous military judicial system and with weapons of the 21st century, all controlled by the enlightened heirs of King David.
	A second generation of Palestinians has been born into oppression, poverty and humiliation, and a leader from the margins of the West speaks about the darkness of the Middle Ages and enlightenment? By the way, where are the detention camps of Interior Minister Eli Yishai in this puzzle of progress?
	Israelis go wild over their leaders who can speak English with a good accent. Our country is altogether a strange place that cannot differentiate between good English and intelligence. However an historical difference can be discerned between the speech-makers at the UN over the years. Abba Eban excited the Jews of America. Netanyahu excites the Christians there who are anxiously awaiting the the Battle of Armageddon. In 1843, a century before Hitler brought the "Western heritage" to one of its technological high points, Karl Marx wrote in a letter to his co-editor, Arnold Ruge:
	"It is a truth which, at least, teaches us to recognize the emptiness of our patriotism ... and makes us hide our faces in shame. You look at me with a smile and ask: What is gained by that? No revolution is made out of shame. I reply: Shame is already revolution ... Shame is a kind of anger which is turned inward. ... I admit that in Germany even shame is not yet felt; on the contrary, these miserable people are still patriots. ... A ship full of fools could perhaps be allowed to drift for quite a time at the mercy of the wind, but it would be driven to meet its fate precisely because the fools would not believe this. This fate is the impending revolution."
	Marx, of course, was also mistaken with regard to German patriotism.

<title>Obama is turning his back on Zionism </title>
<date>Mon Apr 09 02:52:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Presidential election season in the United States is obviously an especially good time to enlarge settlements in the West Bank and strike new roots in the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.
	The incumbent president reads a report about the establishment of a new outpost for the evacuees from Migron and stuffs another matzo ball into his mouth. The secretary of state hears that the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Homa is to be expanded and asks the spokesman to send out the usual response - the same one that was used for the Gilo plan and those of Har Shlomo, the Shepherd Hotel in Sheikh Jarrah and Ras al-Amud.
	"And what should I say to the journalist who asked for information about that other issue ... what's it called? Oh yes, the peace process," the spokesman remembers on his way to the door. "He said something to the effect that the Quartet's last deadline for presenting the positions of the sides on borders and security passed last week, and that the Israeli document was reminiscent of a grocery store list rather than positions." The secretary of state sighs: "Tell the nudnik that there's no one to talk to at present, and that you'll get back to him when the Passover holiday is over."
	That's what an American administration does when it wants to do the best for Israel. Really? Does President Barack Obama not know that a two-state solution and expanding the settlements in the heart of the occupied territories are, as they say over there, an oxymoron? Does he not understand that Har Homa's constant encroachment upon Bethlehem and the penetration by right-wing extremists into Sheikh Jarrah are designed to wipe out the last chance for a reasonable arrangement in Jerusalem?
	Does he believe there is a Palestinian leader who is willing to hold negotiations with Israel at a time when Jewish thugs, if they aren't busy chasing Palestinians off their lands, are setting fire to mosques or chopping down olive trees? Is the leader of the free world blind to the fact that when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talks about two states, he is referring to a Palestine without the Jordan Valley, Gush Etzion, Ariel, Ma'aleh Adumim and, of course, without one grain of sand from the eternally holy soil of [the East Jerusalem neighborhood of] Shuafat?
	Obama is not blind, and nor is he deaf or dumb. He is just another politician who has turned his back on the values with which he grew up and the people who believed in him, in order to remain in office.
	In his new book, "The Crisis of Zionism," Prof. Peter Beinart tells the story of the black president who grew up in the heart of the Jewish community and betrayed the heroes of his moral values - Abraham Heschel and Stephen Wise, two liberal Zionist rabbis who dared to condemn the settlement enterprise and were pushed to the sidelines.
	Beinart describes how Obama replaced talented advisers such as Dan Kurtzer and Rob Malley, who did not hide their concern over Israel becoming a binational state or an apartheid regime. The book describes the right-wing path which Jewish "leaders" - who never stood for election in the Jewish community - decided on for the president who won 78 percent of the Jewish vote in the last election.
	If professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt once accused the Jewish lobby of harming American interests, the courageous book by Beinart charges it with undermining Zionist interests. The Zionist liberal from New York relates how self-important activists fought against the freezing of the settlements, and how power-hungry philanthropists enlisted Congressmen against the White House after it dared to criticize Netanyahu.
	Beinart also warns of the accelerated manner in which the young generation of Jewish Americans is distancing itself from Israel as an occupying power - a country whose values are not theirs. To Jews with a true Zionist heart, he proposes boycotting products from the settlements (but to try and buy Israeli products ); to take action against American foundations that fund the settlements; and to replace the phrases "Judea and Samaria" and "West Bank" with "nondemocratic Israel."
	At the beginning of October 1973, Lt. Benjamin Siman-Tov, a young officer in the Intelligence Corps of the Israel Defense Forces' southern command, wrote reports warning that the deployment of the Egyptian forces indicated preparations for a war. Only the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War prevented the officer from being sent to jail for "unseemly conduct under fire." Beinart has dared to wash Israel's dirty laundry in public and to criticize the president who is providing it with the washing powder. Because of this, right-wing activists, who are in effect post-Zionists, have begun burning the Siman-Tov of New York at the stake - the messenger who is warning of the terrible disaster engulfing the promised land.

<title>Palestinian Zionism </title>
<date>Tue Sep 04 01:59:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Representatives of American-Jewish businessman Irving Moskowitz on Monday took over a room in the home of the Hamdallah family in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Ras al-Amud. As in previous cases, the emissaries of Moskowitz, whose foundation raises funds for Jewish housing projects in Arab neighborhoods, enjoy a privilege that East Jerusalem's Palestinians don't have: to get back property that was abandoned during the 1948 War of Independence.
	The 15-square-meter room provides yet another small brick of evidence to boost the theory of irreversibility that is gaining strength in the public discourse. The theory holds that it is no longer possible to seriously discuss dividing the land or evacuating the settlements, since the government's decisions, the political stalemate and the resolve of the settlers have already determined that there will be a one-state, binational solution. Just the nature of that state - whether it will more closely resemble a federation or apartheid - has yet to be determined.
	Anyone who wants to see what irreversibility looks like should head to Jerusalem. The Arab residents of East Jerusalem have long continued to see themselves as part of the Palestinian community of the West Bank, even though they are officially Israeli residents and are entitled to vote in municipal (but not national ) elections. But that appears to be starting to change.
	Take the East Jerusalem Palestinians who aspire to an "Israeli" education. They no longer wish to make do with Palestinian matriculation certificates that keep them out of Israeli jobs, and they don't want to wait in line at a roadblock to attend Palestinian institutes of higher learning. They would prefer to earn an Israeli matriculation certificate and attend the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
	The separation fence, along with the discrimination faced by graduates of Palestinian educational institutions, has pushed these youth westward. This process comes on the heels of additional signs of the "Israelization" of Jerusalem's Palestinian population. There has been a drop in fertility rates among East Jerusalem families and a rise in the participation of women in the work force; Palestinian families have been moving into predominantly Jewish neighborhoods and, no less important, can increasingly be found in parts of West Jerusalem that have long been considered Jewish destinations, like Sacher Park, Malcha Mall and Jaffa Street.
	Surveys also point to an increased Palestinian interest in an Israeli-controlled Jerusalem. To the credit of Mayor Nir Barkat, the surveys also show greater satisfaction with municipal services in East Jerusalem. It seems that even violence and racist attacks like last month's severe beating of an Arab youth and Saturday's stoning of Arab vehicles in the Shuafat neighborhood have not affected the encouraging process of the city's two populations' drawing closer to one another.
	Arab observers offer varying interpretations of these changes. One theory states that Palestinian East Jerusalemites are undergoing a process of Israelization and integration similar to that which the Israeli Arabs underwent after the 1950s. Others see the current behavior as a survival tactic, a result of political apathy on the part of a young generation merely looking for a way to make it under occupation. And there is also talk of the creation of a new kind of Palestinian identity that is distinct from that of Palestinians who live in the West Bank or the Gaza Strip, as well as from that of the Israeli Arabs.
	If the theory of Israelization is correct, the next step for Arabs living in East Jerusalem should be immersion in local politics. So far, they have largely refused to vote in Israeli municipal elections, as a way of making a statement about their distinct identity. Their lack of governmental representation has made it easier for the city, and the country as a whole, to discriminate against them when it comes to apportioning slices of the budget.
	For a number of years now, representatives of Jerusalem's Palestinian population have been saying the time has come to break the taboo on voting. If there is a decision of this kind and it is accepted by the public, it will be a tremendous leap forward in the direction of a binational state.
	A united Palestinian ticket (if there were to be one ) could, based on population data, win between 10 and 13 of the 31 seats on the city council. There are even some pundits who think it is possible, even if unlikely, that as long as the Jewish vote continues to be split along religious lines and the city's Arabs succeed in remaining united enough to field only one ticket, the next mayor of the Israeli capital could be a Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
	In that case, Irving Moskowitz would have gotten what he and his followers have been asking for, even if not quite what they actually had in mind: the united home of the Hamdallah family, a united Jerusalem and a united Land of Israel.

<title>Slow thaw for gays in Arab world </title>
<date>Fri Mar 02 03:19:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Although gay Arabs have been generally supportive of the Arab Spring, the Arab Spring has not been very supportive of gay Arabs. But because the activists among them see themselves as part of a broader struggle, they face the question of how much they should set aside their gay activism while fighting for bigger and more immediate goals.
	This question came up last November when a Facebook group wanted to declare January 1 as Egypt's National Gay Day. A blogger in Cairo called Nilesby wrote: "Is shocking people this way going to support our cause, or harm it? Is the time ever 'right'? ... I do think there are times that are more appropriate than others. There are also ways more appropriate than others. How to measure this 'appropriateness'? I have no idea."
	Another blogger dismissed the argument that the time isn't right, and wrote: "Over and over we have waited, and put the 'greater' cause ahead, only to find ourselves pushed back once things are settled ... We have learned that yes, the time is not right, simply because the time for us to speak out was yesterday .... Our demands are only ours because the 'greater' cause only rarely embraces them ..."
	But, taking a longer view of the prospects for gay rights, I think the Arab Spring is opening up new possibilities. There are basically two strands to achieving LGBT rights (and sexual and gender rights as well ). One is institutional acceptance, which involves changing laws, and the other is social acceptance, which involves changing attitudes. They don't always happen simultaneously.
	What we are seeing with the Arab Spring is the beginning of generalized institutional change, starting with the removal of authoritarian regimes. But that is also being driven by social pressures - frustrations over a lack of personal and political freedom, a lack of economic opportunities, a lack of opportunities for self-fulfillment, and so on. These social pressures began long before the events in Tunisia and they'll continue long after the dictators are gone.
	Looking elsewhere in the world, institutional acceptance of LGBT rights has often been the result of political upheaval. For example, in South Africa when apartheid ended, or in Latin America when the age of the military juntas came to an end.
	I can't visualize anything similar happening with LGBT rights in the Arab countries at present; they are more likely to follow the more gradual route we saw in Britain, among other places.
	What happened in Britain was partly a change in ideas about the function of governments - a realization that policing what consenting adults did in private was not a legitimate concern of the state. This was combined with a recognition that in order for a crime to take place there has to be a victim, and that laws against homosexuality were generally unenforceable.
	On the institutional front, these are the sort of arguments that have some prospect of being accepted in at least some of the Arab countries eventually. In Lebanon, for example, there has been persistent talk of overhauling the penal code to remove those sections that are no longer seen as part of government's legitimate business - including the one that criminalizes "all unnatural intercourse."
	On the social front, I don't see much scope at this stage for a confrontational, in-your-face style of campaigning - mainly because the number of people willing to stick their heads above the parapet is too small.
	In Lebanon, though, the local LGBT organization, called Helem, has been functioning openly for about 10 years now and has played quite a smart game. This has been based on raising the visibility of gay people in a fairly low-key way and presenting them as part of the country's social and political fabric. The first public appearance of a rainbow flag in Lebanon, for example, was during a demonstration in 2003 against the Iraq war.
	The Lebanese activists have also worked hard at cultivating allies among other sections of civil society, constantly making the point that LGBT rights are an integral part of human rights.
	In 2006, when Lebanon was bombed by Israel, Helem's office became the center of a relief operation for people who fled their homes - and this certainly helped to change perceptions of them among the Shia community, and even in Hezbollah.
	When I first started writing about gay issues in the Middle East 10 years ago, it was still very much a taboo subject. I think there is more awareness now, at least among the more progressive elements, that gay Arabs do exist - despite the lack of public role models - and that the challenges posed by sexual nonconformity won't go away.
	These challenges go to the heart of the Arab Spring. They raise questions about the relationship between the state and the individual, and above all about the continuance of patriarchal rule. In a system where masculinity is highly valued and gender roles are rigidly defined, any deviation from the sexual "norms" and expected gender roles is not only subversive, but is regarded as extremely threatening.
	Brian Whitaker is an editor at the Guardian, and author of "Unspeakable Love: Gay and Lesbian Life in the Middle East" (Saqi Books / University of California Press ). This opinion piece is based on a talk he gave last month at a conference on the Arab Spring at SOAS, London.

<title>Supreme Court thrusts Israel down the slope of apartheid </title>
<date>Fri Jan 13 03:38:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
The High Court of Justice's ruling Wednesday on the legality of the Citizenship Law proves the erosion of this institution's role as Israel's guardian of civil rights. Let's look at how the justices voted at the moment of truth on the law, which bans Palestinians from living in Israel with spouses who are Israeli citizens.
In a 2006 ruling, 6 out of 11 justices said the law was unconstitutional, and in the current ruling, 6 out of 11 justices said the law, which was made more strict after the first ruling, was constitutional. That's a disappointing outcome, in part because the first ruling was made not long after the terror attacks of the second intifada, while the current ruling was made during a period of calm, due in part to coordination between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
The title that Justice Asher Grunis gave his opinion - "Human rights are not a prescription for national suicide" - is also disappointing. No one disagrees with this, but Justice Elyakim Rubinstein, who arrived at the same judicial conclusion, recognizes that "a small group - those men and women in Israel's Arab minority who want to marry residents of the region - must pay a heavy price for greater security for all Israelis, including their own."
Justice Grunis apparently would not agree to this wording; as he put it, he's not someone who gives the "constitutional rights that are mentioned in the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty the most expanded and comprehensive interpretation."
Justice Miriam Naor's opinion is disappointing - that the constitutional right to family life means everything, but establishing a family with a foreign spouse in Israel should not receive constitutional protection. It's hard to accept this contradiction, which imposes on other countries a burden that Israel is unwilling to bear and hurts Israeli citizens' right to family life.
The dissenting opinion properly balances the security needs of all citizens and the rights of individuals; the law should be annulled and replaced with security checks of any candidate for residence in Israel when family unification is involved.
The ruling touches on the balance between security needs and individual rights, but the public will understand it as a demographic ruling - one that protects the Jewish majority while harming the rights of Arab citizens. And thus the ruling pushes Israel down the slope of apartheid.

<title>Tel Aviv as a checkpoint</title>
<date>Mon Aug 27 03:16:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	It is only on rare occasions that I agree with an editorial in Haaretz. Especially when the topic is political, and particularly if it deals with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In fact, I think that might never have happened. And for a time, I thought it was impossible.
	And yet, just as we once thought it impossible to run 100 meters in under 10 seconds - until Jim Hines did that very thing - so too did Friday's editorial in Haaretz ("A vision of the End of Days?" ) accomplish the unbelievable.
	Obviously, I do not agree with every word in the editorial. The description of Judea and Samaria as "a giant prison" is completely unfounded and is reminiscent of the kind of propaganda that is cut off from reality. But these are trifles under the circumstances of the matter. Because I identify with both of the central messages of the editorial. In fact, I consider the permission granted to 130,000 Palestinians to visit "little Israel" - to swim in the sea in Tel Aviv and to have picnics on the lawns of the Charles Clore beachfront park - as a most welcome step. I also believe that this should be expanded, and should even become a routine practice - all of this, as Haaretz pointed out, subject to security considerations.
	I also second Haaretz's words of praise regarding the removal of checkpoints and the freedom of movement granted to the Palestinians - with the utmost caution that the war on terror obliges.
	Were Haaretz also to preach, as I do, increased freedom of movement by Jews in Nablus and Hebron and Jericho and all the other parts of the land where they are forbidden to go, then my joy would be complete. Every reasonable person (including Yossi Sarid) already knows there will never be a political border between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, and that there will not be any sovereignty other than Israeli east of the Jordan River. This assumption is reinforced by what I call "the Razi Barkai test." Until a few years ago, the opinionated broadcaster Razi Barkai would declare: "After all, we all know what the solution will eventually be - two states within the 1967 borders, with an exchange of territories." Now, he no longer speaks of this prospect. Even one state - of all its citizens - is impossible.
	For this reason, we have to ensure that the lives of both populations - both the Jews and the Arabs - are as normal as possible under the existing circumstances. The right to live - or, in other words, freedom from terror - is a supreme right. But when it is granted, freedom of movement is one of the basic tenets of human rights. We have to aspire to return to the days when a resident of Kfar Sava could go to a dentist in Qalqilyah, and a resident of Tul Karm could eat at a restaurant in Netanya.
	This process must conclude with the removal of the separation fence, which has wounded the land, defaced it, and caused inconvenience to so many people - Jews as well as Arabs.
	Apart from the security risks - and herein lies the difference between my opinion and that of Haaretz - the obstacle to this welcome process is not "the settlers and other rightists," but, in fact, the residents of Tel Aviv. They won't like it if the Arabs suddenly start to "get in their way."
	Enlightenment is so much more convenient when it is merely theoretical. As someone who grew up in Tel Aviv, I know that my former neighbors would have to exert considerable effort to free themselves of preconceived ideas and also a little racism. I hope they will do so, on behalf of coexistence. From our experience, I can calm them down. We use the same roads every day, buy in the same supermarkets, and this is generally without any problems. People get used to things.
	One of the initiators of the boycott against the cultural center in Ariel, a member of the Cameri Theater, explained her actions by saying her conscience would not allow her to appear in a place reached by "apartheid roads." The truth is that Route 5 and Route 60 lead to Ariel but both are open to all. On the other hand, if a Palestinian wants to see a play at the Cameri Theater, he will be stopped at a roadblock some 30 kilometers before Shaul Hamelech Street. From that point on, and within Tel Aviv, he is not at present allowed. The ball is in your court.

<title>The Amir legacy </title>
<date>Thu Jul 05 01:28:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	The decision to release Yigal Amir from an outrageous 17 years of solitary confinement was courageous and apposite, if several years overdue. It was courageous because it is sure to ignite a firestorm of populist righteous fury. It was apposite because Amir has the same fundamental human rights as any other murderer, and they must be protected. And it was overdue because his solitary confinement was unnecessary and unreasoned from the outset.
	The sole purpose of Amir's harsh conditions of incarceration was to placate public opinion, to satisfy the lust for revenge. But the man who murdered Yitzhak Rabin is not the source of all evil that he is made out to be. Far from it. It is true that all that remains of the Rabin legacy, come what may, is the Amir legacy, but that is not because of Amir himself. Perhaps that's why some Israelis seek to vent their rage against him: They don't like the group portrait they see in the mirror, the product of their own handiwork, and so they put all the blame on Amir. The revenge against Amir is the last relic of the Rabin legacy, and it is the only part that Israelis want to preserve.
	Of course, there is no way of knowing what would have happened had Rabin not been murdered. Only one decisive fact remains: 17 years on, Amir's spirit is much more in evidence than Rabin's, in spite of the innumerable institutions and roads that now bear his name. That is not Amir's fault, it's the fault of all Israelis.
	Israel today should thank Amir for opening the door to everything it wanted to be and to do - for destroying every opportunity for and all belief in peace, for grounding the occupation so firmly that it cannot be reversed, and for creating a racist society and a ruined democracy. Amir only provided the opportunity; the Israelis did the rest, with joy and with dedication.
	This gives the lie to the false, hollow and sanctimonious claims that Amir "murdered the peace" and "killed Israeli democracy." Israeli democracy is much more deeply rent now than it was as a result of Amir's undemocratic assassination. The likelihood of reaching peace, similarly, is much more thoroughly destroyed now than it was by the diabolical wrench that Amir tossed into its gears. Everyone who was shocked by his despicable act is an accomplice, by their actions or their silence, to the passage of racist legislation, to the manhunts on the streets, to the ongoing brutality of the occupation, to the rising violence in society and to the continued building of the settlements.
	It's us, not Amir. Peace has dropped off the agenda entirely, human rights became an obscenity and the yafeh nefesh ("gentle soul" ) a curse. It's us, not Amir. Tens of millions of shekels are spent on alternative housing for settlers who stole land. It's us, not Amir. Kicking a 9-year-old Palestinian boy. It's us, not Amir. A callous apartheid state in the territories. That too is our work, not Amir's.
	But all this is difficult for Israelis to admit, so they seek revenge on Amir, only on Amir, the enemy of the people. In their eyes, the sole and absolute enemy.
	The self-righteous chorus, from the left and the right, is sure to lift up its voice any day now against easing Amir's prison conditions. Many people would even like to see him executed: They are the enemies of democracy, no less than he. They all want only to see Amir's continued mistreatment, to distract us from the real, concrete mistreatment of peace, justice and democracy in Israel, which came after Amir was already locked up in solitary confinement, devoid of all influence.
	Let our camp be pure: See how we punish anyone who dares raise his hand against peace and democracy - decisive proof that we are firmly committed to peace and democracy and it was only the despicable killer who ruined it for us. That is why he must remain in solitary confinement, why he can never go free, in contrast to any other murderer. Because we are fearless warriors against anyone who dares raise his hand against the most just, most peace-loving and most democratic kingdom in the Middle East; in the entire world, actually.

<title>The battle isn't just economic </title>
<date>Wed Aug 08 08:47:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	It was sad to be in the plaza opposite the Tel Aviv Museum of Art last Saturday night. Very sad - but not unexpected. Even at the height of the impressive wave of protests last summer, I wrote in these pages that demonstrations which don't quickly find a political base and a determined leadership are destined to evaporate. The greatest enemy of an informal movement like this one is the passage of time.
	Protests can achieve results only when they present an alternative that poses a genuine threat to the establishment. Ostensibly, there were a few days like that last summer, but they didn't last: The threat was eliminated then and there.
	Today, however, the protest doesn't even constitute a nuisance, because it's become clear that its activists aren't capable of leading a movement. One of the most prominent, by virtue of his position as chairman of the National Student Union, Itzik Shmuli, is developing into a run-of-the-mill politician in search of a path to the Knesset. And the others, who include some true idealists, have fallen victim to both their own naivete and the manipulations of the government.
	But they can also blame themselves, because a war over bread and butter for the middle class is certainly a worthwhile goal, but not for people in their twenties. That could be left to Histadrut chairman Ofer Eini.
	From them, we would have expected a great outcry, both against the oppression built into the very bones of Israel's capitalist system and in favor of an uprising against the formal establishment of an apartheid state, which the justice minister is working on at this very moment on the government's behalf. What should one think of young people who don't utter a peep in the face of the daily oppression in the territories, and also aren't frightened by the erosion of basic democratic values in the Israel Broadcasting Authority and the education system?
	Indeed, anyone who has pretensions to change anything in the Israeli reality is required to deal simultaneously with the fact that its neoliberal economy, by its very nature, rejects the principles of equality and solidarity, and with the apartheid that is rapidly gaining legitimacy among the public. Thus, in order to create a welfare state here in the Western European style, we need a different national leadership. And for that, we need an uncompromising battle to replace Netanyahu's government.
	Nevertheless, Israel's fate won't be determined by the level of value-added tax, or by the Iranian bomb that may or may not ever materialize, but by the future of the territories. On this, there is no room for doubt. Distortions in the tax system can be fixed, and Iran can be neutralized. But what can't be fixed, and is gradually bringing us to the point of no return, is the occupation.
	Yet lo and behold, this existential question has miraculously vanished from the agenda, thanks to a tacit agreement between the right, which controls the government, and the Labor Party. Thus, the danger of the liquidation of the democratic Jewish state has ceased to be a bone of contention.
	This development is without precedent in the history of democratic politics: It's doubtful that there has ever before been a democratic state where an incomparably controversial issue on which its very existence depends has been silenced and buried by agreement between the government and the opposition. There have, however, been countries in which the cowardice of the opposition has exacted an unbearable price.
	The next question, then, is what can be done? The active core of the protest still has an important role to play - not to act on its own, but to serve as a bridge between all the forces of opposition to the leadership, one that will smash the agreement between Likud and Labor. This is the way to a welfare state that aspires to equality and justice for all - for Israelis, Palestinians and work migrants alike. This is also the way to realize a two-state solution that will do justice to both peoples and save Israel from destruction.

<title>The dream has vanished, with the left's help </title>
<date>Fri Oct 26 03:08:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	The cloak that the right wing has donned in anticipation of the upcoming election bears the proud label with the brilliant and innovative "ruling" by Justice Edmond Levy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu without a doubt knows that Levy's learned conclusions will be treated in the rest of the world just like those rulings once handed down by village courts concerning evolution and the origin of man. He is also aware of the fact that if the government formally adopts the practical conclusions that stem from Levy's "ruling," Israel will be perceived as a country struck by fanaticism that deserves condemnation on every possible public stage.
	However, according to the concepts of the right wing, annexation is legitimate not only because it is legal and in accordance with the wish of the creator, but also because it rests on the desire of the people. That is the modern side of nationalist fanaticism that grants ultimate justification to the occupation. On the one hand, in the present Knesset, which represents the sovereignty of the people, there is a clear majority in favor of annexation. On the other hand, the survey published on the front page of Haaretz earlier this week confirms what is already clear from our daily experience - that a majority of Israelis are not deterred by apartheid.
	In the wake of a continuous ideological effort of an entire generation, the right wing has ultimately succeeded in endowing society with its values: If it were to annex the territories, it would not annex the human beings living there. The Arabs would remain with the status of a population that is no longer occupied because the territories - according to what Levy stated - are not occupied territories, and they will merely be the dust of humanity, without identity or rights.
	Levy and those who appointed him have apparently never heard of human rights, because after all these are the rights that people invented and they are universal and applicable to all people in all parts of the world. The only rights the various segments of the right wing have heard of are historical rights that are relative and dependent on time, place and culture. The historic rights of the Jews, who own the Promised Land, erase the Palestinians' right to be masters of their own lives.
	It is reasonable to assume that the upcoming election will give final approval to the will of the Israeli citizen. The Jew - who himself was an oppressed refugee, or whose parents were, an object of hostility, hatred and extermination - has become a tyrant who is permitted to do whatever he wants.
	This has happened because the left wing was not ideologically equipped to withstand the violent demands for sole ownership of the land. In the left, as well, too many people followed in the footsteps of those founding fathers of the Labor movement who shared that concept. Therefore, in all the years that have elapsed since 1967, the right also had sympathetic listeners among those on the left.
	Many of those who noticed the dimensions of the disaster that was taking place kept quiet or were silenced, lest they be branded "enemies of the people." The right wing stuck to its principles and sharpened its positions while the left wing, out of fear of being "cut off from the nation," helped them, the people, to bang their heads against a brick wall. And now, faithful to this path, Labor Party leader Shelly Yacimovich too is snuggling up to Likud and, if the latest reports are correct, she is becoming a collaborator with Likud in all that is connected with the territories.
	As a result of that conduct - which the second government under Yitzhak Rabin interrupted, but only for a short while - the positions of the right have become accepted among wide swaths of the center-left. Today they are considered as being identical to the national interest, or in common parlance, the "state." In this manner, the nationalistic and messianic settlement ideology has spread like an oil spill, until it reached the point that we are currently at: The dream of a liberal and open society has vanished and the rug is fast being pulled from under the feet of sane Zionism.
	The only question now is whether we have already reached the point of no return, or whether there still remains one minute before midnight.

<title>The dwarfs of Oslo</title>
<date>Mon Sep 10 05:03:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	In 1993, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to two African leaders: Nelson Mandela and Frederik Willem de Klerk. The award went to them for bringing to an end the apartheid regime in South Africa by peaceful means. These two leaders were certainly deserving of the prestigious prize. A year later, in 1994, apparently because of the inertia in the committee in charge of the “peace” department, the prize was awarded to three leaders from the Middle East: Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat, on account of the accords between them, named after the Norwegian capital of Oslo.
	The fundamentalist right in Israel has coined the phrase “the criminals of Oslo” and attached that name to the Israeli leaders who supposedly tried to promote an Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Benjamin Netanyahu, the orator, was also there when the campaign of incitement against the “Oslo criminals” was taking place. I was reminded of those “criminals” this week because I happened to have been at the Grand Hotel in the heart of Oslo, and I learned that the Nobel Peace Prize laureates stay there when they come for the award ceremony.
	It is worth recalling that the Oslo Accords that were signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Israeli government were not the result of a true and earnest desire on the part of the leaders for peace. The two leaderships of the two conflicted nations sought, each in its own way, a means of escape from the imbroglio in which they found themselves following several decades of mutual lack of recognition. The Oslo Accords were merely a trick, a deception. The Israeli government was looking for a way to continue the occupation, and thought that calming down the area, which had flared up during the first intifada, would help. The Palestinian leadership was seeking a way to regain legitimacy after the political defeat it suffered when Arafat embraced Iraq’s Saddam Hussein.
	Netanyahu, who took every opportunity to publicly speak out against the “Oslo criminals,” has become prime minister for the second time. As a student of Yitzhak Shamir, Netanyahu continues to earn his living from doing nothing. A short while ago, he even repeated the mantra of his teacher and guru about “the same sea and the same Arabs.” But it turns out the situation is actually the opposite of the one he spoke about: The sea is the same sea, the Israeli government is the same government, and what was then is what is now.
	Nobel laureate Shimon Peres, who was responsible for preparing the ground for the settlements in the 1970s, is now, many years later, continuing to hand out kashrut certificates for all the evils of the Israeli right. From time to time, he serves as the glowing showcase for the Israeli government, with its plethora of members that at no time ever intended to promote any kind of peace process.
	The Oslo saga has not ended. A few years ago, when Barack Obama was elected president of the United States, before he had done anything whatsoever toward the objective of the prize, the members of the committee hastened to grant him the Nobel Peace Prize. Among the reasons cited for the honor was the objective of strengthening the cooperation between the nations. But now, four years later and in retrospect, the prize that was awarded to Obama can also be seen as ridiculous.
	If the committee continues in this fashion, if there are more peace prize laureates of this kind, we shall be lost. Compared with Mandela, the prize winners from the Middle East look like dwarfs. That being the case, the time has come to speak about the real Oslo criminals. These are in fact the members of the selection committee for the prize, who make a mockery of the dream of peace and trample uncaringly on the principles of the prize when they award it to those people that have not done a thing to earn it.

<title>The future looks bleak for Middle East Christians</title>
<date>Thu Mar 22 09:20:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
 	Wearing a frown that creased his unreasonably handsome features, Georg Clooney was handcuffed by police outside the gates of the Sudanese Embassy in Washington, DC last Friday, during a protest against a renewed military offensive by the Khartoum regime in the border areas of newly independent South Sudan. The Hollywood actor was shepherded to a waiting patrol car along with a troupe of civil rights leaders, including several Jewish representatives, who were also detained.
	The spectacle was a timely reminder that the coalition which crystallized around the genocide in Sudan's Darfur region -- in which Jewish communal organizations were heavily involved, together with assorted celebrities and civil rights groups -- has endured. South Sudan is the site of a bloody and seemingly endless conflict that has already claimed upwards of two million lives. The country now faces a new round of murder and mass displacement at the hands of its northern neighbor.
	How should these latest horrors be contextualized? In a recent interview, Clooney discussed his visit to the Nuba Mountains, the inhospitable terrain that lies at the heart of the current conflict. "Religion is not an issue," he said, when asked about the causes of the war. "In the camps you will find Christians and Muslims hiding together. It is ethnic in nature."
	Given the increasingly sharp debate about Islam here in America, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the liberal Clooney is keen to avoid talk of a religious war. Nonetheless, the Islamist character of the regime in Khartoum can hardly be deemed incidental to the conflict.
	In common with other Arab countries, Arab chauvinism in Sudan is combined with a domineering, supremacist version of Islam. The religious aspect was dramatically underlined at the beginning of March, when Sudan announced that it had stripped around 700,000 of its citizens of their nationality, the vast majority Christian. They have just over two weeks from today to leave Sudan. Those who depart for the south will walk straight into an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe. Those who remain in the north face the prospect of imprisonment or forced deportation.
	To this depressing tale of ethno-religious cleansing, we can add the problem of slavery. The government of South Sudan says that there are 30,000 slaves being held in the north, the clear majority of whom, again, are Christians. As far as the north is concerned, there is no slavery in Sudan, a line about as credible as the Tehran regime's insistence that there are no homosexuals in Iran.
	Instances of Christian persecution can be found in nearly every Muslim country. The death sentence imposed on Youcef Nadarkhani, an Iranian pastor who committed the mortal sin of converting to Christianity from Islam, has highlighted the tenuous situation faced by Iranian adherents of the faith. In Nigeria, Christian churches are bombed with mounting frequency by the Islamist terrorists of Boko Haram, whose name translates as "western education is a sin." In Egypt, the Coptic minority faces violence and discrimination that will likely get worse, given the strong showing by the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafist parties in the recent elections. In Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia - you name it - reports of Christians being falsely charged with blasphemy or apostasy, along with gruesome tales of beheadings and beatings, are multiplying by the day.
	Though not every Christian community in the Middle East lives with the scale of terror currently spreading through Sudan, it is legitimate to ask whether Sudan provides a terrifying glimpse of the future for Christians in the wider region. In that sense, it's worth paying to heed to the statement delivered on March 12 by Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, who declared that it is "necessary to destroy all the churches of the region."
	In the event that their churches are destroyed, the Christians who worship in them will surely follow. It must also be acknowledged that Christians are repressed both by the allies of the west, like Saudi Arabia, and by its adversaries, like Iran and Sudan.
	Jews and Christians in America already have an encouraging record of joint campaigning, especially when it comes to Israel advocacy. Both communities now have a duty to raise the banner of Christian persecution, an issue with similar mobilizing potential to the campaign against apartheid in South Africa, or freedom for Soviet Jews. They need to do so with urgency and clarity. We may not have reached a final, genocidal phase yet, but we are headed in that direction.

<title>The people demand some blood </title>
<date>Mon Mar 12 04:50:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Whoever decided to kill the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees didn't do so to prevent a terror attack. The attack was foiled, thanks to the targeted killing, because the army lies only during its internal power struggles; and when its comes to anything related to war, it returns to the motherly embrace of public opinion: Its intentions are pure. That's its job during war, which only it can declare - and in wartime, after all, we fall in love with the army and with ourselves.
	But the excuse of the terror attack is another indication that there is no opposition - neither at home and nor to the west. There is no one from whom we should hide the fact that every "targeted killing" brings rockets, and only thereafter comes "wiping out terrorism." The thuggish stance of the army in relation to the rules of the game - we assassinate, you launch rockets, and we bomb and kill - is Israeli logic: We're allowed to because we're strong. There's no need for a moral masquerade.
	This was the escalation dynamic that was covered up during the second intifada with the help of every media outlet, without exception. Then, after every targeted killing, we were flooded with huge pictures of the target, and "suddenly," at Google speed, we were introduced to all kinds of enemies who only the Shin Bet security service had known about just the day before - from Hussein Abayat, the first assassination target in Bethlehem, through the elimination of Raad Carmi in Tul Karm, whose killing so inflamed Palestinian passions that they responded with a wild massacre at the Park Hotel, until the recapture of the West Bank in Operation Defensive Shield.
	This - the elimination of terror, and the elimination of Palestinian independence en route - was the initiative of the General Staff. The escalation enabled the destruction of all the political structures in the territories (since of course they were always surrounded by paramilitary organizations ), until we achieved the ultimate: Gaza in the hands of they with whom we cannot conduct negotiations, and the West Bank in the hands of they with whom we don't have to conduct negotiations. The occupation assures its own eternal existence.
	This hooligan-like logic turns into part of a totally uninhibited language. We are allowed to assassinate, but you aren't allowed to respond: For the little, if any, of our blood spilled, you will pay with many liters of blood. This is a colonial logic, in which the West has permission to do what it pleases, while the natives do not. This, incidentally, is the logic in the campaign against Iran: You don't have permission to acquire nuclear facilities, only we do.
	With regard to the Palestinians, the issue also touches on our behavior and the fact that we are an impoverished society. "You can starve, while we battle for our standard of living. We are a democracy for the Jews. You aren't really human beings."
	Why then are we surprised that the leader of "The People Demand Social Justice," Daphni Leef, is flying to England to deny that Israel is an apartheid state? Why are we surprised that the mayors of our southern cities are demanding more blood instead of social justice? Soon the policeman in the F-16 will be declared the big winner. The palace will burn some more hut-dwellers.
	It's clear why Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a by-product of the colonization - and not its cause - and the result of logic that goes, "We're allowed, because we are who we are, and you are forbidden because you're inferior." Who can demand social justice from such logic?
	The bombing of the Gaza Strip in response to the Grads and mortars that came in response to the assassination is an episode with many Palestinian funerals and the addictive feeling of subservience. But whoever decided on the assassination knew he was cancelling the south's topping off a long Purim. Those in the south had apparently celebrated enough. What exactly they would go through after the assassination didn't really interest anyone.
	This "I don't care what happens to them" attitude doesn't stop at the Green Line nor at the Mizrahi Jews' enclaves in the south. This is the kind of firmness that will be needed to bomb Iran. It's called rulers' apathy, or a society that has no opposition.

<title>The real radical left </title>
<date>Thu Apr 05 03:15:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Even a dead body can sometimes twitch reflexively. Here we go again: The settlers have occupied another building. Their lawyer isn't ashamed to boast about the deceptive way the property was acquired. The ministers make their pilgrimages. The defense minister pulls a surprise eviction. The right is furious, the remnants of the left utter praise, and even Europe and America seem satisfied - look, another settler real estate grab has been thwarted.
	If it hadn't involved the private property of an unfortunate Palestinian family it would have been one more laughable farce. If we weren't talking about a hopeless rearguard battle there would be a reason for outrage.
	But there's no point in outrage now. Migron, Hebron, whatever - the war is over. The victor was declared long ago, the vanquished was defeated long ago, notwithstanding yesterday's evacuation in Hebron. All that's left is the reflexive twitching of the corpse: the targeted removal - a drop in the bucket - and a last gasp from the moribund left.
	The part of Hebron under Israeli control, H2 under the 1997 Hebron Protocol, has for years been a ghost town, with hundreds of abandoned apartments and dozens of shuttered stores; a mute testament to the purest and most undeniable form of apartheid. But the "protest" continues: Another house on the wild prairie was saved.
	But we could have given the settlers that house; it wouldn't have changed anything. Let them have Migron, that won't make or break anything either. Even the 50 homes in Beit El's Ulpana neighborhood won't change the bigger picture. The occupation is more entrenched than ever, its end more remote than ever, and the settlers have won in a stinging knockout.
	It's time to raise the white flag, to admit publicly that the two-state solution has been foiled. There's no point in celebrating yesterday's evacuation of Hamachpela House, because there are thousands of other buildings just like it. It doesn't even pay to fight for the rule of law; if the state has the audacity to try to circumvent a ruling of the High Court of Justice, as it tried to with Migron, even that looks like a lost cause.
	If the apartheid neighborhood in Hebron could not stir Israelis from their moral fog - and any decent person who visits there is shocked to the depths of their being - and if life goes on undisturbed, with no moral questions, even as this horror occurs in our own backyard, then what difference does another stolen house make? Let it go, let other houses go; the chance for a solution is long past.
	Even the twitching of the dead are moving. The determination of organizations such as B'Tselem, Breaking the Silence and Gush Shalom not to surrender should evoke admiration here and abroad. But it's hard to revel in them when they are fighting a final battle.
	Hamachpela House was evacuated. But like its predecessor in Hebron - known variously as "Peace House," "The Brown House or "Beit Hameriva" ("The House of Contention" ), which has stood empty for more than three years, and hundreds of abandoned homes whose sole occupants are the ghosts of justice and of Israeli democracy - its owners will presumably never be able to return to live there.
	The battle for Hebron has been decided. All that remains is to ask what will replace the solution that was put to death. There will not be two states. Even a child knows the alternative: one state. There is no third option. Israel's most radical left won. For years it said one state, even as we played with ourselves at two states. Now everyone says two states, in unison, only because they know that train has left the station, and the great train robbery was pulled off.
	From now we need only take care with our definitions: The extreme left is whoever endeavors toward a single state - the plundering settlers, the establishment that embraces them and the majority of Israelis, who do not lift a finger to stop them.
	The Palestinians, as everyone knows by now, aren't going anywhere. There is even a handful of settlers that has begun talking about giving them citizenship. If this, too, is not a ruse, then this little group is openly reconciling with the great victory of Israel's most extreme left.
	The struggle? From now on it must focus on human rights. Yes, equal rights for everyone who lives in Greater Israel, just as you wanted.

<title>The rifle blow to the head that reminded Israelis of the West Bank</title>
<date>Fri Apr 20 01:54:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	The truly interesting aspect of the story in which a senior IDF officer brutally smashed his rifle into the face of a pro-Palestinian demonstrator is the extraordinary buzz it has caused in Israel. This has been a classic case of the exception proving the rule. It is difficult to remember the last time a story from the occupation grabbed the headlines so dramatically and remained there so many days.
	The doubters now clucking their tongues are correct: The scandal is being treated as a housekeeping matter. Attention is focused tediously on the image of the Israel Defense Forces and on one specific event that was photographed by chance, instead of focusing on the bigger picture.
	Yet there is also a welcome aspect to all this fuss over the brutal attack. With one blow, Lt. Col. Shalom Eisner drove a hole into the wall.
	When the separation fence was built, it was depicted as a physical barrier that would prevent terrorists from entering areas within the Green Line. It was described as a vital security necessity. Civilian life in Israel had become impossible as terrorists blew themselves up in population centers.
	But hidden from the eye at the time of the fence's construction was the tremendous negative effect it would have on Israeli consciousness. Since then it has become clear that the separation wall also makes it possible to be blind, to repress awareness and become indifferent.
	It is very good that Israeli citizens have stopped dying in terrorist attacks because of the wall. It is very bad that the wall also makes it possible to ignore reality over there on the dark side.
	In the judgment of history, when the total price is calculated, it is not clear in which direction the balance will tilt. For most Israelis, the great strategic question has turned into an empty debate, exhausting and almost academic. The issue no longer lies "five minutes from Kfar Sava" but light years from it.
	The urgent affairs of the day require slogans. There is the "occupation" and the "territories" and "Palestinians" and "settlers" and "left-wing activists" and all of these exist under the blessed jurisdiction of the IDF, far from our eyes and hearts. The Israeli mainstream is cut off from the occupation and loves it. Only in the Israel pacified by the separation fence is it possible to imagine that the head of the Labor Party, a declared candidate for the prime ministership, refuses religiously to utter a word about the country's political future.
	It is only in that walled-off Israel that idealistic social activists like Daphni Leef and Stav Shaffir, as good as their intentions may have been, can get hundreds of thousands to march in the streets demanding social justice and changes in priorities without even hinting at the occupation and its moral, economic and diplomatic costs.
	The wall blinds the Israelis and sometimes even stupefies them. Time and again they boast of being the chosen ones of "the only democracy in the Middle East" without understanding that this claim, too, has been blocked by the separation barrier.
	There is no democracy east of the wall. There is the rule of a military occupier, an apartheid-like mechanism of discrimination, and more than two million Palestinians who are denied basic civil rights. The damage caused by the wall is enormous. It was meant to serve as the basis for Israel's permanent eastern border, but because of it, Israelis are no longer in a hurry to draw permanent borders and to return to the family of nations. The diplomatic talks this week between representatives of the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority amounted to an exchange of letters.
	At the time of the wall's construction, the slogan of its supporters was, "They over there, we over here, and peace upon Israel." Thanks to the wall, the people of Israel can forget about the unnecessary peace. It is only on rare occasions that some officer like Eisner bursts forth and with one blow reminds us that under all this contentment lurks a deep despair.

<title>The storm over Bamba and apathy concerning Gaza</title>
<date>Thu Mar 15 04:47:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	For four consecutive days and nights, millions of citizens of this country once again lived under conditions of fear and terror. The innovation was that, this time, no one tried to whitewash things. The mass terror was to be expected and it stemmed directly from an Israeli act of violence. Nevertheless, no one thought of expressing opposition. Better not to even ask whether indeed a terror attack had been foiled; whether the secretary general of the Popular Resistance Committees was one of those rare people in human history for whom there is no replacement; or whether indeed his assassination was beneficial or legal.
	The assassination and the revenge were seen here as a divine edict, as a force majeure, as a storm in the southern skies - a quick strike that would blow away with the wind. The south was scared, the north turned a blind eye, and all together were amazed at the way Iron Dome successfully intercepted the missiles. And at times like these, there is no opposition in Israel.
 What are your thoughts on this issue? Follow Haaretz.com on Facebook and share your views.
	Not just at times like these. It is possible to imagine a situation in which Israel would have continued with another ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. And would anyone have raised his voice against that? Of course not. Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee's chairman Shaul Mofaz would be in favor of course, and so apparently would opposition leader Tzipi Livni (whose voice was once again not heard this week ); Labor Party leader Shelly Yachimovich is busy to the hilt with the tycoons; Knesset hopeful Yair Lapid would have made do with another ideological "okay, bye!"; the summer protest movement leader Daphni Leef is traveling across the seas to explain that Israel is not an apartheid nation; on the Facebook page of Meretz leader Zahava Gal-On there is no mention of what happened in the south; and the Arab members of the Knesset are isolated as usual from the public discourse.
	And as if that was not enough - it seems to everyone that this is a normal situation. That's how things are and there is nothing we can do about it. A difficult reality in the south following an act of choice by Israel and no one even considers asking questions, casting doubts, offering alternatives. Hamas held its fire? Rubbish. It announced it had renounced violence? Nonsense. Once again Egypt turned out to be the only party that could bring back quiet despite its Muslim Brothers? So what? Speak with Hamas? What, have we lost our minds? Only a stand-up artist in the south raised that brilliant idea on television: To continue with assassinations in Gaza "until the inventory is completed." That's an idea and that's an idea. Laughter. An Israeli democracy that lacks an opposition, free of any alternative ideas for government - a global innovation.
	But just a minute, there are storms here nevertheless. For two days a storm has been raging here over [the children's snack] Bamba, a storm which was almost wilder than the storm in the south. Had it not been for the summer social protest, the baby icon of the Bamba snack would have turned into the official mascot of Israel's Olympic team. Only decent public intervention prevented the disgrace.
	The Internet was flooded with reactions, the minister of sports and culture threatened to intervene, the chairman of the Knesset's Education Committee called for an emergency meeting, columnists joined in the struggle, and the cute little Bamba baby will not march at the London Olympics. Psychosis and neurosis. Two days of newspaper headlines. All of a sudden, everyone is interested in sports and concerned about the moral standards of the Olympic team, and they have reservations about using a commercial symbol. Suddenly there is a protest, there is an opposition and there is a popular uprising. Even if this protest is justified in principle and there really is no place for commercial sponsorship of a national mascot, what about the proportions? Where is the proportionality? This exaggeration was intended for one purpose only - to cover the shame of apathy and to give ourselves the superficial appearance of involvement.
	That is the other side of the apolitical nature of the summer protest movement - the connection between a vacuous patriot and a hollow protester. Because that's how things are in an involved democracy, that's how things are when there is an alert civil society - you keep things clean and throw the Bamba in the garbage bin. However on the other side of the colorful bag of snacks lurks a destructive apathy.
	All the futile storms of the past months - Bamba, Big Brother, Pesek-Zman, Hatikva, and even the scandal of cancelling free train rides for soldiers for three consecutive hours per week - cannot hide the disgrace: In the land of Bamba, in Bamba Land, people come to life only the marginal and the meaningless. Let it be known: there is a direct link between the storm over Bamba and the apathy concerning Gaza. Both are driven by blind and cheap patriotism. And which mascot will march in our name at the Olympic stadium in London? That affects us much more deeply than what is done in our name in Gaza.

<title>U.S. elections: Palestine can't wait</title>
<date>Mon Nov 05 14:01:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Palestine has not been part of any major discussion during the presidential election debates. That is surprising and dismaying, given the United States' role as a crucial player in the region and its unconditional financial and political support of Israel. Yet, the candidates appear to have actively avoided the issue.
	This tactic has also been adopted by Israeli politicians. Though they remain the leaders of a state that actively practices and encourages the colonial domination of another nation, Israeli politicians, from different parts of the political map, have decided to focus their attention mainly on issues such as domestic social policy and the encouragement of a new war in this region. Almost nothing has been said about the millions of people living under full Israeli control and the impossibility of peace while the occupation persists.
	However, ignoring this vital issue does not mean that Palestine and its sacred right to freedom can be bypassed. In fact, the common future of Israelis and Palestinians, as well as the rest of the region, depends on achieving peace and security for both Palestine and Israel. This is not a task that should be marginalized.
	This harmful state of denial comes at a time when the possibility of realizing the two-state solution is rapidly diminishing due to Israel’s policies of colonization. Such policies have been denounced by Israel’s long-standing allies, such as Germany and France. But it seems these calls for peace have been muffled by election campaigning in Washington.
	Successive American administrations have affirmed that the two-state solution based on the 1967 border is an American interest in the region. President Obama has also repeatedly stated his commitment to this issue. But in Israel, the current Prime Minister has unfortunately ensured that American efforts to resume meaningful negotiations between Israel and Palestine have failed, by taking actions on the ground, namely the unprecedented acceleration of Israel’s illegal settlement enterprise, that negate the spirit and purpose of those negotiations. The recently published Levy Report presents another clear example of this government's systematic efforts to derail all international efforts, as Israel threatens to effectively turn the occupation into full-fledged annexation.
	But as Israeli actions are fading out the prospects of peace, the geopolitical map of the region is also changing rapidly, opening horizons of freedom and activism that were previously blocked. The Arab Spring has set a new context for the Middle East.
	All world leaders who supported the Arab Spring, including the newly-elected American president, will have to explain to the Arab street why their support for freedom stops at Palestine's doorstep. Serious effort will be needed to explain why  the world continues to insist on trying, again, formulas that have failed time again, including the demand for resumption of negotiations without any guarantees or clear terms of reference while guaranteeing Israel immunity from any accountability for ignoring previous agreements and its internationally recognized obligations.
	We realize that the ties between Washington and Tel Aviv are solid. But it's important to remember that a friend has a responsibility to provide honest and even sobering advice to a friend who is committing a grave mistake. Entrenching the occupation and denying the Palestinian people their inalienable national rights to freedom and independence will not bring peace to Israel. On the contrary, it will guarantee perpetual conflict. 
	The next American president might very well be the last president of the “two-state solution” era. That is an historic responsibility whose far-reaching consequences cannot be understated.
	In this context, the new American administration will have an opportunity to have, as one of its first actions, a real and effective push for peace by supporting Palestine's diplomatic initiative to achieve enhanced status at the United Nations, advance our national rights and save the two-state solution. This step will enhance the political process and bolster the chances of initiating a credible and effective political effort that would conclude with the realization of the two-state solution.
	We have chosen negotiations as a means to reaching peace. Our commitment to this path is firm. Our political initiative at the United Nations is a sincere effort for the sake of peace that should enjoy the active support of all those brave enough to be true peace partners in Israel as well as Israel's friends who are committed to seeing it enjoy a future of peace.
	Efforts to prevent the Palestinian people from exercising its inalienable and sovereign right to self-determination are contradictory to stated American positions regarding the struggle for freedom and democracy embodied by the Arab Spring. Undermining the mechanisms of the international system and obstructing the will of the majority of the international community is not only counterproductive but also undemocratic. This does not help Israel, as it only strengthens those within Israel who support an apartheid regime and the systematic denial of the rights of the Palestinian people.
	Palestine is looking forward to working with the next American administration to achieve peace through freedom and justice, and in so doing, securing a future of democracy, security and prosperity for the whole region. That is why it is vitally important for the U.S. to have the political will to show that Palestine is not an exception to the international rule and that it also deserves to exercise its internationally-recognized inalienable rights. Let us work together towards this noble goal, because ignoring it will only drag the entire region further away from the peace we seek. 
	After almost a century of denied national rights and five decades of oppression, it is time for Palestine to enjoy the blanket international support it deserves for justice long overdue.

<title>Water torture </title>
<date>Sun Jul 08 01:22:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Avi is an inspection coordinator for the "Civil Administration" - the occupation regime, to speak without euphemisms. Presumably Avi likes his job. Maybe he's even proud of it.
	He doesn't bother mentioning his last name in the forms he signs. Why should he? His ornate "Avi" signature is sufficient to carry out his diktats. And Avi's are among the most brutal and inhumane diktats ever to be imposed in these parts.
	Avi confiscates water containers that serve hundreds of Palestinian and Bedouin families living in the Jordan Valley.
	The containers are these people's only water source. In recent weeks, Avi has confiscated about a dozen containers, leaving dozens of families with children in the horrific Jordan Valley heat, to go thirsty.
	The forms he takes pains to complete, in spiffy style, say: "There is reason to suspect they used the above merchandise for carrying out an offense." Avi's bosses claim the "offense" is stealing water from a pipe. This is why the containers are seized - with no inquiry, no trial. Welcome to the land of lawlessness and evil. Welcome to the land of apartheid. Israel does not permit thousands of these wretched people to hook up to the water pipes. This water is for Jews only. Even the greatest Israeli propagandists could not deny the nationalist, diabolical separation taking place here.
	The axis of evil is located about an hour's drive from your home. But emotionally distant and far from the heart, it inspires no "social protest." And on the scale of Israeli evil, it is one of the worst. Backed with forms and bureaucracy, applied by ostensibly nonviolent inspectors, it involves not a drop of blood, yet leaves no drop of water either.
	The Civil Administration is supposed to take care of the people's needs. But it does not stop at the most despicable measure - depriving people and livestock of water in the scathing summer heat - to implement Israel's strategic goal: to drive them from their lands and purge the valley of its non-Jewish residents.
	The stealing of water, whether it did or didn't take place, is of course only the excuse. Even if there was such a thing - what choice do these people have? The authorities won't allow them to connect to the water pipe running through their fields; pipes whose water is flowing to saturate the settlers' green vineyards and fields.
	Last week I saw the people whose water container Avi had confiscated, leaving them thirsty. Newborn babies, a handicapped little girl, a small boy post-surgery, women and old folks, and, of course, the sheep - the only source of income here. Denizens with no water - in Israel, not in Africa. Water for one nation only - in Israel, not in South Africa.
	But this is not the only watershed. A few days ago, the Israel Defense Forces decided to hold training exercises in the area. What did it do? Evicted the residents from their homes for 24 hours. Not all of them - only the Palestinians and Bedouin. It occurred to nobody to evict the residents of Maskiot, Beka'ot or Ro'i. The authorities don't call that apartheid, either.
	Where did the IDF evict them to? Wherever the wind carries them. Thus some 400 people were forced to leave their huts and tents and spend a day and a night on the arid soil by the roadside, exposed to the elements.
	Amjad Zahawa, a 2-day-old infant, passed his third day under the hot sun, with no shelter over his head. Greetings, Amjad; welcome to the reality of your life.
	Avi, as we have already mentioned, loves his work and is proud of it. Dozens of others like him are also doing this contemptible work. But they are not the only ones at fault. Behind them stand millions of Israelis who are entirely untouched by all this. They blithely drive through the valley roads, paying no heed to the endless embankment alongside the road, imprisoning the residents and blocking their access to the road.
	There is an iron gate every now and then. The soldiers, representatives of the merciful occupier, show up every few days to open the gate for a moment. Sometimes they forget, sometimes they are late. Sometimes they lose the key, but what does it matter?
	The occupation is enlightened, Israel is right, the IDF is the most moral army, and apartheid is merely an invention of Israel's haters. Go to the Jordan Valley and see for yourselves.

<title>World nations should issue a travel warning to Israel</title>
<date>Wed Apr 18 02:56:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	The skilled attack by Lt. Col. Shalom Eisner on a blond Danish peace activist in a kaffiyeh was spectacular. The senior officer's two agitated arms grasped the M-16 rifle as if it was an indivisible part of his body, and with an instinctive movement that might be expected from someone whose life was being threatened, landed it in the face of the person who dared to look him in the eye.
	What luck that the belligerent Viking toppled over, thereby signaling his defeat. A recognized sign in the jungle. The frightened officer let him be. What a shame! Had he continued his assault, this could have been an excellent kill scene for a new series in National Geographic. Perhaps under the title "Annihilation."
	On the face of it, this is a political story in which a group of pro-Palestinian peace activists tries to convince an occupying power to behave in decent fashion toward those occupied. But there is nothing political here. When a country behaves as if it is a nature preserve where the species living in it feel they are in danger of extinction, it is a simple anthropological story.
	Anyone who wants to visit a gorilla preserve in Uganda, for example, knows what the restrictions are. The visitor must provide a certificate showing that he is not sick, and curious tourists are permitted only to visit in small groups and must leave the preserve in less than 24 hours. Tourists who go to the nature preserves in Tanzania know that it is forbidden to leave their vehicles, to throw food in the direction of the animals or get close to them. Anyone who kills a white polar bear in the snow fields will be brought to trial. There are clear, internationally recognized rules that define which species are threatened and how to preserve them.
	Israel is a dangerous preserve and responsible nations should have issued a travel warning for this country long ago, or at least published a detailed guide of what is permitted or forbidden to do here. Which words or sentences induce a warning growl. A kind of dictionary for tourists in which terms such as "fly-in," "flotilla," "Palestinian state," "illegal outposts," "apartheid," "racism," "High Court of Justice," and of course, "occupation" will be underlined in bold red.
	The guidebook would explain what is likely to cause Israel to bite and which sites the tourist is advised to avoid; where it is permitted for males and females to stay together and where mixed groups may attract stone-throwing; what response a red kaffiyeh around the neck is likely to evince; and what dangers someone wearing red, black and green clothes could face.
	This is not an extraordinary recommendation. Someone who wants to visit Somalia, Afghanistan, Algeria, Chechnya or Sudan, or merely to go on a safari, knows what he has to wear and what he cannot say.
	A threatened preserve like Israel is not meant for everyone at all times. When it was still a small country defined by a Green Line, it invited the whole world to come and visit. But when it grew fat and expanded its living space, it became more threatened and more frightened, and it has designated in lists drawn up in advance who is forbidden to enter its territory. The lists include not only wanted men who plan to carry out terror attacks, but also activists in human rights organizations, at least one German author and politicians who are not prepared to sing in the choir. The lists also include recommendations about who should not waste their money on airplane tickets - for example, a tourist whose name implies Arab or Muslim origin. It is possible that soon, new and much shorter lists will be issued bearing the names only of those who are permitted to visit the preserve.
	This is how Israel is turning itself into an enclave of nationalist fundamentalism in which the covenant between its citizens (the Jewish ones, of course ) is not based on equality or shared values but on the ceaseless marking of its borders with the outside world. This is an enclave which does not feed on a sense of victimization - though that is certainly a national value - but rather on a threat, the impact of which is understood only by denizens of the enclave.
	Therefore it is not the one who threatens but rather the one who doubts the existence of the threat who is the real danger. It is not the Palestinians who threaten to establish a state but rather the people who think a Palestinian state is not a threat who violate the borders of the enclave.
	This is the kind of person who poses the existential danger so he is the one who gets whacked in the face, no matter if he is a Danish or Israeli citizen.

<title>Israeli moderates, resist</title>
<date>Mon Jul 01 06:46:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
We continue to debate the travels of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, the necessity of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel, the deterioration of the middle class, the character of Iran’s new president. Those are all important issues, some of them even existential. But we don’t notice that while we preoccupy ourselves with the problems of the present, right-wing groups in the Knesset are trying to change the parameters of the equation whereby Israel is a Jewish and a democratic state. Once-ubiquitous expressions used to describe Israel, such as “a Jewish state” or “a state with a Zionist orientation,” are undergoing a tremendous metamorphosis, and we turn a blind eye and think it only a semantic change which may not even be possible to implement.
The State of Israel was established as a refuge for the Jewish people, to give it the right to self-determination that had been denied to it. But the public agreement was for a state that represents a moderate, tolerant and determined Judaism. Groups on the right and among the settlers tend to characterize Israel as a state that represents the essence of their Judaism, in which only lip service is paid to democracy. Already in the previous Knesset, legislators proposed ultranationalist laws but were blocked by then-Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor and company.
Make no mistake: There is a group in the Knesset that seeks to change the formula of Israel’s being a Jewish and a democratic state. But MKs with identical goals do not join forces without a determined leader. MK Yariv Levin ‏(Likud-Yisrael Beiteinu‏) was not anointed by his party colleagues, MKs Zeev Elkin and Danny Danon, but he is the real leader of the unrestrained approach, filled with hatred for the legal system.
The prime minister stands at the sidelines, as a neutral observer. He does not offer the nation a vision and a path, but he avoids confrontation with the out-of-control unbridled MKs. Some call this fate, since after all some elements of the nation do not rule out apartheid as a system. They are prevented from saying this outright only out of concern that it could cause harm to the state. But these are not majority opinions. Large sections of the public prefer Benjamin Netanyahu over other possible heads of government, but would prefer that government itself to be more moderate. The fact that Netanyahu is the lesser of the evils indicates the direction in which the pendulum is now swinging.
But Netanyahu’s election was not an automatic vote of public confidence in Danon and in another party colleague, MK Moshe Feiglin. The settlers, the religious Zionist camp and their supporters are the minority. There is no majority for their views, nor for the pseudo-liberal disguise donned by Economy Minister Naftali Bennett of Habayit Hayehudi in the election. The opposing camp is split mainly over socioeconomic issues, but the electorate behind all of the more moderate parties wholeheartedly objects to the interpretation of Judaism and democracy offered by Levin and by MK Ayelet Shaked ‏(Habayit Hayehudi‏).
Before the next election we should consider a broad coalition of political forces from all the center and left parties, of people like Meridor and company and leaders of public opinion from the economic, media, military and academic spheres. The creation of an alternative requires great finesse, and there are many seemingly impassable obstacles to be overcome. This can happen if more important individuals and groups within society come to realize that this is a battle for the soul and the future direction of Israel.

Admit it: Egypt has us stumped
It would be helpful if we could all admit to honest ambivalences about Egypt. On one side is the “new beginning,” renewing the 2011 youthful revolution and human rights cause. Notably most women have been in the anti-Morsi crowds; almost everyone visible for the Brotherhood appear to be men. And Morsi as an Islamist was possibly trying to theocratize rather than democratize Egypt.
Rarely noted is the unacceptability of Islamists describing democracy as a concession and compromise rather than one of their core beliefs. This violates the UN Charter, UN Declaration of Human Rights, and every modern political value.Also, before Islamism, the other major ideologies that failed to incorporate democracy as core beliefs were Communism, Fascism, Nazism, KKK-like Southern Jim Crow segregation and South African Apartheid. Another is Kahanism. So while we must be concerned about how the change will affect Islamists ‏(everywhere‏), we must also be concerned that this very concern is itself, by default, a kind of submission to extremist blackmail.
On the other side are worries about the arguable basic unfairness of the revocation of a free election − that while Morsi was possibly trying to theocratize Egypt or make Brotherhood rule permanent, this was never unequivocally clear enough to overturn a free election, and moreover he had done nothing evil or criminal; about the practical effect everywhere on Islamist acceptance of democracy − even if worrying about this is, again, a form of submission to extremist blackmail; about further violence and polarization; and about the fate of democracy in the Islamic world.
If only, even at the cost of personal discomfort, we could live with ambiguity, and admit to uncertainty.

From ‘the Zionist dream’ to the oligarchs
In response to “Russia’s blue-and-white oligarchs” ‏(Asher Schechter, July 5‏).
Oligarchy − government by a small group of people. That’s in the dictionary. When I read this article, I was not only repelled but distressed; could these guys eventually “govern” us?
I was a fighter in the U.K. for the freedom of Jews in the former U.S.S.R. from 1968-78. I continued my activities in Israel until the first group of refuseniks came out in 1987. Consequently I feel a sense of pride that I have contributed to this significant aliyah, notwithstanding that its full effect has yet to be felt.
Since we have a high-profile group of our own “oligarchs” encouraged by our government, its time to seriously think about where they and the wannabees are aiming to take us. After all, money is power.
I wonder what Herzl, Jabotinsky, Ben-Gurion and Eshkol, not to mention the other Zionist, pioneering leaders who were here when I first arrived in Israel in 1949, would think about it all.
Can anyone remember what “the Zionist dream” was?

<title>EU guidelines: a point of no return</title>
<date>Thu Jul 18 17:17:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The panicky voices in Jerusalem are no negligible thing. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Economy Minister Naftali Bennett understand that something important has happened in Europe. The barrier has been breached. The first sanctions have been imposed, so now it's only a matter of time until more serious and painful sanctions hit. Have we mentioned South Africa?
For decades the Europeans only talked and threatened. For decades they were led astray by our right-wing governments that promised negotiations and a construction freeze in the settlements. This time the Europeans got tired and took action; they're stopping funding, grants and awards to any Israeli entity linked to the settlements.
That's why people on the right are so angry. That's why they're so upset. They understand that the troubles will begin in our pockets. They understand that when the public feels the sanctions in the form of lower salaries, rising prices and increasing unemployment, it will realize that it's impossible to fool all the world all the time.
It was amusing to hear the reactions of peace advocates Netanyahu, Lieberman and Bennett. Netanyahu hastened to say that the Europeans' step "undermines efforts to renew the diplomatic process." After all, he's a famous peace advocate whose whole objective is to sign an agreement with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. That's why he ran in the election last January. And now those anti-Semitic Europeans are sabotaging his efforts.
No less amusing was Lieberman's reaction: "This is a final blow to the chances of renewing the peace process." He's also a famous peace advocate and an indefatigable opponent of land confiscation and illegal construction in the territories. Actually, he's an expert at making any possibility of compromise impossible.
Bennett, too, has a sense of humor. He went on the air and bemoaned the "economic terror attack" that has "destroyed any possibility of negotiations." But he immediately added that we don't have to be upset by the sanctions because "trade with the world is only increasing because the world needs the Jewish mind." How much arrogance and chutzpah do you need to believe that only we have the brains and the goyim can't exist without us?
Bennett has lost himself in an imaginary world in which China, the United States and Europe are dependent on us, rather than the other way around. It's a world in which we sell fighter planes to the United States and rescue it from sanctions at the United Nations.
In this miraculous world, our situation is constantly improving. Bennett has not heard, for example, about the decision (since rejected) by European banks to ban loans to Israeli companies that operate in the territories. That was considered as part of an ethics review, a process that has become a norm at European companies.
Bennett hasn't heard about the consumer unions that boycott Israeli products because of the occupation. They demonstrated outside supermarkets until several retailers in Europe and the United States stopped carrying Israeli products.
Nor is Bennett aware of large European trade unions that advise their members not to buy Israeli products. And he hasn't heard about trade unions at European ports that refuse to unload cargo from ships that fly the blue and white. Nobody told him about European companies that shun Israeli companies due to the "Israel risk" – code for the occupation and its consequences. These groups are aware that Israel is dependent on exports, and they mention the boycott that brought down the apartheid regime in South Africa.
In 2009 the Norwegian government announced that it was excluding Elbit Systems from its pension fund, citing the company's part in building the separation fence. The fund also announced that it was dropping real estate developer Africa Israel, citing construction in the occupied territories.
This is the first breach in the barrier. Later the sanctions and boycotts will intensify until they hit us all hard in our pockets. Even Bennett will understand that.

<title>Scrap the so-called Jewish state law</title>
<date>Tue Oct 22 03:32:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The only way Israel can exist as a democratic Jewish state is by being a democratic state whose citizens have equal rights, but where the majority of its population is Jewish.
Ensuring such a majority is not self-evident, but in view of the current Jewish majority of four-fifths, it is possible - provided that Israel sees this as the fundamental issue, rather than annexing territories with hundreds of thousands of Palestinian residents - as it has done in Jerusalem.
Maintaining the majority in a democracy cannot be done by means of discriminatory legislation. The Law of Return, although intended for Jews, does not discriminate among the state's citizens. It is intended for those who are not citizens.
However, the amendment to the Citizenship Law - which prevents Israelis from forming a family in Israel with Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza - is discriminatory. This is because it is only Arab Israelis who are expected to ask to form such a family. The state did not dare say the reason for such a law is the need to ensure a Jewish majority, for fear it would be disqualified by the Supreme Court. Instead, the state argued that the reason for the law was security, which the High Court of Justice accepted by a majority vote.
Prof. Ruth Gavison refused to take part in this pretense. She justified the law, citing the need to ensure a Jewish majority, even at the expense of infringing on democracy and equal rights. Prof. Gavison has now been asked by Justice Minister Tzipi Livni to draft a proposal for a constitutional arrangement dealing with the character of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state (the so-called "Basic Law: Jewish nation state") that the coalition government partners agreed to enact, and that should combine and balance these two values of Jewish and democratic.
The first proposal for such Basic Law, sponsored in the previous Knesset by MK Avi Dichter (Kadima), showed such legislation was not possible without infringing on the equality before the law. So does the current proposal, sponsored by MK Yariv Levin (Likud-Yisrael Beiteinu) and MK Ayelet Shaked (Habayit Hayehudi).
But this is the law's intention: to subject the state's democratic values to its being "Jewish". The legislators are conspiring against the Arab minority, a fifth of the state's population, but not only against it. The pressure for this legislation must be seen as preparation for a much larger Palestinian population in Israel, after it annexes the West Bank territories. This is what the proposers want.
There is no need for a new Jewish nation state law that compromises equality and leads Israel towards apartheid. The right direction for Israel to take is clear, and the prime minister understands it. Israel must set borders within which it has a Jewish majority and move to integrate its Arab citizens. The idea of a Jewish state law, in any possible version, works in the opposite direction and must be scrapped.

<title>The price of deception and apartheid</title>
<date>Wed Nov 27 06:09:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
Despite the compromise that Justice Minister Tzipi Livni reached on Tuesday with the European Union’s foreign minister, Catherine Ashton, over the Horizon 2020 scientific cooperation agreement, Israel is now beginning to pay the price of its deeds in the occupied territories.
Four years after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech at Bar-Ilan University, in which he recognized the principle of two states but nevertheless refused to stop construction in the settlements - following the government’s extremist statements and decisions to build thousands of housing units in the settlements; and following Israel’s ongoing harassment of Palestinian residents of the territories - the international community is beginning to take practical measures against Israel’s tactics of deception and the apartheid it practices toward the Palestinians.
In July, the European Commission published new guidelines that forbid European Union agencies and foundations to give grants or loans to Israeli bodies connected in any way to activity in the territories. These guidelines complicated the finalization of the Horizon 2020 agreement, as the European Union rejected most of Israel’s compromise proposals. This scientific cooperation agreement is expected to bring hundreds of millions of euros to Israeli research institutes and high-tech companies, so, had Israel not signed it, the result would have been a loss of NIS 2.5 billion for the research and development community.
In light of this expected loss, Livni conducted marathon negotiations with Ashton by telephone on Tuesday. The compromise that they reached deals mainly with how the money expected to flow from the European Union will be “fenced off” to ensure it doesn’t reach the settlements in any way. Though any Israeli entity that operates within the Green Line will be able to submit a request for European funding, it will need to develop a mechanism to ensure that any money it receives from the European Union is invested only in activities conducted inside the Green Line.
Despite the retreat from its initial refusal to compromise, the European Union is making an important contribution to Israel’s future by its determined stance against transferring money to the settlements. The settlement enterprise has turned Israel into an immoral state whose policies are unacceptable to the world of which it seeks to be part. It’s regrettable that the government hasn’t understood this on its own, but the international community must make this clear to it.
What the European Union, and essentially the entire world, is seeking is crystal clear: the reinstatement of the Green Line as the line that divides Israel from the occupied territories. Anything else will impose heavy economic, diplomatic and scientific costs.

<title>Netanyahu's symbolic absence</title>
<date>Wed Dec 11 04:10:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to start curtailing his exorbitant expenditures, which are publicized from time to time and generally spark public outrage. But it’s too bad that the very first cut he opted to make resulted in Nelson Mandela’s funeral – an event that drew most of the world’s leaders, from presidents of the United States and European countries to leaders of controversial states like Iran – taking place without the participation of a senior Israeli representative.
Given the generous budget for travel and other expenditures that has characterized all of Netanyahu’s terms as prime minister (just last year, for instance, he insisted on flying in a specially-chartered plane to the funeral of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher), and given that Mandela’s doctrine and legacy (in contrast to those of Thatcher) are evidently not the pillar of fire that guides Netanyahu, it’s not unreasonable to suspect that the spending issue provided Netanyahu with a pretext to escape a vexing event he didn’t want to participate in.
Mandela, in both life and death, symbolized the idea of equality among all human beings and opposition to the apartheid regime, which subjected people to different laws based on race or ethnicity. Israel under Netanyahu’s leadership, in which segregation, racist legislation and discrimination on the basis of nationality are flourishing virtually undisturbed, cannot say it respects Mandela’s heritage, nor can it join the family of nations whose flagship values are the striving for civil equality and the fight against racism.
Mandela spoke out in the past in favor of the Palestinian struggle – something that earned him no points with Netanyahu, who sees the Palestinians as demonic enemies with whom there is no possibility of dialogue. It’s also possible to infer that the core of Mandela’s struggle – the war on racism against blacks – doesn’t burn in the Israeli prime minister’s bones, since just this week Netanyahu and his coalition partners were busy passing the so-called Infiltration Law, which allows people to be jailed for up to a year without trial, and is aimed primarily at African migrants.
The absence of Israel’s senior leadership from Mandela’s funeral is no accident, and it can be seen as a symbol of Israel’s increasing diplomatic isolation. Israel is gradually being evicted from the international community because of its insistence on continuing the occupation and even reinforcing it via more and more settlements, while turning its back on diplomatic processes and initiatives. This situation, whose implications first began making themselves felt in the negotiations over the Horizon 2020 scientific cooperation agreement, endangers Israel no less, and perhaps even more, than the plethora of regional threats that worry Netanyahu, and about which he is constantly warning.

<title>Lapid, for Israel's sake, break with Bennett</title>
<date>Thu Dec 12 06:02:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
The alliance between the “brothers” Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid, which was forged in order to form a coalition, has helped Bennett and his Habayit Hayehudi party portray themselves to the Israeli public as a young, innovative, liberal alternative. But after less than a year in the government, cracks have formed in this alliance, and they recently widened to the point of an open break. Habayit Hayehudi’s true face is gradually being revealed: It’s not a party of “high-tech” or “new politics,” but a nationalist, conservative religious movement that stands for apartheid, discrimination, occupation and preserving the religious-civic status quo, which makes life difficult for most Israelis.
This alliance has made some of Lapid’s voters feel cheated, since they see that their votes have ultimately strengthened the rule of extremist settlers in the form of MKs Uri Ariel and Orit Strock. Now that Habayit Hayehudi has blocked all the bills Yesh Atid proposed to sever the connection between the Jewish religion and civic life – tax credits for gay parents, preventing discrimination against homosexuals on issues such as obtaining mortgages, and a reform of Israel’s divorce laws – it seems the time has come to put an end to this alliance.
Yesh Atid’s parliamentary activism on issues of separating religion from state reflects Lapid’s belated realization that his voters didn’t elect him to protect the settlements of Beit El, Elkana and Givat Assaf, but to protect their own right to live in a democratic state governed by liberal rather than religious law. Bennett, the economy minister, talks a lot about innovation and progress, on the basis of his experience as a high-tech entrepreneur. But by turning its back on every initiative and reform related to core Israeli concerns in the diplomatic and civic arenas, his party has exemplified the exact opposite.
The Israeli public – including those Israelis who don’t hate religion but rather integrate religious customs into their lives – is ripe for civic reforms that would sever the connection between religion and state, which no government has ever dared try to unravel. It is even demanding such reforms.
Lapid must continue the trend of distancing himself from Bennett that he has begun, and advance the civic reforms necessary to bring Israel into line with the world’s liberal democracies, in which personal matters such as the choice of a partner, and the method of marriage, divorce and burial are left up to the individual’s choice. He must break with Bennett.

<title>Time to ask South Africa for forgiveness</title>
<date>Sun Dec 15 01:07:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
DURBAN - At the time I didn’t know anything; it didn’t interest me and I didn’t want to know. Some of Israel’s most senior journalists had traveled to South Africa as guests of the apartheid government, which wined and dined them, to which they responded in kind, with complimentary stories; to this day, most of them don’t see anything wrong with that. At the time I was jealous that I hadn’t been invited; I was a good Tel Avivian who, like the overwhelming majority of Israelis, didn’t see anything wrong with apartheid or with the relations my country had with South Africa.
The apartheid prime minister and some members of his cabinet came to the Israel of Yitzhak Rabin (and Shimon Peres), the one they remember so fondly now – another chapter of the “Rabin Legacy” – and they were granted a reception here that they would not have received in any other country; Israel Aircraft Industries made some huge deals with South Africa that “saved” the company, as Aluf Benn recently revealed here, as did other Israeli weapons manufacturers. Foreign reports have revealed nuclear cooperation, with the defense minister at the time, Ariel Sharon, quoted as saying that Israel had to supply more weapons to its fellow “leper” state, in order to “stop communism,” which certainly sounds possible.
In Europe, hundreds of thousands of young people had taken to the streets in protest against apartheid and to call for the release of Nelson Mandela, while here there was shameful silence and embarrassing weapons deals.
Some radical left-wing organizations tried to protest, and their protests were greeted with the standard delegitimization. My colleague at Army Radio, Yoav Karni, tried to raise a storm, and was considered a troublemaker. Yossi Beilin then tried to take action as director-general of the Foreign Ministry, and he was also considered a troublemaker, someone who understood nothing about “interests” and “security,” until he succeeded in making some, albeit small, change in policy.
For several years, Israel was the most loyal ally of that South Africa, the only democracy that did not join the sanctions regime until it was forced to do so under American pressure, and it’s doubtful whether it really observed the sanctions (one must consider what Israel would say today about a country that didn’t join the sanctions against Iran). Even the support that the white regime had given to Nazi Germany didn’t deter Israel. Weapons, weapons, you shall sell.
And we – all Israelis, except for a few select individuals, were silent. We supported and were even proud of our despicable ally. When talking about brainwashing and the terrible blindness in Israeli society, we need to remember this, too. When we speak about Mandela, we must not forget this. We were practically the only country that traded and supported and trained and sold and bought and built and conducted experiments with it – overtly and covertly, a friend of the department, the department of evil. We were members of the same cohort -- lo and behold, the apartheid regime and Israel were established in the same year – and Israel found itself a host of justifications as part of the fellowship of justifications. It upheld a covenant of two representatives of enlightened minorities standing in the breach against dark and wild majorities, both justifying their actions with religious and messianic arguments. The biblical Amnon and Tamar, Israel and South Africa.
We have to remember this now, but it’s not enough. I’m writing these lines from the Eastern Cape of South Africa, en route to Qunu, to cover Mandela’s interment there today. Neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor President Shimon Peres will be at the ceremony. What else is there to say about someone who saw attending British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s funeral as more important than attending Mandela’s, and about Peres, who, of all the trips he’s taken, was unable to make this one.
But there is something much more important than participating in ceremonies that Israel should have done long ago. Israel should have begged Mandela’s forgiveness in his lifetime, and must apologize to South Africa at any time. It’s not too late. Mandela forgave Israel, but Israel must not forgive itself. Now, as the world bows its head in such an impressive manner before Mandela’s achievements, the prime minister must apologize for the shameful collaboration, for the arms deals, and for the indifference and moral obtuseness. Sometimes a country may also ask forgiveness, and in this case, it’s even required.

<title>Emergency order forever </title>
<date>Thu Apr 25 02:53:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
You have to be a former Shin Bet head to say Israel is putting its future at risk by not making a real effort to integrate its Arab citizens, nor advancing their status and solidarity with the state.
When a current Shin Bet chief is asked for his opinion, the easy default option is to say that permitting Israeli Arabs to raise a family with a spouse from the West Bank or Gaza Strip potentially poses a high risk to the country's security and its people's safety.
Thus, with the backing of the Shin Bet's opinion, the Knesset extended on Tuesday the emergency order denying residency in Israel to male spouses under 35 and female spouses under 25 who hail from the West Bank, Gaza or enemy states. In other words, the ban applies to Arabs from outside Israel in their marriageable prime. The emergency order from 2003 has now entered its 11th year.
On the face of it, the order also applies to Jews who want to raise a family with Palestinians from the West Bank or Gaza. But there are hardly any such cases. In contrast, the natural reserve of partners for Israeli Arabs is among their people in the West Bank and Gaza. Hence, the order clearly infringes on Israeli Arabs' right to set up a family with their chosen partner and live in Israel.
Preventing a citizen from living in his country with his or her chosen spouse is a severe infringement of a basic civil right, whose protection is one of the reasons for maintaining a democracy. An order directed exclusively against the Arabs strengthens the argument that Israel is a discriminatory apartheid state.
The Shin Bet's job is to enable Israelis to live in safety in an environment ensuring their civil rights. The way to achieve this cannot be through sweeping discrimination against Palestinian citizens. Rather, it should be achieved by vetting each candidate for family unification individually, as the security service knows how to do.
The Shin Bet gave the cabinet an opinion that appeased the politicians, whose motives are demographic, and harmed Israel's security by entrenching the inequality between Jews and Arabs.
Labor MKs who supported the emergency order - Omer Bar-Lev, Hilik Bar, Moshe Mizrahi, Erel Margalit, Miki Rosenthal, Nachman Shai and Itzik Shmuli - continue the disgraceful tradition of supporting nationalist, discriminatory laws. Such support liquidated the Kadima Party. Such votes will not lead Labor to power, except perhaps as a spear-carrier.

 Sharing the burden: no mere slogan

	With all the talk in the news and all the speculation surrounding coalition talks, I’d like to add my take on the slogan “Sharing the burden.” I think every citizen of this country is entitled to privileges, but these privileges come with obligations. We should all make a contribution to the state, to our welfare and to upholding democratic institutions.
                
	With all due respect to the religious parties, they are not democratic and do not contribute to safeguarding or advancing our very precious democracy. On the contrary; they are mainly led by rabbis who have held sway over our lives via the Interior, Health, Housing and the Religious Affairs Ministries, not to mention the Chief Rabbinate. These parties are takers, not givers, and we have encouraged them to take by cultivating a growing population of “entitled ones.”
                
	“Sharing the burden” includes several aspects that are cardinal to our democratic life here, the least important of which is army service. First and foremost is education: we need a uniform education system for all. Currently, we have secular, religious Zionist, schools for Haredi boys, schools for Haredi girls and education for the Arab population − five separate systems for fewer than 8 million citizens.
                
	After our boys and girls complete their army service and go on to university or college, they have huge tuition costs; many work and study at the same time. Religious boys go to yeshivas or kollels; not only are they paid for by the state, but these “students” are paid to study! With education comes joining the work force, paying taxes and reaping the benefits of working. At the moment, some religious citizens work, but many more don’t, or do “gray” work and avoid paying taxes.
                
	Then there is the issue of civil service. There is no shortage of places for Israelis, including the religious and Arab sectors, to contribute − for the country and for their communities. After these requirements have been filled, then we can look to army service and examining how enlisting Haredi youth will change the fabric of the military.
                
	Yes, it’s time to “share the burden,” but we must examine exactly how this is to be accomplished − and the sooner the better.

 Children of Abraham

	In response to “As Lincoln abolished slavery, Israel must abolish occupation” ‏(Bradley Burston, February 26‏)
                
	Bradley Burston says that “as Lincoln abolished slavery, Israel must abolish the occupation.” These evils, which are otherwise so different, are similar in that they have needed to be literally, and not just figuratively, abolished.
                
	But Burston’s metaphoric analogies to Lincoln’s issue are also striking − the Palestinians’ lack of rights, dispossession, that they are beaten, shot and jailed, sometimes it seems almost at will − and that their families are split by artificial boundaries, and with ancient Biblical justifications.
                
	Lincoln famously said, in 1858, “A house divided against itself cannot stand” and “cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free.”
                
	Israel is such a house − Israel proper and the occupied territories; free and occupied; pro-freedom and pro-occupation. But Israel will be one house, either based on its 1967 borders or as an annexationist “Greater Israel.”
                
	Lincoln spoke against Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas, who advocated “popular sovereignty,” where each new state’s free population could vote to be a slave or a free state.
                
	Israel is a democracy in Israel proper and when decisions refer to it; but not when it decides in favor of occupation. Palestinian freedom is inalienable and not decidable. When others decide, we have Senator Stephen Douglas’s sovereignty proposal all over again. In the occupied territories itself, Israel is no more ‏(or less‏) democratic than the slave South, apartheid South Africa or the segregationist South.
                
	Lincoln opposed the Dred Scott decision ‏(1857‏) of his Supreme Court, according to which blacks had no constitutional protections or citizenship, which also recalls the Plessy v. Ferguson decision ‏(1896‏) for “separate but equal” segregation.
                
	These legalistic rationalizations of oppression − also like the Levy Report − would be denounced by Hebrew prophets like Amos and Micah, by America’s founders fighting Britain’s “legal” Empire, and by Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, David Ben-Gurion and also Ariel Sharon.
                
	As Burston says, Israel must abolish its own expansionist and oppressive decrees to act in the spirit of the Hebrew prophets of righteousness and of the biblical Abraham’s most renowned namesake, Abraham Lincoln.

What about the views of the non-Orthodox?
In response to “Every Holocaust Remembrance Day, a secular jihad” ‏(Opinion, Mordechai Brener, April 15‏).
On April 15 you published a diatribe by Mordechai Brener. I say diatribe because it was neither an opinion nor a discussion. It was an attack on any Jew who does not share his view of life. If Israel is a democracy, as it is supposed to be, what about the views of others living here, who are not Orthodox? Many of us citizens hold other views of Judaism and by most accounts, polls and statistics, the Orthodox are a minority. I was taught the definition of a democracy was a place where the majority rules and minority rights are respected.
Brener talks about people wearing immodest dress in Mea She’arim and Bnei Brak. But who defines what constitutes modest dress? Does “immodest dress” give someone permission to spit on, insult or physically assault women, or even children, who do not meet his standard?
I think we, the people he is attacking, are more than tolerant in allowing this small minority to deny us access to transportation, restaurants, stores and entertainment. Why not trust the rest of us to do what we believe honors our dead and the things that are important to us − and that we learn through education, not coercion?
Brener talks about “desecrating the Sabbath” with disdain and contempt. Several years ago, my son was a member of the Jerusalem police. One night, he and his partner were sent to a religious section of the city because of a fire reported in a residential building. He and his partner arrived before fire trucks or other police units. They were ordered not to enter the building or make rescue attempts. Still, they felt it was their duty to enter the building and warn the inhabitants about the fire. They pounded on doors and pulled people out. When they emerged from the building, they were greeted not by cheers from tenants of nearby buildings, but by a barrage of bottles, garbage and cries from the rooftops that they had “desecrated the Sabbath.”
On returning to their station, they were officially reprimanded for disobeying orders, but were comforted by the thought of children, dirty from the smoke, but alive and well. And this is desecration?

Awe at the ingathering of long-exiled exiles
In response to “Home, but not free” ‏(Opinion, Alon Idan, April 15‏).
As one who stood alone in silence gazing out my window the other night as Israel ground to a halt for a moment’s reflection, I feel compelled to respond to Alon Idan’s scathing opinion piece “Home, but not free,” and his 1984-ish comment that people who do so, do so out of fear.
My reaction to his views was intensified by the fact that moments before reading his piece, I had parted from an older friend, a widow who does what she can to commemorate these holidays − out of awe, not fear. Born in Nazi Germany and raised in a large Scandinavian country, she migrated with her family to South Africa during apartheid. The Scandinavian country had denied her citizenship, and South Africa always remained for her an alien place. “I never felt at home anywhere but here,” she told me.
Unlike your unnamed citizens standing alone in their dwellings, she was not filled with fear of the state, but awe, appreciation and love. I suggest that others who did so were not unlike her. It’s not a knee-jerk reaction, a “religious signifier,” but a deeply felt connection.
Interestingly enough, these holidays fall on the third week after Passover, closely allied with the attribute of tiferet, compassion − one which seems to be sorely lacking in Idan’s rather robotic critique.
Perhaps you, Mr. Idan, are younger than the state, born here of parents who are also younger than the state? It’s not fear of the state, but love and awe at the ingathering of our long-exiled exiles that underline these collective moments of silence and reflection. Perhaps if Idan could find a place of greater compassion within himself, he could more easily comprehend the other’s love for the Land of Israel.

<title>New routes to racism</title>
<date>Tue Mar 05 04:20:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
	At the beginning of the week, separate bus lines were launched for Palestinians in the territories who travel into Israel. The Transportation Ministry claims the lines are meant to ease travel conditions for the Palestinians, but they’re actually another manifestation of a regime based on discrimination and segregation.
	Although by law a Palestinian with a permit to enter Israel cannot be prevented from traveling on regular buses, the police is preparing to enforce the separation. Consequently, a Palestinian who reaches a checkpoint on a regular Israeli bus will be asked to get off and wait for the special bus.
	Palestinians traveling from Tel Aviv to Samaria were apparently already being taken off buses last Thursday. According to witnesses, an entire busload of people were ordered off a bus near the Shaar Shomron interchange, and their identity cards were checked. All of the passengers turned out to be Palestinians, and they were ordered to leave the terminal and walk to the Azoun-Othma checkpoint, 2.5 kilometers away. According to the police, they were merely implementing Transportation Ministry instructions.
	Around four years ago the High Court of Justice disallowed the ban on Palestinians traveling on Route 443, arguing that the military occupier cannot build roads in an occupied area that do not serve the local population. Then Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch, however, got upset by the comparison the petitioners had made between separate roads and the apartheid regime in South Africa. But the decision to separate Palestinians and Jews on the buses is another component of an apartheid approach, and demonstrates that those petitioners’ arguments were not unfounded.
	It’s clear that the bus segregation is part of a more principled separation between the populations that is expressed in almost every area: In the allocation of areas for residential construction, in the different legal systems, in the unequitable distribution of resources and in discriminatory travel regulations.
	Occupied territory is meant to be managed by the occupying state as a temporary trust for the benefit of the local population. There are clear rules aimed at preventing the evolution of a colonial or apartheid regime. The way the State of Israel is managing the territories is a far cry from the way occupied lands are meant to be managed.
	Rather than express “concern” for the Palestinians by excluding them from Jewish bus lines, it would behoove the prime minister to immediately put a stop to this racist segregation.

<title>Weaken the right </title>
<date>Fri Jan 18 03:45:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
	Benjamin Netanyahu's outgoing government caused serious damage to Israel over its four-year term. Its foreign policy focused on expanding the settlements, avoiding negotiations with the Palestinians and reviving the idea of annexing the occupied territories. The result was intense international isolation, a rift in the relationship with the United States and a terrifying vision of Israel's future. Its domestic policies were characterized by pure nationalism, harassment of the Arab minority, politicization and militarism in the education system, and bringing initiatives to destroy the Supreme Court and weaken the free press.
	Isolationism, nationalism and threats to democracy and civil rights are the banners of the right-wing parties, which are running in the elections with their most radical lists of candidates ever. The Likud has united with Avigdor Lieberman and thrown out such liberals from its ranks as Dan Meridor and Benny Begin to make room for Moshe Feiglin. Naftali Bennett was chosen to head Habayit Hayehudi, which preached the annexation of Area C in the West Bank and cleansing the media of left-wing journalists.
	The dangerous direction in which the right has turned requires all supporters of democracy and openness to the world to go to the polls and vote for parties that will stand in opposition to Netanyahu and his "natural partners." The choice is not simple. The camp that opposes the right has failed to join ranks and pick a candidate for prime minister. Among center and left-wing voters there are voices of despair saying "there is no one to vote for," but they must not be heeded. There is no more important commandment than to vote on election day in 2013.
	Meretz has presented the most suitable platform, with uncompromising support for ending the occupation, dividing the Land of Israel into two nations, separating religion from state and strengthening civil rights, including those of the Arab minority. Moreover, Meretz will not join a Netanyahu government, and the polls forecast the party doubling its strength. The Labor Party has strengthened in the polls and has a refreshing list of candidates, but Shelly Yacimovich's leadership does not present an alternative to the Likud. Her evasion of issues and support of the settlers, Haredim and the wasteful defense budget is worrisome. Her test will be in keeping her promise not to join a right-wing government.
	Those who don't want to vote for opposition parties can choose between Tzipi Livni's Hatnuah, Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid and Kadima, headed by Shaul Mofaz, in the hope they will join with Netanyahu and moderate the influence of the extreme right and Haredim. Out of all of them, Livni has stood out in her exhortations for an agreement with the Palestinians and rebuilding the relationship with the United States. Israeli democracy will be better off if Arab voters vote in high numbers and strengthen Hadash, Balad and the United Arab List-Ta'al against right-wing persecution. As opposed to the two "sectoral" Arab parties, Hadash is also competing with Meretz for left-wing Jewish voters. Its platform is much more radical, but its importance is in strengthening the struggle of Jews and Arabs for common goals.
	The undecided voter has quite a lot of alternatives, but the principle that must guide his or her vote is clear: Weakening the right-wing parties and the Haredim in order to halt Israel's slide into political isolation, fascism and apartheid.

<title>Kerry told the simple truth</title>
<date>Thu Apr 10 01:28:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
One can only regret the American administration’s attempts, coated with praise for Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s government, to clarify and modify Secretary of State John Kerry’s statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday.
Describing the events leading to the collapse of the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, Kerry said Israel had not released prisoners as it had pledged to do as part of the agreement to resume the talks, and had then approved tenders for constructing 700 new settlement units in East Jerusalem (which followed other huge tenders for accelerated construction in the settlements).
Kerry refuted the spin issued by Netanyahu’s office — that the talks broke down because Mahmoud Abbas had signed applications to join Palestine to 15 UN treaties. Kerry said this move, which he described as “not helpful,” came in response to the Israeli violations of the agreement, not as an intention to sabotage the talks. So Kerry was right to blame Israel with blowing up the talks.
His words hewed to the simple truth. Throughout the negotiations, Prime Minister Netanyahu has been busy spreading fog around his intentions and inventing spin tactics aimed at avoiding any significant decision. Housing Minister Uri Ariel and Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon have done everything they could to sabotage the talks. Finance Minister Yair Lapid made do with lip service to the peace process, while Justice Minister Tzipi Livni served as a fig leaf trying to cover Israel’s insincerity.
So instead of automatically blaming the Palestinians for the negotiations’ failure, they should ask themselves what their own part was in the foot-dragging and obstructionism in the talks, and how they helped create he pretense that Israel and the Palestinians are two state entities with equal military and economic status.
The Israeli public deserves a government that is candid with it and admits clearly that it has no desire for a peace agreement, and that its main motivation is to continue developing the West Bank settlements. In other words, it wants to continue the occupation and separate the Palestinians from their lands.
Once the government admits that, Israelis will be able to choose which kind of state they want to live in and which vision of a state they want to vote for – that of a democratic state that respects the rule of law and human rights and sees international relations as a vital asset, or of a messianic, separatist state with features of an apartheid regime, in which a privileged Jewish population rules over millions of Palestinians.
These are Israel’s options. Any other portrayal of them is a false one.

<title>Apartheid in planning rights</title>
<date>Mon Apr 28 03:05:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The High Court of Justice is scheduled to hold a hearing Monday on the issue of planning rights in Area C of the West Bank, which is under full Israeli control and constitutes 60 percent of the territory. The petition, filed in 2011 by, among others, the village of Dirat-Rafa’aya in the southern Hebron Hills, Rabbis for Human Rights and the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions, asks the court to restore the planning committees that dealt with Palestinian development that were annulled in 1971 by the Israel Defense Forces and their authority transferred to what eventually became the Civil Administration, which is appointed by the military and consists solely of Jews.
The planning body’s affiliation and composition reflect the policy of discrimination and lack of representation suffered by the Palestinians in the regional planning system, which leads to their eviction so that settlements can be expanded. From the data supplied by Bimkom − Planners for Planning Rights, it emerges that the areas currently designated for Palestinian development total only 1 percent of Area C, while the settlement areas with master plans constitute 26 percent of Area C (as reported by Amira Hass on Sunday). The petitioners note that the land area the state allocates to Palestinian towns is significantly less than that allocated to settlements and limits Palestinian options for future development and expansion.
The result is that nearly all Palestinian construction in the area is considered “illegal” and subject to demolition. Between 2009 and 2013, 2,224 Palestinian structures were demolished for this reason.
Given these statistics it is hard to understand the state’s response to the petition, in which it argues that claims of discrimination are groundless. Not only is the planning inequitable in scope, it is carried out by separate planning bureaucracies; while the settlers enjoy a planning system sympathetic to them, the Palestinians face a military planning bureaucracy that is hostile. Even though in recent years, in response to the petition and under pressure from Europe, the Civil Administration has prepared 11 master plans for Palestinians and slowly approved a few local plans that were prepared, the discrimination is still built in to the system and results in planning apartheid.
The state’s argument that these issues have diplomatic ramifications and should be dealt with during the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, and not by the courts, is false and disingenuous. Not only is Israel doing its best to avoid negotiating with the Palestinians. Moreover, according to the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, it has actually stopped advancing what building plans there are, as punishment for the Palestinian Authority applying to join UN conventions.
But in any case, the rights of those living in occupied territory and who are considered “protected” by international law are not subject to negotiation, and cannot be undermined on any political or diplomatic pretext.
The military that controls an occupied area is obligated to preserve the law that existed in it before it was occupied and attend to the welfare of the local population. Israel’s discriminatory planning policy in the West Bank violates this obligation, and it behooves the court to halt it.

<title>Is this not apartheid?</title>
<date>Thu May 01 02:47:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Is Israel at risk of becoming an apartheid state, as John Kerry said on Friday, or not, as he said on Tuesday? Who knows? Given his feeble performance as U.S. secretary of state and his disgraceful apology, maybe it no longer matters what Kerry thinks or says. Given the aggressiveness of the Jewish lobby and the weakness of the Obama administration, which capitulates to every “pro-Israel” whim, Israel doesn’t need enemies with friends like these. Look what happened to its genuine friend, who was only trying to warn it from itself.
What a miserable secretary of state, up to his neck in denial. And how unfriendly to Israel he is to retract his frank, genuine and friendly warning merely for fear of the lobby. Now millions of ignorant Americans, viewers of Fox News and its ilk, know that Israel is in no risk of becoming an apartheid state. They believe the power of Hamas and the sophistication of Qassam rocket pose an existential danger to Israel .
But Kerry’s vacillations do not change the reality that shrieks from every wall. From every West Bank Palestinian village, from every reservoir and power grid that is for Jews only; apartheid screams from every demolished tent encampment and every verdict of the military court; from every nighttime arrest, every checkpoint, every eviction order and every settlement home. No, Israel is not an apartheid state, but for nearly 50 years an apartheid regime has ruled its occupied territories. Those who want to continue to live a lie, to repress and to deny are invited to visit Hebron. No honest, decent person could return without admitting the existence of apartheid. Those who fear that politically incorrect word have only to walk for a few minutes down Shuhada Street, with its segregated road and sidewalks, and their fear of using the forbidden word will vanish without a trace.
The history of the conflict is filled with forbidden words. Once upon a time, it was forbidden to say “Palestinians” was forbidden, after that came the prohibitions against saying “occupation,” “war crime,” “colonialism” or “binational state.” Now “apartheid” is prohibited.
The forbidden words paralyze debate. Did you let the word “apartheid” slip out? The truth is no longer important. But no political correctness or bowdlerization, however sanctimonious, can conceal reality forever. And the reality is an occupation regime of apartheid.
The naysayers can find countless differences between the apartheid of Pretoria and that of Jerusalem. Pretoria’s was openly racist and anchored in law; Jerusalem’s is denied and repressed, hidden beneath a heavy cloak of propaganda and messianic religious faith. But the result is the same. Some South Africans who lived under the system of segregation say that their apartheid was worse. I know South Africans who say that the version in the territories is worse. But neither group can find a significant difference at the root: When two nations share the same piece of land and one has full rights while the other has no rights, that is apartheid. If it looks like apartheid, walks like apartheid and quacks like apartheid, it’s apartheid.
Israel is an incipient apartheid state, just as Kerry I said on Friday. Kerry II, on Tuesday, merely tried to blur and hide the truth for fear of the lobby. But apartheid is in our future. If there won’t be two states, there will be only one. If there won’t be a democratic, egalitarian state, a state of all its citizens, then there will be an apartheid state. There is no other option. With its actions, Israel is saying a firm “no” to the two-state solution. With its fear of a non-Jewish state, Israel is saying no to a democratic, binational state. Where does that leave us? With an apartheid state. As Naomi Shemer said in her optimistic song “Mahar” (“Tomorrow”): If not today, then tomorrow, and if not tomorrow, then the day after.

<title>The truth, off the record</title>
<date>Thu May 01 03:25:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
At a G-20 conference in Cannes in November 2011, then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy termed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a “liar” and said he “can’t stand” the Israeli leader. U.S. President Barack Obama responded, “You’re tired of him; what about me? I have to deal with him every day.” These rare quotes, revealing truths that are usually kept from the public due to the rules of diplomacy and political correctness, came to light only because the two presidents didn’t realize that the microphones were still on.
Now, it is John Kerry’s turn. In contrast to Sarkozy and Obama, the U.S. secretary of state was caught revealing truths not about people, but about fundamental issues. During a meeting of the Trilateral Commission last week, Kerry was recorded as saying, “A two-state solution will be clearly underscored as the only real alternative. Because a unitary state winds up either being an apartheid state with second-class citizens—or it ends up being a state that destroys the capacity of Israel to be a Jewish state.” He also warned that a stalemate in the peace process could lead to renewed violence in the territories, while hinting that progress might be possible under a different government: If “there is a change of government or a change of heart, something will happen,” he said.
Kerry’s frank statements weren’t the sort that diplomatic ears are accustomed to hearing, and he was therefore subjected to a wave of political and personal attacks for having made them. He was even forced to publicly express regret for having used the word “apartheid,” saying, “If I could rewind the tape, I would have chosen a different word.”
It’s no accident that Kerry was forced to retract the term “apartheid” in particular. There’s good reason for the sensitivity over comparisons of Israel with apartheid-era South Africa: Aspects of apartheid already exist in Israel, and they are liable to expand if the two-state solution collapses. But instead of working to alter the country’s destructive direction, groups and individuals that call themselves “pro-Israel” are trying to obscure the grim reality by denying the “apartheid” label.
Kerry’s “off-the-record” remarks essentially described reality: Israel cannot remain a Jewish and democratic state without a two-state solution, a unitary state would be an apartheid state, a stalemate in the peace process is liable to lead to another intifada and a change in the composition of Israel’s government, and/or the person heading it, is liable to change the picture. The troubling snapshot of reality that Kerry presented must be altered by implementing a two-state solution. For unlike an audio recording, the tragedy that is gradually taking shape here won’t be possible to rewind or erase.

<title>Don’t redefine Jewish state</title>
<date>Sun May 04 00:21:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that he intends to advance a new basic law to guarantee Israel’s existence as the state of the Jewish people, after recognizing that there are those who “seek to undermine the historic, moral and legal justification for the existence of the State of Israel as the state of our people.” But Netanyahu is mistaken, and perhaps he is intentionally being misleading.
In Israel and outside it, no significant challenge has been made to its right to exist as the state of the Jewish people. There is a meaningful challenge to Israel’s operational policy — led by the prime minister — the implication of which is that the occupation, the settlement enterprise and the apartheid regime imposed on the Palestinian population are a foundation of Israel’s existence.
The passage of another nationalist law, the likes of which are passed in certain regimes, would be very damaging to Israel and would not have a positive impact on attitudes toward the state. Only eliminating the occupation would have that effect.
The real significance of the proposed law was explicated by one of its proponents, MK Yariv Levin (Likud), who claimed it would “return Israel to the Zionist path, after years of continual injury by the judicial system to the basic principles on which the state was founded.” In other words, the judicial system, which has in many instances prevented major damage to Israel in the international arena and acted as an upholder of civil rights in the absence of a constitution, is not, according to Levin, part of “the basic principles on which the state was founded.” Indeed, this bill lays the groundwork for discriminating between Israeli citizens and violating the civil rights of Arab citizens, and for annexing territory while violating the rights of its inhabitants — violations that the judicial system has so far succeeded in preventing, in instances where the injustice was intolerable.
Israel boasts of being the only democracy in the Middle East, and it does have many important components of democracy, on account of which it is considered part of the democratic world. But the occupation and the apartheid, antidemocratic regime that it creates have long since gone from being a constraint that was imposed on Israel to being a goal in itself. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that supporters of the occupation such as Levin seek to remove the democratic obstacles from their path. That is the true meaning of the proposed Basic Law on Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish people.
Israel was defined as a Jewish and democratic state in a Basic Law around 20 years ago. This definition reflects the realization of the Zionist program to establish a state for the Jews in a democratic framework that grants equal rights to all citizens, including those who are not Jewish, and gives equal weight to both descriptors. This definition does not need to be changed by the prime minister.

<title>United, the Palestinians have endorsed 1967 borders for peace. Will Israel?</title>
<date>Wed May 07 15:05:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
When Yasser Arafat, in the framework of the Oslo agreement,  accepted 22% of historic Palestine, many people including myself had reservations.
Why recognize the State of Israeli within the 1967 borders when Israel hadn’t yet recognized the state of Palestine or signaled a willingness to halt settlement construction and rapidly move toward a withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from the occupied territories? The risk, many people said, was that the Israelis would simply refuse to give up East Jerusalem and most of the West Bank. What would we do then? Arafat replied to such fears by assuring us that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, “the Israeli Charles de Gaulle” as he likened him, was his partner. The two of them, he and Rabin, would end the conflict that had lasted too long and destroyed too many lives. 
Of course, Arafat was aware of those Israelis who suspected him of using Oslo as a plot, and of planning to launch a final war against Israel from lands “given” to him by the Rabin government.
In the countless meetings I and other friends and advisers had with Arafat, never did he talk about any such conspiracy. His vision was for Gaza to be the “lungs” of our new state, a place with an international airport, a harbor, light industries, and new housing for our refugees. Citizens of Palestine would be able to jump in their cars or even board a train and travel along a highway or tracks to the West Bank. A unified people, willing to turn the page on the past, would make peace with Israel, a final, lasting and warm peace.
This seems like a distant utopian dream in today’s landscape of walls, hermetic closures, and a fractured Palestinian people. The plans for the sea port and the Gaza-West Bank road link are still filed away and ready to be implemented; there just seems no political way of doing so.
But the logic that was behind Arafat’s peace with Rabin is as sound today as it was in 1993. Israelis and Palestinians have no choice but to find a way to share the Holy Land, and this will happen only when our two nations are prepared once and for all to set to once side their maximalist claims. Israelis have to learn to live within their 78%, just as we must use our talents to transform our 22% into a unified and productive democracy.
For us Palestinians, the reconciliation agreement concluded between Fatah and Hamas in Gaza two weeks ago was a necessary condition for moving on from the past. The agreement brings our main political players to the same side, namely to the side of a historic agreement with Israel. The terms of agreement includes recognition of the 1967 borders. Hamas's political leaders, moreover, are willing to back the Arab peace initiative of 2002, which is the clearest sign I know that their readiness to sign off on the 1967 border is not a mere tactical move but reflects deeper strategic calculations.
The new technocratic government that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will form over the coming weeks will abide by all the terms of the Oslo Accords and the Middle East Quartet. It will be as well a government willing to use the Arab peace initiative as a framework for a negotiated peace agreement that, once signed, will offer the Israelis full diplomatic and commercial relations with fifty-seven Arab and Islamic states.
The real question is how the Netanyahu government will respond. Will it be strong and united enough to conclude what Arafat called the "peace of the brave"? Will it lower its walls and permit the Israeli people to get to know our aspirations, or will it keep in place its policies of separation that contribute to suspicion and fear? Will it open itself to our region, or will it continue the relentless expansion of settlements and population control that will lead to an apartheid regime?Munib al Masri is a co-founder and chairman of the Palestine Development and Investment Company (Padico), co-founder and honorary chairman of the Welfare Association, founder and chairman of Edgo Group, and chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce in Palestine. He is a trustee of Al-Quds University, trustee emeritus of the American University of Beirut, and support numerous schools and universities. He is dedicated to promoting social welfare, education and development in Palestine, and advancing the cause of peace.

<title>Education minister has a lot to learn</title>
<date>Fri Jun 13 01:11:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The nationalist word laundry never stops working. It seems that every minister feels obliged to practice collective brainwashing, aimed at removing the two-state solution as far as possible. After the usual “occupation stars” – Naftali Bennett, Uri Ariel, Moshe Ya’alon, Gideon Sa’ar – now it’s the turn of Education Minister Shay Piron.
Unlike the official extremists, who aren’t ashamed of their nationalist positions – and even enjoy ramping up the violent rhetoric occasionally for political purposes – Piron presents the “educational version” of occupation.
As befits an education minister, Piron isn’t interested in occupying any old territories that don’t belong to Israel. All he wants is to “connect different parts” of the people. He’s not interested in causing the Palestinians harm, but wants to create “a meeting of cultures of Jews from east and west.” He doesn’t want to do injustice to another, but yearns to return to “another discourse” – because he’s concerned over the “either-or” culture that “emphasizes the contradictions.” He doesn’t want to turn Israel into an apartheid state, of course, but believes that “only a complete culture, which has some of both, will lead to consolidating a rooted Jewish world.”
The trouble is that all these lovely words have one role – to prevent, as Piron says, “restricting the Greater Israel vision.” Because, he adds, “the Land of Israel without Hebron and Nablus, without Tel Aviv and Deganya, without Ofakim and Kiryat Shmona, is not whole.”
Of course he doesn’t “know a peace without withdrawals,” but the education minister – who is supposed to ensure that hundreds of thousands of students develop a democratic, egalitarian, humane awareness – believes his job obliges him “to educate, tour the country, occupy and study the land to its length and breadth.”
Piron said these things on Thursday in a speech at Ariel University, which symbolizes, by its very existence beyond the Green Line, the dangerous process of normalizing the occupation. Four days after his Yesh Atid leader, Yair Lapid, threatened to topple the government if it annexes settlements, the education minister proved how flimsy his party’s ideology is. His statements show what stuff a party that takes part in a radical rightist government, which acts regularly to sabotage a peace agreement, is made of.

<title>Boycott in the air</title>
<date>Sun Jun 29 04:29:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The winds of international boycott of the settlements are quickening, picking up. On Friday the Spanish and Italian governments warned citizens against conducting business with settlements in the Golan Heights, the West Bank or East Jerusalem, saying such activity could expose them to a number of legal and financial risks. France, Germany and Britain had previously issued similar warnings to their nationals.
The individual warnings by these five countries may soon become an all-European resolution. European Union institutions are considering the issue of a general warning on behalf of all 28 EU member states, and the statements by the five nations will presumably expedite these discussions. It was no coincidence that the EU envoy to Israel, Lars Faaborg-Anderson, said on Friday that the warnings indicate that EU member states “are losing their patience with concerns not being treated” by Israel.
For now, Europe is taking only small, measured steps. While the European Council last week took a firm stance last week in banning the import of goods from Crimea and the occupied city of Sevastopol, EU institutions have thus far made do with warnings only regarding the Israeli settlements. But the message is clear in the winds from Europe, and Israel cannot afford to ignore it. A European boycott of all economic activity originating would be a blow to the Israeli economy, nearly all of which is invested in the settlement enterprise, whether directly or indirectly.
The world is indeed beginning to lose its patience, as the EU envoy said. The status quo in the territories, which already has characteristics of an apartheid regime, is intolerable to the Europeans, who will not stand by indefinitely. After the last attempt to revive the peace talks, the collapse of which was largely due to Israel, friendly nations including Europe and the United States will be forced to take concrete measures against an intransigent Israel. In the 21st century, the world will not accept another 47 years of occupation, dispossession and widespread violation of the rights of an entire people.
The warning by these five states to their citizens should, therefore, become an even stronger warning to Israel’s government: If it does not hasten to take concrete steps toward ending the occupation, all Israelis will pay the price, and it could be high indeed.

<title>My plea to the people of Israel: Liberate yourselves by liberating Palestine</title>
<date>Thu Aug 14 21:56:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The past weeks have witnessed unprecedented action by members of civil society across the world against the injustice of Israel’s disproportionately brutal response to the firing of missiles from Palestine.
If you add together all the people who gathered over the past weekend to demand justice in Israel and Palestine – in Cape Town, Washington, D.C., New York, New Delhi, London, Dublin and Sydney, and all the other cities – this was arguably the largest active outcry by citizens around a single cause ever in the history of the world.
A quarter of a century ago, I participated in some well-attended demonstrations against apartheid. I never imagined we’d see demonstrations of that size again, but last Saturday’s turnout in Cape Town was as big if not bigger. Participants included young and old, Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, agnostics, atheists, blacks, whites, reds and greens ... as one would expect from a vibrant, tolerant, multicultural nation.
I asked the crowd to chant with me: “We are opposed to the injustice of the illegal occupation of Palestine. We are opposed to the indiscriminate killing in Gaza. We are opposed to the indignity meted out to Palestinians at checkpoints and roadblocks. We are opposed to violence perpetrated by all parties. But we are not opposed to Jews.”
Earlier in the week, I called for the suspension of Israel from the International Union of Architects, which was meeting in South Africa.

I appealed to Israeli sisters and brothers present at the conference to actively disassociate themselves and their profession from the design and construction of infrastructure related to perpetuating injustice, including the separation barrier, the security terminals and checkpoints, and the settlements built on occupied Palestinian land.
“I implore you to take this message home: Please turn the tide against violence and hatred by joining the nonviolent movement for justice for all people of the region,” I said.
Over the past few weeks, more than 1.6 million people across the world have signed onto this movement by joining an Avaaz campaign calling on corporations profiting from the Israeli occupation and/or implicated in the abuse and repression of Palestinians to pull out. The campaign specifically targets Dutch pension fund ABP; Barclays Bank; security systems supplier G4S; French transport company Veolia; computer company Hewlett-Packard; and bulldozer supplier Caterpillar.
Last month, 17 EU governments urged their citizens to avoid doing business in or investing in illegal Israeli settlements.
We have also recently witnessed the withdrawal by Dutch pension fund PGGM of tens of millions of euros from Israeli banks; the divestment from G4S by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; and the U.S. Presbyterian Church divested an estimated $21 million from HP, Motorola Solutions and Caterpillar.
It is a movement that is gathering pace.
Violence begets violence and hatred, that only begets more violence and hatred.
We South Africans know about violence and hatred. We understand the pain of being the polecat of the world; when it seems nobody understands or is even willing to listen to our perspective. It is where we come from.
We also know the benefits that dialogue between our leaders eventually brought us; when organizations labeled “terrorist” were unbanned and their leaders, including Nelson Mandela, were released from imprisonment, banishment and exile.
We know that when our leaders began to speak to each other, the rationale for the violence that had wracked our society dissipated and disappeared. Acts of terrorism perpetrated after the talks began – such as attacks on a church and a pub – were almost universally condemned, and the party held responsible snubbed at the ballot box.
The exhilaration that followed our voting together for the first time was not the preserve of black South Africans alone. The real triumph of our peaceful settlement was that all felt included. And later, when we unveiled a constitution so tolerant, compassionate and inclusive that it would make God proud, we all felt liberated.
Of course, it helped that we had a cadre of extraordinary leaders.
But what ultimately forced these leaders together around the negotiating table was the cocktail of persuasive, nonviolent tools that had been developed to isolate South Africa, economically, academically, culturally and psychologically.
At a certain point – the tipping point – the then-government realized that the cost of attempting to preserve apartheid outweighed the benefits.
The withdrawal of trade with South Africa by multinational corporations with a conscience in the 1980s was ultimately one of the key levers that brought the apartheid state – bloodlessly – to its knees. Those corporations understood that by contributing to South Africa’s economy, they were contributing to the retention of an unjust status quo.
Those who continue to do business with Israel, who contribute to a sense of “normalcy” in Israeli society, are doing the people of Israel and Palestine a disservice. They are contributing to the perpetuation of a profoundly unjust status quo.
Those who contribute to Israel’s temporary isolation are saying that Israelis and Palestinians are equally entitled to dignity and peace.
Ultimately, events in Gaza over the past month or so are going to test who believes in the worth of human beings.
It is becoming more and more clear that politicians and diplomats are failing to come up with answers, and that responsibility for brokering a sustainable solution to the crisis in the Holy Land rests with civil society and the people of Israel and Palestine themselves.
Besides the recent devastation of Gaza, decent human beings everywhere – including many in Israel – are profoundly disturbed by the daily violations of human dignity and freedom of movement Palestinians are subjected to at checkpoints and roadblocks. And Israel’s policies of illegal occupation and the construction of buffer-zone settlements on occupied land compound the difficulty of achieving an agreementsettlement in the future that is acceptable for all.
The State of Israel is behaving as if there is no tomorrow. Its people will not live the peaceful and secure lives they crave – and are entitled to – as long as their leaders perpetuate conditions that sustain the conflict.
I have condemned those in Palestine responsible for firing missiles and rockets at Israel. They are fanning the flames of hatred. I am opposed to all manifestations of violence.
But we must be very clear that the people of Palestine have every right to struggle for their dignity and freedom. It is a struggle that has the support of many around the world.
No human-made problems are intractable when humans put their heads together with the earnest desire to overcome them. No peace is impossible when people are determined to achieve it.
Peace requires the people of Israel and Palestine to recognize the human being in themselves and each other; to understand their interdependence.
Missiles, bombs and crude invective are not part of the solution. There is no military solution.
The solution is more likely to come from that nonviolent toolbox we developed in South Africa in the 1980s, to persuade the government of the necessity of altering its policies.
The reason these tools – boycott, sanctions and divestment – ultimately proved effective was because they had a critical mass of support, both inside and outside the country. The kind of support we have witnessed across the world in recent weeks, in respect of Palestine.
My plea to the people of Israel is to see beyond the moment, to see beyond the anger at feeling perpetually under siege, to see a world in which Israel and Palestine can coexist – a world in which mutual dignity and respect reign.
It requires a mind-set shift. A mind-set shift that recognizes that attempting to perpetuate the current status quo is to damn future generations to violence and insecurity. A mind-set shift that stops regarding legitimate criticism of a state’s policies as an attack on Judaism. A mind-set shift that begins at home and ripples out across communities and nations and regions – to the Diaspora scattered across the world we share. The only world we share.
People united in pursuit of a righteous cause are unstoppable. God does not interfere in the affairs of people, hoping we will grow and learn through resolving our difficulties and differences ourselves. But God is not asleep. The Jewish scriptures tell us that God is biased on the side of the weak, the dispossessed, the widow, the orphan, the alien who set slaves free on an exodus to a Promised Land. It was the prophet Amos who said we should let righteousness flow like a river.
Goodness prevails in the end. The pursuit of freedom for the people of Palestine from humiliation and persecution by the policies of Israel is a righteous cause. It is a cause that the people of Israel should support.
Nelson Mandela famously said that South Africans would not feel free until Palestinians were free.
He might have added that the liberation of Palestine will liberate Israel, too.

<title>Path cleared to treat asylum seekers humanely</title>
<date>Wed Sep 24 06:00:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
What can’t be achieved by force can be achieved by more force, believes outgoing Interior Minister Gideon Sa’ar, who wants to amend the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Freedom and curb the High Court of Justice’s authority.
On Monday, the High Court ordered the state to close the Holot detention facility for asylum seekers within 90 days. It also overturned a provision that allowed asylum seekers who entered Israel illegally to be incarcerated without trial for up to a year.
Sa’ar says the responsibility to protect the state’s borders is the government’s, not the court’s. If the High Court’s ruling is implemented, he argues, Israel will no longer be a Jewish and democratic state. But we haven’t heard Sa’ar voice concerns about the threat to the Jewish and democratic state stemming from the settlements and the dispossession and apartheid derived from them – in the absence of an eastern border, which Israel refuses to set.
It’s hard to believe that even after the High Court’s decision, Sa’ar can say the amendment to the Prevention of Infiltration Law “made a considerable contribution to the voluntary departure process.” The High Court described the law’s harsh impact on the asylum seekers’ lives. The only refuge the state left them was “voluntary” return to the countries where their lives were in danger. Clearly there was no free will in the process.
In the court’s ruling, Justice Edna Arbel was right when she said the amendment was merely a rehash of an earlier amendment that the court had annulled a year ago.
The prime minister, interior minister and attorney general must now do some soul-searching after thinking they could cheat the High Court and enact a law identical to one that had been annulled. They blatantly violated the asylum seekers’ rights and caused an injustice whose full scope will only be clear in the future. The attorney general is particularly responsible because he did not prevent the cabinet from this failure and disgrace.
Sa’ar’s new ideas must be rejected. The Basic Law on Human Dignity and Freedom is a vital component of Israel’s essence as a democracy, which places the individual at its center. A change to the law must not even be considered – and certainly not an amendment to the Prevention of Infiltration Law that deviates from the spirit and clear wording of the High Court’s rulings.
Israel must grant the asylum seekers the freedom and ability to run their lives. The burden on south Tel Aviv’s residents will ease if the refugees are allowed to take part in the labor market and gradually resume a normal life.
Sa’ar, with the prime minister’s backing, led Israel on an illegal and immoral path. His decision to resign from politics must therefore be seen as a positive development. It lets the prime minister consider a new way to take care of the asylum seekers.

<title>Israel’s moment of choice</title>
<date>Fri Sep 26 19:28:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
When the Palestinian consensus government was sworn in on 2 June 2014, ending seven years of Palestinian political and institutional division, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately rejected it, telling Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in a public statement that he must choose between peace and Hamas.
In the wake of Israel’s brutal war on Gaza, however, even Netanyahu’s right-wing government now understands that a unified Palestinian government is in everyone’s interest, including Israel’s. The real choice today is not between peace and Hamas but between occupation and freedom. The time has come for Israel to choose between a deteriorating status quo that promises only continued confrontations and further isolation for Israel or a path toward genuine peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike by ending Israel’s military occupation once and for all.
Unlike Netanyahu’s coalition, which includes ministers explicitly opposed to the creation of two states, the Palestinian government was formed on a peace agenda: recognizing Israel on the pre-1967 borders, renouncing violence, adhering both to international law and previous agreements signed with Israel. Bringing Hamas and other Palestinian factions together on such terms was the Palestinian gift to the prospects of real peace, and the only solution to ending the division that has plagued the Palestinian people.
For Netanyahu, 'peace' means returning to the status quo ante: Gaza besieged and severed from the West Bank as the latter continues to be colonized under a smokescreen called the 'peace process.'
A unified Palestinian government administering both Gaza and the West Bank as one integral territory is not an option but a national obligation and an international demand. While such a government was imperative for addressing Gaza’s accumulated problems and sheer human suffering before the war as a result of Israel’s criminal siege, it has become the only life line for both Gaza and the West Bank after Israel’s military onslaught on both areas this summer. No other entity has the domestic and international legitimacy to help end the siege on Gaza, provide relief and reconstruction for the 1.8 million Palestinians while reintegrating Gaza with the West Bank, and address the legitimate security requirements of Palestinians.
Israel’s latest war on Gaza was not the first but it must be the last. Under no circumstances can such senseless mass murder and destruction – which has seen the lives of 2,200 people, mostly civilians, including more than 550 children, taken away, with more than 10,000 injured, and almost quarter of Gaza buildings and infrastructure obliterated – be permitted again. This calamity left most Palestinians, and with us the majority of world opinion, with one conviction: never again.
The Palestine National Movement embodied in the PLO made its choice on behalf of the Palestinian people on 15 November 1988. The Palestine National Council voted overwhelmingly for a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, ipso facto recognizing Israel on the pre-1967 lines. Five years later, the PLO formalized this recognition as part of the Oslo agreements. Despite the lack of reciprocal recognition from Israel and its vagueness and open-ended provisions, many Palestinians supported Oslo, hoping that it meant Israel too had reached its moment of truth and choice: ending its occupation of the land occupied in 1967 and addressing Palestinians’ legitimate historic rights, including the right of return.Alas, we were wrong. In hindsight, successive Israeli governments have instead used the 'peace process' for the exact opposite purpose: to avert and delay that moment of choice. Neither in 1993 nor today Israel is ready to answer the one basic question: where it wants its final border to be? Instead negotiations have been used by Israel as a conflict management tool and a smoke screen for the ongoing colonization of East Jerusalem and the West Bank. In short, the 'peace process' has been used by Israel to delay and prevent the outcome of a Palestinian state.
The recent and biggest land grab in years, confiscating 4,000 dunams (about 1,000 acres) south of Bethlehem, the very heart of where the Palestinian state is supposed to be established, is another confirmation that the current Israeli government’s master map has nothing to do with the 1967 lines. Rather, facts on the ground follow the map of the 'Greater Israel project.' That is, Israel is the only state, controls the whole of Palestine, and is unilaterally partitioning the occupied territories by a complex system of military rule, annexation (colonization), exclusion (ethnic cleansing) and separation (siege and apartheid), keeping Palestinians disconnected, atomized, and unable to function as one political and economic unit.
Twenty one years of a failed 'peace process’ are enough to conclude that the bilateral route to ending occupation is working - but in the wrong direction. We must try something else. Israel must be denied access to its 'we are talking' comfort zone, and the Palestinians must exit the state of limbo we have been in since Oslo.
Today we are saying this is Israel’s moment of choice. Either Netanyahu must declare that the status quo is a military occupation of the territory occupied in 1967, in which case after 47 years it must come to an end. Or he must declare that the status quo is not an occupation and that Israel intends to continue taking effective control of the entire territory of historic Palestine and denying basic individual and collective rights to Palestinians living inside and in exile. Netanyahu’s habit of giving lip service to the first, while following the second, can no longer continue.
Israel can’t have it both ways: land without people, control without responsibility. This has gone on for far too long. Either Israel takes full responsibility or it gives up control of the lives and territory of millions of Palestinians.
President Abbas demanded a firm expiry date for occupation. No more business as usual. Repeating that the status quo in Palestine is unsustainable must not be just a statement, but our and the international community’s goal. On 15 November this year, the Palestinian people will celebrate the 26th anniversary of our Declaration of Independence, reaffirming the collective choice we made in 1988. By next year, we either celebrate our real and full independence or we will have redefined the status quo and with it our national goals and ways to achieve them.

 Peace cannot be privatized
	While Guy Rolnik’s article (“To keep the best, let’s be the best,” TheMarker, October 10), is comprehensive and well written, all the quotes at the beginning to describe those leaving Israel are exactly the same as those used against the people who left their kibbutzim 40 years ago. As then, so now, some will be very successful, some will be happy with their move without becoming tycoons, and some will eventually return.
	Secondly, I reject entirely Rolnik’s assumption that achieving peace in the Middle East is not dependent on our government truly accepting the two-state solution, and negotiating to achieve that end. The status quo, to which Netanyahu and the messianic right wing are loyal, is catastrophic. For Israelis as well as Palestinians. The continued, meteoric growth of the defense budget is destroying education, health and social services. Continued settlement in what is considered by all the world as Palestinian territory, followed by recurring wars, is leading to an increase in anti-Israel and anti-Semitic action. BDS is growing slowly but steadily. (As it did against apartheid South Africa, which eventually collapsed.)
	The economic boom in Israel/Palestine after a peace agreement could be enormous. Tourism, investment by the European Union, America and other countries could be expected. All it needs is for our PM to stop terrifying Israelis with his horror stories of terrorism and nuclear destruction.

 The receipt as an art form
	The art forms described by David Sperber in his review of the catalog for the “Local Judaica” exhibit at the Eretz Israel Museum (“When art and Zionism converged to give Jewish holidays a new meaning,” English Haaretz Online, October 11) have personal meaning for me. Pieces created in the first two decades of the 20th century here, especially by a company called Moinster, took on a second life as giant kabalot (receipts) for donations made to institutions in Eretz Israel.
	Since my grandfather, Rabbi Tuvia Geffen (1910-70) of Atlanta, Georgia, was a fervent giver of charity, constantly collecting and forwarding contributions of $1, $3.50 or a little more to orphanages, little yeshivas and hospitals in this country, he saved kabalot received in his first decade in the American South by framing them and then hanging them on the walls in his study.
	In my family’s case, I was the only one of 18 grandchildren living in Atlanta. My cousins visited every summer from cities in the eastern and Midwest USA. We had great fun being invited into zadie’s study – looking at the well-used, large folios of Shas, Mishneh Torah, Shulchan Aruch and many other works.
	What was most interesting for American born and bred Jewish children like ourselves were these kabalot on the walls. They offered us our childhood views of this land, the wonderful images which Sperber talks about, in particular the romantic presentation of Orthodox Jewish life here.  Dr. David Geffen	Jerusalem

<title>Welcome aboard Israel's apartheid bus</title>
<date>Mon Oct 27 14:40:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon has instructed that Palestinian laborers be prohibited from using Israeli public transportation to travel between their homes in the West Bank and work in Israel. According to the report by Chaim Levinson in Haaretz on Sunday, Palestinian laborers will not be allowed to board buses traveling directly between central Israel and the West Bank at the end of their work day.
	The minister’s decision comes despite the fact that the Israel Defense Forces see no security risk in Palestinians traveling on Israeli buses, because the only ones to do so are those with entry and work permits who undergo careful security checks when they enter Israel. Thus, Ya’alon’s decision is purely a result of his having given in to the longtime pressure exerted on him by settlers demanding that Palestinians not be allowed to board “their” buses.
	The minister’s decision reeks of apartheid, typical of the Israeli occupation regime in the territories. One of the most blatant symbols of the regime of racial separation in South Africa was the separate bus lines for whites and blacks. Now, Ya’alon has implemented the same policy in the occupied territories. In so doing, he justifies the claims of those who brand Israel internationally as an apartheid state.
	Ya’alon’s decision also means a heavier burden on the Palestinians in the West Bank. Few among them are allowed to work in Israel, and those who are allowed to work in Israel face an exhausting, humiliating and painful experience on their way to and from work. Now, Ya’alon is making it even harder on them.
	The defense minister made it his goal a long time ago to satisfy the settlers; to dance to their tune and make almost all their wishes and demands come true. He does this out of cynical personal and political considerations - to reinforce his status as a leader of the extreme right. The saga of his murky relations with the American administration following his disparaging remarks about Secretary of State John Kerry and other senior officials shows how much Ya’alon longs for the settlers’ embrace.
	This time, Ya’alon is kowtowing to the settlers at the expense of the image of the State of Israel internationally and its remaining shreds of morality. And all by abusing a few tens of thousands of Palestinians permitted to make a paltry living in Israel.
	Ya’alon’s has instructed the Civil Administration to prepare for the implementation of his decision until it can be done in practice. It would be better for him to annul it immediately and remove this shame from Israel.

<title>American Jews: Challenge Israel’s segregated bus lines</title>
<date>Tue Nov 04 21:29:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	The American Jewish community has a proud and celebrated history of activism in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ‘60s. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel famously marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma, saying afterwards, “I felt my feet were praying.”
	Young Jews comprised a large number of Freedom Summer activists fighting against racism and segregation in the South; some like Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner even gave their lives in the pursuit of racial equality. Even the threat of personal harm did not stop American Jews from acting on their values.
	Jewish communal organizations often remind us that we have a proud, historical commitment to civil rights. By recounting our history of civil rights activism and our strong values of equality and justice, our communal leaders and organizations hope to inspire those same values in our generation. As J Street U leaders, we see our obligation to pursue social justice and civil rights side-by-side with our commitment to a just and secure future for the State of Israel. That work becomes far more challenging when the Israeli government undermines its own democratic precepts and runs counter to the values of the American Jewish community.
	This week, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon announced a plan  which would require Palestinians who work in Israel during the day to return home to the West Bank through a separate checkpoint than Israelis with the same commute. This will effectively segregate buses in the West Bank; keeping Palestinians off of buses used by Jewish settlers. And while Ya’alon cited “security concerns” as his rationale, the decision contradicts the IDF, which maintains that shared buses do not pose a threat to Israelis. Israel’s Justice Minister, Tzipi Livni, has said that if the policy is carried out, it will mean nothing less than “apartheid.”
	By imposing the ban, Ya'alon, who once threatened to address the "Palestinian cancer" with "chemotherapy" – lines up with MK Moti Yogev, a settler himself, who recently said, “riding these buses is unreasonable. They are full of Arabs.” A settler group in Ariel also recently released a video and staged a protest demanding the racial segregation of buses. The video depicts a lone Jewish woman exiting a bus filled with Palestinian workers, and is captioned, “it's not about racism, it's about a simple question – would you be willing to go on a bus [packed with Arabs]?”
	The idea of segregated buses should send chills down the spine of anyone who has ever witnessed or learned about apartheid South Africa’s separate bus system for whites and blacks, or the segregated Jim Crow-era American south. But sadly, this is just the latest in a long series of discriminatory acts and policies that define Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. It also marks the disturbing rise of influence of the settler movement in Israeli politics – and the government’s willingness to kowtow to their demands.
	Since the busing decision was announced, only two major Jewish organizations – J Street and the Union for Reform Judaism – have spoken out publicly against bus segregation. We note positively that the Anti-Defamation League have also said that they will look into the matter, though they have not yet made a public statement.
	If they are truly committed to both civil rights and Israel’s future, Jewish organizations cannot stay silent. The occupation is nightmarish for Palestinians; it also guarantees that Israelis cannot live with true security, stability, or international respect. That is the simple truth, and it isn’t changing. Segregated busing in the West Bank should serve as a wake up call that Israel’s future has been hijacked by a racist settler movement that cares only for its own continued presence in the West Bank. We must recognize that these segregationist policies are morally repugnant and destroy Israel’s image in the international arena, even among its usual friends.
	When American Jewish leaders actually act on their values, it is a potent and invaluable antidote to discrimination within Israel, and all over the world. We saw this last year when the ADL lauded Israeli government efforts to address the scourge of gender-segregated buses. Groups like the American Jewish Committee have a long history of involvement in the civil rights movement in America and in challenging civil rights abuses across the globe. That makes their current silence even more deafening.
	An urgent letter from the youth arm of the Israeli Labor party has called on the leaders of some of the most prominent institutions of the American Jewish community – the Conference of Presidents, the Jewish Federations of North America, AIPAC, and others – to speak out against segregation in Israel. This call must not go unheeded.
	Segregation was wrong in Birmingham, Alabama, and it is wrong in the West Bank. Denying Palestinians civil rights and self-determination is wrong. The occupation, which began while Dr. King and Rabbi Heschel were alive, is also wrong. We must continue the Jewish communal legacy of fighting for civil rights – even when it means addressing unjust Israeli policies. J Street U is committed to seeing a reversal of this policy and will hold our communal organizations accountable to push for the same.

<title>Israelis must demand: Equality now</title>
<date>Fri Nov 21 05:45:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	Ashkelon Mayor Itamar Shimoni on Wednesday issued an order barring Arab workers from building projects in three preschools, in the wake of Tuesday’s fatal terror attack in a Jerusalem synagogue.
	Shimoni has done nothing new: Arab workers for public organizations suffered harassment and dismissal threats during Operation Protective Edge as well. But his blatant racism evoked a wave of political denunciations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “There is no place for discrimination against Arab Israelis.” Economy Minister Naftali Bennett checked and found that “99.9 percent of the Arabs are loyal to the state.”
	Netanyahu and Bennett’s condemnations set new records for hypocrisy. Shimoni merely translated into deed the spirit of the rightist leaders in Jerusalem. On Sunday, Netanyahu will present the latest version of the so-called nation-state law to his cabinet. The bill establishes the state’s commitment to the Jewish people’s “right to national self-determination in Israel,” to Jews in distress overseas, to Jewish holidays, to the Jewish calendar, to Jewish law and to the cultural and historical heritage of the Jewish people. As to the entirety of Israel’s citizens, the draft law promises them only “personal rights in accordance with every law.”
	Netanyahu pasted into the bill a portion of Israel’s Declaration of Independence, but deleted that document’s explicit promise of equal rights.
	The nation-state bill ignores the existence of an Arab community in Israel, with its own language, culture and rights, placing the state’s Arab citizens in a position that is inferior status to that of its Jews, who are also given collective rights. Instead of moving to end discrimination, Netanyahu means to give it the strength of a Basic Law.
	Netanyahu’s conduct is not surprising. He has ignored the Arab community throughout his term as prime minister, and his coalition acts tirelessly to “Judaize” the state.
	The conduct of Labor and Meretz in this matter is disappointing. Instead of challenging the government by proposing an alternative model of civil and communal equality, they settle for feeble statements to the media.
	The time has come to establish a broad, resounding social movement of Jews and Arabs that will call for “equality now” in order to counter the racism on the right and the political enervation on the left. We must not let Netanyahu obliterate the Declaration of Independence. Otherwise Shimoni won’t be the last to practice apartheid in a public institution.

<title>The Zionist Union is the poor man’s Likud</title>
<date>Fri Feb 13 12:17:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
	The election campaign waged by the Zionist Union belies the declarations of its leaders, Yitzhak Herzog and Tzipi Livni, who state their wish to replace the current government. The slogan “It’s us or him” was recently changed to “Only a sucker would vote for Netanyahu,” but the essential message remains unchanged: the problem with the Likud government lies in Benjamin Netanyahu’s personality, not in his destructive policies.
	Livni and Herzog are marketing themselves as people who will do a better job than Netanyahu in carrying out the foreign and defense policies of the Likud, covered in a patina of empty promises such as “we’ll return money to the public” or “free land for an apartment of your own.”
	This week, Herzog and Livni joined right-wing parties in supporting the disqualification of MK Haneen Zoabi (Balad) from running for the Knesset, thus also aligning themselves with the Likud on issues of democracy, respect for minorities and the guaranteeing of freedom of expression. One could argue that this is only a tactic for luring Likud voters who are disenchanted with Netanyahu, but it increasingly seems that the Zionist Union’s tactics are also its strategy.
	The main objective of the right-wing government, led by Netanyahu, Naftali Bennett and Avigdor Lieberman, is the annexation of the West Bank and the consolidation of an apartheid regime in which millions of Palestinians devoid of civil rights live alongside increasing numbers of settlers who conduct themselves as lords of the land.
	A secondary objective is the suppression of the political and communal aspirations of Israel’s Arab citizens. Anyone wishing to replace this government must first of all take a strong stand against the transformation of Israel into an apartheid state, while striving to incorporate its Arab citizens into an egalitarian state. These are the fateful issues facing Israel, not the cost of apartments or pre-school child care.
	On the Zionist Union’s website, the section dealing with ‘political horizons’ promises to “mobilize the world’s support in our combat against terror and our neighbors” — in other words, to manage the conflict with the Arab world better than Netanyahu. Herzog and Livni have even given up on claiming to strive for peace with the Palestinians, implicitly agreeing with Netanyahu and Bennett that there is no partner and that we need to live with (in Bennett’s words) “shrapnel in our backside.” If these are their positions, it’s no wonder that Netanyahu is beating them in opinion polls. People who support Likud policies prefer the original to the poor imitation offered by Herzog and Livni.

<title>The real existential threat to Israel</title>
<date>Wed Mar 04 03:04:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to the U.S. Congress on Tuesday brought the humbug that has characterized all the candidates in this election to a climax. All of them are ignoring the real existential threat to Israel and its ability to survive as a “Jewish and democratic state”: the unending occupation of the territories. Israel’s insistence on ruling over millions of Palestinians in the West Bank who lack civil rights, expanding the settlements and keeping residents of the Gaza Strip under siege is the danger that threatens its future.
	Israel is mortgaging its national resources to maintain a dual regime of democracy for Jews and apartheid for Palestinians. But the illusion that the occupation is comfortable and quiet, and that most Israelis are isolated from it, is fated to explode.
	In recent years, during which relative security quiet prevailed in the West Bank, Israel embarked on three wars in Gaza that killed thousands of Palestinian civilians – solely in order to maintain the status quo. These periodic “operations,” along with the cessation of negotiations with the Palestinian Authority led by Mahmoud Abbas, have left a moral stain on the Israel Defense Forces, and on the statesmen who sent them into Gaza and on policing missions in Ramallah, Nablus and Hebron.
	Calls for boycotting Israel and recognizing Palestine even without an agreement have moved from the political fringes to center stage in the West. Instead of the Palestinians giving up their national aspirations, Israel is being forced to contend with claims that Zionism and democracy are mutually exclusive.
	During the six years of Netanyahu’s tenure, the occupation’s seepage into the heart of Israel has intensified. Internal tensions between Jews and Arabs have risen, and right-wing parties have vied among themselves in pushing anti-democratic laws designed to institutionalize discrimination against the minority and deprive it of the right of political expression. While Netanyahu was planning his speech in Washington, right-wing thugs attacked MK Haneen Zoabi at a political conference in Ramat Gan. This was the natural continuation of the nation-state bill and the attempts to oust Zoabi and her colleagues from the Knesset, and more proof that democracy has trouble flourishing or even functioning alongside apartheid and military occupation.
	But the current election campaign is being conducted like a Purim carnival. The political parties are ignoring the occupation and its dangers and choosing instead to don masks: Iran, housing prices, personal rivalries. Nobody dares to talk about the conflict with the Palestinians, its heavy price and the necessity of ending it. But topping them all is the prime minister, who wasted the great opportunity and the enormous attention he received on Capitol Hill and didn’t even mention the real danger Israel faces.

<title>Save Meretz, save your soul</title>
<date>Tue Mar 10 06:03:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
	Meretz is at risk of not reaching the electoral threshold. In the last election, it received 176,000 votes. But in the last election, there was no battle over the position of prime minister. This time there is. As a result of a shift by some Meretz voters to Zionist Union, Meretz is expected to get only around 150,000 votes — only 20,000 votes above the minimum — giving it around five Knesset seats instead of the six it has today. If, as in past elections, significantly more Meretz supporters switch to Zionist Union at the last moment “to save the homeland,” the homeland will suffer.
	The size of the biggest party is critical this time, but if four Knesset seats are “lost” because Meretz fails to pass the vote threshold, there will be no electoral upset. It’s cut and dried. Therefore, supporters of both Meretz and the Joint List — who were justifiably appalled by the alliance of Arab parties’ separatist error of refusing a surplus-votes agreement with Meretz — must see to it that Meretz exceeds the threshold, for the sake of the upset.
	The importance of Meretz in achieving the upset goes hand in hand with what it would mean for the party to miss the threshold: Imagine the crowing of Baruch Marzel the Kahanist and others of his ilk, and it’s clear that must not be permitted.
	But anyone who says the size of the biggest party doesn’t matter this time is wrong. Size does matter, in this election. When one side has 61 true supporters in the Knesset — a simple majority — it’s the bloc that counts. This time, neither does. There will be fewer than 50 MKs to the left of Zionist Union head Isaac Herzog, and even fewer to the right of Prime Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud. That means the government will be decided by the centrist parties, according to the results for the big parties. If Herzog and Netanyahu are close, Netanyahu might stay in power. But if Herzog has a significant lead, there will be an upset. That lead will allow the centrist parties that aren’t crazy about Netanyahu, starting with Moshe Kahlon’s Kulanu, to join a Herzog-led government.
	This time it’s possible: The desire not to vote for Netanyahu is enormous. All that’s needed is for everyone who wants an upset to vote for Herzog.
	If I were the brother of Yesh Atid head Yair Lapid, or even Yair himself, I’d vote for Herzog. Anyone recognizing the existential importance of the upset must do so. Lapid won’t sit in a Netanyahu government, but he would be a key cabinet member under Herzog.
	A too-big Yesh Atid would also hinder the upset, which will be mathematically impossible without the ultra-Orthodox parties. When Herzog wins, the Haredim will gladly join his coalition and take over Habayit Hayehudi’s footholds in the rabbinate.
	After former Mossad chief Meir Dagan’s speech at Saturday’s rally in Tel Aviv, this point is surely clear to all. Anyone who remained dry-eyed at the sound of this Israeli hero’s choked voice has a heart of stone.
	Dagan came from the right. He was with Ariel Sharon during “Arik’s” right-wing days. In Gaza. In Lebanon. He grabbed a grenade with his bare hands. He also killed with his hands. When Dagan tears up talking about his grandfather in the Holocaust and pleads, “just not apartheid,” any non-messianist who fails to join the regime-change campaign surely has no soul. The only possible ballots for the upset are Zionist Union or Meretz.
	Historically, the military establishment is nearly always to the right of the political leaders, ready to attack. Only in rare cases, that end in apocalypse, does the military find itself to the left of the government. That’s what happens in messianic eras.
	More than 95 percent of Israel’s top brass has joined the regime-change campaign. With the exception of his own government appointees, almost none have stayed with Netanyahu.
	Given these circumstances, if there is no upset there will be a lot of crying. Anyone who fails to enlist in the effort will bear responsibility for destroying the dreams of future generations. The weakness and cowardice of anyone who fails to call out, loud and clear, “Choose Herzog and an upset,” because of a professional friendship with the Lapid-Ofer Shelah gang, shall never be forgiven.
	When Dagan weeps, a rain of upset ballots should follow. This is no time for hesitation or idle chatter. Either you help Meretz pass the threshold or you vote for Herzog. There is no other choice. If even one person who wants an upset to stop the extremism votes Lapid, heaven will have no mercy on us.

<title>Violence doesn't erase the legitimacy of grievances – in Baltimore, Tel Aviv or the West Bank</title>
<date>Thu May 07 15:15:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
	Last weekend, Ethiopian Israelis — enraged by police brutality, racial discrimination and state neglect — threw stones, bottles and chairs at Israeli police, injuring 56. In response, Israeli leaders condemned the violence while acknowledging the grievances that had sparked it. “We must look directly at this open wound — we have erred, we did not look, and we did not listen enough,” declared President Reuven Rivlin. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that, “We must all line up against racism, condemn it and work to eradicate it.” He pledged to convene a committee to work on the problems Ethiopian Israelis face in education, housing and employment.
	In the United States last week, when Baltimore erupted in flames after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, political elites responded the same way. Hillary Clinton insisted that, “The violence has to stop.” But she also said, “There is something profoundly wrong when African-American men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than are meted out to their white counterparts.” 
	Illegitimate means do not erase legitimate grievances. Leaders can condemn violence while still acknowledging, and working to overcome, the injustice that helps fuel it. When the perpetrators committing the violence are Ethiopian Israelis or African-Americans, the distinction seems obvious. So why it is so hard for the Israeli government and its defenders to grasp when the perpetrators are Palestinian? Why can’t Israeli leaders condemn Palestinian violence without using that violence to excuse Israel’s unjust and undemocratic control of the West Bank?
	I can already hear the objections. Hamas rocket attacks or suicide bombings are worse than throwing bottles in Tel Aviv or burning a CVS in Baltimore. That’s true. But the point is that denying people basic rights doesn’t become OK because some people respond to that denial in violent, even grotesque ways. In South Africa in the 1980s, supporters of Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress forced alleged government informants to wear rubber tires filled with gasoline, and then set them on fire. In 1986, Mandela’s then-wife, Winnie, declared that, “With our boxes of matches and our necklaces we shall liberate this country.” The practice was hideously barbaric. But it didn’t make apartheid any less wrong. (No, I’m not arguing that Israel is the equivalent of apartheid South Africa, only that an immoral response to injustice doesn’t justify that injustice).
	Besides, even when Palestinian violence is more equivalent to the violence that broke out in Baltimore and Tel Aviv — when West Bank teenagers throw rocks at Israeli troops, for instance — the Israeli government’s defenders still seize on it to delegitimize Palestinian grievances. Last year, the Israel Defense Force’s English-language webpage published a blog post entitled, “What ‘Non-Violent’ Palestinian Protests Really Looks Like.” It declared that, “As Israeli soldiers do their best to keep the region secure, Palestinians throw rocks in unprovoked attacks against IDF forces.”  Rock-throwing is wrong. But calling people who have lived for almost a half-century under military law and without free movement, citizenship or the right to vote for the government that controls their lives “unprovoked” is absurd. When Ethiopians threw rocks in Tel Aviv, Rivlin didn’t call their actions “unprovoked.” To the contrary, he condemned the violence while chastising his own government for not addressing the grievances underlying it. Yet the rioters in Tel Aviv enjoy Israeli citizenship, due process of law, the right to vote and the right to travel freely. They have, in other words, been far less provoked than the Palestinian rock throwers whose plight elicits no sympathy from the Israeli government at all.
	Another objection might be that the African-American rioters in Baltimore weren’t trying to destroy the United States, nor were the Ethiopian rioters in Tel Aviv trying to destroy Israel. Hamas, by contrast, seeks to eliminate Israel as a Jewish state. The difference, in other words, isn’t the type of violence used; it’s the outcome sought. But this misses the point too. First, not all Palestinian violence is aimed at eliminating Israel. Yes, Hamas doesn’t recognize Israel’s right to exist. But Marwan Barghouti, a key orchestrator of the second intifada, is on record calling for “a Palestinian state, whose capital is East Jerusalem, and which coexists in peace with Israel.” http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/05/marwan-barghouti-fatah-palestine.html
 More fundamentally, the fact that people use violence in service of an immoral political agenda still doesn’t delegitimize the grievances underlying it. Malik Zulu Shabazz, one of the organizers of the protests that turned violent in Baltimore, has a history of blatant anti-Semitism. But that doesn’t make police brutality in Baltimore any less unjust. Hamas is even more anti-Semitic than Shabazz. But that doesn’t make it any less unjust that Israel makes leaving Gaza almost impossible, even for relatives seeking to attend a funeral or wedding. 
	After the riots of the summer of 1967, Martin Luther King quoted the French novelist Victor Hugo as saying, “If a soul is left in the darkness, sins will be committed. The guilty one is not he who commits the sin, but he who causes the darkness.” Determining who causes the darkness, of course, is not simple. In Gaza, Israel creates darkness by denying ordinary Palestinians the right to leave and Hamas creates darkness by spreading its hateful ideology. But King’s point was that when people respond to injustice in violent, even vile, ways, people in power must address not only the violence, but the injustice as well. When African Americans or Ethiopian Israelis perpetrate violence, that’s not a particularly controversial point. But when it comes to Palestinians, Israeli leaders and their American allies apply a very different standard: Unless Palestinians emulate Ghandi, they have no legitimate grievances at all.

<title>Stop whining. Long live Israel's new and honest government</title>
<date>Sun May 10 02:33:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
The 34th government will deserve Israel; Israel will deserve the 34th government. This is an authentic and representative government, the true manifestation of the spirit of the times and the deepest feelings of most Israelis. It will be a true government, without pretense, without makeup and without self-justification. What we’ll see is what we’ll get. Welcome to the fourth Benjamin Netanyahu government.
They won’t talk haughtily and they won’t spout hollow slogans. Not about peace and not about human rights; not about two states and not about negotiations; not about international law, justice or equality. The truth will be thrust in the faces of Israelis and the world. And the truth is this: The two-state solution is dead (it was never born), the Palestinian state will not arise, international law does not apply to Israel, the occupation will continue to crawl quickly toward annexation, annexation will continue to crawl quickly toward an apartheid state; “Jewish” supersedes “democratic,” nationalism and racism will get the government stamp of approval, but they’re already here and have been for a long time.
Neither Netanyahu, nor Habayit Hayehudi’s chairman MK Naftali Bennett nor that party’s faction members MK Ayelet Shaked and MK Eli Ben-Dahan, started this whole thing. They only expedited things. And there should be no shock or outrage, no bewailing the bitterness of fate. This government is a government of continuation, not a government of change.
True, some of its members are more extreme than their predecessors, but that is mainly about rhetorical differences. Even the most inflammatory appointment, of Shaked as justice minister, which reverberated throughout the world over the weekend, is less revolutionary than it seems. Shaked is blunt and violent, whereas Zionist Union MK Tzipi Livni, her predecessor, was delicate and proper. But Justice Minister Shaked will not have to work hard to break open cracks in our democracy; they opened a long time ago.
The best test of the nature of the regime in Israel is the test of the occupation and the war crimes: the foundations of apartheid are already deep and the war crimes remain uninvestigated. From her office in the heart of occupied Jerusalem, Livni has not made Israel more just in that respect. True, Shaked’s ideas are more nationalistic and her understanding of the essence of democracy is nil. True, many in the world were shocked that a person who identified with one of the most violent articles ever written here against the Palestinian people (by Uri Elitzur), was appointed minister of Israeli justice. But there’s no place for such sanctimoniousness. Elitzur expressed what many people are thinking.
The appointment of another racist, Eli Ben-Dahan, as deputy defense minister, responsible for the Civil Administration, should not be earth-shattering either. True, Ben-Dahan said that “the Palestinians are animals, they are not human” – but don’t these statements reflect the true attitude of many Israelis? Ben-Dahan will speak for them. That is how Israel has been treating the Palestinians for almost 50 years; Ben-Dahan is only saying things overtly. Now he will be responsible for the Civil Administration and the whole system of “humanitarian gestures” will be torn up. Ben-Dahan is the right man in the right place at the right time. An excellent appointment.
A person who proudly says “I killed masses of Arabs” and calls them “shrapnel in the buttocks” will be education minister – and who in Israel doesn’t think that? The general of Operation Cast Lead, with its crimes, the man who contravened building restrictions, Yoav Galant, will be construction minister. Is that not a fine appointment? MK Uri Maklev of United Torah Judaism is to head the Knesset Science Committee? Does that not correctly reflect the attitude of some Israelis to science?
Stop whining. Maybe Israel’s shadow government should be more enlightened, but not its real government. It is what the Israelis chose, it reflects their true stands. And so, long live the new government.

<title>Just say no to the censorship of culture in Israel</title>
<date>Wed May 20 06:00:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
When it was announced that Miri Regev was to be the culture and sports minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s fourth government, some people made jibes about her suitability for the position, based on her reputation as a loud and inflammatory politician who sees the world in clear terms of good and pure (us) and evil and impure (the entire world, including groups in Israel that don’t think “as we do.”)
In her remarks immediately before taking office, Regev reinforced her image as someone with a simplistic view of reality who lacks a comprehension of basic concepts in the areas for which she is responsible.
Regev praised Israeli society as a “large variety of subcultures, colors, sounds and styles that together create the unique Israeli experience that is our glue, which unites and strengthens us.” In the name of pluralism, Regev promised that during her term in office, culture would come to “all parts of Israel,” including “Judea and Samaria.” But “pluralism” means, first and foremost, the ability to include — and even encourage – sounds, styles and above all “opinions” — which are absent from the variety noted by Regev —– that deviate from the “glue” and challenge the cluster of “us.”
The new minister went on to say that “in the name of that pluralism I won’t lend a hand to undermining the image of the State of Israel, Israel Defense Forces soldiers or the state’s heritage as a Jewish and democratic state.” The image of the State of Israel, IDF soldiers or the state’s heritage as a Jewish and democratic state are damaged every day — not by state-sponsored cultural institutions that sometimes present controversial plays, but by the policies of the Israeli government, the reality of occupation that forces those soldiers to deal with difficult moral challenges and creates de facto apartheid, the religious bureaucracy that controls civil society, corruption that has become the norm and the ultranationalist and racist trends in Israeli society itself. If anything, the liberal local culture is a successful ambassador for the state.
The value of cultural activity is measured by its willingness to examine and to shatter images, both genuine and fasle, out of freedom of thought and of expression. That is how culture differs from propaganda, which is also under Regev’s authority.
Upon taking office, Regev said, “if it is necessary to censor, I will censor.” A culture minister who believes “it is necessary to censor” and is willing to do so is a fearful thing to contemplate, and the worry is that she could do great damage to her domain.

<title>Segregated buses are only the tip of the occupation's iceberg</title>
<date>Wed May 20 00:15:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
The fact that a plan to segregate Jews and Palestinians on buses in the territories has now been frozen admittedly brings a sigh of relief. But it’s impossible to conclude from this that Israeli policies in the territories are free of moral shame and disgrace.
This impression is strengthened by what Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon, who proposed the plan, said on Wednesday: that he has no intention of canceling it. Ya’alon’s claim that the plan is meant to serve security needs is unconvincing. That’s because it was drafted first and foremost to appease the settlers, who wanted not to have to share buses with Palestinians.
Segregation on buses has great symbolic power: It recalls the trauma of racism against blacks in the United States and South Africa. Therefore, removing it from the agenda was important to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, because he didn’t want to cause a global outcry.
A move so blatantly racist would have sparked harsh criticism of Israel’s policy of occupation, and the world would have understood this decision in the only way it could be understood – that Israel had decided to institute an apartheid regime in the territories.
But despite the fact that this insane decision has been iced, it’s clear that segregated buses are just the tip of the iceberg. Beneath this visible tip lies an established policy of separation, anchored in the very foundations of Israel’s rule over the territories. This rule stipulates freedom of movement for Jews but restrictions for Palestinians; permits for houses only in specific communities, rather than an egalitarian permit system based on just and fair criteria; eligibility for social benefits and welfare services for one side only; dispossession of the other side from its lands; and of course, different legal systems for people who live in the same territory, including different court systems, different punishments and more.
Segregated buses attract attention that the daily practices of the occupation don’t manage to attract. For instance, the dispossession of Palestinians from the village of Sussia in the South Hebron Hills, which was recently approved by the High Court of Justice, hasn’t sparked an outcry similar to that sparked by the bus plan, even though it is tainted with the same injustice.
Thanks to the ostensibly temporary nature of the occupation, the international community assists the Israeli segregation regime by averting its eyes. Such injustices would not be viewed with understanding if they were directed at Jews anywhere in the world. Moreover, the expansion of the settlements and the strength of their supporters in recent governments prove that the occupation is far from ending. Therefore, it must be treated as a permanent intrusion.
And the defense minister’s dangerous plans must be rejected immediately.

Liberal Zionism has been voted out
In response to “Government on a flight to nowhere” by Ari Shavit and “Herzog is no leader” by Gideon Levy (Opinion, May 21).
Ari Shavit wrote about the disaster that befell Zionism with the swearing in of the worst government in our history, which features the most right-wing ministers ever. On the same day, Gideon Levy wrote about the weakest opposition ever, led by a man with no leadership ability. Shavit laments Zionism and Levy laments democracy and the hope for peace. They’re both right.
Despite this, they should make their claims to Benjamin Netanyahu or Isaac Herzog. The latter was elected by his party members, and as long as he doesn’t exhibit the kind of failure that would warrant resignation (see the Carmel forest fire), his continuing to serve in his post is a party matter. On the other hand, Netanyahu was chosen by the people. His policy, and his government’s policy, faithfully reflect the will of the public. For a few of us, this choice constitutes the extinction of the Zionist idea, but it is the right of the people to choose as they see fit.
It could be that the idea of liberal Zionism, championed by a good many since the days of Ahad Ha’am, is nothing more than an illusion, and like Antony Lerman wrote in the New York Times last year, perhaps Zionism today is xenophobia and extremist nationalism, achieving its goals by colonization and racism. If that is truly the will of the people in Zion, they have the right to carry out that policy. U.S. Congress has been bought on this issue by American Jewish money, and Europe is indifferent. When the final bill comes, we will have no one but ourselves to present our claims to.
The Israeli left will continue its impossible struggle, and not only to be able to say “we had no part in this.” I would be very happy to be proven wrong.

This is not apartheid 
In response to “Apartheid is about more than buses” (Opinion, Aeyal Gross, May 26).
The issue of Palestinians traveling on separate buses has nothing to do with apartheid and everything to do with security. Do I really want to travel on the same bus as a potential murderer? The number of attacks by Arabs on Jews by ramming them with their cars is on the increase, so why should we put ourselves in danger by traveling on the same buses with them?
Come to think of it, why don’t we put up a wall separating us from them, they stay on their side we stay on our side. Oh, we did that. Why don’t we extend the idea and make it permanent? It’s called the two-state solution.

Outrage over Belgian academics’ boycott call
Collectif Dialogue & Partage, a Belgian organization that for years has been fighting for a true dialogue between Jews and Muslims as well as between Israelis and Palestinians, is absolutely outraged by the petition of Belgian academics in favor of a boycott of Israeli universities and artists. Boycott as a weapon was used in the 1930s against Jews by the Nazis, then (and that time rightly) against South Africa during apartheid and now against Israel. Boycott has never been imposed on Vladimir Putin’s Russia after the invasion of Crimea nor against China, which simply absorbed Tibet decades ago, nor against any of the bloody dictatorships all over the world. Boycott is used against people not for what they do, but for what they are. One of the most shocking aspects of this boycott is that it targets institutions where you find the largest number of people who fight for peace.

<title>Europe must  not back down from labeling West Bank settlement products</title>
<date>Tue Jun 09 01:21:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
The most important statement about the European Union’s potential decision to label settlement products was actually made by Dani Dayan, a former leader of the Yesha Council of settlements who still works to promote the settlement enterprise in the occupied territories. In a conversation with Nir Baram, Dayan related that a U.S. State Department official once told him, “For years we perceived you as agents of Israeli government policy, but suddenly we realized that you are the autonomous one and the Israeli government is the agent of your policy.”
Indeed, the settlement enterprise has succeeded in taking over Israeli politics. Dayan also explained why he isn’t worried about an EU boycott on settlement products: It “won’t make much difference – because the settlement enterprise is not based on industrial zones, but on the number of inhabitants. And that number is rising all the time. Bear in mind: when all is said and done, that is the only consistent trend.”
Anyone who thinks the settlement enterprise is illegitimate and causing Israel to lose its own legitimacy must be pleased that Israel was compelled to accept a committee under the auspices of FIFA (the world soccer federation), which, among other things, will discuss the question of whether soccer teams from the settlements can legitimately play in Israeli leagues.
The EU’s plan to publish guidelines for labeling settlement products should also be viewed favorably. Any international move that makes it clear to Israel that this “consistent trend” of growth in the number of settlers is destructive to Israel itself bolsters the chance that, someday, Israel will also have a government that understands this.
The EU must not back down. It has considerable power, because it helps finance the Palestinian Authority through its donations. And the time may soon come when it has to decide whether this financing effectively enables Israel’s diplomatic rejectionism.
It’s convenient for the right to claim that the pressure to boycott Israel stems from anti-Semitism rather than opposition to its insistence on continuing the settlement enterprise and its refusal to make progress, in good faith, on an agreement with the Palestinians. But this is a fundamentally false claim that is meant to mobilize Israelis to defend the settlements. It’s true that one goal of the BDS movement is to return the Palestinian refugees to Israel. But it’s also clear that this isn’t the goal of serious players worldwide that are beginning to lose patience with the Israeli delusion: on the one hand, its desire to belong to the world’s advanced democracies; on the other, its insistence on keeping the Palestinians under an apartheid regime.
The response by opposition leaders was especially disappointing. Instead of claiming there’s no left and right when it comes to boycotts, divestment and sanctions, opposition leaders Isaac Herzog, Tzipi Livni and Yair Lapid should have explained to the public that the prime minister’s policy, throughout his years in office, is what has turned many people worldwide against Israel, and that this policy is leading Israel itself to disaster.

<title>Israeli justice minister's goal: Weakening democracy</title>
<date>Thu Aug 06 01:01:30 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked plans to reexamine the possibility of splitting the attorney general’s role into two: a general counsel whose job is solely to act as chief legal adviser to the government; and head of the public prosecution system.
Shaked’s intentions are cause for concern. Her idea isn’t new. It has been raised in recent years by Daniel Friedman and Yaakov Neeman, two justice ministers whose terms were marked by their efforts to undermine the most vital element of democracy – the separation of powers – and to weaken the judicial authority and rule of law.
Splitting the attorney general’s post is clearly a move to damage the rule of law. The attorney general’s combined duties today ensure comprehensive protection for the rule of law, both because the government’s actions are subject to the law and because steps are taken against those who break it. If the post is split and the attorney general decides, for example, that some government act isn’t legal, while whoever heads the prosecution agrees to defend that act in court, the advisory capacity to the government will in fact be obliterated.
The High Court of Justice highlighted just how important the attorney general’s post is in a detailed ruling laying the foundations of Israeli democracy: “The attorney general’s opinion on a legal matter reflects, for the government, the existing, current legal situation,” it stated, adding, “The government and its authorities’ position regarding the existing law is determined by the attorney general.”
The court made clear that the attorney general and his representatives are not “advisers” in the standard sense of the word, and that “their opinion is binding to the government.”
The Shamgar Commission, which looked into the attorney general’s position following the 1997 Roni Bar-On/Hebron affair, also examined splitting the attorney general’s duties. Retired Justice Meir Shamgar said at the time, “Splitting the duties will weaken both of the position’s divisions and generate a worse reality than the one we know.”
The justice minister’s intention to consider weakening the attorney general’s position – and, in reality, weakening the one whose job is to protect the rule of law – must also be seen as part of the intention of the political wing the minister represents to weaken Israeli democracy in general.
One would have thought the ideological differences between right and left regarding state affairs could be debated and determined with both sides strictly preserving democratic principles. This is how things were when the right wing was headed by Menachem Begin. But things have changed. Maintaining the status quo of occupation and apartheid, and the refusal to advance a peace agreement leading to a Palestinian state, are creating a blatantly undemocratic situation in the territories occupied and controlled by Israel.
In these circumstances, a strong attorney general who insists that the government act legally will become a hindrance.

<title>Letters to the Editor: Come home, Sayed </title>

<content>
Come home, Sayed
I tried, I really tried, to find a way of contacting you in person, but I didn’t manage to, so I hope you read this.
I’m so sorry you decided to give up, or so it seems. Left behind are me and tens of thousands of readers who took so much pride in and gained so much hope from your columns, waiting each week to read your/our thoughts on the life of every Arab in this country.
All of a sudden you decided to leave. I don’t wish to interfere in your private decisions, but Sayed – you’re no longer a private citizen. You’re a well-liked public figure, an author and screenwriter and, yes, a source of national pride. For me and many others like me you were and are a kind of power and strength of the better kind, eloquent as only you can be. You caused me and my friends to walk around with our heads held high.
You left. Since then I’ve reflected on whether maybe this isn’t the right place for me and my family as well. But for now I’m staying, since there is no better place to raise children than in one’s homeland. But I’m a bit angry with you, like a brother I found who then abandoned me. I think as you do but I don’t have the talent you have to express what I feel. I found my dreams in your writing. When you stopped believing it would be good here, I started having doubts as well.
You were never afraid of writing what you thought and felt, but your battles here aren’t over yet. You were the one who blazed the trail, and every week I’m the first to read your columns from America. How I pray that you write me from here, from your home.
Let’s meet at Mohammed’s barber shop. I don’t need a haircut and don’t walk around in shorts, but for you I’m willing to do that, and more. Just come back.

If this is apartheid ...
In response to “Why Israel is an apartheid state” (Opinion, Roy Isacowitz, September 6.)
In his counter to Benjamin Pogrund’s article, Roy Isacowitz points out that Israeli actions over the years may fit with definitions of apartheid according to a UN statute. The rest is not, as he claims, “just semantics.” Like Israel, many countries in western Europe, Asia and the Americas may also fall under the apartheid statutes when they committed and continue to commit racially inspired “inhumane acts“ against refugees trying to find safer havens in their countries. Moreover, to claim that Israeli governments undertake “systematic oppression and domination of other racial groups“ in order to “maintain their regime” is apparent nonsense, given the comparatively benign state of affairs between Israel’s Jews and the other racial groups (e.g. Palestinian Arabs, Druze or Circassians) within the Green Line.
The fact that Palestinian opposition to the state has been largely violent, both before and ever since the UN partition resolution was approved in 1948, also has some bearing on Israel’s repressive counter-actions. Isacowitz’s hysterical description of Israel’s leadership as “a fanatical cult bent on ultimate glory or suicide” gives his formal blessing to the many Arab nations and Iran, which are still actively trying to remove the legitimacy of the state, rather than encourage a negotiated settlement.
Finally it is his kind of biased outbursts that unfortunately drive the saner elements in the Israeli electorate away from voting for left-wing parties that might conceivably lead us out of the current mess. Less extreme self-flagellation, more reasoned arguments and reasonable actions are the only way forward.

<title>Netanyahu's apartheid vision for Israel's future</title>
<date>Thu Oct 29 06:39:29 IST 2015</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented his current political vision to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee this week. While saying that that he does not want a binational state, Netanyahu stressed that Israel “must control the entire area for the foreseeable future.” He explained that he was prepared to divide the land but “the other side is unwilling,” and that the Middle East is subject to Islamic religious influences that preclude any possibility for peace. 
On the face of it, this position does not seem extremist. It’s accepted by most Israeli Jews, according to multiple surveys that have been conducted over the last 15 years, ever since the Camp David summit. Most people support the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, but believe that it is not practical since there is “no partner” on the other side. The same majority, including Netanyahu, opposes the notion of a binational state with equal rights for all its citizens, Jews and Palestinians alike.
Netanyahu has cleaved to this line for his entire tenure: Verbal consent to dividing the land – which distinguishes him from the extreme right and from settler leaders – while in practice adopting policies that thwart the realization of such partitioning. He has consistently refused to talk about future borders with the Palestinians, demanding that they recognize Israel as “a Jewish state,” developing and expanding settlements across the West Bank and presenting Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas as an enemy and instigator to violence. 
In the real world, outside the realm of speechmaking, Netanyahu is only ready to hold empty and aimless talks with the Palestinians, or to discuss “small steps to reduce tension,” without relinquishing any control on the ground. 
His words this week acknowledged Israel’s total domination over the territories, discarding the dual pretense of a “temporary war-like situation,” which the state has regularly presented to the High Court of Justice for decades, and the pretense of a Palestinian Authority supposedly enjoying autonomy in managing Palestinian affairs, as Israel likes to present things.
Netanyahu’s opposition to a binational state leads to a clear conclusion: As long as “Israel’s control of the area” continues, millions of Palestinians in the territories will remain in the inferior status of subjects devoid of civil rights. Their settler neighbors, meanwhile, enjoy such rights unhampered. 
The regime described in Netanyahu’s vision has a name – it’s called apartheid. There is no other term for two populations living in the same area, one with political rights and the other under perennial military occupation. No security argument or warnings about the effects of Islam can whitewash the implications of this vision. Netanyahu’s words should shock anyone who is concerned about the justice of Israel’s cause and the country’s future. Concerned people should unite and form a national salvation front that will work to replace this government.

<title>Bill Maher: Islamophobe or one of the last true liberals?</title>
<date>Thu Nov 26 14:00:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
Bill Maher finished the 13th season of his HBO show ‘Real Time’ with a bang this past weekend. Currently one of the most controversial, if not most hated, men in America, Maher is often referred to as arrogant, smug and profane - and that's by people who like his show. A dyed-in-the-wool liberal, who gave Obama $1 million in 2012 and works to flip Republican-held Congressional seats to the benefit of Democrat contenders, Maher in the past year has become a target of liberal anger, who have often called him xenophobic, a pseudo-intellectual and a bigot.
Maher is no stranger to controversy. His first late night comedy show, 'Politically Incorrect', was cancelled in 2002 after he disagreed with President George W. Bush’s assertion that the 9/11 hijackers were “cowards.” He came back to the airwaves unshackled a year later with 'Real Time' on HBO, attracting A-list celebrities and politicians (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been a regular guest) to his weekly panel where he discusses and satirizes the news to a live studio audience and over a million cable viewers.
In this final episode, Maher focused his commentary and comedy on ISIS, Islam and the Syrian refugee controversy.  Maher discussed a new opinion poll showing a majority of Americans believe the values of Syrian refugees seeking asylum are at odds with their own, noted, ‘“If you are in this religion, you probably do have values that are at odds. This is what liberals do not want to recognize. You may be from a country—as there are many, many Muslim countries—that either have Sharia law or want Sharia law. Those values are not our values.” (His comments are backed up by research from the Pew Research Center whose 2013 poll found that overwhelming percentages of Muslims in many countries want Islamic law (sharia) to be the official law of the land where they live).
This line of reasoning has been grabbing Maher headlines and ratings since October 2014, when, with author Sam Harris (the 'New Atheism' advocate) at his side, he tussled live on air with Hollywood star Ben Affleck.
During the exchange Harris asserted that Islam is “the motherlode of bad ideas,” while Maher exclaimed that Islam is the only religion that acts like the mafia, “that will f--king kill you if you say the wrong thing, draw the wrong picture, or write the wrong book.” To which, Affleck, getting visibly upset, shot back, denouncing Maher’s take as “gross” and ”racist.’” "It's like saying, 'you shifty Jew!'" he declared.

Maher’s critics accuse him of simplistic generalizations that amount to racism. On CNN, Reza Aslan slammed Maher, saying that on religion he is not very “sophisticated in the way he thinks,” noting that Maher makes broad generalizations about the planet’s 1.6 billion Muslims based on the acts of a few. “We're using two or three examples to justify a generalization. That's actually the definition of bigotry."
For his part, Maher responds to these critics, many of whom sit across from him during his show, with the simple refutation that: “I’m not demonizing, I’m just reporting! We’re saying the ideas need to be changed.” In his own defense Maher attempts to separate individual Muslims from the practices of Islam; he time and again asserts he is not talking about all Muslims, but is criticizing instead the ideas within Islam that go against ‘universal liberal values' – standing up for the rights of women, gays, apostates, democracy, and his favorite - freedom of speech. 
A voice like Maher’s has been seen on the American left before in the face of an existential threat. In 1949, historian Arthur Schlesinger coined the term ‘doughfaced progressives’ to label those on the left that he saw as soft on emerging communist totalitarianism, either because they felt sympathetic to its underlying ideology or because they believed that progressivism required the tolerance of otherness. Schlesinger dubbed these doughfaced progressives “democratic men who support totalitarian principles.” Schlesinger, the proto-Maher, fought within the American left at the beginning of the Cold War for liberals to address Soviet communism for what it was – illiberal. 
In the aftermath of the Paris terror attacks, John Kerry stirred controversy that fed straight into Maher’s argument about liberal America’s blind spots, or lack of courage. Kerry was quoted as saying that it was possible to find “legitimacy” or “a rationale” behind the January 2015 attacks on Charlie Hebdo (which openly satirized the prophet Mohammed) as opposed to the most recent attacks in Paris which were in Kerry's words “absolutely indiscriminate.”
The night of the Paris attacks, Maher happened to be taping live and in an interview with Muslim feminist author Asra Nomani. They both urged liberals in America to wake up. “How could liberals, who stood for black people getting to go to college in the 60’s and then when I was in college they were protesting apartheid in South Africa… How can they not stand up against sharia law, which is the law in so many Muslim countries, which is a law of oppression?”
Exactly where Maher falls in the divide between bigot and truly enlightened, it's hard to say. Bill Maher, as a devout atheist, slams all religions. Having been raised Catholic, despite having a Jewish mother, Maher left his faith at a young age and has since been poking religion in the eye, exposing its hypocrisies and every week, to his HBO audience, has been calling out religious believers for holding 'fairy tales' above science and fact.
Is Bill Maher bigoted against Islam? I don’t think so. He takes broad aim at Islam as an ideology (which certainly does leave him open to intellectual criticism), and just like someone who has factual, value-based disagreements with capitalism or communism or any other ideology that governs people’s way of life, it is perfectly legitimate to criticize and make a case for why an ideology contains bad, damaging ideas.  (When it comes to Mormonism however, a faith he refuses even to acknowledge as a religion and likes to simply call “stupid,” Maher might be a bit of a bigot, but that’s another story.)
Maher has undoubtedly made an enemy of the PC left on this issue; Steven Colbert and Maher got into a heated exchange on Colbert's late-night show last week, after Colbert berated Maher for his willingness to leave no joke untouched. "Bill, they say at a dinner party you should never talk about sex, politics or religion. Have you ever been invited to a dinner party in your life?" To which, Maher retorted, "I probably wouldn't be invited to your dinner party." The exchange deteriorated quickly from there with Colbert concluding, “My religion teaches me humility in face of this kind of attack,” before switching to ‘safer’ topics.
At the end of last year, Maher was disinvited from giving the commencement address at UC Berkeley after 6,000 students signed a petition to that effect.  Maher eventually gave the address amid protests, in which he began by saying, "C'mon, it's Berkeley. I think I can speak freely here. I mean, I hope I can."
The same day that Maher finished his season, Pew published a survey showing that 40% of Millennials agree with censoring speech offensive to minorities, an all-too real exemplar of the PC culture inundating America that Maher has so long fought against. It's just too bad Maher didn't have one more episode left to make a joke, or ten, about that finding.

<title>Musicians: Boycotting Israel fans the flames of conflict</title>
<date>Thu Nov 26 14:45:48 IST 2015</date>
<content>
On November 17th, Vice published a piece by Brian Eno and Ohal Grietzer calling for musicians to boycott Israel "until Palestinians are free." The piece is the latest attempt by the boycott divestment sanctions movement, also known as BDS, to gain legitimacy by preying on musicians’/artists’ natural affinity for those perceived as victimized, and appealing to a call for “human rights” for the Palestinians.
While we have sympathy for all of those that are downtrodden, unfortunately, these musicians and artists have fallen prey to a narrative that is filled with untruths and distortions and that has its basis in the BDS movement's lack of support of ‘two states for two peoples’. Indeed, the boycott movement's founder and other central BDS leaders have said "they oppose a Jewish State in any of part of Palestine," and their definition of Palestine includes all of Israel.
Let's address some of the familiar accusations and examine why they don't hold water.
The first accusation is that Israel is an "apartheid" state. Anyone who has been to Israel knows that it is a western style democracy (indeed the only one in the region) and by definition cannot be considered "apartheid." Arabs make up approximately 20 percent of the citizens living within Israel and have always had the right to vote, and the right to a free press. Further, Arab Israelis serve in Israel's parliament (the Knesset) and serve in Israel's court system. Indeed one of the judges who convicted former Israeli President Katsav was George Karra, an Arab Israeli. 
Just as America grapples with Ferguson and charges of racial discrimination, there may be instances of injustice to Arabs that occur in Israel. However to try to brand Israel as an “apartheid” state is simply untrue and libelous. It is also important to note that Arabs living in the West Bank are governed by the Palestinian Authority, while Arabs living in Gaza are governed by Hamas.
Further inflammatory language used by Eno includes charges that the Palestinians are the areas only "indigenous people" and have been "ethnically cleansed."  It doesn't require much study of history to know the Jews have a long history of living in Israel, including having Jewish populations not just in Jerusalem, but in many cities claimed by the Palestinians (Hebron, Jaffa, and others). The term “ethnically cleansed” is patently false and inflammatory.
Perhaps most troubling is the timing of this piece and of the call for boycotting Israel when terrorism is striking at western democracies around the world.
Why is it acceptable to only blame one side in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and fail to question why Palestinians have rejected various peace offers dating from 1948 to the more recent offer of former Prime Minister Olmert? Why is it acceptable for Palestinians and their leadership to take no responsibility for inciting terrorist attacks? Why are they not holding their own governments responsible for lack of elections, and supporting a government in Gaza whose charter calls for the destruction of the State of Israel?  This gives a "free pass" to behavior that those who support democratic values should question.
We believe that music and the arts can indeed build bridges and should not be used as a political weapon if conditions don't justify. That's why artists, including Alicia Keyes, Jon Bon Jovi, the Rolling Stones, Rihanna, Enrique Iglesias, Justin Timberlake, Justin Bieber, and many others continue to perform in Israel for audiences that can include Israeli Arabs, Christians, Muslims and Jews. Over 30,000 people have signed Creative Community for Peace's Anti-Boycott Petition.
While we lament the loss of all innocent life, when artists function as a bullhorn for spreading untruths and misinformation they only fan the flames of conflict rather than seek to use the power of music and culture to unite.
David Renzer is chairman of the Spirit Music Group. Steve Schnur is the Worldwide Executive and President of Electronic Arts Music Group. Both are co-founders of the Creative Community for Peace.

<title>Fiddling with flags while Israel burns</title>
<date>Wed Dec 16 20:03:08 IST 2015</date>
<content>
Israel’s politicians are, once again, up in arms.
What got them all riled up this time? No, it’s not the wave of terror that has so far killed 22 Israelis and injured hundreds.
Nor is it the entrenched poverty that continues to cripple Israeli society, or the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has undermined every democratic institution and principle in his determination to drive through a controversial deal for Israel's natural gas.
It isn't even Israel’s diminishing democracy, which is being chipped at by the very politicians now expressing anger. They’re fine with that, thank you very much.
No, Israel’s right-wing and centrist politicians have much bigger things to worry about. Did you hear, for instance, that Palestinian head negotiator Saeb Erekat spoke at the Haaretz conference in New York without an Israeli flag behind him?
Erekat, who has played a central role in peace negotiations with Israel since the early 1990s and was a major force behind the Oslo Accords, also gave a fascinating, bitter speech, in which he pleaded with Israel “not to give up” on a two-state solution in favor of the apartheid regime (“one state, two systems”) that is fast becoming reality on the ground. Visibly upset, he spoke about his nephew, who was shot and killed in a West Bank checkpoint after shooting and wounding two Israelis earlier this month.
Overall, it was a vitriolic speech, one that was clearly emotional for Erekat, who choked up when discussing his nephew and sarcastically “congratulated” Netanyahu for “destroying a culture of negotiations, a culture of dialogue, a culture of peace.”
But it wasn’t the substance of what Erekat said that caused a scandal in Israel. it was that he refused to say it underneath an Israeli flag.
Here's looking at you, Donald
In an improbably-still-ongoing scandal that could be called “flag-gate”, Haaretz was slammed for acquiescing to Erekat’s request to remove the Israeli flag that had been hanging minutes earlier, as Israeli President Reuven Rivlin made his own speech.
Rivlin himself was already the subject of controversy for his agreement to participate in a conference co-hosted by Haaretz and New Israel Fund, two of the most maligned organizations in Israel today, that also included the left-wing NGO Breaking the Silence (the new favorite punching bag of the Israeli right).
The umbrage wasn't confined to the far right. “The far left has finally lost all sense of national pride,” claimed former Finance Minister Yair Lapid, chairman of the centrist Yesh Atid party, on his Facebook page. Likud Minister Ze'ev Elkin, who is on the far right, argued that Erekat’s request to remove the Israeli flag while he spoke “showed once again how little Palestinians are willing to seek a peace agreement.”
The pro-Bibi daily Israel Hayom devoted the majority of its cover page yesterday to "flag-gate", with an op-ed that stated “only the far Left would fold its own flag.”
Sadly, this is what has become of Israel’s democracy: With little actual content, all that’s left seems to be a pathetic, empty race to determine who’s the most Zionist.
The health of a democracy can be measured by the issues that rule its public debate. In Israel, a country in crisis that is currently dealing with deep-rooted problems, visionless politicians prefer to argue over flags than offer real solutions that might cost them their careers.
This is not a unique problem to Israel by any means (here’s looking at you, Donald Trump), but Israel has developed a unique obsession with trivial nonsense as a way to avoid a debate about the real issues. If it’s not the latest chapter in the saga of Sara Netanyahu then it’s Culture Minister Miri Regev declaring she doesn’t read Chekhov, or a Likud MK who said something nasty to another MK, or it might be a Swedish Foreign Minister who said something unflattering, or simply the prices of chocolate pudding in Berlin.
Israel, as a country, will soon need to make difficult choices about its identity, its values and its future. With the “peace process” dead and buried and over three million Palestinian still under its control, Israel will have to decide between its Jewishness and its democracy. With a society that is already among the most unequal in the OECD, it will have to change course, or risk instability.
But you wouldn’t know any of this if you listen to right-wing or centrist politicians. Theirs is a world where the most pressing issue Israeli voters have to decide every four years is who is best equipped to deal with unpatriotic flag placements.
Some might say Israel is a country heading fast toward a giant iceberg. Some (among them the author) will say it has already hit the iceberg, and is simply, deliriously oblivious. Regardless of how far along Israel is in its course of decline, though, it seems its current rulers have no idea how to turn it around, or even that it needs to be turned around. Otherwise, why would they be sitting casually on the deck of the Titanic, arguing about the placement of flags?

<title>Letters to the Editor: BDS, ultra-Orthodox Jews and French peace initiative</title>

BDS, Israel’s only salvation
In response to “Shutting down debate in Chicago” (Sharon Kleinbaum, Opinion, January 31).
I empathize with the things written by Rabbi Kleinbaum in the body of her article. I cannot in any way agree with her conclusion that Israeli and Palestinian activists can bring about change.
In 2002 many well-known retired senior officers, including generals, formed the Council for Peace and Security. Thousands of people signed their names in support of the group’s positions. The government ignored it.
In 2003-2005 Ami Ayalon, former head of Shin Bet, and Palestinian Professor Sari Nusseibeh tried to lead a grassroots movement for negotiations on the basis of their proposals. Some 254,000 Israelis and 161,000 Palestinians supported this effort. Our government did not.
The negation of these efforts, together with the government’s ignoring of the Saudi Peace Proposals of 2002 and 2009 have shown us that the only way to save Israel from the messianic wave sweeping the country is through economic, political and cultural coercion, i.e., BDS.
Just as sanctions against Russia and Iran were meant to bring about change, BDS is not meant to destroy Israel as the national explainer and his cronies continually tell us. As in the case with apartheid South Africa, it is meant to bring about change that will be for the good of all the peoples in the region.

This Diaspora Jew has had it
“I want to guarantee ... as prime minister of Israel, I will always ensure that all Jews can feel at home in Israel, Reform Jews, Conservative Jews, Orthodox Jews, all Jews. ... [Israel will] invest in strengthening Reform and Conservative communities within Israel.” – Prime Minister Netanyahu, October 2015.
As expected, Netanyahu’s position was condemned by Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox MKs and communities. In keeping with the Israeli government’s ever-increasing Orthodox leaning, Education Minister Bennett reassigned funds from Reform and Conservative “Jewish renewal” activities to Orthodox activities. MK Moshe Gafni, the ultra-Orthodox chairperson of the Knesset Finance Committee, promised to block allocation of any funding to expand the mixed-prayer space at the Western Wall. Without support from Habayit Hayehudi and United Torah Judaism, Netanyahu loses majority support in Knesset; so, to remain in power, once again Netanyahu must cave into the demands of Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox MKs.
And once again, we non-Orthodox Jews remain “non-Jews” in many important ways, sanctioned by the Israeli government.
I’m stunned that the Israeli government continues to expect support – financial and political – from us in the Diaspora, yet denies us equality in our supposed homeland. I cannot and will not support this government that denies my right to be who and what I am. I will continue to disavow the actions of this government that excludes me yet claims to act in my name.

French frame-up of Israel
What duplicity. France has already prejudged the outcome of its proposed conference on the Arab-Israeli conflict. It has predetermined that Israel would be at fault if an agreement is not reached, and France would recognize a Palestinian state.
What incentive do the Arabs have to reach an agreement with Israel? They can demand that all of Jerusalem be their capital, that 5 million Arabs be admitted into Israel and that Islam becomes the state religion of Israel.
They have nothing to lose. One way or another, France will recognize them, just as Iceland, Sweden and the Vatican have. It will further delegitimize Israel and support the Arab claim that Israel must be dismantled.
It is little wonder French Jews are leaving in record numbers. Fortunately, Israel and Quebec will welcome and protect them.

<title>Respecting Arab MKs is a must if Israel is to remain a democracy</title>
<date>Mon Feb 08 02:03:46 IST 2016</date>
<content>
It’s okay to object to the actions of Balad Knesset members Jamal Zahalka, Basel Ghattas and Haneen Zoabi, whose party is a partner in the Joint Arab List. It’s okay to oppose their meeting with the families of terrorists, to deem it unacceptable for them to observe a moment of silence in the terrorists’ memory and inappropriate to call them martyrs. But it’s not okay to join the ugly, aggressive persecution campaign against the MKs, which has no place in a democracy.
The Knesset has united against the three, nearly wall-to-wall. Representatives from every party but their own vied to be the sharpest-tongued against them. The right’s goal was transparent and dangerous: another attempt to delegitimize the Knesset’s Arab representatives as a step toward ostracism and perhaps even removing them from the legislature. This goal was aided, intentionally or not, by centrist and left-wing MKs who joined the unbridled assault. MKs from Zionist Union, Yesh Atid and even Meretz took part in the attack on Balad.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who never misses an opportunity for incitement against Arab Israelis, outdid them all by “instructing” the attorney general to examine what legal steps can be taken against the three MKs. He, together with the Knesset speaker, also filed a complaint against the MKs with the Knesset Ethics Committee, and Sunday Netanyahu said he would “promote legislation so that anyone who acts like this will not serve in the Knesset.” Nobody would imagine Netanyahu taking such steps against, say, a Jewish MK who claimed that the murder of the Palestinian family in Duma wasn’t terror, or against Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, who reportedly met with the family of one of the Jews arrested as suspects in that case.
The MKs of the Joint Arab List, the Knesset’s third biggest party, were elected to represent their voters. This community does not share the worldview, beliefs and opinions of Israel’s Jewish Zionist majority. If Israel purports to be a democracy and to reject accusations that it is becoming an apartheid state, it must respect these opinions, even when they are irritating or even painful to the Jewish majority. The Balad MKs said they met with the families in an effort to help them obtain the release of the bodies of their loved ones, months after they were killed. It’s their right and even their duty to do so.
Arab Israelis are members of the Palestinian people, sometimes even members of the same families, but in any case the same people, with the same history. This creates the fragile and delicate situation of having a conflict of loyalties between their people and their country.
The way to preserve democracy in Israel is to respect this complex situation and demonstrate maximum sensitivity toward it. Arab MKs are in any case already excluded from many areas, and pushing them into a corner would bode ill for Israel. If they are forced to boycott the Knesset, and their community to boycott the elections, Israel will cease to be a democracy.

<title>Talking about the zombie two-state solution: It's something to do</title>
<date>Fri Feb 19 06:54:29 IST 2016</date>
<content>
They said it was over. They said it was dead, a reminder of simpler times.
But as with '80s music, apparently some people are still trying to bring back the two-state solution - yes, the one Thomas Friedman eulogized just last week. This week, France officially proposed an international summit in Paris, bringing together Israeli and Palestinians, with European, American and Arab mediators, in order to end that pesky conflict thing once and for all. The aim, said the outgoing French Foreign Affairs Minister Laurent Fabius, is to “preserve and make happen the two-state solution.” And if the initiative fails, France warned, it would recognize a Palestinian state.
Israel, predictably, responded to the French initiative with perplexity. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the French initiative “puzzling,” explaining that the “threat” to recognize a Palestinian state ensures the talks will fail. (The Palestinian Authority, on the other hand, welcomed the initiative).
To be fair to Netanyahu, if taken at face value, the French proposal is puzzling. Israel is dealing with an unorganized wave of horizontal terrorism that seems more and more like an intifada, while Palestinians are reckoning with the realization that Israel will not grant them statehood, simply because it doesn't want to.
At this time (proposing an old-fashioned peace summit sounds hopelessly out-of-touch. Neither side is in any mood to compromise, or has the political ability to push for radical solutions, and even the would-be mediators seem to have lost interest. Europe is preoccupied with the constantly-escalating refugee crisis, the Arab states are dealing with ISIS and each other, and the U.S. is in an election year and has essentially relinquished the Israeli-Palestinian issue since its last effort to broker peace talks in 2014 collapsed.
The only one really interested in this summit seems to be Fabius, who during his almost four years as foreign affairs minister, has been very active on the Israeli-Palestinian front. Last year, he tried and failed to promote a resolution at the UN Security Council outlining terms for ending the conflict.
None of his efforts to move the Israel-Palestinian needle in a more positive direction bore fruit. His latest initiative is probably more of a last-ditch effort  before he leaves the ministry.
But he isn't alone:  The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, visited Israel-Palestine this week, ostensibly to promote a two-state solution that the Obama administration itself seems to have given up on.
The thing is, neither the French nor Power's initiative mean that anyone believes the two-state solution is still viable. Haaretz’s Barak Ravid suggested the conference is an idea that was designed to fail, a way for Fabius to leave behind a legacy by opening the door to alternatives on the Israeli-Palestinian issue, like recognizing a Palestinian state.
If that is true, then the proposed peace conference isn’t meant to be a revival of the peace process, but its funeral, and Netanyahu’s government (once again falling victim to its own myopia) has played into the hands of its ideological rivals by automatically rejecting it.
The insistent way in which the two-state concept refuses to die  and stay buried is rooted not in belief, but in the simple fact that the system is highly vested in it. There are dozens of think tanks, organizations and lobby groups dedicated to promoting a two-state solution. The American left supports a two-state solution, the European left supports a two-state solution, and the majority of the Israeli left, despite Labor leader Isaac Herzog’s strange plan to unilaterally disengage with the Palestinians, still believes there is no other way.
Yet with the PA on the verge of collapse and with recent Israeli policies skirting the thin line between South African apartheid (tossing Arab MKs out of the Knesset) and Loony Tunes cartoons  (like “We will surround all of the State of Israel with fences and barriers to defend ourselves against the wild beasts”), it’s difficult to imagine that many people honestly believe there’s hope for peace accord anytime soon.
The allure of the two-state solution is that it’s familiar, it’s relatively simple to understand, and there’s already an infrastructure supporting it. But the Jews and the Palestinians are already in an undeclared de-facto binational state, with one side living under military occupation (or, in the case of Gaza, the world’s largest prison), and the other free to enjoy (some of) the benefits of democracy.
The only way forward is equality, but achieving equality will require uneasy compromises by both parties, responsible leadership able to contain what is sure to be a tumultuous process, committed foreign allies with will and resources, and most importantly: a willingness to recognize that the current situation is simply untenable.
However, in lieu of all that, I guess talking about a two-state solution is also something to do.

<title>Dear Oscar star, say yes to that free Israel trip. Then do this.</title>
<date>Tue Feb 23 18:32:24 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Dear major Academy Award nominee or presenter,
By now you've doubtless gotten wind of that blue card in the swag bag. The trip to Israel, all expenses paid. By now, also, people will have given you all manner of reasons not to go.
Some, your agent maybe, may tell you not to go because it's dangerous — that there are Palestinian knife attacks against Israeli and other civilians every single day, sometimes several times a day.
They're right. But it's not a reason to turn down the trip.
Others, supporters of BDS, the movement to boycott, divest from, and sanction Israel, may tell you to stay away from here because this is a propaganda stunt by an Israeli government trying to whitewash away serious allegations of violations of human rights.
They're right, too. But that's not a reason to stay away from here either.
After all, they're asking you to boycott an entire country, and all the people in it, without even having seen it for yourself.
Come. Take the trip. See for yourself.
But before you do, I, as a card-carrying Israeli, have some unsolicited advice for you.
DISCLOSURE: Just so you know, before I was a card-carrying Israeli, or ever imagined I might be such a thing, I was a native of Studio City and an employee of Universal Studios (janitorial position, serial summer hire). At some point, I took a trip to Israel, and I found out that absolutely nothing I had read about the place, seen on the news, or been told, was anywhere near what it's really like here.
What I found out — and have learned anew, year by tumultuous, troubling, soul-battering year — is that Israel and the exceptional people who live there are nothing like you think they are. Whatever you think they are.
No other place in the world inspires the passion and the havoc, the loyalties and the lies that this one does. "Feeling alive" here is not an issue. You can't know anything about it from a distance. You need to see it, feel it under your feet and before your eyes, take in the air, in order to realize that something inexplicable happens to the people who come here.
So listen to all those people telling you not to make the trip. They have important points to make. Then go anyway.
You can be a force for making this a better place. You can help heal the deep wounds from which everyone who lives here suffers. It all depends on how you approach the trip. More about that in Section 4 below.
Before that, though, why in the world would you want to want to come to a place like this?
1. It's family.
Prepare to meet some of the best people you will ever get to know.
And yes, prepare to meet some of the worst as well.
This is a family. A sprawling, fiercely loving, profoundly flawed, astonishingly dysfunctional extended family.
It is, as well, a family related by blood and scripture, by land and the many cruelties of history, to the people who are our neighbors.
This, you will come to realize, is not really a country at all. And not only because it has no recognized borders or capital city. Or because there are those who, openly or covertly, wish it did not exist at all.
It's a family, and if you spend time wisely in this place, it will become part of yours.
Prepare to fall in love. With the place, and with many of its people. And prepare not to understand exactly what this love is.
Prepare, also, to be appalled.
War does terrible things to people, and the people of this country have been at war for every moment they have lived here. In many ways their spirit is beaten to rags. They have unimaginable reservoirs of raw grief and rage.
They have terrible leaders. They know it. But they have lost the belief that they can have better ones. They feel that they only have each other, and, judging by their leaders, they're right.
Under the circumstances, leaving them alone, isolating them, hasn't helped anyone over the decades, and in many ways makes what is unendurable for everyone here, even worse.
Prepare to meet people in power who are amateurish, fat-headed, cluelessly provincial, unintentionally — or not — insulting. Starting with the tourism minister.
2. This is your chance. Learn from them. Ask them a straightforward, three word question: "What's your plan?"
Don't let them jerk you around. There are millions of Palestinians living under Israeli rule in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. They are living there without basic human rights, without the right to vote, without rights of free speech, without true freedoms of religion, assembly, movement, or professional or academic opportunity.
If government people don't answer directly, if they blame the Palestinians or blame BDS or blame Iran or ISIS or President Obama, don't take it personally. Ask them again.
"What's your plan?"
Don't let them jerk you around. Don't let anyone suggest that this is not a military occupation. Take it from an objective observer, a former resident of Studio City: Anyone in the army who was ordered to occupy Palestinians — as I was, on and off for nearly 20 years — can tell you about the rights denied, the medical services delayed, the extremists on both sides making the impossible worse.
A further word of unsolicited guidance:
3. The equation is simple. Israel - Occupation = Democracy. Israel + Occupation = Apartheid.
Which way is Israel headed?
If you meet the leaders, applaud the proposal by Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon to present a new package of economic measures to benefit Palestinians. Then ask where, exactly, this proposal stands.
Applaud, as well, the government's proposal for the largest-ever plan to advance the economic development of Israel’s Arab population, which from Israel's founding has suffered from discrimination and second-class citizen status.
Then ask, where, exactly, this proposal stands.
4. Everything in Israel is either much better or much, much worse than it was intended to be. Nothing is what it's supposed to be.
There are great people, many of them, who are working to make the Israel they love a better place.
You need to be here to see them. Their work may be as quiet as the bakery down the street from my house, where the Palestinian Israeli family of bakers wears shirts in Arabic, Hebrew and English, reading "Arabs and Jews Refuse to be Enemies."
You need to be here to appreciate them.
There are schools which, in their quiet way, are making radical strides toward a future which both Jews and Arabs can live with, and well.
Ask to visit the Hand in Hand schools, where Palestinian and Jewish Israeli children study together.
Ask to meet people from the human rights, religious freedom, pro-democracy and social justice organizations sponsored by the New Israel Fund, like the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Rabbis for Human Rights, and Breaking the Silence.
Ask to meet people from Peace Now, working for transparency in Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza.
Ask to meet legislators working for a better Israel and human rights for all who live in the Holy Land, people like Ayman Odeh of the Joint List, Zehava Galon and Tamar Zandberg of Meretz, Merav Michaeli and Stav Shaffir of Labor / Zionist Union.
One more thing. Israelis may seem hard headed. But they're not stupid. They know they have bad leaders. They expect nothing from them, and they're right — they get nothing from them. Their leaders know how to stay in office — and that's it.
Come to Israel. Don't let extremists have the final say. Racism thrives on isolation and separation and fear. Just as occupation thrives on darkness.
Come to Israel. Shed light.

<title>Republican candidates love Israel. Too bad they don't make sense</title>
<date>Tue Mar 15 15:40:00 IST 2016</date>
<content>
At the (largely civil) Republican debate in Miami last week, the four candidates left standing gor into yet another argument about whose is bigger. This time, the argument didn’t revolve around hands or penis size, but around something just a little more substantive: their love of Israel.
Ted Cruz thought he had it in the bag when he vowed to “stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel.” Marco Rubio, though, had other plans, when he promised to “stand firmly on the side of Israel.” Donald Trump, though, took things up a notch when he promised to be “very, very pro-Israel,” before clearly winning the exchange by delivering a brutal coup de grâce: “I happen to have a son-in-law and a daughter that are Jewish, OK? And two grandchildren that are Jewish.”
It wasn’t the most troubling moment of the debate. (Trumps justifying the violence in his rallies by putting the blame on protesters easily takes the cake.) But it demonstrates how low the discourse on Israel has sunk, especially within the GOP.
Risk, rewards and ridiculous pander
Republican candidates love Israel. Honest to God, they do. They may not win a majority of Jewish voters (in 2012, some 69% of Jews voted for Obama; a recent Pew Center survey expects more of the same this election cycle), but they love to proclaim their unfettered love for the Jewish state. How do we know? Israel was mentioned 37 times during the Republican debate in Miami and 55 times during the one before that.
Uninhibited adoration for Israel plays well with the Republican electorate. According to a Gallup poll last year, 83% of Republicans side with Israel over the Palestinians, and it may come in especially handy as Florida Jews prepare to vote in the primary today. If you want to win the voters’ support, and more importantly, the financial backing of major donors like Sheldon Adelson and Paul Singer, you have to say nothing but positive things about Israel. Them's the rules of the game.
Played well, the rewards can be considerable. Previously during the campaign, Trump seemed to have been challenging the Republican orthodoxy by saying he’d be “neutral” between Israelis and Palestinians. In the last two weeks, though, Trump has spoken several times about his “tremendous love for Israel,” even dredging up his past as a “grand marshal of the Israeli Day Parade down 5th avenue” and his daughter Ivanka’s conversion to Orthodox Judaism.
Amazingly, this ridiculous pander seems to work. Trump is now going to headline the AIPAC conference together with Hillary Clinton. And two days ago, he seemed to have gotten a nod from Sheldon Adelson, when the front page of the newspaper Israel Hayom (which the Adelsons control) quoted former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani saying: “Trump isn’t afraid to say ‘Islamic Terror’.” 
Sadly, all this makes for very little substance, and what substance there is regarding Israel among Republican presidential hopefuls makes very little sense.
While Republican candidates have been pressing hard on the pro-Israel lever, their recipes for helping Israel essentially boil down to the tautology “we’ll support Israel by strongly supporting Israel.” Which is just fine and dandy, but really tells us very little about how these four candidates, if elected president, intend to help “America’s strongest ally” (copyright Ted Cruz) to tackle its myriad challenges.
A hair weak on specifics
Marco Rubio, for instance, has said several times that Israel “has no partner for peace” and that he “doesn’t see the conditions right now” for a two-state solution.” This is a fine reiteration of Benjamin Netanyahu’s favorite talking points, but it reveals little about what Rubio intends to do in the very plausible case that, for instance, the Palestinian Authority collapses. Will his promises to “fight efforts to delegitimize the Jewish state” help him assure Israel’s security when and if it effectively becomes an apartheid state?
And do would President Ted Cruz's promises to supply Israel with “everything it needs to defend itself” include yet-undeveloped technology that stops Palestinian 15-year-olds armed with screwdrivers and cutlery from being enraged at the prospect of spending the rest of their lives under military occupation? Will his promises to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem prevent the next war in Gaza?
President John Kasich might try to “stabilize the region by supporting the Israelis and making sure they have the weapons and the security that they need with our 100 percent backing.” He’s bound to find out that Israel is in fact a very smallplayer in the region, and arming it further won’t do much to bolster security in Syria or Iraq.
Which brings us to President Trump. Oh, President Trump. President Trump just might “negotiate a peace settlement” between Israel and Palestine. He is, after all, a “negotiator”. And his previous experience as an Israel Day Parader might be of some assistance.
Granted, the Democratic candidates have not fared much better when it comes to Israel. Hillary Clinton’s most significant statement about Israel during this election cycle was that as president she will “reaffirm the unbreakable bonds of friendship and unity between the two nations” and invite Benjamin Netanyahu to the Clinton White House during her first month in office. Bernie Sanders has been just slightly more nuanced (though in this race, the fact that he has nuance says a lot).
But as naive as Democrats have been, Republicans have been downright deluded. Obama has “treated Israel horribly” - so they say. Israel, they (rightly) say, is in trouble. But its troubles have nothing to do with a lack of affection, which is the only thing they seem to be offering.
Do they honestly believe, one has to wonder, that moving the American embassy to Jerusalem, or fighting “efforts to de-legitimize Israel,” selling Israel more arms or simply “standing by Israel” going to make Israel’s precarious situation any better?
Let’s be honest: Probably not. But boy, they sure love that nonsense in Florida.

<title>Letter to the Editor: Beinart’s erroneous distinction</title>
<date>Fri Apr 08 03:11:22 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Beinart’s erroneous distinction
Twice within a week, Peter Beinart published columns about his hobby horse that anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism (“No, anti-Zionism isn’t anti-Semitism,” Mar. 30; “Why Rabbi Sacks is wrong,” April 6). Anti-Zionism is a pathology that works insidiously. Once anti-Semitism was an obsession with Jews, but today since this animosity is too obvious, it has come to mean being consumed by hatred of the homeland of the Jews. If anti-Zionists are concerned by atrocities, why are they indifferent to the death of 2,000 civilians in the Russian bombing of Syria? If anti-Zionists are concerned by apartheid, why are they indifferent to the ugly caste system in India, the “world’s largest democracy”? If Muslim anti-Zionists care about the fate of their fellow Muslims, why are the many Pakistanis in Britain indifferent to the suffering of their brethren in Kashmir under India, but obsessed with Israel’s rule over Palestinians?
Beinart claims that because Jews are prominent in anti-Zionism, then it must be kosher. However, many of them abuse and mock Judaism. For example, here, in downtown Toronto, up to two dozen anti-Zionist Jews denounce Israel in front of the Israeli Consulate every Friday between 5 and 6 P.M. When Shabbat begins after 4 P.M. in winter they are there, and when Rosh Hashanah fell on Friday in 2013 and 2014, they still protested, desecrating the High Holiday. Hate overcomes respect for Judaism.

Sharansky’s pain over the Kotel crisis
In response to “Sharansky Western Wall plans at risk if talks reopened,” April 5
Although I have long been affiliated with and a supporter of the Original Women of the Wall, I felt a real poignancy in Judy Maltz’s piece describing Natan Sharansky’s warning about reopening negotiations over the new prayer space at Robinson’s Arch. Sharansky is such a man of integrity. It must be difficult and painful for him to understand that not everyone at the negotiating table brought the good intentions and integrity that he did.

<title>Ayelet Shaked: Israel's minister of annexation</title>
<date>Mon May 02 23:16:23 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked’s portfolio automatically gives her a seat on the security cabinet. But more important to Shaked than the rule of law she’s responsible for are the settlers who vote for her Habayit Hayehudi party and influence its internal rankings, and who want to legalize the inequality between first-class Israeli citizens and fourth-class Palestinian subjects (in the middle are Israeli Arabs and residents of East Jerusalem who are not citizens).
Shaked announced Monday that she’s working with Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit on a plan to apply Israeli law in the West Bank. She said a committee to be established will examine each law that passes in the Knesset and decide whether it should immediately be applied to the settlements as well by military order.
Shaked’s proposal comes after repeated efforts to legislate bills that smack of annexation. Bills submitted by Orit Strock, Yariv Levin, Zeev Elkin and Shaked herself in the previous government, in an effort to get future laws to apply to in the West Bank, were opposed by then-Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein and were ultimately scuttled, although they were approved by the Ministerial Committee for Legislation.
Also in the previous Knesset, Habayit Hayehudi pushed an initiative to apply labor laws in the West Bank to help pregnant women in the settlements. But it backtracked when it became clear that the legislation would improve Palestinian rights and add an economic burden to employers in the settlements.
Israel has not been inadvertently avoiding the process Shaked advocates. To date, Israeli law applies to the settlers on a personal basis under the law that extends emergency regulations, while whatever applies on a regional basis is by order of the regional military commander. There are already Israeli laws “imported” to the territories that favor the settlers, and Shaked’s proposal will make the situation worse because the laws will be applied more systematically.
The proposal is expected to deepen the apartheid in Israel’s code of law that effectively exists between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. It will also cause Israel damage in the international arena. The proposal is akin to de facto annexation, making discrimination in the territories official. This will bring the world down on Israel’s head, which is why even firm opponents of withdrawal like former premiers Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir avoided such a step.
Mendelblit must refuse to support the legal bypass Shaked is trying to pave, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – who repeatedly says that he’s ready “for negotiations with the Palestinians without preconditions” – must protect the State of Israel’s interests, which are being trampled by the interests of the messianic Greater Israel.

<title>For Diaspora Jews, the occupation can’t just be a spectator sport  </title>
<date>Mon Jul 11 16:02:00 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
What is the responsibility of a witness to injustice?
I recently visited Hebron with Breaking the Silence.  Run by Israeli military veterans, the NGO collects testimony from soldiers about incidents of wrongdoing.
Some of these incidents are actual violations of law — like looting, assaulting detainees, or firing a barrage of shells on a random house in Gaza to commemorate the death of a fellow soldier, while others — practices like “mapping” a house — interrupting the residents in order to draw a floor plan, take down names and phone numbers and ID’s and snap photos — even if soldiers discard the data shortly afterwards — are part and parcel of running an occupation.
The goal of such practices, as First Sergeant (res.) Yehuda Shaul, a founding member of Breaking the Silence, describes them, “is to intimidate and to make our presence felt. They [the Palestinians] never know when we’re going to show up.”
In hosting tours of Israelis and non-Israelis to places like Hebron and South Hebron Hills, and in running many other educational events with youth movements, schools, and in universities, the group is clear about its aims: to help end the occupation.
As I attended the Hebrew-language version of the tour, the only non-Israeli among the group, I wondered about slacktivism versus activism, and about voyeurism versus bearing witness.
If the tour's goal is to fire up participants about the severity of the occupation while preventing the all-too-human tendency to get excited by peeping into others’ suffering, then one must first, I found, overcome a great sense of banality.
How unlike the bomb-dodging days and flare-illuminated nights of war correspondents across the planet’s most intense conflict zones, or at least as I imagine them, was this experience. I returned dusty, tired and, despite my best efforts to seek shade, sunburned. When it comes to the occupation, there is often very little to stimulate the senses.
There was the monument to the late racist Rabbi Meir Kahane in a Kiryat Arba park, and, nearby, the grave of Baruch Goldstein who murdered 29 Palestinians in 1994. Two weeks after our tour, a Palestinian teen from a nearby village would stab 13-year old Kiryat Arba resident Hallel Yaffa Ariel to death in her bed.
In adjacent Hebron, there was the infamous al-Shuhada street, which used to host a vibrant market and is now a ghost town. We stood across from an apartment building where Palestinian residents, no longer allowed onto the main street, must resort to leaving their homes through windows and the roof.
There was the Israeli settler, who, while being restrained by police officers, accused us of being “disgusting traitors.” And there were more mild-mannered settlers, too, some as young as 12 or 13, who tagged along on our tour, inserting their version of events where they could.
And there was the settler-with-a-sense of humor, who stood alongside our group, softly singing “Am Yisrael Chai” (“the Nation of Israel Lives”) while swinging his hips.
There were the unmarked cars interrupting our tour, the drivers flashing their police badges at our guide before questioning him. And there were the two impoverished Palestinians who didn’t leave our side, entreating us dozens of times to buy their embroidered cloth purses, even after we did.
The leader of our tour — an endless fount of knowledge armed with maps, facts and figures — was IDF First Sergeant (ret.) Ido Even-Paz, Breaking the Silence’s director of education.
I asked him the question that most often dogs the group from its critics. If their aim is to end the occupation, thus needing to change Israeli hearts and minds, why take the message abroad?
Even-Paz’s reply was striking. “We want to show the world that there's someone to talk to here in Israel; that, unlike extremely closed societies, we are a vibrant democracy. If that means that we are serving as a fig leaf for the government, so be it."
After having taken thousands (in Even-Paz’s estimation) of Israelis and non-Israelis on their tours, and given that 71.5% percent of Jewish Israelis don’t actually believe there is an “occupation,”  Breaking the Silence has its work cut out for it. Shaul tells me they can’t “keep up with the demand” for events, having run 90 in Israel over the last six months.
Most of their activities, he stresses, are in Israel — not abroad. And Even-Paz cites the fact that some Israeli top brass — like former Shin Bet chiefs Ami Ayalon and Yuval Diskin, as well as Israeli Police Maj. Gen. (ret.) Alik Ron and Maj. Gen. (res.) Amiram Levin — have come out publicly in support of the NGO. These moves reflect a broader trend of the Israeli security establishment pushing back on the government’s orientation towards the Palestinian question.
As for the broader world, the international community tends to see military rule of West Bank residents — and civilian rule for Israeli residents — for what it is. Diaspora Jews, for their part, are divided: many are troubled by the occupation while others take their cue from the Israeli government.
So, five years after Peace Now board member and prominent American Jewish feminist and author Letty Cottin Pogrebin visited Hebron and used the “a” (for apartheid) word to describe it, what is the proper thing to do?
We must continue to talk about the occupation in our own communities, however indifferent or hostile the reception. We must be aware of the fact that the Israeli government does not — and cannot — speak for the millions of West Bank Palestinians under its rule.
Supporting groups like Breaking the Silence is one way to bolster Israeli democratic discourse while helping push the needle within Israel towards meaningful policy change, however slow the process may be.
A postscript: Breaking the Silence has again made headlines after being vilified by the president of Ben Gurion University (who vetoed the Middle East Studies department’s selection of the NGO to receive its annual peace prize on the basis that the group, in her words, doesn’t represent the “national consensus,”), and by Yesh Atid leader and MK Yair Lapid, who went after the new editor of Haaretz’s English edition, Noa Landau,  for being the partner of a Breaking the Silence activist.
In a subsequent Facebook post (Hebrew), Lapid apologized for his sexist remark, while doubling down on his criticism of Haaretz and Breaking the Silence (calling the latter a “dangerous organization”).
If pushing Israelis to end the occupation is viewed as 'dangerous', I can’t help but wonder how the alternative — another fifty years of this — is any less so.

<title>We’re American Jewish historians. This is why we’ve left Zionism behind</title>

Hasia Diner: The Israel I once loved was a naïve delusion
When I was asked to run as a delegate on the progressive Hatikva platform to the 2010 World Zionist Congress, I encountered my personal rubicon, the line I could not cross. I was required to sign the "Jerusalem Program." This statement of principles asked me to affirm that I believed in “the centrality of the State of Israel and Jerusalem as capital” for the Jewish people. It encouraged “Aliyah to Israel,” that is, the classic negation of the diaspora and as such the ending of Jewish life outside a homeland in Israel. 
The “Jerusalem Program” also asked me to declare that I wanted to see the “strengthening [of] Israel as a Jewish, Zionist and democratic state.” As to democratic, I had no problem, but the singular insistence on Israel as a Jewish and Zionist state made me realize that, at least in light of this document, I could not call myself a Zionist, any longer. Does Jewish constitute a race or ethnicity? Does a Jewish state mean a racial state?
The death of vast numbers of Jewish communities as a result of Zionist activity has impoverished the Jewish people, robbing us of these many cultures that have fallen into the maw of Israeli homogenization. The ideal of a religiously neutral state worked amazingly well for the millions of Jews who came to America. 
The socialist Zionism of the Habonim youth movement was central to my early years, providing my base during the 1970s when the Jewish settlement of the Occupied Territories began. I need not belabor the point that from that date on, the Palestinian land that has been expropriated for Jews has grown by leaps and bounds and that the tactics used by the State of Israel to suppress the Palestinians have grown harsher and harsher. 
Nor do I need to say that the exponential growth of far right political parties and the increasing Haredization of Israel, makes it a place that I abhor visiting, and to which I will contribute no money, whose products I will not buy, nor will I expend my limited but still to me, meaningful, political clout to support it. 
I have read too much about colonialism and racism to maintain what I now see as a naïve view, that only the events of June 1967 changed everything. The Israel that I loved, the one my parents embraced as the closest approximation to Eden on earth, itself had depended well before 1967 upon the expropriation of Arab lands and the expulsion of Arab populations. The Law of Return can no longer look to me as anything other than racism. I abhor violence, bombings, stabbings, or whatever hurtful means oppressed individuals resort to out of anger and frustration. And yet, I am not surprised when they do so, after so many decades of occupation, with no evidence of progress.
I feel a sense of repulsion when I enter a synagogue in front of which the congregation has planted a sign reading, “We Stand With Israel.” I just do not go and avoid many Jewish settings where I know Israel will loom large as an icon of identity. 
Marjorie N. Feld: The moment I began my reeducation
In all facets of my very Jewish upbringing I was immersed in Holocaust education. It was made absolutely clear to me that only Israel could prevent the concentration camps, right-wing anti-Semitism and genocide, from reappearing.  Friends and I travelled throughout Israel on a summer high school program in 1988, hitting the Jewish tourist spots (Masada, the Western Wall) that reinforced both Jewish nationalist triumphalism and the co-constitutive invisibility of Palestinians, their history, the violence and ethnic cleansing that created the Jewish state.  
I now call it my propaganda tour, but I learned this language only later. From non-Jews I met in liberal and left organizations in college, I first heard strong critiques of Zionism as Western colonialism, as a militarist project, as racism. Very smart friends of mine were articulating these critiques, and they made me terrifically uncomfortable.    A feminist scholar I met at a conference asked me directly if I considered myself a Zionist, and I gave an indirect answer. Her anger became palpable. She nearly shouted: “You’ve read Chomsky, haven’t you?” I had not yet read Noam Chomsky’s writings on Israel, I confessed. As I recall she turned away and didn’t speak to me again that evening. That might be hyperbole, or more likely my own sense of shame.  
I reeducated myself, stopping to look at all of the facts that I had bumped up against for years. The 1947 radio broadcast of the votes at the UN that declared the Jewish people had a home and would never face genocide again: I had listened to this recording and this interpretation dozens of times in the sites of my Jewish education. Now I interpreted it anew. The founding of Israel was the Nakba, the great catastrophe, for Palestinians, with ethnic cleansing, destruction, and no right of return.  
In short, I no longer found common ground with those who saw an anti-Semitic or anti-Zionist bent, or even conspiracy, on the left. I saw that that Israel fit neatly into my broader understanding of Western colonialism. How could Israel be the antidote to genocide when it was the product of imperialism and ethnic cleansing?  
Like Hasia, I often feel marginalized. I travel across several towns, driving past many other synagogues, to my synagogue precisely because I too refuse to enter to any institution that flies the “We Stand with Israel” banner. 
‘Before’ and ‘after’ Zionism in the U.S. Jewish community
Our journeys from “before” to “after” identifying with Zionism have been painful, and we’ve searched for allies and institutions. We have both found Jewish Studies a difficult space in which to criticize Israel, to stand against the Occupation or even Zionism. Though we certainly do not claim to speak for all American Jews, as scholars we know we are a part of something much larger, something that, we assert, should be shaking the foundation of American Jewish leaders. Closing down all conversations on Israel/Palestine, demonizing the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, marginalizing or silencing those who dissent from the Zionist “consensus”:  there is a growing gap between these leaders and the people for whom they claim to speak.

<title>The dangerous fantasies of Jeffrey Goldberg</title>
<date>Wed Aug 03 19:04:02 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Jeffrey Goldberg has a fantasy. Like every fantasy, it’s only loosely connected to reality. But don’t dare try to spoil it – he’s enjoying it too much.
Goldberg is an enlightened liberal, representing progressive American Jewry. He’s liberal, intellectual, Zionist (of course), a friend of Israel (of course), close to U.S. President Barack Obama and a highly regarded journalist. He is critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (who isn’t?) and has liberal, enlightened Israeli friends just like him.
In Goldberg’s fantasy, Israel is as enlightened as he is: liberal, democratic and just. Don’t you dare try casting doubt on that – Goldberg’s liberalism won’t tolerate it. He will praise freedom of expression in Israel, as he did at a Haaretz conference in Palo Alto last November, and will say that Israelis' freedom of the press and lively public debate is what makes Israel so popular in America. But from now on, it will have to be without Haaretz and the lively public debate it fosters about Zionism among Jewish Americans.
According to Goldberg, Haaretz is doing something unforgiveable: it’s shattering his fantasy. Because of an op-ed piece in which two American-Jewish historians explain why they’ve abandoned Zionism, as well as a piece of my own (“Yes, Israel is an evil state,” July 31), the liberal Goldberg has decided he’s had enough of Haaretz. He tweeted to his 107,000 Twitter followers that these sort of pieces make him sick. Neo-Nazis, he said, have been distributing my op-ed, so he was going to have to “take a break” from Haaretz.
I would love to know who those neo-Nazis are. After all, neo-Nazis and the radical right are now some of Israel’s best friends. Did Goldberg mean to say that BDS advocates are neo-Nazis? And besides, I’m not sure I understand. What, the pieces are true, but it’s only the way they’re used that angers Goldberg? Should they not be published because neo-Nazis disseminate them? Or are the articles not actually true?
Behind this lies the greatest boorishness of all: the rather primitive idea that Israel’s critics are the ones giving it a bad name, not its actions and policies. That criticism of Israel was born of articles in Haaretz, not the crimes of the occupation. The video footage released Tuesday showing a Border Policeman throwing the bike of a terrified Palestinian girl into the bushes in Hebron did more damage to Israel than all of my pieces in Haaretz combined. Goldberg probably thought it should never have been posted, because of the neo-Nazis.
You’re tired of Haaretz, Jeffrey? The Palestinians are far more tired of the occupation. They’d also like a break.
And now to the essence. Goldberg thinks a country that’s oppressing four million human beings is an enlightened state implementing the liberal values of the West. That a country that in its own backyard is maintaining one of the most brutal and tyrannical regimes that exist today – certainly in the Western world – and has been running an apartheid regime for nearly 50 years, is a democracy. Would Goldberg call his country a democracy if there was racist discrimination in the south?
No one is denying Goldberg his right to deceive himself and his readers. But the Goldbergs bear a heavy burden of guilt, because the occupation also continues because of them – those who spread the lie of Israeli democracy and its liberal nonsense. The smokescreen that Goldberg spreads in America allows it. He wants to continue enjoying Israel as long as it doesn’t harm the Reform movement or the Women of the Wall, while ignoring everything it does to the Palestinians.
Haaretz will manage without Goldberg, but Israel would be a different country without this newspaper. It would be a country that even propagandist Goldberg would be ashamed of, without journalism of substance and without real oversight. Who will cover the occupation? Channel 2? Or the asylum seekers – Yedioth Ahronoth? Who will write about the undermining of democracy? Israel Hayom?
That’s the country Goldberg would like to continue to fantasize about in Washington. Thanks, but we’re not interested.

<title>U.S. Jews must support Black Lives Matter, regardless of its platform's anti-Israel assertions</title>
<date>Wed Aug 10 15:52:10 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Many in the Jewish community were justifiably outraged when the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of dozens of organizations mobilizing for racial justice in America, made the libelous assertion in its recently published platform that Israel is an “apartheid state” perpetrating a “genocide” against the Palestinian people. There were feelings of confusion, disappointment, anger and even the hurt borne of betrayal. Some have called for an outright rejection of the Movement. Unless it changes course on this plank, these voices argue, they “can’t,” or, more accurately, won’t, support it. 
This approach is wrongheaded and counterproductive. First, to abandon the Movement for Black Lives is to abandon the Jewish responsibility to fight for equality. The Jewish tradition sees the equality of all human beings as a fundamental religious principle, as close to an axiom as the Jewish tradition gets. Central to our faith is the notion that there is only one God, an assertion religious Jews affirm twice daily when we recite the Shema. The belief in one God means that all human beings are brothers and sisters, sharing as we do the same Creator. In the Torah, this God, the God of all humanity, is depicted as loathing racism (Numbers 12:1-10) and demanding the creation of a society where minorities receive special protection (Exodus 23:9, et. al.) and are treated equally before the law (Num. 15:16). For Jews to cease fighting for racial justice is to jettison a core part of who we are, and who we are called to be. We must remember that we Jews stand for more than just the State of Israel.
A special love for the land and people of Israel is unquestionably a core part of the Jewish tradition, and is rightly central to the moral and spiritual consciousness of most contemporary American Jews. However, supporting and strengthening the Jewish state and its citizens is not incompatible with supporting and strengthening the Movement for Black Lives. It is not zero-sum. Despite what (some of) the authors of the platform might believe, one does not have to choose one value in order to advance the other. The platform has six demands in total, of which the portion dealing with Israel (or, more accurately, U.S. financial and military support for Israel) is found in one part of one demand, “Invest-Divest.” 
Surely one policy plank does not invalidate a whole platform. Divestment from Israel is not so central to the platform that one cannot plausibly support everything else in the platform except for that one plank. 
If that is true, one might ask, then why did the platform’s authors include divestment from Israel in the first place? And why use such incendiary language? Is it not a distraction from the fight for racial equality? Does it prove, in the words of Rabbi Dan Dorsch, that the way of the Black Lives Matter movement is not the way of Dr. Martin Luther King, and that Jews should not join with the Movement as they did with Dr. King in the 1960’s?
Well, no. Dr. King famously wrote in his “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” that “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.” In 1963, King advanced that line of argument to explain why he, an Atlanta pastor, was concerned with the treatment of blacks in Birmingham. But in 1967, King employed the same line of reasoning to argue why he, an American civil rights activist, was joining the fight against the war in Vietnam. In a speech at New York City’s Riverside Church  alongside Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, King offered several reasons why his involvement in the antiwar movement was directly connected to his civil rights work. 
One reason was that the war effort diverted significant resources that could have been invested in the uplift of poor communities, both black and white. Another was that King felt he could not make a compelling case for non-violence in the pursuit of social change at home without speaking out against state-sanctioned violence in Vietnam. And, finally, King explained that he had to protest the war because of his common humanity - informed by his faith - with the people of Vietnam, caught up in and brutalized by decades of horrific war. He argued in that speech for a “genuine revolution of values,” for all nations to transcend provincial loyalty to cultivate “a worldwide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern beyond one's tribe, race, class, and nation is in reality a call for an all-embracing, unconditional love for all men.” 
If one adheres to Dr. King's philosophy and simultaneously believes that Israel is “an apartheid state” perpetuating a genocide against the Palestinian people, then American divestment from Israel is part and parcel of the struggle for civil rights at home, not a distraction. While I vehemently disagree with and am offended by that characterization of Israel, I understand the logic. 
But those of us who admire Dr. King and the Jewish leaders who stood with him and yet disagree with the authors’ premise about Israel still must fight for racial justice - as well as engage in an honest conversation about how American foreign policy impacts that fight - lest we betray everything that Dr. King and his Jewish allies stood for. 
And those who feel the platform’s assertions about Israel are too dangerous to be disregarded can actively fight against those who seek to advance its attendant policies in the arenas where those policies are being debated. But even that course of action does not prevent one from aligning with the Movement for Black Lives on every other issue, nor does it absolve one of the responsibility to fight for equality.
And make no mistake: Jews who are serious about the fight for racial equality in America should ally themselves with an organized movement - rather than advocate for justice independently - because the cause will only be effective through organized effort, strength in numbers, and “political will and power,” as the platform puts it. Ironically, this point should be obvious to American Jews. After all, the fight for a strong U.S.-Israel relationship is only achieved through the organized effort, strength in numbers, and political power of groups like AIPAC. 
As was the case in the 1960’s, the Jewish community has the strength to help make the Movement for Black Lives a success. Abandoning it makes it more likely to fail, and any of us alone are unlikely to rectify centuries of systematic injustice. We Jews  ought to be allies with those who fight for equality and dignity, for that is our fight, too.

<title>Ignore what Black Lives Matter says about Israel</title>
<date>Thu Aug 18 16:04:24 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
The brouhaha about Black Lives Matter’s platform and what it says about Israel, says a lot more about Jews than it says about American blacks, or about relations between the two communities.
The platform, issued almost three weeks ago, does devote a disproportionate about of attention to Israel, and what it does say, is objectionable to most Jews and Israelis. Israel is committing “genocide” against Palestinians, it’s an “apartheid” regime and bulldozes Palestinian homes to make way for settlements.
The $3 billion in U.S. aid Israel gets annually gets as much word count in the platform as all other defense spending. Egypt gets almost as much money, but as far Black Lives Matter is concerned, Egypt’s only sin is being an “ally” of Israel.
But Israel is just a minor – albeit prominently minor – part of a platform that addresses a whole range of issues far beyond its remit. It delves deeply into climate change on the flimsy pretext that blacks are among the “most affected” by its consequences. It condemns the War on Terror and valiantly struggles to make it into black issue by exaggerating U.S. military activity in Africa, even though the war is being fought primarily in the Middle East, and has nothing to do with police misbehavior towards American blacks.
It calls for universal healthcare, free education through college (and oddly enough, good cafeteria food) and reparations as compensation for the suffering of American slaves – all things way for the political agenda for mainstream America, which can barely even stomach Obamacare.
What it doesn’t mention
The Black Lives Matter platform is a document of the American left that ignores the needs, interest and concerns of the people in whose name it purports to be speaking.
It is hostile to Israel not because the Israel-Palestine dispute has any bearing on the lives of African Americans or because African Americans as a group dislike Israel, or identify with the Palestinians. It is hostile to Israel because it Israel is a top agenda item for the American left.
The left’s predominance is evident in the vocabulary the platform employs, terms like “colonialism,” ”the American empire”  and “patriarchy,” which go down well in college sociology departments and among community activists, but hardly speak to the broad, much less black, American population.  
Thus, like Donald Trump’s pronouncements on undocumented Mexican immigrants, Hillary Clinton and his business acumen, the Black Lives Matter platform doesn’t deal in facts but in articulating a worldview, highly defined and ideologically driven in this case. Facts are messy things that have to be hammered into shape to fit in with the theory.
Let’s take a real issue that might have concerned Black Lives Matter vis a vis Israel, namely Israel’s treatment of African refugees.
But it doesn’t merit attention is because it doesn’t get a lot of international media attention and isn’t on the left’s agenda, which is busy enough with Israel’s other crimes.
Let’s say Black Lives Matter had addressed the issue in a real and forthright way, without ideological blinders. It could have justifiably pointed out how Israel has blocked its borders, herded refugees into camps, and abused and mistreated them.
But if the movement was going to seriously address the issue, it would have to asking why Africans are fleeing Africa to begin with, how they are treated along the way by their fellow Africans and by Egypt, how other Africans on the way to Europe are abused by Arab countries and how they are herded into camps and abused by their European hosts.
But that’s much too complicated, no good for slogans and doesn’t fit the template of white oppression and the blameless suffering of blacks. Better just to point out Israel’s sins
The reality is that American blacks aren’t hostile to Israel or identify with Palestinians. A 2013 Pew survey found that about 44% of black Protestants, for instance, strongly sympathized with Israel, which was 20 points lower than for all American but a rate far higher than the 12% who sympathize with Palestinians.
One commentator on the poll said blacks’ pro-Israel feeling are linked to their Christian beliefs  – the same poll found that 51% of black Protestants believe Israel was given to the Jewish people by God – but you won’t find a word about Christian values in the Black Lives Matter platform, because it’s of no interest to its framers.
Ignore the Black Lives Matter platform. It has no resonance with African Americans and will have a shelf life of a few months before everyone forgets it.

<title>If Trump wins, we could see the worst of U.S.-Israel ties on steroids</title>
<date>Mon Aug 22 15:01:31 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
It is easy, perhaps too easy, to harp on the absurdities of how American politics relate to Israel. It is the satirical material of popular political shows, such as “The West Wing,” in which fictional President Josiah Bartlet once considered framing and mounting a map of the Holy Land from 1709 and got dressed down by staffers: “People would be offended – the map does not recognize Israel.”
In the current election, reality makes fictional scriptwriters seem unimaginative: drafting the Democratic platform became a Basil Fawlty-like exercise in not mentioning the occupation, while Republican candidate Donald Trump has encouraged settlement building and accused the Obama administration of treating Israel as a second-class citizen (blessed, indeed, is the second-class citizen who receives more military assistance than any other country, bar none). 
Setting aside disbelief for a moment, imagine the following scenario. Despite the compelling and mounting evidence of the doomed nature of the Trump candidacy – even after the recent launch of his campaign among Americans exiled in Israel – the Donald wins and is sworn in as America's 45th president on January 20, 2017.
President Trump then sets out to govern based on the positions – or at least sound bites – he has espoused during the campaign, including those about banning Muslims, building a wall with Mexico and Israel’s right to expand settlements.
Likewise, senior echelons of the Trump administration are staffed by some of those who have spoken as his advisers on Israel affairs (these include a president of the American Friends of the Beit El settlement, who has compared J Street to “Kapos during the Nazi regime” and a former settler who boasts of not having met any Palestinians since his time as a yeshiva student in the settlements during the 1980s).
Then imagine that the collection of national-security pronouncements (a mixture of America First, chauvinism and pivoting away from friends toward certain foes) become policies sustainable throughout a significant chunk of a Trump administration’s tenure.
America's closest allies, including in NATO and in Asia, are put on notice that they must demonstrate their usefulness to America and pay their way. With one notable exception, Israel.
America’s global commitments are radically downsized. Again, with one exception, Israel, for whom America will continue to jump through every hoop in every international forum and to deploy whatever is deemed necessary to defend that state – militarily, politically and economically.
The entire scenario is far-fetched, not least its opening premise of a Trump election victory – yet the GOP has nominated Trump, the candidate and his advisers have taken these positions and this election is being treated as a serious contest.
What, then, would the consequences be were this scenario to unfold? The effects of a Trump administration’s specific brand of pro-Israelism would likely accelerate – perhaps dramatically – two trends already in motion.
The first is occurring inside the United States, and involves the shifting political terrain regarding Israel. Evidence already exists as to the difficulties of sustaining uncritical bipartisan support of every Israeli policy.
Could that notion survive the unprecedented polarizing effect of a Trump administration, in which Israeli occupation policies – building separation walls, racial profiling, appeals to ethnocracy over democracy (the shared Netanyahu/Trump playbook) – are closely identified as Trump values?
The Donald's particular brand of pro-Israel exceptionalism will be hard for many who are traditionally sympathetic to Israel to stomach – more so even than Netanyahu’s foray’s into partisan U.S. politics.
More strident critiques of the U.S.-Israel relationship are likely to become part of the mainstream anti-Trump narrative. The potential impact among Democrats and non-Trump Republicans should not be underestimated.
The second trend likely to be put on steroids under a Trump presidency is the ascendancy of the Israeli far right’s claim that its policies can be implemented even while Israel benefits from American and international support.
The key political fault line in Israel today is not between left and right, but rather between rightists calling for the precipitous annexation of the West Bank and realization of the vision of Greater Israel versus those arguing for continued but incrementalist territorial expansion and Palestinian dispossession.
That distinction – between the extreme and pragmatic right – may seem semantic, but it matters a great deal. The pragmatic right is more cautious, more democratic and includes elements open to compromise under certain circumstances.
The debate in Israel long ago abandoned issues of morality, international law or even values, and has become increasingly focused on two simple themes: demographics, and whether there are any limits, internationally, to Israeli impunity.
The more it has been proven that Israel can get away with anything at minimal or no cost internationally, the more extreme Israeli politics and policies have, unsurprisingly, become.
If an American administration were to shift from timidly opposing to openly embracing a permanent Israeli apartheid system for managing the Palestinians, then the demographic issue is also resolved, with Palestinian enfranchisement off the agenda indefinitely.
There is a school of thought in certain leftist circles that welcomes the clarifying and polarizing impact of a prospective Trump presidency. That is the logic of the “Bernie or Bust” crew, those Sanders supporters who refuse to back Hillary Clinton. Their so-called theory of change can also be applied to the Israel-Palestine issue.
In reality, that prospect is terrifying, not least for those who are ultimately supposed to benefit from this “clarity.” If Trump’s pronouncements are not to be taken seriously, then the candidacy itself is not serious.
And if the Republican nominee means what he says, then let's not pretend this is politics as usual. Choices have consequences – sometimes decidedly ill-advised ones.
Daniel Levy is the President of the U.S. / Middle East Project, based in New York and London and served until recently as Middle East and North Africa Director at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

<title>BDS is a lot of things, but it's not anti-Semitic</title>
<date>Wed Sep 21 21:51:01 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
The charge of racism has become a useful way to shoot down substantive debate. Donald Trump certainly has felt its sting, as did Brexit voters, both after raising legitimate questions about the economic impact of globalization only to find themselves bombarded with accusations of bigotry and hate.
Israel is also often charged with racism, and with apartheid in recent years, on top of more traditional crimes of colonialism and imperialism.  It’s no surprise that “Israeli apartheid” has become the clarion call of the boycott, sanctions and divestment movement  -- it hits the racism button so hard.
How ironic then that pro-Israel groups are throwing back the racism charge at BDS itself. The argument is that regardless of whether BDS portrays itself as pro-Palestinian or as a champion of human rights, the very essence of the movement – promoting a boycott of Israel – is by nature anti-Semitic, because it singles out Israel for punishment.
Leftists charged with racism
The anti-Semitism charge is a serious business. No one wants to be openly associated with any kind of racism – certainly not the movement’s rank-and-file leftists.
But there is even a bigger problem. If BDS is really anti-Semitic or even anti-Israeli businesses and institutions would be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. And if that's the case, any business complying with  BDS would be at risk of being sued.
The BDS-as-racism campaign is gaining momentum, at least in the U.S. Just last week the New York City Council passed a resolution condemning BDS for, among other things, its “unacceptable anti-Semitic rhetoric”. A dozen or so U.S. states have passed anti-BDS legislation, and a key U.S. trade bill approved by Congress last year includes anti-BDS provisions.  All of this is only possible because the only good excuse for impinging on people’s rights to boycott products or services as they see fit is that it is motivated by racism.
But is the BDS movement anti-Semitic, or even anti-Israeli?
Not going by its official BDS website, where you won't find anything self-evidently anti-Semitic. The word “Jew” doesn’t appear, and a section is devoted to defending the movement against charges of anti-Semitism.
Its criticism of Israel is intense and uncomfortable to read, even if you know a lot of it is over the top, but the official movement steers carefully clear from stereotyping Israelis, and speaks only of the culpability of Israeli institutions for the Palestinian plight.
That’s the website, which no doubt is carefully vetted to make sure the movement stays on message. Grassroots BDS is another matter.
Magnet for haters
As Trump and Brexit campaigners know, once you start raising issues like immigration, you’re going to attract the haters.
You might legitimately think mass immigration is bad for the economy, but if you do, you’re going to find your allies are people who just don’t like foreigners.
BDS is in the same boat: People who are legitimately outraged by Israel’s behavior are going to find themselves at rallies shoulder to shoulder with people who don’t like Jews.
Anti-BDS activists argue that by singling out Israel, even the best-intentioned BDSers are ipso facto discriminating against Israelis. They correctly argue there are a lot of places in the world where human rights are being violated and/or are under occupation. Why pick on Israel, unless you don’t like Jews? 
That is because BDS is a one-issue group, and its issue in Israel. To say that it should be mounting campaigns against Syria, Zimbabwe or Iran before it tackles Israel isn’t fair and realistic. That would be like accusing the 1970s-era struggle for Soviet Jewry of being anti-Russian because it ignored oppression in elsewhere in the world or saying the American Lyme Disease Foundation has no business raising money that should go to fighting cancer.
The anti-Semitism charge is tempting to many who find BDS’s virulent anti-Israel posture unsettling and unjust. Not a few activists in the movement have dubious motives and its anti-Israel campaign often strays into dark areas, as when the filmmaker Shimon Dotan was disinvited from a Syracuse University film festival apparently for no other reason than that he is Israeli. But the charge is unproven. There are quite enough exaggerations or outright falsehoods perpetuated by BDS. Fight them on that and leave the anti-Semitism alone.

<title>Was Shimon Peres a man of peace?</title>
<date>Wed Sep 28 21:01:15 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
He was my private political instructor for four years, day and night. He didn’t act like a teacher, but I learned a lot from him, about what to do, but also what not to do. I was very young, and he was already Shimon Peres. We parted with mixed feelings. 
He was the last of the old-time Israelis. What’s “Israeli” to you? Once it was Shimon Peres. Now Miri Regev represents Israeliness much more than he does. But when Israel still wanted to be portrayed as a peace-seeking nation, it had Peres.

When it was still important for it to be accepted – Peres. When saying one had been a shepherd was still respectable – Peres. When speaking of books was still admired – Peres. When at least a semblance of enlightenment and modesty was still important – Peres. It was a different country. He died yesterday, but that Israel died long ago. It’s not certain that it was as lovely as we tend to describe it.
His Israel was a country of great achievements, but also of shadows and lies. One cannot crown him a wondrous figure, as the whole world is doing now, without also describing his country. If Peres was a hero of peace, then the State of Israel is a peace-seeking country. Is anybody buying that? One cannot call it an occupier, a dispossessor, a pariah, while calling Peres a giant of peace.
If Israel is on the verge of a moral abyss, then Peres had a part in that. If it’s a country en route to apartheid, he was a founding partner.
The state was Peres and Peres was the state, at least to some extent. He was a fixture of the landscape for all those years and in all those positions. Look at him and you see us.
We so want peace but are doing so little to achieve it. He was the country’s pretty face but also misleading. Israelis are remembering him fondly now; how wonderful it is that we had such a man. Those world leaders who will be coming to his funeral tomorrow will also effusively praise his contribution to peace.
But what peace? The man gave us the Dimona reactor and the 1956 Sinai Operation, Upper Nazareth and Ofra, Israel Military Industries and Israel Aerospace Industries – so how much peace (and justice) did he really bring, and how much occupation and settlements?
There’s no doubt that he wanted peace and worked for it. But he stopped halfway by ignoring the settlement issue during the Oslo process, and there are no half-paths to peace. It’s not just the right that’s responsible for that failure.
He was an impressive man.  His span of knowledge was broader than most of his contemporaries, as was his personal charm. We never had a more curious and stylish politician, nor a better conversationalist. I’ll go further; he was also an honest man, certainly no less than his colleagues. And no one could talk about peace the way he did; even Mahatma Ghandi spoke about it less. 
Back in the late 1970s, Peres was already saying in every speech, “It’s impossible to rule over another people against its will.” It moved me then. But during the ensuing decades when he was at the helm, that sentence remained in party speeches. What did he do to end the occupation? He contributed a great deal to Israel – to its security, to its prosperity – but not to its justice. So just don’t say he was a man of peace. 
He wanted peace. Who doesn’t? But the truth must be told, even in difficult moments; he never perceived the Palestinians as equal to Jews, and certainly not as having equal rights.
After years in the company of David Ben-Gurion perhaps it was too difficult to formulate a different approach. Human rights and international law didn’t interest him, and Palestinian suffering didn’t move him. 
When U.S. President Barack Obama praises him tomorrow as a man of peace, one will get the sneaking suspicion that he may be Peres’ spitting image. How pleasant it is to praise Peres.
Because above all else, Peres was the champion of the Israeli desire to “go with and feel without.” Of saying how terrific we are. Now there isn’t even anyone left to say it.

<title>Shimon Peres was one Holocaust-era Jew whom anti-Semitism didn't scare </title>
<date>Thu Sep 29 19:35:36 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
By the time you read this column, I’m pretty sure you will have read and heard enough Shimon Peres quotes over the last few days to last you a while. But I’m going to give you one more all the same. As president, he naturally met hundreds of delegations of Diaspora Jews and whenever, as often happens in such meetings, they brought up the issue of anti-Semitism, he refused to dwell on it. “Anti-Semitism,” he told them, “is no longer a problem for the Jews. It is a problem for the goyim.” He was pretty special among Israeli politicians, who love to go on about how Jews abroad face hatred, in disregarding it is a threat. And of course he was right.
No one could accuse the Polish-born Peres – whose family members not fortunate enough to have emigrated before the Holocaust were all wiped out – of not being aware of the worst the outside world could do to the Jews. But in his pragmatic and forward-looking worldview, he appreciated the fact that in today’s world, where nearly all the Jews live in prosperous Western countries, when anti-Semitism does appear, it’s no longer the Jews who have to be worried. Irrational hatred of Jews, and of Israel, is a sign of ignorance among individuals and dysfunction of groups and societies.

Peres recognized how the status of Jews changed in his lifetime as they became fully integrated and well-adjusted citizens, while the obsessive Jew-haters and “anti-Zionists” were now the misfits, relegated to the margins. It wasn’t only his assessment of the world we live in today – it was also an integral part of his self-confidence and optimistic outlook. He knew that the Jewish state would ultimately prosper as part of the international community because successful countries could only be those that treated Jews with respect.
For proof that on this, at least, Peres was 100% correct, you only have to look at any serious assessment of contemporary anti-Semitism. The headlines may tell you that anti-Semitism is on the rise but actually, looking at the data, actual physical attacks upon Jews have never been lower. Where we find anti-Semitism is on the internet and social networks like Twitter. And it’s clear where it’s coming from. In the United States it’s coming from the neo-fascist “alt-right” element of the Trump campaign. In Britain from the cranks of the far-left Corbynist cult who have taken over what was once a proud, anti-racist Labour Party and from the xenophobes of the Brexit movement. On the European continent it’s coming from resurgent nationalists on the right who are trying to take Europe back to a darker age, and frustrated immigrants who have only learned the worst traditions of their new home countries and are blaming their situation on Jewish bankers. Further afield it is being fueled by Russian trolls and bizarre conspiracy theorists who populate propaganda channels like Russia Today and Iran’s Press TV. And it’s coming from Islamic dictatorships.
Of course it’s unpleasant to read or hear any of the tripe coming from these places, but it’s about as harmful to Jews as the ravings of a lunatic. And of course there’s no coincidence that it’s coming out of troubled societies, political parties who have lost their way as well as unfortunate and, quite frankly, backward communities. History has naturally conditioned us to be alarmed when we hear Jews being blamed for the world’s problems (or Israel being used as an excuse for the woes of the Middle East). But Peres was right in pointing out that in this day and age, anti-Semitism is no longer about the Jews. It’s just another symptom of an illness affecting some groups and societies. It afflicts the weak and those susceptible to conspiracy theories and other forms of quackery. It may once have been fashionable but if you see anti-Semitism and irrational hatred of Israel anywhere today, you know that in those same places liberal democracy is hated as well. And that science and experts are disregarded and the “mainstream media” distrusted.
Following on Ben-Gurion
Shimon Peres’ philosophical outlook on anti-Semitism was the natural continuation of his mentor David Ben-Gurion’s famous exhortation that “it doesn’t matter what the goyim say. It matters what the Jews do.” Their point was that often, focusing too much on what our haters say about us is the real problem. It diverts our time, attention and resources from building our own society and fixing its flaws.
There is of course one flaw in the Peres philosophy. In being prepared to overlook anti-Semitism as an internal illness that doesn’t really affect the Jews anymore, he was also too willing to overlook the injustices committed by countries and governments he dealt with. He championed defense ties with apartheid-era South Africa, lobbied against recognizing Turkey’s genocide of the Armenians, and in more recent years had much too friendly relations with Putin’s Russia. Only last month he gave an interview to the Kremlin’s Russia Today channel defending Putin’s intentions in Syria. It wasn’t one of his proudest moments and it’s sad that one of his last interviews was with a news organization that routinely hosts anti-Semites and Holocaust-deniers. It would be too easy to put it down to the vanity of an old man, but Peres was always of the view that Israel cannot choose its allies. Still, learning from someone also means learning from his mistakes.
Peres was right: Anti-Semitism is a sign of a society’s ills, not something the Jews need to do something about. But it also means that the other side of the coin is that Jews and the Jewish state can only be secure for long in an environment of democracy. Peres argued that Israel was secure enough to make concessions to its neighbors for peace. If that is true, then it should be secure enough to recognize injustices where they exist. Secure enough for a long-term commitment to democracy over the convenient pragmatism of allying with dictatorships.

<title>Israel's national puppet theater heads to settlements</title>
<date>Wed Oct 26 12:06:18 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
There’s nothing new in the desire of the settlers, Israeli citizens living in territories that are not the country’s sovereign territory, to normalize their residence there, one way being through their demand that cultural institutions supported by public funds perform for them in their communities.
For that purpose several cultural centers were built there, which can accommodate complete shows.
Nor is there anything new about the fact that the Israeli government is promoting the appearance of “normalization” in a situation that is far from normal, in occupied territories, where in effect there is an apartheid policy:
One population enjoys full rights while another lives under conditions of oppression. Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev (Likud) even signed regulations recently that enable her ministry to punish cultural institutions by denying them a part of their budget for not performing in the country’s periphery, and to provide incentives for those performing only in settlements.
Until now few plays by the supported public theaters were performed in the cultural centers of the settlements, and the managements of those theaters made sure that there would be substitutes for the few theater people who refused to perform there for reasons of conscience.
Since this activity is relatively marginal, they have refrained as far as possible from publishing declarations on the subject. At the same time, there is a considerable group of artists opposed to performing in the territories, and in addition there is evidence that such performances damage the foreign relations of Israeli theater.
What’s new in the case of the scheduled performance by the Habima National Theater in the cultural center of Kiryat Arba - a place that has become a symbol of the injustices of the occupation and the settlements - is the declaration published by the theater on the subject.
For the first time, the management of a public theater is publishing a declaration that also links the fact that it is a “national” theater to the idea that “we are interested in continuing to provide high-quality culture to all the citizens of Israel,” and also “rejects with repugnance any call to exclude citizens and to exclude communities, and condemns any attempt at a cultural boycott in any place where Israeli citizens live.”
In 1958 one reason why Habima received the title “national” from the Israeli government was to enable the government to provide financial support.
For over 20 years the theater has been mired in a financial and artistic crisis, and receives regular and special financial assistance, contrary to the rules of proper administration, as the State Comptroller remarked in a severe report.
The culture and sports minister recently established a committee to examine the significance of the “national” aspect of the theater, and she is regularly invited to its debut performances where she delivers speeches.
It’s clear that the theater is totally dependent upon the good graces of the government and the minister, even if its directors had a viewpoint regarding the morality of the settlements.
The fact that the government and the settlers are using culture and its institutions to put a kosher stamp on a politically and morally unacceptable situation is another expression of the self-righteous policy of “robbed Cossacks.”
The Habima management’s provocative consent to this is a moral stain worthy of condemnation.

<title>Whitewashing apartheid</title>
<date>Fri Nov 18 02:08:29 IST 2016</date>
<content>
The creativity of the Justice Ministry knows no bounds when it comes to trying to whitewash the crimes of the settlements. After the shameful vote on the unconstitutional law to retroactively legalize illegal settlements, which although it passed its preliminary vote in the Knesset is destined to be struck down in court, the attorney general and the justice minister are seeking alternatives to retroactively legalize outposts. Their efforts are intended to legitimize not only the outposts, but the apartheid rule in the territories.
One of the proposals is to declare settlers a “local population,” in an area defined as under military occupation. This declaration has many problems, but even if it could be accepted, in the end it would define both populations – Jewish and Palestinian – as “local populations” in an occupied zone.
 By this definition would it be possible to take lands from one population at the expense of another?  That is, could lands be taken from Jews to benefit the Palestinians? Would the laws that are applied to the Palestinian local population, including military law, be applied to the settlers, with both groups judged by the same courts and according to the same laws?
Since the answer to this question is no, defining the settlers as a “local population,” will only continue a long process of creating apartheid rule. Because if these are “local” populations, why should they be subject to different legal systems and why should they not have equal rights, including granting Palestinians the right to vote in elections in Israel?
Over the years, the High Court of Justice has refused to touch the hot potato of the settlements’ legality. Rather, it has ruled that as long as settlers are living in the territories, their needs have to be met like the needs of any person living in a certain place. But what does that have to do with taking private Palestinian lands on which to build or expand the settlements?
The Justice Ministry’s reliance on a  controversial arrangement, used in Cyprus, is nothing more than a superfluous,  damaging and manipulative action. The best solution for Israel is the two-state solution. The other possibility – granting full civil rights and equality before the law for Jews and Palestinians – would mean the end of the Jewish state. The third possibility is called apartheid.

<title>About living in Israel and losing friends</title>
<date>7/1/2006</date>
<content>
You make aliya to Israel, and it's what you wanted. You're an exile who's been ingathered, and you're living the life you've chosen among those who are your kin. But that doesn't mean shunning friends from your former life, whom you've known for decades. You'd like to stay close.

I've really wanted to do that, and with some friends I've succeeded, albeit from a distance. But with two of my oldest associates, one from school, the other from college, both Jewish - as they say in Yiddish, "it doesn't go." Anytime I talk to either of them I'm conscious that there's an elephant in the room named the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

We tiptoe around it, try to pretend it isn't there. But it is, and, inevitably, I get slapped in the face by a swinging trunk or swishing tail.

Like last month in England, when I told my old school-friend on the phone about a trip I had made to Germany and an article I had written about how complex it is for a Jew to visit there. I observed that no European country really had the right to tell Israel what to do, given the murky pasts of so many of them.

Oops! Shouldn't have said that.

"That," replied my friend, "happened then. This is now." Then, sternly: "I don't like things that are happening in Israel." And, in case I hadn't got the message: "Many of us here don't like things that are happening in Israel."

Swish, slap. For some reason, that "here" really got up my nose.

I SHOULD have drawn her out, listened patiently to the charge sheet against Israel - whether it was the cruelties of the occupation, the outrage against international law of targeted assassinations, or the rapacious apartheid wall - and explained gently that roadblocks and the security fence exist only to stop the, regrettably, many who are set on stealing in and killing us in our homes and public places; and that when that determination dissipates, the roadblocks and fence, with their attendant hardships for civilians, can come down.

But I didn't. The old sadness of being misunderstood, accompanied by a hollow sense of personal injury, washed over me. It was soon after the Netanya bombing, and all I could manage was a weary reflection on how much more than physical distance separated me from this person who had once been my confidante.

So I said, "How's your mum?" She answered with a little laugh, in which I thought I discerned satisfaction at retaining, as she saw it, the high moral ground.

NEEDING TO know where we stood, Israel and I, I once asked her: Did she believe the State of Israel had a right to exist? Of course, she answered. That was why she was so critical of it.

Why have I persisted in this relationship? I guess it's because old friends are like family, inextricably woven into one's life story.

The trouble began long ago. Back in 1973, as a new immigrant sitting nervously in Ramat Aviv's Beit Millman absorption center, near the Reading power station - a prime target for enemy attack - I received a long letter from the UK. It was my first experience of war, and scary. A letter from a friend would thus have been very welcome, had it expressed any concern for my welfare. Not a bit of it; what I read, with amazement and growing anger, was a moralistic screed on Israeli wrongheadedness. (Much later, she acknowledged a possible lapse of sensitivity.)

BUT DON'T think I haven't put Israel's case to this friend many times. In between the annual birthday cards I began mailing her op-eds from this newspaper and others, written by people I felt explained the "situation" far better than I ever could. They weren't automatic defenses of Israeli policies, rather attempts to lay out our very nuanced reality. Ok, I chose more than a few that I thought demonstrated the justice of Israel's cause. And, especially during these five years of imposed war, I thought I was getting somewhere.

Then this request arrived: "Please don't send any more articles. It's too depressing. I can't cope with it."

I understood. Confronted by too many facts that didn't fit the liberal Left's knee-jerk view of Israel she was, perhaps unconsciously, taking refuge in the Victorian female's ploy of pleading faintness and calling for the smelling salts.

And that view of Israel is knee-jerk, for the most part. A newer acquaintance, visiting last week from the UK, confided to me over lunch: "It's awful, really. These are intelligent, educated British Jews who see themselves as fair and openminded. One would like to think one belongs to their group - but it seems that to do so one has to be anti-Israel."

I WISH our security fence was as impenetrable as these liberals' rigid outlook, according to which, as my friend once earnestly explained, "Israel's problem is that there are people on one side confronting an army on the other." I wish the field on which Israel has been forced, since its creation, to play a deadly game was level. I wish those who consider themselves fair and openminded really were. I wish people didn't grow apart. I wish I had the courage to tell my old friend: "We had something precious, but the core has emptied out. Let us agree to let it go."

<title>Anti-Israel on campus: Louder, not more effective</title>
<date>15/2/2006</date>
<content>
Two conferences organized by pro-Palestinian groups, which are taking place this week on the campuses of Oxford and Georgetown universities, have as their explicit goal the academic boycott of, and divestment from, Israel.

Last week a conference on academic freedom organized by the American Association of University Professors, and due to take place next month in Italy, was cancelled after it was revealed that a third of the invitees actively supported an academic boycott of Israel, and that an article denying the Holocaust had been circulated among conference participants (the AAUP later called its circulation "an egregious error").

Is this series of events indicative of a growing momentum among anti-Israel organizations on campuses abroad? To some observers, "yes" may seem like an obvious answer. A more careful analysis of these and other recent anti-Israel events, however, reveals that at their core is a rather small group of extreme anti-Israel activists, whom - however persistent - do not seem to be garnering further international support.

"What is common to all these events," Bar Ilan University Prof. Gerald Steinberg told The Jerusalem Post, "is the strategy of demonizing Israel, with the goal of portraying it as the new apartheid state." At the same time, Steinberg - who is chair of the university's International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom - agreed that the organizers of these events are "a small number of people with a commitment to the cause," and that this cause is not gaining momentum.

"There's a lot of noise, but they don't seem to be attracting new members," he said. "It's the same people doing the same things with less support."

The Italian conference, however, was a different matter. "The threat at Bellagio was greater because it was not an outright anti-Israel conference," he said. "Its organizers did not wish to introduce the Middle East to the center of the debate, but the conference got sidetracked, so that the motive behind it was not clear. The people at Oxford wouldn't have cancelled, because the anti-Israel nature of their conference is at its core."

Steinberg added, "I don't want to underplay the subject - there is a formidable threat to Israel, and campuses are still a rough place for Zionists and Israelis, but we are capable of fighting the problem in ways we didn't have the means to do two or three years ago."

David Newman, professor of Politics and Government at Ben-Gurion University, was actively involved in countering last year's attempt to boycott Israeli academics by the Association of University Teachers in Britain.

"I think we're being really paranoid," Newman told the Post, arguing that this week's conferences posed no real danger.

"If they were taking place on behalf of the universities, that would have been an entire different matter," he said. "But it's a small group of people, and I don't think they threaten Israeli academia."

<title>Challenging the NGO mythology</title>
<date>11/3/2006</date>
<content>
For years well-connected groups that claim human rights as their agenda have been bombarding the Israeli courts (and media) with allegations of abuses primarily involving the IDF. Israeli officials have mostly ignored these non-governmental organizations (NGOs), allowing their radical political agendas and selective reporting based on "Palestinian eye-witnesses" to go unchallenged.

The damage to Israel's image has been immense.

Partly as a result of NGO activities, boycotts and divestment campaigns are spreading, and senior IDF officers are threatened with possible arrest in London, Brussels, and even in the US.

The cost of silence has finally sunk in, and several Israelis officials are now taking a new approach. For instance, Attorney Nira Mashriki of the State Prosecutor's Office submitted a legal brief responding to a action involving an NGO with the moral-sounding name of "Hamoked: Center for the Defense of the Individual," and backed, in turn, by B'Tselem, which calls itself the "Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories."

They are representing a Palestinian resident of east Jerusalem who is suing the government claiming harassment, abusive interrogations and unnecessary delays at checkpoints.

But Mashriki asked the court to reject their requests for information about security personnel and procedures, arguing that both groups "undermine the existence" of the State of Israel, "cause it damage in the world" and hurt the security forces.

Breaking the taboo of political correctness, she wrote that HaMoked's claim to be "a human rights organization has no basis in reality and is designed to mislead."

The brief notes that the NGO "is funded by outsiders [including European governments, the New Israel Fund, and the Ford Foundation] whose interests differ from those of the State of Israel and sometimes contradict them."

And it "works in the interest of [the Palestinians], whose elected leadership is currently in a harsh conflict with the State of Israel and is undermining its existence."
As our own NGO Monitor points out, HaMoked routinely uses terms such as "apartheid" to help erase the context of terror.

B'TSELEM COOPERATES closely with Hamoked and other politicized NGOs, and its activities are also distant from its image as a neutral reporter on human rights. Their one-sided analyses, including Palestinian casualty reports that count combatants as "victims," are used by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International to promote campaigns which serve to demonize Israel.

The latest US government report on human rights in Israel, released Thursday, is influenced by B'Tselem's tendentious reporting.

But Mashriki puts her cards on the table, condemning B'Tselem's use of human rights claims to attack "the State of Israel and its security forces throughout the world."

Mashriki's straightforward approach comes shortly after a recent statement made by outgoing Supreme Court deputy president Mishael Cheshin in rejecting claims of false-flag human rights groups demanding automatic entry for Palestinians who marry Israelis.

Cheshin noted that the "family unification" case before the court - and presumably the NGOs that pressed it - served the interests of Palestinians whose leaders "intend to destroy our state... Why should we allow people who could carry out terrorist attacks to enter? We're at war."

In a single sentence, Cheshin identified the immorality of human rights claims that systematically and deliberately erase the context of terror: "This is a matter of life and death, and the right to life has priority."

Making the same point, but in an entirely different way, IDF Chief of Staff Dan Halutz recently invited members of Machsom Watch in for a chat. This group also exploits human rights rhetoric to promote a political agenda that blames Israel exclusively for "the occupation" and the continuing conflict. Its subjective and often second-hand allegations of human rights violations at IDF checkpoints accuse soldiers of deliberately humiliating Palestinians, while the context of terrorism tends to be ignored.

By seeing the group, Halutz gave Machsom Watch publicity and prestige in the hope that his agenda, rather than theirs, would prevail.
Halutz declared that "Humanitarianism is not exclusively owned by Machsom Watch and it is tested not only at the checkpoints, but also in preventing suicide bombers from reaching the markets of Tel Aviv and Netanya..."

The checkpoints save lives. While there may be some cases of abuse, Machsom Watch's exaggerated allegations obscure the larger reality.

Mashriki's brief, Cheshin's finding, and Halutz's statement, by themselves, will do little to offset the dollars available to Hamoked and similar interest groups allowing them to pursue agendas that ultimately serve to demonize Israel.

Indeed, the counterattack against Mashriki began immediately. HaMoked director Dalia Kerstein filed a protest with Attorney-General Menachem Mazuz arguing that "attacks by the state on human rights organizations" and their legitimacy "pose a serious threat to democratic rule."

A single brief written by a non-conformist lawyer in the prosecutor's office, a statement made by a retiring justice, and an ill-considered meeting with the chief of staff are not enough to defeat the pressure groups waging political war against Israel.

The IDF and Justice Ministry need to focus resources on refuting the false reports of these groups rather than ignoring them. And Israeli diplomats in the Foreign Ministry should give priority to ending the flow of funds from European governments to such NGOs. Like the military analog, winning the political war will require an appropriate strategy and perseverance.

<title>Concessions: Cause and effect</title>
<date>14/6/2006</date>
<content>
Israel's international standing is at an all-time low. Academics and journalists are questioning whether Israel even has a right to exist; it is increasingly described as an "apartheid state"; and campaigns to boycott and/or divest from it are gaining momentum. And, contrary to the prevailing wisdom, which holds that Israel's standing is bolstered by concessions to the Palestinians, these developments occurred not while Israel was still refusing to recognize the PLO or evacuate settlements, but after a string of major Israeli concessions.

So why have Israel's concessions brought opprobrium rather than acclaim? As explained in last week's column, one reason is that Israel has stopped articulating its own valid claim to the West Bank and Gaza, thereby according the Palestinian narrative - that these territories are stolen Palestinian land - the status of unchallenged truth and condemning itself as a thief. Thieves do not deserve acclaim for surrendering some of their ill-gotten gains; they deserve opprobrium for not disgorging the rest.

However, there is another, no less important, reason, which relates to a small but influential group of radical pro-Palestinian activists: Quite simply, Israel's behavior in recent years has stimulated the instincts of a hunter scenting blood.

EVER SINCE it signed the Oslo Accord in 1993, Israel has been ditching its former "red lines" with increasing rapidity. No negotiations with a terrorist organization; no Palestinian state; no concessions on Jerusalem; no negotiations under fire; no unilateral withdrawals; no withdrawals under fire - all these positions enjoyed a massive Israeli consensus before Oslo, but have been abandoned since.

Moreover, these concessions were made in response to pressure, and in exchange for constantly decreasing diplomatic and security returns - thereby undermining the once widespread belief that Israeli concessions could best be obtained by offering meaningful compensation.

When Israel agreed to return Sinai to Egypt in 1978, for instance, it did so following a five-year cease-fire, and in exchange for a full-fledged peace treaty backed by international guarantees, including a multinational force in Sinai.

By contrast, when Israel gave Gaza and Jericho to the PLO in 1994, it did so following six years of terrorist violence (the first intifada) and unprecedented diplomatic pressure: America's conditioning of loan guarantees for immigrant absorption on a settlement freeze. And in exchange, it received only an interim agreement, with no international guarantees.

The Palestinians proceeded to massively violate their main obligation under this accord, which was to end terror: In the 30 months after Oslo, Palestinian terrorists killed more Israelis than during the entire preceding decade. Yet in 1995-97, Israel transferred six other West Bank cities to Palestinian control - again partly due to American pressure, and in exchange for nothing more than a Palestinian reiteration of their previously disregarded no-violence pledge.

Then, in July 2000, Israel offered the Palestinians some 88 percent of the territories, including part of east Jerusalem. The Palestinians refused and launched the second intifada, the worst terrorist violence Israel has ever known. But the violence, instead of generating international support for Israel, generated pressure for additional concessions. And Israel responded by upping its offer at the subsequent Washington and Taba talks, to about 95 percent of the territories, plus the Temple Mount.

Not only did the Palestinians still refuse, but over the next five years, Palestinian terror claimed over 1,000 Israeli lives - more than during the entire preceding 52 years. Yet much of the world continued to demand more Israeli concessions. And Israel's response? In summer 2005, it evacuated every last settler and soldier from Gaza - something it had previously refused to do without a final-status accord - without receiving anything, even an interim agreement, in exchange.

THE PALESTINIAN response was twofold: daily rocket fire on southern Israel from evacuated Gaza, and a landslide electoral victory for Hamas, which does not even pay lip service to peace with Israel. Yet Israel responded by proposing a much larger unilateral withdrawal, from about 90 percent of the West Bank, which will entail evacuating some 80,000 settlers - 10 times the number evacuated from Gaza. And while initially, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that he would demand international recognition of the new lines as Israel's border in exchange, he is now declaring that the withdrawal will take place no matter what - even for no diplomatic return at all.

The upshot of this process is that the Palestinians and their supporters have become convinced that there is no red line that Israel will not eventually abandon, for no recompense at all, if they just keep ratcheting up the pressure - through terror, on the Palestinians' part (this belief played a major role in Hamas's election), and through boycott and divestment campaigns by their overseas supporters.

Thus it is no accident that the latest anti-Israel boycott, by the Ontario branch of Canada's largest labor union, CUPE, is explicitly slated to continue until Israel grants Palestinian refugees a "right of return" - a euphemism for eradicating Israel demographically. CUPE's leaders believe that Israel will abandon this red line as well if enough people just apply enough pressure.

Radical pro-Palestinian activists are obviously a small minority of the Western world. But it only takes a small minority to create a massive anti-Israel campaign - because boycotts and divestments are usually approved not by an organization's full membership, but by a cadre of activists. In the academic boycott approved last month by the British lecturers' union NATFHE, for instance, only 198 of NATFHE's 67,000 members participated in the vote - of which 109 voted in favor. Thus to secure a boycott or divestment resolution, committed activists need persuade relatively few people. The broader membership, for whom the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is rarely high priority, is unlikely to intervene.

Thus if Israel wants to stem its growing international ostracism, it must first convince the world that pressure is counterproductive rather than effective. And to do that, it must stop responding to pressure by making ever-increasing concessions in exchange for ever-diminishing returns.

Olmert's proposed withdrawal will be a vital test case. If he persists in implementing it without substantial international compensation, the hunters will know that the prey is still weakening, and they will continue going for the jugular.

<title>Conference to battle for academic freedom [pg. 6]</title>
<date>25/1/2006</date>
<content>
Following a successful campaign to persuade the British Association of University Teachers (AUT) to rescind its proposed boycott of Israeli universities last year, a conference on academic freedom opens today at Bar-Ilan University.

"We had decided to wage war on that boycott not so much because of our fear that Bar-Ilan would be hurt by it, but because of our fear that the structure of scientific research in the Western world would be hurt," said Bar-Ilan Rector Yosef Yeshurun.

Following the AUT boycott attempt, Bar-Ilan founded the International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom, which currently has 450 members worldwide.

While focussing on the proposed boycott of Israel and its relationship to anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, the conference will also discuss the concept of academic freedom in a universal context and examine its implications in different arenas, ranging from North America to China.
Panelists at the conference will include British Ambassador to Israel Simon McDonald, Harvard University Prof. Alan Dershowitz, and Tel Aviv University's Prof. Asa Kasher, among others.
Bar-Ilan University's Prof. Gerald Steinberg, chair of the conference's organizing committee, said that the essence of the conference was to examine whether there are limits to academic freedom - such as, for example, Holocaust denial, or the abuse of the notion of academic freedom for political campaigns.

Prof. Jon Pike of the UK's Open University, who was actively involved in overturning the AUT boycott, said that he believed that last year's initial boycott decision at the AUT was passed undemocratically, and that it was not an appropriate way to criticize the actions of the Israeli government.

"This is not to say we were not concerned by the situation facing Palestinian professors and students, and we are opposed to the occupation of the West Bank," Pike said. "But we thought that aiming to coerce Israeli academics into political agreement was wholly wrong and anti-Semitic."
Pike, who is a philosopher, will devote his talk at the conference to the ethical implications of the rescinded boycott.

He also wanted to underscore, he said, that the same standards of academic freedom demanded by Israelis had to apply to Palestinian academics whose academic freedom was being infringed upon by Israel.

University of London's Prof. David Hirsh, who also actively opposed the AUT boycott, is set to speak in a panel devoted to the ideological foundations of the boycott campaign.

"We share certain criticism of Israel," Hirsh said, "but think the way in which the term 'Zionist' was used during the boycott campaign made it into a term of insult associated with racism and apartheid, rather than with the actuality of Israeli policy."

"The fact that Israel was demonized rather than criticized is problematic," Hirsh added.

While he said he believed that the boycott attempt made by the AUT no longer posed a serious threat for the moment, he said that the politics and ideas behind it were important to examine - especially the notion that Israel was utterly different than any other country, and deserving of particular punishment for what may considered to be the infringement of human rights.

<title>Exposing a dangerous myth</title>
<date>4/9/2006</date>
<content>
Old myths never die.  They just fade from time to time only to reappear when conditions seem to favor fantasy over reality.  Unfortunately, we are beginning to hear from proponents of such wishful thinking here in America.  The crux of the argument is that Israel and the United States are the cause of Islamic angst and aggression now running amuck in the Middle East.  They propose that apartheid Israelâ€šs occupation of Arab land, suppression of impoverished Palestinians, and American imperialism have teamed up to cause a volatile, yet somehow justified reaction in the world of Islam.

The pathway to peace and tranquility is for America and her allies to go home, mind their own business but keep sending boatloads of carrots to assuage Arab and Muslim anger.  The call is for Israel to make more concessions and more land giveaways, coupled with less inclination to defend itself while opening the floodgates to Arab immigration at levels that will imperil the survival of the Jewish State.  If this becomes the case, Islamists will stash their suicide belts, defuse their missiles, teach their children love, not hate, and go back to making an honest living for themselves and their families.

That's the myth.  It has nothing to do with reality.  And try as one might, reality cannot be wished away.  In the real world, Islamists are on a crusade to establish a global Islamic caliphate.  Their intentions may be ignored or explained away by Western apologists, but they make no bones about their intentions.  Some cryptic words by the late Abu Musab al-Zarqawi make the case.  "We will either achieve victory over the human race or we will pass to the eternal life."

Journalist Daniel Pipes stated that Islamists have made themselves clear:  A caliphate, an Islamic global empire is their vision.  "It," says Pipes, "requires monumental denial not to acknowledge it, but we Westerners have risen to the challenge."

Disproving the myth
The Islamist's campaign of bloodshed, death and destruction cannot be blamed on Israel, America, or any in the Western democracies.  The proof is whatâ€šs happening in countries with little or nothing to do with either Israel or America.  Christians are under attack.  Below is a partial list of countries where people who are not Jewish or American are paying with their lives. And for what?  It is for their Christian faith.  And although the secular media and hosts of politically correct politicians choose to ignore the phenomenon, Christians continue to endure daily horrific systematic persecution, costing hundreds of thousands of lives, mutilation, rape and slavery.

Here is a partial list of countries where atrocities against Christians are taking place: Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, Algeria, Nigeria, Kenya, Iran, Pakistan, Indonesia, Yemen, Ethiopia, Somalia, Armenia, Albania, Chechnya, Dagestan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Egypt, Jordan, the Philippines; and the list goes on.

All of which says that there is a very good reason why evangelical Christians are bonding with Israel and the Jewish people at this juncture in history.  There is a confluence of common concern.  We are in a war.  And in this conflict, there is no where to hide.

<title>High Court expected to rule on fence</title>
<date>3/4/2006</date>
<content>
Petitioners asking the High Court of Justice Monday to order a halt to construction of a low concrete wall along the shoulder of a 41-kilometer stretch of road in the South Hebron Hills said the state planned to use it to move the separation barrier deeper into the West Bank or to help create an "apartheid" road system in Judea.

The petitioners, which included the towns of Dhahiriya and Samua - represented by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and attorney Giat Nasser respectively - and other Hebron-area residents represented by Rabbis for Human Rights, asked the court to issue an interim injunction freezing work on the wall until it ruled on the petition and their request for a show-cause order instructing the state to submit a detailed explanation of its reasons for building it in the first place.

The court is due to rule on the requests in the coming days.

During the hearing, Col. (res.) Danny Tirza, the chief planner of the separation barrier, told the court that the 82-centimeter-high concrete barrier was needed to protect the segments of Highways 60 and Highway 317 linking five Jewish settlements - Carmel, Maon, Sussiya, Shim'a and Tene - all of which are located several kilometers north of the separation barrier, on the Palestinian side.

Tirza said there were openings in the wall involved in the petition to allow Palestinians vehicles and pedestrians, as well as local shepherds, to cross the highways.

On the other hand, he said, the barriers would prevent Palestinians from entering the road from any point to the north or south and leaving it at will, as has been the situation until now. The existing situation made it easier for terrorists to attack Israeli vehicles on the road at will and to escape afterward, he said.

However representatives of the Council for Peace and Security, who spoke in the capacity of "friends of the court," said the cement barrier failed to contribute to security and actually made the roads more dangerous.

Col. (res.) Shaul Arieli said the barrier would provide cover for would-be terrorists to conceal themselves until a car came close enough for them to open fire or throw rocks or firebombs. They could also use the wall to prepare bombs, he said.

"All the barrier has is disadvantages," said Arieli. "There is no security advantage whatsoever, but there is security danger, from A to Z," he said.

Arieli and his colleague, retired police cmdr. Shaul Givoli, said the security problems caused by the concrete wall were so obvious that there must be some other reason for building it. "Maybe we're going back to the original route of the security barrier," said Arieli, referring to the original route approved by the cabinet, which placed the five Jewish settlements named above on the "Israeli" side along with tens of thousands of dunams of West Bank land.

The army changed the route after the High Court, in its landmark 2004 Beit Surik ruling, set out the principle of proportionality between the security benefits of a specific route compared with its cost to Palestinians.

ACRI attorney Limor Yehuda said the concrete wall would cut off Palestinians in 20 villages south of the roads from the northern part of the West Bank, while at the same time separating farmers north of the road from their fields to the south. She also said the wall would make it even harder than it already was for Palestinians to drive on the roads.

<title>Israel delays UN mission to Beit Hanun</title>
<date>9/12/2006</date>
<content>
The UN fact-finding mission to the Gaza Strip, led by South African Nobel Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu, was delayed on Saturday because Israel had not yet decided whether to grant visas to the mission's members, diplomatic officials in Jerusalem said on Saturday night.

"A decision on visas is pending," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said. "[The decision] is not about [Tutu] the person, but the process is extremely problematic, because it singles out Israel for special treatment and uses a human rights agenda to bash Israel."

Tutu was to begin leading a six-member team this weekend in the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanun investigating the botched shelling that killed 19 people in Beit Hanun on November 8.

There couldn't be a more perfect time (op-ed)
Archbishop Tutu, please be fair (op-ed)

A spokesman for the UN delegation said that it would not be making its way to the region before Monday, Israel Radio reported.

Government officials said last week they would not cooperate with the mission, but would not bar entry into the country of Tutu, a longtime critic of Israel. They said Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid efforts, was by no means "persona non-grata" in Israel.

The 47-nation United Nations Human Rights Council asked Tutu to report back by mid-December, assessing the situation of the Beit Hanun victims, addressing the needs of survivors and making recommendations on ways to protect Palestinian civilians against further Israeli attacks.

Three different officials connected to the talks between the council and Israel said they had yet to receive any indication from Israel that the mission would take place.

Diplomatic officials said the council had proven itself to be stridently anti-Israeli. The council passed an eighth resolution criticizing Israel on Friday, this time for failing to act on recommendations the body made in July that urged an end to military operations in the Palestinian Authority. Since it was founded in June, the council has condemned only Israel.

"Even UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has condemned the council for being biased against Israel, so we don't need to again voice our dissatisfaction with their completely biased way of presenting issues," an Israeli government official said.

The council noted with regret that Israel has failed to release a group of PA cabinet ministers from Hamas it arrested earlier this year.

"Violations of the fundamental rights of the Palestinians continue unabated," said Pakistani diplomat Tehmina Janjua on behalf of the 57-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference, which proposed the resolution. "The Palestinian ministers, officials and civilians have not been set free."

Janjua demanded that UN human rights expert John Dugard be allowed to conduct an "urgent" fact-finding mission in the region, which the council ordered at an emergency session only one month after it was called into existence to replace the discredited UN Human Rights Commission.

Criticism by the council brings no penalties beyond international attention.

Dugard, a former anti-apartheid civil rights lawyer from South Africa, has frequently clashed with Israel, which notes that he has been mandated only with investigating violations by the Israeli side. The United States - which along with Israel is only an observer at the rights body - also has dismissed Dugard's reports as one-sided.

Only Canada voted against Friday's resolution. Cameroon and Japan joined the 10 European members of the council in abstaining. The rest of Africa and Asia, along with all of Latin America, voted in favor.

Israel's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Itzhak Levanon, criticized the council for ignoring a November 26 cease-fire agreement that ended five months of fighting in Gaza.

"Why does this resolution fail to make any mention of the cease-fire between Israelis and Palestinians that persists despite the continuation of Kassam rockets fired on Israel?" Levanon asked the council.

Annan urged the council last month to deal with the Mideast
conflict in an impartial manner, and said it was time to focus attention on "graver" crises such as Darfur.

Despite his plea, the council has passed only a watered-down resolution on the western Sudanese region proposed by African countries, which urged all parties to the conflict to end human rights violations.

"The Council, regrettably, continues to defy the repeated pleas of Secretary-General Annan to move past its obsession with one-sided resolutions against Israel," said UN Watch executive director Hillel Neuer. "At the expense of victims around the world - in Burma, Libya, Zimbabwe and the 16 other places on Freedom House's 'Worst of the Worst' list - the council is reserving virtually all of its criticism for Israel, and today's resolutions guarantee that this imbalance will continue at its next session."

<title>Israeli lawyers: Rescind Palestinian travel ban</title>
<date>23/11/2006</date>
<content>
Israeli human rights lawyers said Thursday they have asked the IDF to overturn the latest restriction on Palestinian movement - a ban on Palestinians riding in cars with Israeli license plates in the West Bank.

The army has cited security reasons for the ban, which is to go into effect in January.

However, human rights activists said the order is part of a wider Israeli scheme to create separate road systems for Israeli settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank and to keep Palestinians from 20 percent of the territory. The restrictions will also hamper the work of humanitarian organizations in the Palestinian territories, the activists said.

"This is a part of a network of orders that creates the physical and legal reality of separation between ethnic groups present in the West Bank," lawyer Michael Sfard wrote on behalf of the Israeli rights group Yesh Din to Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz. "This is exactly how apartheid is defined."

Cars owned by Israelis and West Bank Palestinians have different plates, black on yellow and green on white, respectively. West Bankers have always been barred from driving cars with Israel plates, but until now could ride in them as passengers. Under the new order, that would be forbidden, even in the West Bank.

<title>Israel may deny visas for Tutu fact-finding trip</title>
<date>10/12/2006</date>
<content>
Israel has not decided whether to grant visas to members of a UN fact-finding mission to the Gaza Strip led by South African Nobel Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu, diplomatic officials in Jerusalem said on Saturday night.

Tutu was to begin leading a six-member team this weekend in the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanun investigating the botched shelling that killed 19 people in Beit Hanun on November 8.

"A decision on visas is pending," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said. "[The decision] is not about [Tutu] the person, but the process is extremely problematic, because it singles out Israel for special treatment and uses a human rights agenda to bash Israel."

Government officials said last week they would not cooperate with the mission, but would not bar entry into the country of Tutu, a longtime critic of Israel. They said Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid efforts, was by no means "persona non-grata" in Israel.

The 47-nation United Nations Human Rights Council asked Tutu to report back by mid-December, assessing the situation of the Beit Hanun victims, addressing the needs of survivors and making recommendations on ways to protect Palestinian civilians against further Israeli attacks.

Three different officials connected to the talks between the council and Israel said they had yet to receive any indication from Israel that the mission would take place.

Diplomatic officials said the council had proven itself to be stridently anti-Israeli. The council passed an eighth resolution criticizing Israel on Friday, this time for failing to act on recommendations the body made in July that urged an end to military operations in the Palestinian Authority. Since it was founded in June, the council has condemned only Israel.

"Even UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has condemned the council for being biased against Israel, so we don't need to again voice our dissatisfaction with their completely biased way of presenting issues," an Israeli government official said.

The council noted with regret that Israel has failed to release a group of PA cabinet ministers from Hamas it arrested earlier this year.

"Violations of the fundamental rights of the Palestinians continue unabated," said Pakistani diplomat Tehmina Janjua on behalf of the 57-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference, which proposed the resolution. "The Palestinian ministers, officials and civilians have not been set free."

Janjua demanded that UN human rights expert John Dugard be allowed to conduct an "urgent" fact-finding mission in the region, which the council ordered at an emergency session only one month after it was called into existence to replace the discredited UN Human Rights Commission.

Criticism by the council brings no penalties beyond international attention.

Dugard, a former anti-apartheid civil rights lawyer from South Africa, has frequently clashed with Israel, which notes that he has been mandated only with investigating violations by the Israeli side. The United States - which along with Israel is only an observer at the rights body - also has dismissed Dugard's reports as one-sided.

Only Canada voted against Friday's resolution. Cameroon and Japan joined the 10 European members of the council in abstaining. The rest of Africa and Asia, along with all of Latin America, voted in favor.

Israel's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Itzhak Levanon, criticized the council for ignoring a November 26 cease-fire agreement that ended five months of fighting in Gaza.

"Why does this resolution fail to make any mention of the cease-fire between Israelis and Palestinians that persists despite the continuation of Kassam rockets fired on Israel?" Levanon asked the council.

Annan urged the council last month to deal with the Mideast
conflict in an impartial manner, and said it was time to focus attention on "graver" crises such as Darfur.

Despite his plea, the council has passed only a watered-down resolution on the western Sudanese region proposed by African countries, which urged all parties to the conflict to end human rights violations.

"The Council, regrettably, continues to defy the repeated pleas of Secretary-General Annan to move past its obsession with one-sided resolutions against Israel," said UN Watch executive director Hillel Neuer. "At the expense of victims around the world - in Burma, Libya, Zimbabwe and the 16 other places on Freedom House's 'Worst of the Worst' list - the council is reserving virtually all of its criticism for Israel, and today's resolutions guarantee that this imbalance will continue at its next session."

<title>Israel must 'take back the narrative'</title>
<date>2/7/2006</date>
<content>
Irwin Cotler, international human rights lawyer and former Canadian justice minister, on Friday called for Israel to "take back the narrative" in the Middle East conflict.

Cotler, who spoke at the annual general meeting of the Israeli branch of the Lions of Judah - the international Jewish women's organization that raises money from women for Israel projects run by women for women - rejected as untrue the widely held idea that the root of the conflict is occupation, with Israel perceived as an apartheid state.

The conflict was not about borders, said Cotler, but about the refusal of the Hamas-led Palestinians and most Arab states to accept a Jewish state in the Middle East.

"It's double rejection" said Cotler. Not only did the Arabs reject Israel's right to exist at the dawn of Israel's statehood, they were prepared to forgo Palestinian independence if it meant accepting a Jewish state, he said.

"Now they're willing to destroy the Jewish state, even if it means not having a Palestinian state," he said.

In taking back the narrative, said Cotler, Israel must make it clear that radical transnational Islam is as much a danger to Muslims as it is to the rest of the world; and that the canards of dual loyalty is contrary to the principles of freedom of expression and freedom of speech.

Focusing on the "escalating, virulent, global and even lethal new anti-Jewishness," Cotler said it went beyond equating Zionism with racism and denied Israel the right to live as an equal member of the family of nations.

This new anti-Semitism, he said, was expressed politically, ideologically, theologically and economically.

In reviewing the "mega events" of the past year that have impacted on the Jewish people and the world at large, Cotler cited, "The state sanctioned genocidal anti-Semitism of Ahmadinejad in Iran," which he said was "a toxic convergence of the most horrific of crimes with the publicly declared intention to amass nuclear weapons to wipe Israel off the map."

In a subsequent comment on the Iranian president, Cotler said, "We have a leadership that seeks a Middle East holocaust at the same time that it denies the Nazi holocaust."

In a reference to Hamas, Cotler spoke of the "election of a terrorist entity to be a government."

Calling the Palestinian Authority a "terrorist government," Cotler said this was the correct terminology, "not because I say so, but because they proudly assert it."

Part of the Hamas Covenant, said Cotler, blamed Jews for all the evils of the world and said they should be eradicated.

The same attitude was reflected in the emergence of global, totalitarian transnational Islam, said Cotler.

Israel was the only country and Jews were the only people that were the standard object of genocidal anti-Semitism, he said, adding that acts of terrorism give expression to this genocidal anti-Semitism.

Cotler also pointed to the dangers of "home-grown terrorism" in which Muslims born in Britain, the US and Canada embrace radical ideologies. He quoted a survey which found that 80 percent of British Muslims believed that Jews were a legitimate target.

Cotler is also concerned at the emergence of "the old, ugly canard of double loyalty," where Jews who are members of the US administration or lobbyists in organizations such as AIPAC are blamed for the war in Iraq, for 9/11 and even for the avian flu.

The meeting was held at the home of Evelyn Douek, whose late father Leon Taman and Cotler were in 1975 among the founders of the World Organization of Jews of Arab Countries (WOJAC), a non-government organization recognized by the United Nations as representing the interests of Jews from Arab countries with regard to population exchanges and compensation for communal and personal property left behind when they were forced to flee their countries of origin.â€¢

<title>Israel won't bar Desmond Tutu's entry</title>
<date>3/12/2006</date>
<content>
Israel will not cooperate with a UN fact-finding mission to investigate last month's botched IDF shelling in Beit Hanun that killed 19 people, but will not bar entry into the country to the mission's head, South African Noble Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu.

Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid efforts, is by no means "persona non-grata" in Israel, a senior government official said Sunday. But, he added, Israel would not cooperate with the mission, just as it did not cooperate with a fact-finding mission the UN sent in 2002 to investigate what the Palestinians claimed then was the "Jenin massacre."

The official said it would not do Israel any good to bar entry to Tutu, since he could easily fly into Egypt and enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing.

The United Nations Human Rights Council, a body that diplomatic officials have said has proven itself to be stridently anti-Israeli, set up the fact finding mission last month, and Tutu is supposed to report back by the middle of December.

"I am honored to have been asked by the United Nations to lead a fact-finding mission to the Gaza Strip," Tutu was quoted over the weekend as saying. "We have been asked to assess the situation of victims, address the needs of survivors and make recommendations on ways and means to shield civilians from military assault."

While the Foreign Ministry has pointedly refrained from responding directly to questions about the mission and whether Israel would cooperate with it, the ADL last week blasted the UN Human Rights Commission and the appointment of Tutu, a former Anglican Archbishop, to lead its team to Beit Hanun.

"The appointment of Desmond Tutu as head of the fact-finding mission to Beit Hanun is an extension of the anti-Israel kangaroo court tactics used by the UN Human Rights Council," ADL national director Abraham Foxman said in a statement.

"No fact-finding mission can produce balanced and trustworthy results if its leader professes to know all the answers beforehand," he said. "Tutu has already publicly expressed his anti-Israel views and his opinions regarding what happened in Beit Hanun, and combined with the one-sided, anti-Israel mandate provided by the [UN Human Rights Council] resolution, the results of the mission are all but preordained."

<title>Jerusalem, UN at odds over whether Israel blocked Beit Hanun mission</title>
<date>11/12/2006</date>
<content>
Although Israel had not made a final decision on what type of visa to grant Nobel Laureate Desmond Tutu, UN officials told AP Monday that Israel had blocked a UN fact-finding mission to the Gaza Strip that Tutu was to lead. Tutu himself said he was distressed by Israel's lack of cooperation.

A decision whether to grant Tutu a visa "was still pending," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said Monday.

"Israel heard that they decided not to come," he added. "We had not given them a negative response. Our final decision was pending."

"At times not making a decision is making a decision," Tutu said.

Israeli government officials told The Jerusalem Post the discussion was over what type of visa to issue. Tutu, according to the officials, wanted a VIP visa, but Israel was only interested in granting him a regular tourist visa. There was likewise discussion about whether only Tutu or the entire six-member team would get visas.

The team was set up last month by the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva and charged with investigating the killing of 19 civilians by an errant IDF artillery shell last month. The team was supposed to report its findings by Friday.

Since the committee was set up, Israeli officials have expressed concern that it would simply be a vehicle to "bash Israel."

"We do not have a problem with the personalities, we have a problem with the institution," Regev said. "We saw a situation where the human rights mechanism of the UN was being cynically exploited to advance an anti-Israel agenda. This would do the Israelis, the Palestinians and peace in the Middle East no good at all. This would also have done nothing to serve the interest of human rights."

The 47-nation council, which even UN Security Council Secretary-General Kofi Annan had criticized for being biased against Israel, authorized the mission last month, to assess the situation of the Beit Hanun victims, address the needs of survivors and make recommendations on ways to protect Palestinian civilians against further Israeli attacks.

Government officials said last week they would not cooperate with the mission, but would not bar entry into the country of Tutu, a longtime critic of Israel. They said Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid efforts, was by no means persona non-grata in Israel. The officials said it would not do Israel any good to bar entry to Tutu, since he could easily fly into Egypt and enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing.

Tutu said Monday that the Israeli government's failure to permit a fact-finding mission to investigate Israeli-Palestinian violence was "very distressing."

"We find the lack of cooperation by the Israeli government very distressing, as well as its failure to allow the  timely passage to Israel," he told reporters after UN officials said Israel had blocked his UN fact-finding mission to the Gaza Strip.

Tutu said he had accepted the mission on behalf of the UN Human Rights Council "at short notice."

"We canceled important commitments to make ourselves available for this task and to submit a report by mid-December to the council," he said, adding that to take up the mission he had left the bedside of his wife, who was in a hospital following a knee operation.

Because of the failure of Israel to approve the mission in time, the mission team had to cancel its appointments in Israel and the Gaza Strip with people involved in the conflict, UN officials said.

Israeli officials have expressed concern that Tutu's mission was only entrusted with investigating alleged human rights violations committed by Israel, and not also by Palestinian terrorists.

<title>Jews against Israel</title>
<date>21/2/2006</date>
<content>
Last week in England, the Cartoon Jihad was not all the rage. There was time aplenty to smear Israel. In truth, judging by the surge of anti-Israel rhetoric, one could almost be misled into thinking that it was not about Danish cartoons that Muslim mobs were burning European embassies and stoning European peace-keepers.

First, the Church of England's Synod voted to divest from Israel, proving - if any further proof were needed - that the Anglican Church has morphed into the liberal-democrats' party conference assembled in prayer.

Not to be outdone by their spiritual leaders, students hosted anti-Israel events: at Warwick University there was a debate on the alleged Palestinian "right of return"; at Oxford there was an "Israel apartheid week"; and at Cambridge the Student Union debated whether Zionism is the most dangerous threat to the Jewish people.

With Hamas in power, Iran ranting and going nuclear and the Middle East on fire on account of 12 cartoons, the Cambridge Student Union could do better than devote its yearly debate on regional issues to whether Jews have a right to self-determination. In the event, all it proved was that intelligence is not a prerequisite for admission into top British universities.

Needless to say, Jews featured prominently in all these events. Haifa University's Prof. Ilan Pappe spoke at both Warwick and Oxford, where he was introduced by his comrade, Prof. Steven Rose of academic boycott fame. Their UCLA colleague, Gabi Piterberg, offered the opening speech at Oxford (though he bailed out of the Cambridge debate at the last minute).

BUT IT WAS at Cambridge that the Jews took center stage. After all, the motion had to do with their identity. Accordingly, the Student Union ensured that the two opposing teams of debaters included Jews only. Perhaps that is why Piterberg bailed out: He did not want to be a member of a segregated panel where Arabs did not have the same right as Jews to discuss and demean Jewish identity.

In the end, though, what is good for the Jews was determined not by the Jews themselves - though the fight was fair and the arguments poignant - but by a vote of the assembled Union. This time it was a close call, with those defending Zionism losing by only four votes.

The Ayes won narrowly, 125-121, but the Jews would have lost anyway. In the minds of the liberal elites of tomorrow's Europe, Jews can never determine their own identity. Only others can, those who know better than the Jewish people what's good for them.

And though nearly half the Jewish people live in Israel and the other half overwhelmingly gives Israel a central place in their own Jewish identity, liberal intellectuals know better: We, the enlightened liberal elite, will dictate the conditions for a Jewish identity the world can tolerate. And when we do that, we can always find a token Jew to endorse this view.

Pitching Jews against Jews is not a novelty, and in the latest Israel hate-fests it appears to be the most popular show in town. The Cambridge event was a repetition of last year's Intelligence Squared debate that saw Melanie Phillips, Rafi Israeli and Shlomo Ben-Ami face Avi Shlaim, Jacqueline Rose and Amira Hass.

THIS TIME, the speakers were Ned Temko of The Observer, Daniel Shek of BICOM and London barrister Jeremy Brier defending Zionism against Oxford don Brian Klug, former Israeli journalist Daphna Baram and Richard Cooper, a representative for Jews for Justice for the Palestinians. Their arguments were as predictable as their victory: Klug decried the conflation of Judaism and Zionism, arguing that in the modern world there is no place for nationalism.

No place that is, except in most places, where nationalism is still proving a vital force for collective identity and political mobilization.

Baram pushed that line further by explaining that Israel's Jewish character means Israeli society is racist - the implication being that Israel must turn itself into "a state of all its citizens" and embrace multiculturalism. Given the ubiquitous nature of multiculturalism in the Arab world and the promise it holds for peaceful coexistence among religions and ethnic groups, one can excuse Baram for having permanently relocated to London.

But it was Cooper who, having compared Israel to apartheid South Africa, offered the best insight into the meaning of the debate. He complained about how the Jewish community marginalizes him on account of his political activism.

In the end, these self-flagellating Jews crave acceptance and recognition. Their views are moot inside the Jewish world, since they have, by and large, lost the argument against the Jewish mainstream and its commitment to Israel. Having been rejected by their fellow Jews, they put their venom to the service of Israel's enemies as a way of regaining a place in the sun.

Is it any wonder that they can win a debate about Jewish identity only when Israel's enemies define the terms of engagement, and have last say on the outcome?

<title>Left appalled by citizenship ruling</title>
<date>15/5/2006</date>
<content>
Israel was branded an "apartheid state" by left-wing Knesset members on Sunday, who responded fiercely to the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the existing Citizenship and Entry Law.

"We thought that the Supreme Court would be the last bastion but unfortunately, it failed in its mission," said MK Zehava Gal-On (Meretz). "The Supreme Court could have taken a braver decision and not relegated us to the level of an apartheid state."

The law, which prohibits Palestinian spouses of Israeli citizens from living within the Green Line, was lambasted by Arab MKs as "racist," while it was defended by Kadima MKs as "just and fair." Amidst the current atmosphere of the Knesset, which many Arab MKs have already declared the "most racist in recent memory" the ruling also contributed to the growing rift between Arab MKs and their counterparts.

"It is the most recent in a long line of insults," said one Hadash MK. "We'll remember this when they come to us in their time of need and ask us to join a coalition."

Several Kadima officials have speculated that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will ask the Arab MKs to join the coalition to pass his convergence plan.

The Meretz Party has also been a part of ongoing negotiations to join the coalition, although a party spokesman said it was not likely that the High Court's ruling would affect those discussions.

"Meretz chairman Yossi Beilin was similarly appalled by the High Court's ruling," said the spokesman, although he noted that the party had not released an official statement on the issue.

"The High Court's decision proves that a 'democratic, Jewish state' is a logical discrepancy, and that the two principles cannot coexist," said MK Ahmed Tibi (United Arab List-Ta'al), himself married to a Palestinian woman from Tulkarm. "This decision will tear husbands and wives, children and parents, apart."

Justice Minister Haim Ramon said that he would implement a plan with the interior minister to secure the immigration policy with basic legislation. He said that he planned to propose equal immigration regulations on citizens of all countries considered to be hostile towards Israel, not only on Palestinians.

Several MKs, including Ran Cohen (Meretz) and Dov Kheinin (Hadash) said that the court's ruling placed the burden of fighting for human rights issues back in the hands of the Knesset. Saying that the decision was "based on racism" Cohen added that he hoped to find ways to combat the law through the Knesset. Meanwhile right-wing and coalition MKs moved quickly to defend the ruling as "necessary to the state's democratic nature."

"We have to maintain the state's democratic nature, but also its Jewish nature," said Immigration Absorption Minister Ze'ev Boim (Kadima). "The Citizenship Law is an appropriate law."

MK Yisrael Hasson (Israel Beiteinu) said his only disappointment was that such a basic decision had not been made unanimously.

"I call on any Israeli married to a Palestinian and prevented from reuniting with him or her to emigrate to the Palestinian's place of residence," said MK Yitzhak Levy (National Union-National Religious Party).

Apartheid? Not here

Sir, - Apart from a two-year stint in the army and a slightly shorter interlude in Copenhagen, I spent the first 38 years of my life in the US, and the next 22 in England. I have been in Israel for the past 13 years.

My family doctor is an Arab. The surgeon who operated on my wife is an Arab. The specialist who diagnosed her problem is an Arab. One of two oncologists she consults is an Arab. My urologist is an Arab. The minor procedure he advised was performed by an Arab.

The bus company that serves the north is owned and run by an Arab consortium. Most of the pharmacists in Nahariya are Arabs. The owner of the largest fruit market in Nahariya is an Arab. My neighbor in the flat below is an Arab. Twenty percent of all students in higher education here are Arabs.

Conclusion: This is by far the most tolerant and least apartheid country I have ever lived in ("Oxford holds 'Apartheid Israel' week," February 16).

Biased view of Jabotinsky

Sir, - Colin Shindler made three assertions in his article summarizing his new book The Triumph of Military Zionism: Nationalism and the Origins of the Israeli Right ("Jabotinsky vs Begin," February 5). All three are dubious and untenable.

First, the vision of Jabotinsky is unauthentic in that it "was constructed by both David Ben-Gurion and Menachem Begin" and, moreover, was "the product of Begin's determined attempt" to claim the leadership of the national camp in the state of Israel. Second, this vision is based on "a selective reading of Jabotinsky's canon of writings." Third, it is doubtful that Jabotinsky would "have embraced military Zionism" had he lived.

Shindler goes over ground well-trod over the past two decades by partisan Israeli writers such as Yigal Eilam, Yaakov Shavit and Yochanan Shapiro. However, Jabotinsky's writings, including an 18-volume edition and, more recently, eight volumes of his letters, have been available for study for 40 years and more. Any unfaithful "construction" that any non-objective researcher such as Shindler proffers has already been debated and found wanting.

Jabotinsky fully embraced the military phase of Zionism and actually had done so in 1915 when he initiated the establishment of the Jewish Legion. In 1938, he praised the Irgun, writing: "Happy am I that I have merited such pupils as these." In 1939 he advanced the planning of an invasion of then Palestine and an Easter Uprising-like takeover of government offices. He further praised the actions of the nascent Irgun against Arab terror in June 1939 when he wrote: "My children 'write' better and more clearly than I" while seeking that the organization keep to an ethical code of armed struggle.

Jabotinsky, who attended Begin's wedding in Drohobych in May 1939 and had appointed him to the top leadership positions of Betar in prewar Europe while disagreeing with him at the 1938 World Conference of Betar, had already selected him as his main ideological heir. Begin's leadership of the Revisionist Movement (he preferred to use the term "Jabotinsky Movement" to include not only the political branch but the youth movement Betar, the Irgun and elements of Lehi, the National Workers' Federation, National Sick Fund and additional institutions) before and after 1948 was recognized and accepted by the vast majority of Betar, Revisionist and Irgun veterans.

Although, to be fair, we need to read Shindler's entire book, this excerpt already illustrates  his own selective interpretation and biased construction.

Bareheaded, truly Jewish

Sir, - Two of your readers complain about male candidates for the Knesset being pictured without kippot ("Head start," Letters, February 15). They are obviously not aware that the custom for Jews to keep their heads covered is a relatively modern one. In the 13th century it was normal for male adults in Germany and France to have their heads uncovered, even when called up to read from the Torah. The custom of keeping the head covered at all times began to come into fashion only in the 14th and 15th centuries. Jewish men in biblical and Temple times did not cover their heads.

Tractate Shabbat attributes the origin of the custom to Rabbi Nachman ben Yitzchak in the 4th century. It relates that when her son was born, the famous rabbi's mother consulted astrologers (even though this is strictly prohibited by the Bible - Deuteronomy 9-13). They told her evil spirits would make her son a thief unless she kept his head covered at all times to protect him from their influence. This she did, and Rabbi Nachman continued the practice. In the rabbi's later life, it is recorded, out of respect for their teacher his many students also kept their heads covered, and the custom spread throughout the Jewish world.

As they say - the rest is history. A similar situation has happened in modern times with followers of the late Lubavitcher Rebbe, as a sign of their allegiance, wearing a hat of the same distinctive style as the Rebbe's.

The rabbis constantly urge us to return to the ways of our forefathers in the times of the Bible and the Temple in Jerusalem. By appearing bareheaded, the prospective Knesset members are doing just that.

Why be extreme?

Sir, - "Religious Zionism is out of touch with mainstream society" says Matthew Wagner (Analysis, February 10). At present, mainstream Israeli society's only objective seems to be to isolate itself from the Palestinians as quickly and completely as possible. This aspiration has been expressed by virtually every political party, including the Likud and Yisrael-Beiteinu. The National Union/National Religious Party offers the only alternative for Israelis who object to this process.

Popular as disengagement may be as a solution to the "demographic problem," it is extreme and impractical. The withdrawal from Gaza was traumatic and costly, and few of the 1,700 families dislocated have yet found permanent housing and employment. Disengagement from the West Bank will involve between 10 and 20 times more people, families and businesses.

The NU/NRP's objective is to encourage Israelis to reconnect with their land, their culture and their religion. It rejects the establishment of a Palestinian state, as did at least 50% of the mainstream until only recently.

Autonomy may not be a permanent solution, but NU supporters see no urgent need to foster self-determination for a population that only weeks ago voted by a landslide in favor of the destruction of Israel.

Higher standard

Sir, - Lori Lowenthal Marcus is correct when she states that there are laws in Israel for dealing with the finding of human bones ("A faux controversy - and ironic, too," February 28).

However, if Ms. Marcus was resident in Israel she would know that a great many laws of the land are observed in their breach.

My house, at the entrance to Safed, borders what was once a large Muslim cemetery. Over the past 30 years I have witnessed major work done in the area where bones, grave liners and tombstones have been dug up and carted away by trucks, along with the earth and rubble, to be used elsewhere.

Several years ago when a major sewer line was installed dozens of graves were dug up and simply dumped. I contacted the local Antiquities Authority. While they were furious with the Safed Municipality, nothing was done and the desecration continued.

I agree that the deliberate destruction of Jewish graves and religious sites by Arabs is inexcusable. But we should hold ourselves to a higher standard.

Good leaders wanted

Sir, - In a country filled with smart, energetic people, why can we not seem to find ideological, moral, upright individuals capable of breaking the hold of corrupt political organizations. The powerhungry individuals currently in control of the political parties are only interested in keeping their jobs and positions by zigzagging on policy.

Until people of good conscience can work their way up the ladder of power we will continue to have governments filled with corruption and moral turpitude ("Corruption captures headlines, month before poll, as usual," February 28).

PAUL SCHNALL

Starting over

Sir, - The fact that "both settler leaders and high-ranking government officials say that the Disengagement Law did not provide for full compensation for farmers' greenhouses and that if the farmers want to build them again they will have to make up the difference, which amounts to 20 percent to 40% of start-up costs" is unfair.

Under normal circumstances, a farmer who sells his land and structures is able to use the proceeds of the sale to buy a new farm. Gush Katif farmers did not sell. They left their land at the government's request. We owe them the cost of starting all over again ("Few Gush Katif farmers have received land," February 28).

Oh my, darling

Sir, - MK Muhammad Barakei stormed out of a police interrogation saying he was angered and humiliated after being called motek ("MK Barakei leaves police probe after being called 'darling,'" February 27). I am not surprised. Bubbelleh would have been far more dignified.

JEFFREY MARLOWE

Surviving a hostile world

Sir, - It goes without saying that the transfer of funds by the EU to the Palestinian Authority flies in the face of everything the US and the EU have threatened about withholding financial aid since Hamas's velvet coup d'etat.

The Palestinian people have cast their lot with Hamas. Let them have what they have called for in such a strong voice. And let America, the EU and the Quartet withhold the aid they have foresworn.

When Israel declared independence the world stood by as the Arabs tried to annihilate an infant democracy. It was reasoned that if Israel was to survive in a hostile world it had better be able to survive that early war. The same logic should apply to the Hamas government. It's time for America and the Europeans to stand by their principles ("Israel believes EU still on board with Hamas strategy," February 27).

ALAN B. KATZ
Melville, New York

Recognize this...

Sir, - Has the whole world gone mad? When, in the annals of history, has a legitimate nation had to wait with baited breath for some people to recognize its right to exist? I find it intolerable, as a Jew and as an Israeli, hearing these words bandied about almost daily in the media ("Israel not impressed by Haniyeh's '67 scenario," February 26).

If indeed such recognition were given it would be meaningless. No matter how sugar-coated Hamas leaders might try to sound, their only real goal is to eradicate Israel. The only declaration of any value at this juncture would be for the Palestinians to lay down their arms. Their words alone are not enough.

NAOMI FEINSTEIN
Givat Ada

...or this

Sir, - I find it difficult to understand why all the major parties refuse to speak with Hamas. Have we not learned from the late Yitzhak Rabin that "you make peace with your enemies"? Have we any better enemy than Hamas?

ELISHEVA DUKOV
Petah Tikva

Eschew obfuscation

Sir, - With the new Hamas regime representing the Palestinian people, Israel has the rare opportunity to correct years of malfeasance with regard to its public relations. Israel must ensure that all comments that Hamas makes in Arabic, and thus for Arabic and Muslim consumption, are communicated to the world press, not the made-for-Western-media double-talk that Arab and Muslim countries have been sending out to obfuscate their real positions.

If Israel provided the media with a side-by-side comparison of Hamas's English and Arabic statements, anti-Israel media would be hard-pressed to continue passing themselves off as impartial while sowing the seeds of anti-Israel and anti-Jewish sentiments.

Israel failed to institute this simple procedure with the Palestinian Authority and Arafat in particular. It ought to seize this moment while it can and finally impart to the world what Israelis have known for far too long: that Hamas is a terrorist organization whose sole purpose is the destruction of Israel ("Hamas immoderation," February 27).

KEVIN KOPLIN
New York

Not just farce

Sir, - In 1938 Hitler told the world that a resolution of the Czech territorial problem would be his last such demand in Europe. In 2006 Hamas tells the world that Israel with 1967 borders, and the right of return for good measure, is not its last demand.

Both Marx and Chesterfield are out of date ("Exposing Hamas," Barry Rubin, February 27). Those who do not learn from history are not only doomed to repeat it, but to make things worse. And we had better believe that it will not be simply a "farce."

LOUIS GARB

Laughable

Sir, - Was Gershon Baskin's "How to guard the two-state option" (February 28) a pre-Purim joke?

REUVEN BEN-DANIEL
Kfar Mordechai-Gederot

Challenge

Sir, - Sadly, while academia, church leaders and some media were shirking a frank discussion of the implications of the recent lethal Islamic fury over the Prophet Muhammad cartoons, they found time and expended a great deal of effort for a series of hate-fests demonizing Israel. After all, attacking Israel is not only safe; it is popular and even attracts encouragement from Islamic fundamentalists.

Students at Oxford University, Warwick University, Cambridge and Toronto recently held anti-Israel events, and at the Palestine Solidarity Movement's conference at Georgetown University students received training in influencing the media and demonizing Israel as worse than apartheid.

My challenge then, to all who participated: Demonstrate your moral clarity, intellectual honesty and even-handedness by addressing "the Muslim threat to Western civilization" with as much fervor as you applied to your "Israel is apartheid" efforts.

MAURICE OSTROFF

Suspension of disbelief

Sir, - Shulamit Leaman imagines what would have happened if London Mayor Ken Livingstone had made an anti-Muslim remark: There would have been demonstrations in major capital cities, with violent demonstrations in London ("What if?" Letters, February 28).

However, I very much doubt that she is correct in concluding that "Livingstone would have been suspended from his job forever" as a result of the violence. He simply would not have survived the lynch mob long enough even to be censured.

MARTIN D. STERN
Salford, England

Phantom operas

Sir, - Those who deplore the Yiddish film with its male-only cast ("Forward & back," Letters, February 24) can find solace in the following: There have been an exclusively female opera (Puccini's Suor Angelica) and two male-only operas (Mehul's Joseph and Massenet's Jongleur de Notre Dame).

For all practical purposes none of these works has survived.

IGO FELDBLUM

Dance of love

Sir, - Earlier this month, I visited Israel on a familiarization trip for American travel consultants. I would like to share with you a special moment that touched me deeply, a moment that I will always remember as a symbol of the love and caring of the Israeli people.

While walking along the Eilat seafront I observed four teenage girls approaching me from the opposite direction. Suddenly, one of the young ladies jumped into my path, performed a sweet little dance and ended by blowing kisses to me. Surprised, I returned the kisses. Just as quickly, this precious child moved on with her friends. I deeply regret not capturing her photo.

There might be more peace in the world if others would visit Israel and experience the love that I received from a perfect stranger in your beautiful country.

ELAINE SHAPIRO

Great match

Sir, - In tense times it is always nice to have a good game of football to help clear the mind. So I'm looking forward to the friendly between Israel and Denmark on Wednesday.

Hopefully it will be a great match. I'm very excited about how the Israeli side will perform this time (hopefully not too well). So enjoy the match and may the best team win!

Stop the circus

Sir, - Slobodan Milosevic's trial cost $200,000,000. Saddam Hussein's trial will cost millions more. It seems absurd for the world to carry on with pedantic legalities to prove such individuals' guilt ("Milosevic's death denies history the chance of judgment," March 12).

It is difficult to justify the costs of these trials - for the goal of avoiding a possible injustice to those accused - especially when the facts are well-known. Such funds could be used far more productively feeding the starving around the world. It seems abuse of the law has become the norm, the tail wagging the dog.

Stop the circus which the Saddam Hussein trial has become at the expense of people in Darfur, Kenya, Namibia, Congo and elsewhere.

NAFTALI SIGAL
Herzliya

Gone astray

Sir, - Seymour Reich should be lauded for his many years of service to the American Jewish community. However, in his capacity as president of the Israel Policy Forum, he has gone astray; especially when setting himself and the IPF as a counter force to AIPAC ("Keep the 'two-state solution' alive," March 12).

American Jews are weakest when we show our internal disputes to both Congress and the world. For decades, AIPAC has been the unified voice of American Jewry across all denominations and boards, supporting the views of the Israeli government no matter what those views have been.

It is OK to have different opinions on the peace process; OK for Israelis that is. As an American-Israeli dual citizen I feel that only those who cast their lot by living in Israel, even if only part-time, should be the ones to decide government policy as it affects Israel. As such, I find the efforts of IPF to be troubling as they will only confuse the issue within Congress.

JAN GAINES
Netanya and Stamford, Connecticut

Do what it takes

Sir, - I am an American expat and a Christian. Unlike my government, I am not about to make demands of Israel on how it should run its affairs. However, it seems to me that when God gave the land to you, through your ancestors, he didn't do it with the caveat that you could negotiate it away with road map peace plans that don't work, and enemies who want to exterminate you.

I would like to suggest that if you intend to keep the land, you defend it with  the maximum effort possible and do what you have to do to keep it.

JIM JENSEN
Butuan, Philippines

Occupational hazard

Sir, - Debra DeLee of Americans for Peace Now, wrote that Israel is the occupying power in the West Bank and Gaza ("APN: For the record," Letters, March 12). If she believes Israel is still occupying Gaza then how can she expect anyone to attach credence to anything her group says?

A. MILES
London

Keeping up with the Jihads

Sir, - It is obviously not in America's interest, or Europe's or even Israel's to see more sanctions applied to an already poorly-funded PA.

First of all, America is of course concerned with the suffering of Palestinian civilians, as some of them are not yet in possession of weapons. If America denies funds, the Palestinians will have to get more money than they're already getting from Saudi Arabia, Iran and al-Qaida to ensure that all PA citizens have those badly needed weapons.

Second, the EU is rightly concerned that large subsidies be immediately transferred to the Palestinians for emergency additions to their vast, but rapidly depleting, arsenal.

And finally, Israel should be most concerned that the substantial tax monies it collects for the PA be speedily handed over to Hamas for urgent humanitarian necessities - like replacing all the essential bomb materials that they've been using since their founding.

How can Hamas be expected to keep up with the Aksa Martyrs Brigades, Hizbullah and Islamic Jihad without the necessary "humanitarian aid" ("Disunity among donors on how to fund a Hamas-dominated PA," March 10)?

ROBERT HARRIS
Chicago

Disproportionate vehemence

Sir, - Michael Freund's article "Neturei Karta pays solidarity visit to Iran," (March 9) garnered hundreds of "Talkback" responses on the Post's  Web site, far greater than any other article that was on the Web site at the time.

The vehemence of some of these denunciations was completely out of proportion to the significance of the Neturei Karta.

This is especially so when compared to the relatively small reaction to left-wing intellectuals who make such a fuss over the alleged violations of the Palestinians' human rights. These groups, with their constant harping on "the illegal occupation," and "the apartheid wall" are a far more serious threat to Israel than the Neturei Karta.

Both may be anti-Zionist but the leftists oppose Zionism because it is too Jewish, the Neturei Karta because it is not Jewish enough.

M. STERN
Salford, UK

Discomfort vs. safety

Sir, - Gerald Steinberg's article ("Challenging the NGO mythology," March 12) is timely, showing the damage done to Israel by so-called human rights organizations that purport to fight against Israel's human rights abuses. The claims of these organizations are based on the false premise that our measures of self-defence are intended to harass Palestinians.

Every effort has been made so that the security barrier and the various check-points cause the least inconvenience possible to the Palestinians. But we are at war and frankly, if the choice is their discomfort or my safety, I prefer the latter. When will the world learn to see this reality? Or is concern for Israeli "abuses" just another example of modern anti-Semitism?

RON BELZER
Petah Tikva

The bottom line

Sir, - Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert stated that Hamas must "accept previous agreements" with Israel before a meaningful dialogue can take place ("'Within four years, we will separate from the majority of the Palestinian population,'" March 10). This implies that Israel will also meet its signed obligations.

My question: Prior to establishing settlements were would-be settlers informed that Israel had signed the Fourth Geneva Convention which specifically forbids the establishment of civilian settlements in the territories?

To circumvent this agreement the government initially established Nahal outposts which were military in nature and could be seen as a temporary, until a final status agreement could be reached. I now understand why the government has floated the idea of removing civilian settlements and replacing them with military installations.

To add insult to injury the government is dragging its feet in fulfilling its commitment to those settlers who were forced out of their homes during disengagement. No wonder that Kadima is losing support.

PINCHAS YONAH
Shoham

Past and future

Sir, - It seems that Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad and Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert have something in common. The Iranian president called for a Holocaust-denial conference, whose outcome was known even before it started; while In Israel, Olmert stated that the election results are already known - even though so many are undecided ("Likud says Olmert's interview with 'Post' will hurt him," March 10).

Neither man is good news for Israel. One denies the past, the other predicts the future, and each believes he is always right.

BORIS CELSER
Calgary

Vote of confidence

Sir, - We were delighted to learn about Kadima's strong stand on changing Israel's antiquated electoral system ("Sheetrit: Kadima wants new election system," March 10).

We salute this effort and hope to see similar stands from all of Israel's political parties. We further hope that these election promises turn into reality and that the people will truly be represented.

ELAINE LEVITT

Migdal Tefen

Too young...

Sir, - I was outraged but not surprised by the story "Rabbis to shut schools so kids can campaign against Kadima, Labor" (March 10). When will we stop putting our children on the front lines of politics? At least the demonstrations against disengagement took place during summer break; but sending kids out during the school year to get trampled at Amona or to campaign for or against a specific party is shameful - not to mention ineffective.

Any teacher can tell you that school time can not simply "be made up." The fact that even Zevulun Orlev supports this move only underscores that the NRP is out of touch.

When my rosh yeshiva, Rav Yehuda Amital, was a minister in the Peres government, he did not let his hesder students - who at least were adults - campaign for any party, including his own.

YOSEIF BLOCH
Jerusalem

...but not too old

Sir, - According to your report, the "Panim Le'Panim" (Face to Face) campaign - which is hoping to reach 1 million voters by having "orange" volunteers go door- to-door - is intended for "young people" ("Rabbis to shut schools so kids can campaign against Kadima, Labor," March 10). Not true! A better phrase would have been "young in spirit."

I know of many grandparents who are manning the telephones to ask voters to vote so as to keep the rockets of Gush Katif from raining down on Ben-Gurion Airport. They are succeeding no less - perhaps more - than their younger colleagues.

SUSIE DYM
Rehovot

Great line

Sir, - David Horovitz's skeptical description of Richard Perle's single-strike scenario for the destruction of Iran's nuclear weapons capability, "wham, bam and good night Teheran," was a truly great line ("Men of their word," March 10).

<title>Major NGOs skip 'unfair' monitoring conference</title>
<date>15/6/2006</date>
<content>
Representatives of many major non-governmental organizations chose not to attend a conference in Jerusalem Wednesday aimed at scrutinizing their activities in the region.

NGO sources said they didn't attend because they didn't believe the conference host, NGO Monitor, was partial in its scrutiny.

NGO Monitor, an Israeli-based NGO itself, analyzes the activities of NGOs in the region, researching their sources of funding and bringing to light statements and reports that allegedly divert from the groups' mission statements.

NGO sources admitted that many groups here were fearful that negative publicity generated by NGO Monitor would harm their donor base. Others called the group an impartial forum that delivered illegitimate criticism.

Officials from the human rights watchdog Amnesty International planned to attend but later cancelled.

"We decided not to attend for the reason that the conference setting and the participants does not give a balanced ground for open and fair dialogue," said Amnon Eidan, a spokesman for Amnesty. "We felt the human rights NGOs were under-represented," he added.

Another official from a large NGO active in the region accused the NGO Monitor group of "partiality." "I don't think we get a fair hearing," the official said. But the issue was worthy of debate, and NGOs do need to be transparent, the official added.

NGO Monitor was founded following a UN conference in Durban, South Africa, ostensibly against racism and xenophobia. Israeli officials felt the conference was used as a mouthpiece for attacking their country, when Israel was accused of racism and a "policy of apartheid" by many NGOs that attended, as violence between Israelis and Palestinians raged.

According to the group, its goal "is to research and analyze the activities of...NGOs involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict, including their political agendas and funding sources." Alongside other achievements, the group credits itself with influencing the creation of the Middle East advisory board at Human Rights Watch. The group's activities have also led to a retraction of an Oxfam advertisement campaign in Belgium, and the closure by the Ford Foundation of an Italian-based conference it intended to sponsor when it became apparent it would advocate an academic boycott of Israeli institutions.

Twenty-one humanitarian aid groups met independently in Jerusalem Wednesday to coordinate their work in light of the current crisis situation in Palestinian territories. Many aid groups, whose donor countries do not allow contact with Hamas, have suspended activities since Hamas took over the Palestinian Authority government and warn of a pending humanitarian crisis.

At Wednesday's conference, panelists debated the pros and cons of allowing NGOs to deal with Hamas. Gershon Baskin, co-head of the dovish Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information, argued in favor. Baskin complained that due to the US ban on Hamas, a US-sponsored program by his organization that taught "peace education" in Palestinian classrooms had been cancelled.

Government policy "should not limit non-governmental agencies," he said, while "discrete productive meetings with Hamas" should be allowed.

However, Israeli officials are more practical and realize "we need to work with [Hamas]," said John Bell from the US-based Search for Common Ground.

Current US regulations meant his organization's attempt to coordinate measures against the spread of avian flu in the region between Israeli, Jordanian and PA government bodies had been currently put on hold, although Bell said he was optimistic his group would soon receive an exemption.

The international community needed to question the achievements of the current policy, Bell said. "Are we eroding Hamas, or damaging the Palestinian body politic, economy and social fabric?" he asked, adding that "a sober-minded approach was needed."

Olli Ruohomaki, from the Representative Office of Finland based in Ramallah, warned the current humanitarian situation in Palestinian areas was "five minutes to midnight." Finland has also closed down a number of projects in Palestinian territories since Hamas entered government, and Ruohomaki echoed a popular complaint by NGOs that their agencies "can't take the roles and responsibilities of government agencies. They don't have the capacity," he said.

<title>Pastors vow to seek end to divestment</title>
<date>28/5/2006</date>
<content>
A group of 11 Presbyterian pastors, completing a five-day fact-finding mission in Israel, vowed Sunday to work to rescind their church's 2004 Israeli divestment policy in an upcoming biennial General Assembly.

Mission members admitted, however, that they would come up against stiff opposition within the GA to any attempts to change the divestment policy.

On June 15, about 500 representatives will gather at the 217th GA of the Presbyterian Church USA in Birmingham, Alabama, which represents about 3.5 million Presbyterian laypeople.

The most volatile issue will be gay ordination, but moving forward with the divestment of the Church's $7 billion pension funds assets from multinational companies that do business with Israel will also be discussed.

The church is trying to use divestment to force Israel to change what it claims is inhumane treatment of the Palestinian people. Construction of the security barrier is an example of an Israeli policy opposed by the church.

John Kushman, Pastor of Church of the Roses in Santa Rosa, California, and National Christian Leadership Conference for Israel executive committee member, said that over the past five days, he and his peers had met with all sides: Muslims, Christians and Jews.

"We've reached the conclusion that divestment would be counterproductive," said Kushman, speaking from Karmiel on the last leg of his trip before departing Monday.

"The Palestinian and Israeli economies are interrelated," added Kushman. "We might end up hurting the Palestinians more than helping them.

"If we are already involved in this part of the world we should at least try to facilitate a two-state solution."

Timothy Smith, Pastor of the Northminister Presbyterian Church in New Mexico, said that there was a "groundswell of concern" about the church's divestment policy vis a vis Israel. He added that he expected a "grassroots push" to overturn or modify the 2004 divestment statement.

According to Presbyterian church policy, divestment is one of the strategies that can be used to bring about social change. On its Internet site, Presbyterian Church USA states, in a press release on its Israeli divestment policy, that it successfully used divestment in the 1970s and '80s to end apartheid in South Africa.

<title>Quebec's narcissistic boycotters</title>
<date>17/1/2006</date>
<content>
Some of the great "progressive" forces of Quebec have decided to boycott Israeli products and companies because of Israel's "apartheid politics." What unadulterated hypocrisy. By their deeds they have demonstrated, to their shame, the true face of that part of Quebec society that, while boldly declaring its own "distinctiveness," is really haunted by a self-doubt driven by a jealousy of others' self-belief.

The F deration des Femmes du Qu bec (FFQ), the provincial union of CEGEP teachers, Les Artistes pour la Paix, as well as the radical CSN and CSQ unions, have joined a polyglot coalition of the usual Islamist groups and some 170 Palestinian "civil society organizations." These groups are demanding sanctions against Israel similar to those imposed on the former white supremacist regime in South Africa.

This call for a boycott and divestiture from Israeli companies is not important in and of itself. It is emblematic of that part of Quebec that still cannot face its own failures. This is the remnant of "le noirceur" - that darkest of periods in Quebec history that was supposed to have ended with the fall of former premier Maurice Duplessis.

And how petty their narcissisms are. These groups want to start boycotting Israeli wines and then move on to companies such as Caterpillar that, besides tractors, sells boots, caps, toys and pocketknives to Israel: in other words, nothing that would really cause the boycotters any discomfort.

The cell phone was developed in Israel by Israelis working in the Israeli branch of Motorola. Most of the Windows NT and XP operating systems were developed by Microsoft-Israel. The Pentium microprocessor in your computer was made in Israel. Voice mail technology was developed in Israel.

So why don't these "progressives" boycott all the instruments that allow them to disseminate their hatred and propaganda? But no, that would be too inconvenient. They want to have their cake, and eat it too.

ON A political level, has the FFQ forgotten that women in Israel always had the vote, while in Quebec they fought battles in the streets for it until the end of the World War I? Have the teachers and artists forgotten that the traditions of open Israeli scholarship and artistic freedom have resulted in more Nobel Prizes being awarded to Israelis than to nations five and 10 times its size? Have the unions forgotten that Israel is the only society in the world where much of its population is affiliated with, and organized under, one big union - the dream of the world-wide labor movement - and that its per-capita income of $17,500 exceeds that of the United Kingdom?

And have all these groups forgotten that Israel is the only established liberal, pluralistic, democracy among the Muslim dictatorships that stretch from the borders of Pakistan to the Atlantic shores of Morocco?

Do they know that some 20% of the student body of Hebrew University are Israeli Arabs? That in Israel, Arabs not only have equal rights but willingly engage in the political process; sit in parliament; represent Israel as diplomats and even serve as judges. Jews on the other hand, from any land, cannot even get visas to most Arab countries.

No, they haven't forgotten. They identify with those Palestinian hatemongers who have made lucrative careers subjugating their own people. They can't stomach the fact that the Palestinian state is a de-facto reality. That Palestinians voted in free elections.

In May 2005 Israeli and Palestinian academics from Jerusalem, Haifa, Hebron and Bethlehem met in Rome and resolved to work together in such vital areas as the natural sciences, economic development and the preservation of cultural heritage. If Israelis and Palestinians can meet and work together on a constructive basis, why are groups from Quebec not supporting them, rather than engaging in mindless boycotts?

SEVERAL YEARS ago, at the first ever conference between leaders of Quebec civil society and Israeli diplomats, FTQ President Henri Mass  said that he saw nothing to condemn in Israel's policies and vehemently denounced Palestinian violence and hate. For the sake of the credibility of Quebec's true progressives, it is time to hear this message out in the open, clearly proclaimed and candidly defended.

If this is not done, Quebec's dream of a "national project" will be hijacked by purveyors of parochial prejudice rather than led by those promoting social democracy and truth.

The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said: "A society begins to die when it remains silent on injustice." In Quebec today the sound of such silence is deafening.

<title>Scent of Jasmine, taste of the east, sounds of J'lem</title>
<date>27/4/2006</date>
<content>
The place that symbolizes Jerusalem for me? To climb up the YMCA tower, at night, and gaze at the walls," says Eli Amir. "Look at the walls. See how the lights and shadows mix, the interplay of happiness and sadness. The merging of longing and reaching. The trees blur our vision and everything is so mysterious.

"So close and so far. The distance of the night, yet it seems that if you reach out, you can touch those massive walls. They are yours and they are not. They are theirs, and they are not.

"And that is the whole story of Jerusalem."

Describing the meaning of Jerusalem, Eli Amir has, perhaps unwittingly, also described himself. Meeting with In Jerusalem in honor of Independence Day and upcoming Jerusalem Day, Amir, best-selling author, publicist, former adviser on Arab affairs, former head of the Youth Aliya Department in the Jewish Agency, and regular guest on the popular radio show (with former MK Geula Cohen), "From the Right and from the Left," reveals much about himself, yet hides at least as much.

Nearly 70 years old, married with three adult children, Amir seems both younger and older. He is both decisive and ambivalent, his language combining both the polemic and poetic, the elegant and the nearly-crude.

Almost like the walls he describes, he is both present and distant, engaged in the interview - but then suddenly making a list of errands and folding it carefully into his pocket. He is alternatively vain and attentive, with an otherworldly eastern quality, sensual and earthy, that is consistently charming and embracing.

His first novel, Tarnegol Kapparot, ("The Scapegoat") is required reading for Israeli high-school students and is largely credited with bringing the social and political plight of the Jews from Arab countries, who came to Israel in the mass immigrations of the 1950s, into the mainstream public debate.

Like the characters he writes about, Amir was born in Baghdad and came to Israel at the age of 12. His family followed a few months later, but he was sent to Kibbutz Mishmar Ha'emek, a bastion of socialist-Zionism, while the family was placed in the Pardes Hanna transit camp. He rejoined his family when they moved to Katamon Vav in Jerusalem, to the "pathetic, small, immigrant neighborhood, with dusty streets" that Amir describes in his most recent novel, published last year, Jasmine.

Together with a third novel, Mafriach Hayonim ("The Dove Flyer"), these novels form a trilogy that describes the immigrant experiences of the Jews who came from sophisticated, urban Iraq and were expected, once they reached Israel, to repress their Arab identity and to adopt an "Israeli identity" free of Arab characteristics.

They were left, he says, with only a sense of "folklore" and a nostalgia for the coffee shops, Arab music and Arab Jews of Baghdad and for their lives in their traditional society. And they even hid their nostalgia behind the doors of the cramped, ugly shikunim where the Ashkenazi establishment housed them.

Yet Amir's professional life has been strikingly successful. He started out as an errand boy, but rose quickly in the ranks of the civil service. The first of his family to attend university, he studied Arabic and Middle Eastern studies.

After the Six Day War, he was appointed national adviser on Arab affairs in Jerusalem, but resigned after only a year and a half. Leaving behind the potentially successful public career, he took a lower-grade position in the Youth Aliya Department, eventually becoming head of that department.

He became an author in his early 40s. He has been a guest lecturer at several Israeli universities and his books have been translated into nearly a dozen languages.

Today, he is Chairman of the Board of the Abraham Fund, a non-profit philanthropic organization that promotes peaceful coexistence between Jews and Arabs in Israel.

Yet throughout these experiences, Amir says, he never denied his Arab-ness. "It's who I am. It's what I am. It is the root of my being."

He continues, "But I have grafted onto the root. I have been able to cast off certain eastern qualities and take on other western qualities.  I've weeded out a lot - the eastern fatalism, the blind religious belief. I've taken in the sense that a person can do whatever he wants to do with his life.

"I have taken in the love of the land. I have dug my hands into the earth - something I never would have understood in Baghdad. I have learned to value the dignity of physical labor and work. I have changed the way I view women. In Baghdad, they hid women, there was no legitimization of a woman's public presence. They could not understand that a woman can be your leader or your superior in a hierarchy, because she is essentially equal to you - all this, I have learned from the west.

"But it never occurred to me to deny my Iraqi-ness. I only changed my name after I was here for 12 years - and that was because no one could say it properly, and it was making me crazy. But I never denied who I am, because I never felt inferior - not towards the Arabs and not to the Jews."

Not that his introduction to and acculturation into Israeli society were easy.

"When I came here, I really did feel low on the status hierarchy." Then in apparent contradiction, he says, "I knew that if I were willing to pay the price, I could achieve that status. But the price was high. The struggle to succeed according to their terms, to prove myself, to do more, to show more. I tried too hard. There's no relaxation in that life."

As if the conversation were now too close, he begins to speak in the third person. "Being successful. Being an adviser. Being a director-general. Isn't that enough? No, it wasn't. No, the effendi tried in politics, too, and he failed. There are endless challenges, and I don't believe that in Baghdad, he would have faced the same relentless ambition."

Did Amir himself pay a price?

"Of course I did!" he answers with emotion, then says, with humor, "My father had a full head of hair. My brothers have full heads of hair. Only I am bald."

Then, more seriously. "My family paid the price, too. But they, the sabras, wouldn't accept what we had to offer, they thought our culture was inferior. But I knew it was about status and class. I'm not part of those political organizations that want to talk about deprivation all the time. Like the characters say in my book, if it would have been up to us, the eastern Jews, we would not have been able to establish the state. We weren't revolutionary or determined or cruel enough.

"But I can tell you this: if we would have established the state, we would have screwed the mother out of the Ashkenazim, just like they did to us. Because they were immigrants, and they were different than us. It's a universal process.

"Maybe they called us olim, but we were immigrants. Olim is a nice word. But what does it hide? Whether you came here out of Zionist beliefs or not, by choice or not, you were torn from your sources, from your roots, you had to begin all over again. 'Going up' when you come to Israel? Nonsense. You go down when you come to Israel. It takes three years just to get used to the weather and the sounds."

He speaks heatedly, but shows no anger. "In the past, I was enraged. There were times when I couldn't bear the rage. I am older now."

But he has little patience for "politically correct" ideas such as multiculturalism.

"Multiculturalism, my foot. It's just a bluff, it's just more word-washing. The Zionist ideology called for creating one Jewish culture, based on Hebrew. Each culture will contribute, but the goal is to create a native culture, here in Israel. Nostalgia belongs in museums.

"My childhood doesn't speak to my son. It was my childhood, not hisâ€¦ Yes, it makes me sad, because we are the last generation of that culture and it was a beautiful culture. But we don't live there any more. We've written the last page, and that Jewish world is gone."

Amir looks out at a small date tree, planted tenuously in the German Colony, where he works in the offices of the Abraham Fund. "I look at the date tree, it's been part of our culture for 2,750 years. Now, we're supposed to be eating kiwi and passionfruit.

"Kiwi just doesn't do it for me. Give me dates, date honey. Date honey and tehina. Not tehina with salt and lemon, but with date honey.

"And if you understand what I am telling you, then you can understand the whole story of the ingathering of the exiles."

A recent conference at the University was dedicated to a discussion of Jasmine. Learned scholars debated images of the "other" in Amir's work and analyzed his metaphors and allegories.

When he stood to respond, Amir smiled, wiped his forehead, adjusted his reading glasses and exclaimed, "Walla, kula I wrote a love story."

The audience loved it. It was Amir at his best - ironic, clever, deliberately self-deprecating, and intimate.

His Arab accent was more pronounced than usual and he peppered his response with Arabism and colloquialisms. The crowd was delighted.

"I was very happy at that conference," he explains later. "A friend told me she wanted to write me a love letter."

He breaks the conversation and dials a number by heart. "A reporter is here," he says into the phone. "She says that I sounded more Arab than I usually do. She says it was very intimate, and now I understand why we're both so happy. Bye-bye."

He hangs up and returns to the interview.

"Almost everyone who attended that conference speaks Arabic as their first or at least second language - professors from the university and Arabists, Friends from Iraq and from the Arabic-language radio. That is why they felt the same intimacy."

He acknowledges that he speaks differently in public or on the radio. "I never adopted the Sabra 'resh' and I will never sound Ashkenazi. I never tried. But when I'm speaking to an unknown crowd, when I'm not in my neighborhood or my element, I try to be more formal."

He looks carefully at this writer. "Where are you from?? Poland? Russia?

"We are both Jews, but you cannot touch my very deepest depths. I can try, I want to try, but I cannot touch your heart. How could I? We don't share the same colors, the same sensibilities.

"Not like Jasmine."

In Jasmine, Amir continues his autobiographical trilogy and also branches out into other areas. For the first time, he brings in a female heroine, a captivating, beautiful, well-educated Palestinian woman from Jerusalem, who joins Nuri Amari, his Iraqi-born protagonist (and possible alter-ego).

The novel is set in the days immediately following the Six Day War.

Jasmine combines an almost Soviet-style realism with mystery and poetics. Throughout, Amir intersperses real events and real people, such as then prime minister Levi Eshkol, mayor Teddy Kollek and others, with whom Amir himself did actually meet during his term as adviser.

Amir reviews and describes the perspectives of both Jews and Arabs in post-war Jerusalem. He introduces Abu Nabil, the Muslim nationalist and counterpoints him with Abu George, the realistic and pragmatic Christian, a refugee from Talbiyeh who has become a newspaper owner and editor.

There is Nuri, the Jew who has immigrated to Israel from Iraq and risen to become the adviser on Arab Affairs, and his father and uncle, the men who, Nuri (and Amir) believe, could have truly built the bridge between the Arab and the Jewish cultures.

And there is Jasmine, Abu George's daughter, a beautiful, passionate young widow who has studied in Paris for five years and learned to quote Frantz Fanon.

In this novel, for the first time, Amir has translated his Arab-Jewish identity into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and into the intercultural crises between East and West, men and women, and modernity and conservative traditionalism.

And it is clear that the wild, devoted, yet deeply impossible love affair between Nuri and Jasmine is yet one more allegory of the situation in our region.

Teasing his readers, Amir will never say if Jasmine really existed. Asked, he answers, "She is real. She is as real as any woman I have ever loved. I didn't want to say good-bye to her when I finished writing the book. I dedicated the book to my family and to her. She is out there, in one way or another.

Political critics have faulted Amir and Jasmine because they seem to posit a separation between the individual and the collective and between the personal and political.

Amir dismisses them with a wave of his hands. "When you go to bed at night with your wife, are you making love to Zionism??!" he asks, seemingly amused.

Yet, like Amir himself, Nuri quits his job as adviser on Arab affairs because he realizes that the establishment would never let him create a policy based on his own father's admonition: to treat the Arabs as they, the Jews, would have wanted to be treated.

"But you have to realize," he continues, "that Nuri did not see himself as an occupier or a conqueror, because Nuri exists in 1967, and not today. We cannot judge him according to today's sensibilities and consciousness."

Amir sighs, painfully. "People like Nuri, and especially like his father and uncle, could have created peace in this region. They understood the Arab culture, they were part of it. But they were ridiculed and marginalized. They were merely unemployed olim in the slums of the Katamonim." And that is part of the tragedy we face today," Amir observes.

"And that is another reason that Nuri, and maybe I, too, resigned. Even though he wasn't conscious of it at the time, he resigned as a protest, in the name of his father and uncle."

The Arabs, he says, would ultimately have come to accept people like Nuri and his family because, "They can't call me a 'Moscovian.' They know that I am from here, too, and so, in a moment of grace, a Palestinian will be able to say that he recognizes that I belong here, and that the countries of the region owe me a solution to my refugee-ness, too. But no one thinks in those directions today, and that is part of the tragedy, too.

"As a country and society, we must be from here. We must stop acting as a Western colonial conqueror. We must be part of the Middle East. Our children must learn Arabic as well as Hebrew."

That is why, he says, he is head of the board of the Abraham Fund - to help to make a change, to bring the message of peace and equality.

Every Thursday night, Amir and Geula Cohen debate politics on their popular radio program. Amir's left-wing, patient and elegant presentation provides the perfect foil for Cohen's flaming tones.

Yet Amir's position is, ultimately, very centrist. Politically, he believes in separation.

"We are different peoples. We are not ready for intimacy. So let there be a Jewish state and a Palestinian state.  This is not apartheid or racism. It's what our common sense tells us. When there is a Palestinian state, the Palestinians who choose to live in Israel as a minority will know that they are a minority. And they'll accept the rules of the game.

"And the Jews who choose to live in the Palestinians state will have to understand that they are the minority there, and they will have to accept the Palestinian rules of the game.

"So of course I believe in the disengagement. Because we cannot live with them. We have to live with ourselves.  Israel should disengage from every place that we know that we won't be there in the future - and that serves our best interests.

Amir believes that "a language of love and understanding" could bring an end to the conflict. He is very excited that Jasmine is being translated into numerous languages, including Turkish, Arabic, Russian, and German. He wishes it would be published in English.

And last month, he was delighted to be the guest of honor at a literary evening in Cairo.

But Nuri and Jasmine cannot find that common language of love. Although they both speak Arabic as their mother tongues, and speak Hebrew fluently as well, she insists on speaking to him in English, a language which neither of them speak well.

"Yes, they cannot find a common language," Amir agrees. "But they know what they could share, perhaps in another time."

Jarringly, as they make love, Jasmine calls Nuri, "my gentle conqueror."

"He conquers her not as a Jew or an Israeli, but he conquers her soul, as a lover. And she loves him in return," Amir explains.

But of course, he then acknowledges, in one of his complex internal contradictions,  "The conflict between their two peoples are there, in the background. Their love affair could not succeed, because it was too early, their peoples were not ready."

Jasmine , he concludes, is set in a time of grace, when even a love story between an Arab and a Jew seemed possible.

But that time has gone, he says. "Then, I believed that people like me could make a difference. That we could bring peace. We have missed our chance. We Israelis became greedy, demanding another strip of land, another piece of space. And the Arabs weren't ready, either. That is very sad abut our two peoples - we never share the same space of time."

"We are two peoples whose similarities are also our points of conflict. Neither of us are fully mature peoples, and each side believes that justice and truth belong to him alone. We are both Semitic and Middle Eastern peoples. and we both want this land. At the same time, we are both the descendants of Abraham and Rivka."

But the time of grace has gone and we will have to wait for another time to fulfill what we already know, he says. "In the end, Jerusalem will be an open city, a capital for two peoples. Anyone who believes that he can have Jerusalem to himself will wind up with nothing. Anyone who thinks he can unite the city into one will wind up with none."

<title>Shaping the City?</title>

The projected Center for Human Dignity-Museum of Tolerance in Jerusalem (MOTJ) recently ran into a rough spot regarding its designated site on Rehov Hillel.

Some say excavations are taking place in a Muslim cemetery, whereas others say the cemetery has been "decommissioned" (they tell me there is such a possibility under Islamic practice). Personally, I hope the issue will be sorted out in a gentlemanly manner and the project carries on. I would like to see what it looks like when completed.

The proposed MOTJ, which can be described as the Jerusalem branch of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, is actually not a building, but a community of buildings designed by star architect Frank O. Gehry in five or six different architectural dialects and straddling Rehov Hillel. The larger part of it will be built south of Hillel and west of Rehov Ben-Israel (the street cutting through Independence Park), along the edge of the present Muslim cemetery.

The complex can be seen as a fruit basket, defined by a circular arch shape on the west. Inside the basket, facing east, is a giant pineapple, made of spiraling metallic panels and alternating wedges of glass. Next to that, and closer to Hillel, is a bouquet of rectangular wedges, not unlike carrot and celery sticks. These are most akin to conventional building shapes, except that they are sloped and smashed together at various angles. Moving up and west along Hillel, but set back slightly, is a huge cobalt-blue squashed turnip, with the stalks cropped to form a glossy blue crown.

Filling in all the irregular in-between spaces and oozing into the cracks is a clear bluish glaze - glassed over the connecting areas. Another bluish blob, resembling half a jellyfish, is attached outside the fruit basket's edge, on the corner closest to Independence Park. The rest of the complex will be built across the street, where the open-air jewelry market is now located (Kikar Hahatulot).

Basically, the familiar truncated pie slice denotes a theater, with a rectangular volume containing the backstage areas. It will, however, be covered with more bluish glazing, tying it into the theme of the rest of the complex, and forming an entrance canopy.

Each of the major components of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's program is expressed as a separate building. Thus, the circular basket edge is a building designated as the Adult Museum. Its ample curved wall will be the "donors' wall," where some 2,500 names will be carved in stone. The pineapple is to be the Great Hall (which the people from LA say will become "Jerusalem's living room"). The carrot bouquet will be the educational center, a place for classes and workshops, whereas the blue turnip will be the International Conference Center. The jellyfish is the children's museum, and across the street is the performing arts center, to be connected with the rest of the complex by an aerial bridge.

The title "Center for Human Dignity-Museum of Tolerance" is a little bit misleading. The Simon Wiesenthal Center is first and foremost a Holocaust-related enterprise. As such, it tries to teach everybody else to be more tolerant of Jews. Its press releases reveal an active interest in combating anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism and Holocaust denial. It encourages legal prosecution of remaining Nazis and Nazi collaborators worldwide and keeps a close watch over Iran's president Ahmadinejad and other enemies of Israel.
Notably absent from its activities is an effort at teaching Jews or Israelis to be more tolerant of other people, especially Palestinians. It urged the churches and NGOs, who refer to Israel's security fence as an "apartheid wall," to drop their campaign for its dismantlement; certainly a legitimate position, but not one that views inter-community relationships as issues relating to tolerance and dignity.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center supports a large Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. In addition to Holocaust-related features, the Los Angeles museum operates exhibits and programs on various topics, such as drunk driving and incitement, the exploitation of women and children, the threat of terrorism, the plight of refugees and political prisoners, Bosnia, Rwanda and contemporary hate groups. Will it dare take on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?

Like other modern architectural projects, the Jerusalem museum, too, parts ways with the traditional urban notion of wrapping up different functions in a common envelope, roughly dictated by the borders of the site. It does, however, pay homage to that notion with the circular basket edge, a basket holding a jarring composition of disparate objects. Is the architect Gehry trying to show us how very different shapes can "tolerate" each other? Is he trying to bring an amalgamating order to light, out of what is seemingly chaotic, irregular, fragmentary? There is something troubling here when you compare the humor and whimsy of the shapes with the gravity of the cause.

The way they huddle together gives a sense of a defensive perimeter. Will this complex be an open campus, drawing in the activity of the street, or will it, like most quasi-public spaces, be a controlled and secured area, where underpaid guards check visitors with a metal detector?

Innovative buildings, by sheer formal bravado, have had a profound impact on their surroundings. But although innovative for Jerusalem, this is not a very innovative building for Frank Gehry. It is all too easy to identify pieces of Gehry's past projects in this one.

For a time, Gehry's work used "unfinished" qualities as a part of the design - it was characterized by harsh, "low class" materials (such as bare two-by-fours or a chain link fence) and its juxtaposition of simple, almost primal geometric forms. Out of this modest and coarse palette, he has been able to create works of intense poetic value. In more recent times, especially since winning the Pritzker prize in 1989, Gehry has been embraced by powerful institutions and has become the architect of the day for major universities, museums, and even mega-developers.

Will Gehry's poetry survive the institutional embrace of the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the intolerance of Jerusalem?a

<title>South Africans show solidarity</title>
<date>6/8/2006</date>
<content>
Amid rising anti-Israel sentiment throughout South Africa, nearly 20 South Africans, led by Chief Rabbi Dr. Warren Goldstein, arrived on Sunday as an expression of solidarity with Israelis, specifically former South Africans living in the North.

The four-day mission was organized by the World Zionist Organization and includes participants from Johannesburg and Durban. The group plans to travel north on Monday to visit the nearly 300 South Africans who live in areas under fire.

"If your brothers are in the front lines, there is nothing you can do sitting in South Africa," said Daniel Kaplan, one of those on the mission. "Why should they be out there while you are in South Africa? The least you can do is show your solidarity."

Goldstein described the group's goal as straightforward: "We are here with one simple message - there is one Jewish family around the world... Also, we are also here to deliver the message that we, and the vast majority of our community, believe in the justice of the cause of the State of Israel."

Through the help of the South American Zionist Federation, known as Telfed, the mission met with three South African families from the North at a Jerusalem restaurant on Sunday. The residents spoke of rockets that hit just meters from their homes, and thanked Telfed, the South African community and the Israeli community for their overwhelming support.

Over the past weeks, Telfed has undertaken a number of initiatives aimed at helping those in the North. In conjunction with Table to Table, it has delivered 36,000 parcels of food, with another 10,000 parcels being packed daily by local volunteers. Additionally, Telfed has decided to adopt an army unit by raising the funds necessary to provide it with whatever it needs.

"The specific needs of the soldiers at the moment are clean shirts, socks, underwear etc," said Hilary Kaplan, vice chairman of Telfed. "As of now, we have raised NIS 43,000 and have ordered 2,000 army T-shirts that will be delivered and sent up to the northern border."

Telfed chairman Itz Kalminowitz commended the group for traveling to Israel amid recent anti-Israel events in South Africa. He cited two "traumatic" incidents - a letter signed by a group of South African Jews blaming Israel for starting the "unjustified" war and a demonstration urging South Africa to impose sanctions on Israel.

Goldstein also commented on the anti-Israel tension, attributing much of it to the misconception that Israel's actions parallel the apartheid system once employed in South Africa.

About 20,000 people took to the streets of Cape Town on Saturday in a demonstration organized by the Sanctions Against Israel Coalition, a mostly Muslim group, to protest the Israeli operations in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, organizers said.

The demonstrators chanted slogans such as "Down with Israel," "Who made George Bush God?" and "Zionism equals Apartheid".

<title>The radicals behind the Anglican Church</title>
<date>26/2/2006</date>
<content>
Last week, British chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks came out strongly against the Church of England for its vote for "morally responsible investment" (MRI) in Israel (a.k.a. divestment). In response church leaders stated that the vote was merely advisory. The archbishop of Canterbury, who heads the Anglican Church and supported the measure, claimed it was not a vote for divestment and that he remained committed to "a continued personal engagement with the Jewish communities in Israel and in the United Kingdom."

If there is a lesson from this debacle, it is that attention must be paid to Palestinian NGOs, rather than assuming that such groups are too blatantly biased to influence mainstream institutions.

The Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center, for example, spearheaded the international campaign for divestment. This group claims to pursue "a spirituality based on justice, peace, nonviolence, liberation and reconciliation." But it is, in fact, an extremist Palestinian organization that pays lip service to a two-state solution while promoting the "right of return" for all Palestinians, which is a euphemism for the destruction of Israel as a Jewish state.

Led by Naim Ateek, Sabeel brands Israel as "an apartheid state." His 2001 Easter message continued with the language of demonization, such as decrying the "Israeli government crucifixion system... operating daily."

Sabeel's activities are a clear example of the "Durban Strategy," a campaign to undermine and delegitimize the State of Israel by falsely comparing it with apartheid South Africa and pursuing boycotts and divestment as a response. This process began at the Durban World Conference against Racism in 2001, where NGOs adopted a declaration condemning Israel's "racist crimes against humanity including ethnic cleansing [and] acts of genocide."

The Durban strategy turns the concept of morally responsible investment, or at least how that concept is billed to many well-meaning people, on its head.  Rather than constructively opposing particular government policies, while condemning terrorism and recognizing the right of self-defense against it, these groups are promoting a wholesale rejection of the legitimacy of the State of Israel itself.

SO HOW does an obscure and extreme NGO like Sabeel get the ear of the Church of England? It turns out that Bishop John Gladwin, who is a member of the Church Synod that voted for MRI, is a patron of Sabeel UK and also chair of the Board of Trustees of Christian Aid. Christian Aid is a major British charity, and as its head, Gladwin is well placed to influence the wider church on questions regarding the Israeli-Arab conflict. Gladwin is one of the few bishops who has vocally defended the Synod vote despite Archbishop Rowan Williams's public backtracking.

The church's resolution urged its members to visit "recent house demolitions" and educate themselves about the situation through first-hand experience. No doubt Gladwin or Ateek will be happy to arrange a tour with the Israel Committee against House Demolitions (ICAHD), a partner and ally of both Sabeel and Christian Aid.

This EU-funded NGO focuses primarily on political and ideological denunciations of Israel, including active promotion of "apartheid" rhetoric and justification of terrorism. Like Sabeel, it is driven by a radical anti-Israel ideology that exploits humanitarian and human rights claims to pursue these goals. The "evidence" that the leaders of both NGOs present entirely erases the context of conflict, incitement and terrorism. ICAHD's international reputation has been significantly enhanced by its association with Christian Aid's youth Web site, pressureworks.org, which publicizes and endorses its campaigns.

This demonstrates the power of the NGO network. Unchecked and unaccountable, some NGOs profess humanitarian goals while their actions contribute to conflict rather than peace. In a similar manner, Palestinian NGOs and their allies were able to get a small group of officials of the British Association of University Teachers to adopt a short-lived boycott of Israeli universities. In that case, the wider AUT membership quickly recognized that claims presented in support of this campaign constituted gross distortions, and revoked the resolutions. Such moral clarity still evades the church, however.

At a time of growing anti-Semitism in Europe, and the election of a Hamas leadership committed to Israel's destruction, it would be nice to believe that the Church of England did not mean to subscribe to the rejectionist beliefs of Sabeel and others when it passed its resolution. However, it has raised the profile and international status of Sabeel, as the leader of the MRI campaign; and promoted the Durban strategy to undermine Israel's legitimacy. If we are going to question why the big fish continue to rally against Israel, we should start by looking at the small ones.

<title>UK writer urges Brits to join Israel boycott</title>
<date>19/12/2006</date>
<content>
A respected British writer and artist has called for a cultural boycott of Israel.

In a letter to the Guardian newspaper on Friday, John Berger calls on writers and artists to undertake a boycott, saying it "could be a factor in Israeli policy changing."

Blog: Another British boycott

The Guardian also dedicated a quarter of a page article in the paper's national news section on Friday to the boycott call, which was signed by 95 others, including musician Brian Eno and writer Arundhati Roy.  Berger, a Booker Prize winner, calls for artists to decline being published by mainstream Israeli publishers.

The letter accuses Israel of killing children, land grabbing and breaching UN resolutions.  The letter says: "There is a fragile cease-fire in Lebanon, albeit daily violated by Israeli over-flights. Meanwhile the day-to-day brutality of the Israeli army in Gaza and the West Bank continues. Ten Palestinians are killed for every Israeli death; more than 200, many of them children, have been killed since the summer. UN resolutions are flouted, human rights violated as Palestinian land is stolen, houses demolished and crops destroyed."

It also compares Israel to the apartheid regime in South Africa.  It says: "Meanwhile, western governments refer to Israel's legitimate right of self-defense, and continue to supply weaponry. The challenge of apartheid was fought better.The non-violent international response to apartheid was a campaign of boycott, divestment and UN-imposed sanctions which enabled the regime to change without bloodshed."

In the letter Archbishop Desmond Tutu and South African minister Ronnie Kasrils are quoted saying the situation of the Palestinians is worse than that of black South Africans under apartheid.
The signatories say a boycott offers "another path for peace", and conclude: "Today, Palestinians teachers, writers, film-makers and non-governmental organizations have called for a comparable academic and cultural boycott of Israel as offering another path to a just peace. This call has been endorsed internationally by university teachers in many European countries, by film-makers and architects, and by some brave Israeli dissidents. It is now time for others to join the campaignâ€¦"

The letter follows the call made by British film director Ken Loach in August for a boycott of state sponsored Israeli cultural institutions.
"I support the call by Palestinian film-makers, artists and others to boycott state sponsored Israeli cultural institutions and urge others to join their campaign," Loach said.

Painting a bleak picture, he added that "Palestinians are driven to call for this boycott after 40 years of the occupation of their land, destruction of their homes and the kidnapping and murder of their civilians.  They have no immediate hope that this oppression will end."

In August the Edinburgh International Film Festival returned a donation from the Israeli Embassy in London after pro-Palestinian activists inundated the organizers with mail and phone calls and threatened to demonstrate at the event.

The Irish Film Festival also cancelled its sponsorship arrangement with the Israeli Embassy in Dublin for the screening of an Israeli film, following the outbreak of the Lebanon conflict.

Mark Mulqueen, director of the Irish Film Institute, said in a statement: "The decision is taken in light of the current activities of the Israeli government and prompted by the performance of your ambassador in explaining these acts to the Irish public.  It is important for us to separate the screening of an Israeli feature film from activities of the Israeli government."

<title>UN: Israel blocks Tutu fact-finding trip</title>
<date>11/12/2006</date>
<content>
Although Israel had not made a final decision on what type of visa to grant Nobel Laureate Desmond Tutu, UN officials told AP Monday that Israel had blocked a UN fact-finding mission to the Gaza Strip that Tutu was to lead. Tutu himself said he was distressed by Israel's lack of cooperation.
A decision whether to grant Tutu a visa "was still pending," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said Monday.

"Israel heard that they decided not to come," he added. "We had not given them a negative response. Our final decision was pending."

"At times not making a decision is making a decision," Tutu said.

Israeli government officials told The Jerusalem Post the discussion was over what type of visa to issue. Tutu, according to the officials, wanted a VIP visa, but Israel was only interested in granting him a regular tourist visa. There was likewise discussion about whether only Tutu or the entire six-member team would get visas.

The team was set up last month by the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva and charged with investigating the killing of 19 civilians by an errant IDF artillery shell last month. The team was supposed to report its findings by Friday.

Since the committee was set up, Israeli officials have expressed concern that it would simply be a vehicle to "bash Israel."

"We do not have a problem with the personalities, we have a problem with the institution," Regev said. "We saw a situation where the human rights mechanism of the UN was being cynically exploited to advance an anti-Israel agenda. This would do the Israelis, the Palestinians and peace in the Middle East no good at all. This would also have done nothing to serve the interest of human rights."

The 47-nation council, which even UN Security Council Secretary-General Kofi Annan had criticized for being biased against Israel, authorized the mission last month, to assess the situation of the Beit Hanun victims, address the needs of survivors and make recommendations on ways to protect Palestinian civilians against further Israeli attacks.

Government officials said last week they would not cooperate with the mission, but would not bar entry into the country of Tutu, a longtime critic of Israel. They said Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid efforts, was by no means persona non-grata in Israel. The officials said it would not do Israel any good to bar entry to Tutu, since he could easily fly into Egypt and enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing.
Tutu said Monday that the Israeli government's failure to permit a fact-finding mission to investigate Israeli-Palestinian violence was "very distressing."

"We find the lack of cooperation by the Israeli government very distressing, as well as its failure to allow the  timely passage to Israel," he told reporters after UN officials said Israel had blocked his UN fact-finding mission to the Gaza Strip.

Tutu said he had accepted the mission on behalf of the UN Human Rights Council "at short notice."

"We canceled important commitments to make ourselves available for this task and to submit a report by mid-December to the council," he said, adding that to take up the mission he had left the bedside of his wife, who was in a hospital following a knee operation.

Because of the failure of Israel to approve the mission in time, the mission team had to cancel its appointments in Israel and the Gaza Strip with people involved in the conflict, UN officials said.

Israeli officials have expressed concern that Tutu's mission was only entrusted with investigating alleged human rights violations committed by Israel, and not also by Palestinian terrorists.

<title>UN to send mission to W. Bank, Gaza</title>
<date>6/7/2006</date>
<content>
The UN Human Rights Council on Thursday voted to send an urgent fact-finding mission to the West Bank and Gaza Strip after the council deplored  the IDF operations  in the region as breaching international humanitarian law.

The resolution said the council "decides to dispatch an urgent fact-finding mission" headed by John Dugard, a UN expert who visited the Palestinian territories last month.

By a vote of 29-11 with five abstentions, the council approved the resolution proposed by the 57-member Organization of the Islamic Conference after it was amended to suggest the Palestinians also had a responsibility to refrain from violence against civilians.

"It is absolutely unacceptable" that the resolution only names Israel, said Israeli Ambassador Itzhak Levanon. "Obviously this resolution isn't even-handed. It's not equitable and it's not balanced. Everybody knows that. Even those that voted in favor, they did this for political reasons."

Switzerland had earlier proposed amendments saying armed Palestinian groups also should be called to account in the resolution.

But the council accepted instead a more vague Islamic conference amendment that "urges all concerned parties to respect the rules of international humanitarian law, to refrain from violence against the civilian population and to treat under all circumstances all detained combatants and civilians in accordance with the Geneva Conventions."

China, which was among those voting for the amendment, said the resolution should have been changed so that everyone could accept it by consensus.

"This is a new council, and it should have a new start," said Chinese Ambassador Sha Zukang. "This type of voting should not be encouraged."

The resolution received considerable support from the non-Muslim members of the council, including India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil, Ecuador, Ghana, Guatemala, Cuba, the Philippines and Mauritius, Sri Lanka, Uruguay and Zambia, but a number of them said they thought the Palestinians should have been called to account as well.
Canada and European countries opposed it. Neither the United States nor Israel are members.

The resolution expressed "deep concern" over the "arbitrary arrest of Palestinian (Cabinet) ministers, members of the Palestinian Legislative Council and other officials as well as the arbitrary arrests of other civilians" and military attacks.

The vote came in an emergency session of the U.N. body, which decided last week as one of its first acts to make it a priority to examine Israel's human rights practices in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

The emergency session, which began Wednesday, had to be carried over until Thursday after reservations arose about the Muslim states' proposal, which singled out Israel for breaches "of international humanitarian law and human rights law in the occupied Palestinian territory."

US Ambassador Warren W. Tichenor said, "An historic opportunity has been lost. An historic opportunity to address the human rights situation in a fair, credible and balanced way has instead resulted in an unbalanced effort to single out and focus on Israel alone."

He said the United States urged all parties to exercise restraint, protect all citizens and avoid adversely affecting the Palestinian humanitarian situation.

Tichenor said both sides should work for a lasting peace.

"This begins with the return of the Israeli soldier."

In Wednesday's session a UN human rights expert said it was clear that Israel was in violation of the most fundamental norms of humanitarian law and human rights law.

Dugard, a South African lawyer responsible for investigating alleged human rights abuses by Israel in Palestinian areas, said he had "every sympathy" with Israeli Cpl. Gilad Shalit, whose capture by Palestinian militants in Gaza sparked the latest Israeli military reprisals. But he said Israel's response has only increased its violations of the Geneva Convention on the treatment of occupied people.

Dugard, an anti-apartheid civil rights lawyer in the 1980s, was appointed by the now defunct commission in 2001 to investigate only violations by the Israeli side, prompting Israel and the United States to dismiss his reports as one-sided.

Levanon told the 47-member body that Israel's invasion of the Gaza Strip, which followed the capture of the Israeli soldier in a cross-border raid on June 25 was "triggered by the attack on our sovereign territory by Palestinian terrorist groups."

The UN Human Rights Council on Thursday in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as breaching international humanitarian law.

By a vote of 29-11 with five abstentions, the council approved the resolution proposed by the 57-member Organization of the Islamic Conference after it was amended to suggest the Palestinians also had a responsibility to refrain from violence against civilians.

"It is absolutely unacceptable" that the resolution only names Israel, Israeli Ambassador Itzhak Levanon told The Associated Press.

Switzerland said Thursday that armed Palestinian groups should be called to account in a proposed UN resolution blaming Israel for violence against civilians.

Earlier in the week, Switzerland said that Israel has been  violating international law in its Gaza offensive by heavy destruction and endangering civilians in acts of collective punishment banned under the Geneva conventions on the conduct of warfare.

Switzerland proposed the amendments in an emergency session of the UN body, which decided last week as one of its first acts to make it a priority to examine Israel's human rights practices in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

The emergency session, which began Wednesday, had to be carried over until Thursday after reservations arose about the Muslim states' proposal, which singled out Israel for breaches "of international humanitarian law and human rights law in the occupied Palestinian territory."

In Wednesday's session a UN human rights expert said it was clear that Israel was in violation of the most fundamental norms of humanitarian law and human rights law.

John Dugard, a South African lawyer responsible for investigating alleged human rights abuses by Israel in Palestinian areas, said he had "every sympathy" with Israeli Cpl. Gilad Shalit, whose capture by Palestinian terrorists in Gaza sparked the latest Israeli military reprisals. But he said Israel's response has only increased its violations of the Geneva Convention on the treatment of occupied people.

Israel's ambassador to the UN's European headquarters in Geneva called the session "a planned and premeditated" attack on his country, and said it continued the anti-Israel bias set by the discredited U.N. Human Rights Commission, which was phased out this year.

<title>Why I'm running...</title>

When I made aliya from England, I, like the majority of "Anglo-Saxim," had positive reasons for leaving the land where I was born. The situation may have changed in the intervening couple of decades, but I lived in an England where the economy was stable and I could comfortably wear my kippa in the streets of London.

It was a tremendous blessing for which I never cease to thank God that I had nothing to flee from.

I am sure that many readers of these pages have felt the same thrill of transforming the ancient "next year in Jerusalem" from a request to a prayer of gratitude, of seeing biblical place names on the destination boards of bus stations, of hearing TV and radio announcers wishing us a "Shabbat shalom," "Shavua tov" and "Hag sameah."

"When the Lord returned the captives to Zion, we were as dreamers," said the Psalmist. But when we come to build a state, we had to wake up from the dream. We dreamed of a country in which Jews would never again be persecuted for being Jews, a country in which every Jew might find refuge. Yet in the past decade, more Jews have been murdered in Israel than in the rest of the world.

We dreamed of a country whose social conscience would be "a light unto the nations"; and we woke up to a country with a terrible disparity between rich and poor, where politicians are corrupt and where the judiciary frequently resembles a Third World banana republic.

We dreamed of a Jewish state; and awoke to a country where the Arab minority has more than tripled in 50 years, from less than 7 percent in 1957 to almost 22% today. A country in which the Arabs could be the majority in another 50 years.

MY OWN political activism was, quite literally, hurled at me against my will: last summer, in the last days of Gush Katif, I was on the beachfront of Neve Dekalim when I was attacked by some 50 rock-throwing Arabs. With nowhere to go but heaven, hell or the Mediterranean Sea, I fired a few shots in the air to cover my retreat.

Four days later I was arrested and charged with grievous bodily harm, on the claim that one of the rock-throwers was hit in the leg by a bullet. The evidence against me was scant: no bullet, five (Arab) eyewitnesses who could not agree on where or when the event happened or on what the shooter looked like (one "eyewitness" later admitted that he had not been there), and a medical report from the Khan Yunis hospital that recorded an "alleged gunshot injury" (emphasis added).

The judge who pronounced me guilty all but admitted in her verdict that there was no real evidence; she had to decide whether to believe the eyewitnesses or me, and she decided for the former.

It is as a symbol of what is wrong with Israeli society that I am on the Herut party list, running for the Knesset.

We dream of a society in which there will be jury trials, because juries, unlike judges, have neither political nor social agendas nor are they subject to professional pressures.

We dream of a society in which every Jewish child will receive a strong Jewish education. Let them accept or reject, believe or deny - but let them make choices based on knowledge.

We dream of a society based on the five "mems" of Ze'ev Jabotinsky: marpeh (health care), moreh (education), malbush (clothing), mazon (food), ma'on (housing) - the basics of life that the state will supply to all, while encouraging free-market capitalism.

This will build a large and strong middle class, leading to an economically healthy society while ensuring that even the poorest will never be hungry or homeless. Education of a descent standard will provide everyone the opportunity to break out of the poverty cycle.

We will offer an "absorption package" to every Arab who wishes to emigrate. No Arab will be forced to leave, just as no Jew is forced to make aliya; but we will ease their transition. Anyone who still dreams of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state has to face a painful yet crucial question: when the Arabs become the majority, a generation and a half hence, will Israel become an apartheid state, in which the Jewish minority controls the Arab majority? Or will democracy take its course, turning Israel into another Arab dictatorship?

We suggest we all address the issue now and use the most moral and democratic methods possible of ensuring a perpetual Jewish majority, which is the only way that Israel will remain both Jewish and democratic.

With a far smaller hostile Arab population, and less money spent on internal security, Israel could be transformed into a veritable paradise. This is the way to a future without terror or war, to an Israel which will truly be "a light unto the nations."

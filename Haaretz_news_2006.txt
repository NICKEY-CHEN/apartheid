<title>How Jewish is Israel?</title>
<date>Fri May 19 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
If we concede A.B. Yehoshua's claim that Israel is the source of Jewish identity in today's world, we reduce Jewish identity to a conversation between anti-Semitism and a blood-and-soil nationalism that is Jewish only in the sense that anti-Semites use the term i.e., racial. But if, instead, we define "Jewish" on the basis of the universal ethical challenges at the core of Judaism, then not only is the Diaspora an essential condition of Jewishness, but Israel's own claim to a Jewish identity is open to question. 
The idea that the modern State of Israel expresses some ageless desire among  Jews across the Diaspora to live in a Jewish nation state is wishful thinking. Before the Holocaust, Zionism had been a minority tendency among Western Jews, and scarcely existed among those living in the Muslim world. And a half century after Israel's emergence, most of us choose freely to live, as Jews have for centuries, among the nations. That choice is becoming increasingly popular among Israeli Jews, too: 750,000 at last count - hardly surprising in an age of accelerated globalization that feeds dozens of diasporas and scorns national boundaries. 
The State of Israel was created by an act of international law in 1948, largely in response to the Holocaust. It was violently rejected by an Arab world that saw it as a new Western conquest of the territory over which so much blood had been spilled to defend Muslim sovereignty during the Crusades, so like most nation states Israel had to fight its way into existence. Its victory came at the expense of another people, whose dispossession was the precondition for Israel achieving an ethnic Jewish majority. And the conflict fueled by the unresolved trauma of its birth has condemned the Jewish state to behave in ways that mock the progressive Zionist dream of Israel fulfilling the biblical injunction to Jews to be a "light unto the nations." 
Former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg puts it eloquently: "The Jewish people did not survive for two millennia in order to pioneer new weaponry, computer security programs or anti-missile missiles. We were supposed to be a light unto the nations. In this we have failed. It turns out that the 2,000-year struggle for Jewish survival comes down to a state of settlements, run by an amoral clique of corrupt lawbreakers who are deaf both to their citizens and to their enemies. A state lacking justice cannot survive. More and more Israelis are coming to understand this as they ask their children where they expect to live in 25 years. Children who are honest admit, to their parents' shock, that they do not know." 
So, while Yehoshua challenges the Jewish identity of the Diaspora, Burg  challenges the Jewish identity of Israel. Of course, they use different definitions of "Jewish." Yehoshua dismisses religion, and says it is the land and language of Israel that defines him. I am not religious, but I share Burg's belief that Judaism is fundamentally an ethical challenge epitomized for me by the famous "on-one-leg" definition by Hillel: "That which is hateful unto yourself, do not do unto others; all the rest is commentary." 
The fact that in Israel, Hebrew was transformed from a liturgical language to eclipse the Yiddish, Ladino and Arabic in which Jews had communicated for hundreds of years is a remarkable feat of nationalist social engineering, but nothing more. The notion of identity deriving from the soil seems to owe more to 19th-century European nationalism than to Jewish ethics. I can't see anything Jewish about investing hills and piles of stones with a spiritual significance worth dying and killing for. 
Growing up in apartheid South Africa was an object lesson in Jewish ethics. Yes, there was plenty of anti-Semitism in the colonial white society, but the mantle of victimhood belonged to others. And if you responded to the very Jewish (although in no way exclusively so) impulse to seek justice, you found yourself working side by side not only with the remarkable number of Jews who filled leadership roles in the liberation movement, but also with Christians, Muslims, Hindus and others, each articulating their own traditions within a common identity based on the common values. 
Judaism's universal ethical calling can't really be answered if we live only among ourselves - and Israel's own experience suggests it's hard to live only among ourselves without doing injustice to others. As physical threats to Jewish existence in the Diaspora have receded, Zionists today cite the specter of "assimilation." But assimilation holds no fear for the happy Diaspora-ist who expresses his traditions as just that - traditions - alongside those of others. 
The idea that Jews should live in a ghetto is one from which Jews were, mercifully, liberated variously between the 18th and the 20th centuries. A.B.  Yehoshua and others want to revive something we're better off without. All of the great Jewish intellectual, philosophical, moral and cultural contributions to humanity I can think of were products not of Jews living apart, but of our dispersal among the cultures of the world  . Maimonides or Spinoza, Marx, Freud, Einstein or Derrida; Kafka, Proust or Primo Levi; Serge Gainsbourg or Daniel Barenboim; Lenny Bruce or Bob Dylan - I could go on ad nauseum - all are products of our interaction with diverse influences in the Diaspora. 
Jewish identity is always in flux and contested. The Zionist moment is a comparatively brief one in the sweep of Jewish history, and I'd argue that Judaism's survival depends instead on its ability to offer a sustaining moral and ethical anchor in a world where the concepts of nation and nationality are in decline. Israel's relevance to Judaism's survival   depends first and foremost on its ability, as Burg points out, to deliver justice, not only to its citizens, but to those it has displaced. Until then, Israel's own Jewish identity also remains uncertain.

<title>Muslim leader gets interfaith award in U.S. despite Jewish protests </title>
<date>Fri Oct 06 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
The Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations gave an interfaith award to a prominent Southern California Muslim leader despite strong objections from Jewish organizations who criticized him for comments made about Israel.
Dr. Maher Hathout received the John Allen Buggs Award on Thursday for his contributions to relations between religions. Hathout, 70, is a retired cardiologist who is chairman the Islamic Center of Southern California.
The commission called him "an inspired and tireless voice for greater interfaith understanding and alliances."
The decision drew bitter criticism from some Jewish leaders, who pointed to comments the Egyptian-born Hathout made at a rally in Washington, D.C., in 2000.
Speaking at a Jerusalem Day rally, Hathout said: "We did not come here to condemn the condemned atrocities committed by the apartheid brutal state of Israel because butchers do what butchers do and because what is expected from a racist apartheid is what is happening now."
Hathout said earlier this year that his remarks had been "harsh." He said they sprang from anger over the way Israeli authorities were treating Palestinian protesters in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the last Intifada.
Organizations including the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles and the American Jewish Congress condemned the honor, and one previous recipient returned his John Allen Buggs Award in protest.

<title>The Jewish lobby approves</title>
<date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
The chair of the Israel Architects' Association, Yitzhak Lir, turned last week to a British architect, Lord Richard Rogers, and invited him to head the panel of judges for the David Azrieli Prize, which will be awarded to the most outstanding student final project in the schools of architecture here. 
Rogers was chosen, says Lir, because he is "an exceptional architect." However, the chief motive for inviting him was Rogers' repudiation of his previous support for the Architects and Planners for Justice in Palestine, a British organization that called for a boycott of those involved in construction in the territories to the detriment of Palestinian rights. 
Lir, who a few weeks ago condemned the identification by major architectural figures (including Rogers) with the APJP, expressed complete satisfaction with the fact that Rogers "had second thoughts and now sees things in a different light. I am glad that he is no longer against us and is now for us." 
Lir was a little hasty in his tribute to the highly acclaimed British architect's second thoughts. According to the British and American press, and those closely associated with the affair, Rogers began to see things in a different light only after massive pressure from Jewish organizations and politicians in the United States. He found out the hard way that taking a moral stand could cost him the huge and eminently desirable projects he is currently planning in New York. 
The affair began with the first meeting of the APJP, which Rogers hosted in his offices in London on February 2. Dozens of architects and intellectuals attended the meeting, and Rogers made the introductory statements. News of Rogers' involvement in the organization's activities shot across the Atlantic and outraged Jewish organizations in New York. 
One of Rogers' current projects in New York is the enlargement of the Jacob K. Javits Center in Manhattan. The late Senator Javits was a passionate supporter of Israel, and various parties warned Rogers that his "suitability" for the $1.7 billion project, one of the largest in New York, would be in doubt if he continued to support APJP's "extreme stand." 
The story ignited a storm, and Rogers was forced to work hard to calm things down. He hired the American public relations expert Howard Rubinstein, a specialist in damage control with a seven-figure income, and, last week, while still recovering from surgery, Rogers flew to New York. He held highly publicized meetings with his critics, who cross-examined him regarding the steps he had taken, and launched an intensive campaign of clarifications and apologies. 
Rogers explained that he had hosted the APJP meeting only as a favor to an old friend, the British Jewish architect Abe Hayeem, a left-wing activist and one of the APJP's founders. He was not completely aware of the organization's nature and its goals, he said; in any case, he maintained, he left the meeting in his office after 10 minutes. 
Rogers publicly distanced himself from the APJP, repudiating its aims. He said that he had never supported any boycott of Israel, and that he is opposed to any economic boycott (although he had joined his friend Abe Hayeem and other architects in a boycott of the apartheid regime in South Africa). His repentance was accompanied by public support for construction of the separation fence and a call to Hamas to "renounce terrorism and recognize Israel's right to exist." 
Recent articles about Rogers note his Jewish extraction and tell how his family had fled from the Fascists in Italy in the 1930s. PR expert Rubinstein told "The Jewish Chronicle" that Rogers and his first wife honeymooned in Israel and added that if offered a project in Israel, Rogers would respond favorably. 
The paper also reported an embarrassing yet amusing tidbit: In a television interview in New York, Rogers said that the conflict in the Middle East was between "a terrorist state and a democratic state." Which was the terrorist state, the interviewer asked. Rogers, apparently confused, responded: "Israel." His wife Ruth, a Jewish American and the owner of a fashionable London restaurant, hurriedly corrected him: "Not Israel, not Israel." 
Rogers' clarifications mollified the Jewish lobby, which gave him its blessing to continue his work in New York. And the world of architecture lost an opportunity to restore its dignity and advance a courageous agenda. 
The dilemma Rogers faced was not a simple one. Taking a moral stand is a privilege that can be enjoyed by precious few, those who can afford to pay the price. Rogers - an architect with an international reputation and a wealthy member of British society - is one of those precious few. A refusal to back down on his part would have set a utopian standard to which others could aspire. 
Consequently, Rogers' choice is a resounding disappointment. The "prize" he received from the Israel Architects' Association for his conduct in this affair is a dubious one. The association, as the representative voice of Israeli architects, has never excelled in taking a moral stand on the issues that Rogers faced. It apparently perceives his behavior in this case as a form of legitimization for its own moral imperviousness concering similar issues. 
The invitation from the Architects' Association states that Rodgers is invited to head the judges' panel and to give the keynote address at the awards ceremony in late April or early May. The association has said it will cover all the costs of Rogers' visit and "to do everything in our power to make your stay pleasant and interesting." 
If he accepts the invitation, Rogers will discover that one of the schools whose students are vying for the David Azrieli Prize is located in the West Bank settlement of Ariel. If he takes the trouble to visit the school, he is assured of an interesting visit to a land lacerated with checkpoints, apartheid roads and separation fencing. Pleasant it will not be; perhaps as a result he will have third thoughts.

<title>200 Israelis, Palestinians protest new Israeli-only W. Bank road</title>
<date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
Roughly 200 Israelis and Palestinians turned out for a protest march Saturday against the construction of a new West Bank viaduct that will be open to Israeli traffic only.
The viaduct will run along the existing Route 60 from the Etzion settlement bloc to El Arub.
Among the demonstrators were activists from all the Palestinian factions, including Fatah and Hamas, as well as members of Israeli organizations "Anarchists Against the Fence," "Ta'ayush," and "Fighters for Peace." 
The demonstrators said the viaduct, which they termed an "apartheid road," not only discriminates on the basis of race but will also necessitate the expropriation of land from the Palestinian villages of Halhul, Beit Umar, and El Arub.
"This is a protest against the apartheid road that will be constructed," said Ta'ayush activist Avihai Sharon. "Route 60 will be for Palestinians, while above it a viaduct will be built for Jews only."
"The road will also steal land from Palestinian villages like Beit Umar and Halhul".
The march set out from Beit Umar and ended in the El Arub school. Cooperation between Hamas and Fatah activists was evident in the demonstration, despite the severe tensions between the two factions.

<title>Abbas tells Mandela: S. Africa has role to play in Mideast peace</title>
<date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
JOHANNESBURG - Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas met anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela yesterday as he wound up a three-day state visit to South Africa and headed home to face factional violence in Gaza. 
During a brief courtesy visit to Mandela's Johannesburg home, Abbas paid tribute to the African National Congress veteran as the "father of all liberation movements." 
He said that South Africa, which enjoys good relations with the Palestinians, Israel and the United States, could play "a productive role in the peace process." 
Mandela looked relaxed as he joked with his visitor in front of photographers. 
Abbas met Friday with President Thabo Mbeki. 
In a toast at a dinner in honor of Abbas late Friday, Mbeki said South Africans felt solidarity with the Palestinian people. 
"This visit is very special to all of us because for many decades both our peoples have occupied the same trenches, and shared similar experiences and anxieties in our quest for freedom and independence," Mbeki said according to a text of his speech released yesterday. 
Mbeki said that South Africa's peaceful dismantling of apartheid and transition to multiparty democracy should serve as an example in the Middle East. 
"We are convinced that there is no other road to peace between Palestine and Israel except the road of negotiations to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution," he said.

<title>Academic boycott expires after two U.K. unions merge</title>
<date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The recent decision by the largest lecturers' union in Britain to encourage an academic boycott of Israel has expired, as was expected when it was implemented, said the union's general secretary this weekend. 
Although the controversial decision was made only May 29, it stopped being valid two weeks ago because the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) has merged with another British union, the Association of University Teachers. 
Mackney, general secretary of NATFHE and the merged union, sent a letter Saturday to a British lawyer representing Jewish lecturers against the boycott.  
The letter confirmed that the boycott decision was no longer valid. 
NATFHE's decision encouraged lecturers to boycott Israeli institutions and individuals who do not publicly dissociate themselves from Israeli policies related to the occupation and from discrimination in the field of education. 
It had previously been reported that the boycott decision would be valid for only a short time because of the merger.  
Nonetheless, Israeli anti-boycott groups said yesterday that they saw the move as an achievement of their struggle against the decision. 
The International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom, a group that was founded at Bar-Ilan University in response to an earlier academic boycott and was a key player in fighting NATFHE's move, said in a statement yesterday that it was "pleased to announce that [the decision] has been canceled." 
Education Minister Yuli Tamir said she "welcomes the cancellation of the British academic boycott thanks to the tireless efforts of all the relevant groups in this matter." 
By contrast, MK Rabbi Michael Melchior, the chairman of the Knesset Education Committee, noted that the expiry was a technical matter and "therefore does not indicate anything about a change regarding Israel." 
"The celebrations over the revocation of the British academic boycott of Israel are premature and baseless," he said. 
False pretenses
Supporters of the boycott said that the Israeli lobby falsely presented the expiration as a cancellation and a victory. 
The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, an umbrella organization encompassing dozens of Palestinian nongovernmental organizations, said: "The significance of the academic boycott against Israel adopted by the largest British academic union cannot be viewed in legalistic terms," it said. "Its moral weight should not be underestimated."  
The group added that NATFHE's decision has proven that boycotting Israeli academic institutions because of their cooperation in preserving a special form of anti-Palestinian "apartheid" remains a priority for progressive Western and human rights activists.

<title>Academics: Boycott may hurt junior researchers</title>
<date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Monday's decision by Britain's largest lecturers union in favor of an academic boycott of Israel has worried some academics here. Yesterday they said that although it would probably not have an immediate impact on prominent Israeli researchers, it may affect their younger colleagues who have not yet established themselves in their fields. 
The union has decided to boycott Israeli academics who do not publicly disassociate themselves from Israel's "apartheid policies." 
"We don't know at what pace the practical impact of the decision will be felt," said Zvi Ziegler, a professor at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and chairman of the Israeli Inter-Senate Committee of the Universities, when asked for comment on the decision by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE). "But our fear is that the decision gives legitimacy to people who are debating whether to boycott Israel." 
Ziegler stressed that all Israeli scientists are dependent on colleagues from abroad at various stages of their academic careers. 
"No one will prevent Nobel Prize winner Aaron Ciechanover from publishing an article in a scientific journal," he said. "But a young scientist who sends an article to a British journal is liable to encounter editors who hesitate to publish his article and delay its publication." 
The Inter-Senate Committee, which sharply condemned NATFHE's decision on Monday, is currently focusing on "making the academic boycott completely illegitimate because it is an assault on academic freedom, and getting the senior academic establishment in Britain to publish a declaration that academic boycotts are unacceptable," Ziegler said. 
The Israel Science Foundation, the largest funder of basic research in Israel, sends out some 10,000 letters a year asking scientists to examine research proposals by Israeli researchers and decide whether they deserve funding. According to Professor Joseph Klafter, the ISF's chairman, about 10 scientists have refused to participate in the review process this year. He said that the foundation first began encountering such refusals following Operation Defensive Shield in March-April 2002. Such refusals typically say something like "I respect my Israeli colleagues, but until Israeli policy changes, I will be compelled to refuse your requests." 
A forum comprised of the presidents of all Israeli universities discussed the boycott at its meeting yesterday and issued a statement describing NATFHE's decision as "harmful and dangerous." Professor Moshe Kaveh, the forum's chair and president of Bar-Ilan University, said: "The mixing of politics and scientific research is a destructive phenomenon that must be fought aggressively." 
Professor Steven Rose, a prominent philosopher of science who serves as secretary of the British Committee for Universities of Palestine, said yesterday: "We recognize that this has not been an easy decision, with the extreme pressure put upon the Union by outside forces, including the Israeli government and the organized Israel lobby ... The vote is an historic step forward, both expressing our solidarity with Palestinian academic colleagues and also in helping persuade Israeli colleagues that it is time to cease silent complicity with the illegal acts of the Israeli state." 
Tomorrow, however, NATFHE is due to merge with another lecturers union, which will render the boycott resolution advisory only.

<title>A concert cry severs the silence</title>
<date>Wed Sep 20 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Some 92 minutes for a live broadcast on satellite TV. Such is the amount of time Al-Jazeera and Ramattan, a Palestinian news agency, alloted the "Conquering the Silence" concert in Ramallah on Sunday. During that time, musician Khaled Jubran, who produced and hosted the event, juggled artists performing in recording studios all around the world: Paris, Dubai, Cairo, New York, London and Beirut. An hour and a half after the opening note, organizers breathed a sigh of relief: Everything had gone as planned, except for a few hitches, which did not interfere with the festive atmosphere. Millions watched it all over the world.
Jubran seemed nonplussed by the pressure of such a complex production - one which he worked on with friends for three months - as he stood onstage at the Ramallah Cultural Center, juxtaposed by a couch and an enormous screen. He kicked off the event with a moving virtuoso, solo performance on the Arab buzuk and then proceeded to navigate the event smoothly. He joked with artists who appeared onscreen, but did not conceal his strident opposition to oppression and occupation. Such was the artists' objective for the evening: to break the silence. Satellite technology made it possible to mock the limits to freedom of movement imposed on them by appearing in tandem, despite prohibitions. 
In the first performance, Lebanese  director and actor Roger Assaf appeared in Beirut, emphasizing the walls and boundaries erected between nations of the Middle East and the ensuing silence. Assaf, who remained in the capital during the shelling in the recent war and who has written his impressions in numerous articles, described a trip to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to the Palestinian audience; his is a trip which can only be taken in the imagination. In the end, he begged the forgiveness of viewers for replacing the traditional moment of silence to mourn the dead with a moment of screaming. Live on screen, he removed his glasses, closed his eyes tightly, clenched his fists, and emitted a shriek which sounded like the groaning of a wounded heart. From then on, each performance seemed to be a continuation of that cry. 
The concert's virtual jaunt around the world revealed many different facets of music, dance, art and reached new summits. One performance featured a piece by celebrated guitarist John Williams. Despite his shy demeanor, he executed the piece with typical perfection. 
Musician Kamilia Jubran appeared onstage after Williams; she formerly led the Sabreen group. Jubran offered her own contemporary music style to accompany protest lyrics. Her rendition turns its back on all accepted forms of Arabic singing and oud playing. The Arabic instrument rang with grating dissonance under her hand and the music was an innovative departure from Western tonality and Arabic scales - her voice screamed more than sang. Hers was the only performance that challenged the audience in the auditorium: Some fidgeted in their seats and an audible murmur arose. 
Artists ascended and descended the stage and screen: Breyten Breytenbach, the South African poet who fought apartheid and was jailed for seven years read poems which he dedicated to Palestinian prisoners; Khaled Muhammed Ali, an Iraqi oud player exiled in Dubai, played a classic Arabic piece; Cairo poet Amin Haddad read the nationalist poems of his father Fuad Haddad, drawing resounding response from the audience when he called for continued resistance and mentioned the name of Hassan Nasrallah; and Palestinian actor Yusef Abu-Wardeh, who resides in Israel, stunned the crowd with his superb performance. 
The cultural face  of the Arab world
Finally, the moment that everyone waited for, adored Lebanese composer, singer, and musician Marcel Khalife appeared onscreen, causing pandemonium in the audience. A satellite gaffe which silenced Khalife for many, long minutes created anxiety and disappointment. The audience unanimously sang one of his songs and rhythmically clapped hands to fill the void. But Khalife went back on the air with the song, "Rita and the Gun," by Mahmoud Darwish. The erotic song of love between the poet and the Jewish girl he was forced to leave after 1967 brought the audience to its feet. 
"This protest is supposed to take the place of action. It's typical of middle-class residents here, who are capable of applauding Nasrallah despite the fact that he did nothing for them," said one Ramallah resident. But another Palestinian praised the way the concert "opened people's minds," by presenting artistic material in unfamiliar styles  and showing the cultural face of the Arab world - one which the West is anxious to suppress.He added that the Palestinian public was hungry for defiance and encouragement from artists after a long, depressing silence. "Any break in the silence is welcome," he remarked.

<title>Along with the boycott, some good news</title>
<date>Fri Jun 09 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The decision by NATFHE, the British college lecturers union, to initiate a blacklist with respect to their Israeli colleagues has been met with shock in Israel. It has rapidly become clear that the instigators of the boycott belong to that school of thought in Europe that regards the very existence of the Jewish state as an affront and an injustice. The re-emergence of the boycott initiative in the U.K. was followed closely by a decision by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) in Ontario to declare its own boycott of the Jewish state. Again, the motion that was passed included provisions - such as support for the right of return of 1948 refugees and their descendants to within Israel's borders - which are a coded demand for Israel's demise. 
These two victories for the boycotters might be seen as evidence that Israel is losing the ideas war in significant parts of the Western world, with the demand for Israel's demise moving steadily closer to the political mainstream. Closer observation of political trends, however, indicates a more complex picture. Those who seek Israel's destruction are indeed closer to the mainstream than ever before, but those who argue for a wholehearted identification with Israel are also increasing in numbers and influence in the political mainstream. The latest developments are a factor in a more general, growing polarization. 
Let's take a look at what's being said, and by whom. Taking the British example, it is worth examining for a moment the background to the boycott vote in the NATFHE lecturers union. The same NATFHE conference that supported the blacklist resolution also sent a vote of congratulations to the Respect party for its recent performance in Britain's local elections. Respect is a small and strange alliance of British Trotskyites and Islamists that has emerged in recent years. The blacklist vote, it appears, was the brainchild of activists of this organization. 
What may be learned from this is that the desire for the delegitimization of Israel is not a free-floating, generally-held notion in British political debate. Rather, it is embedded in a more general set of ideas currently on the rise, but far from dominant in Britain and other Western European countries. 
This set of ideas includes a generalized loathing of the U.S., fervent opposition to the Iraq War and a belief that radical Islam is analogous to anti-colonial liberation movements in being an inevitable, understandable response to oppression. One may encounter this belief system in its pure form in organizations such as Respect. It is visible in a more diluted version in the  editorial pages of a number of Britain's quality daily newspapers, and among backbench MPs of the Labour and Liberal Democratic parties. 
Outright rejection of Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state is one of the articles of faith of this belief system in its undiluted form. In the milder version, a view of Israel as analogous to now-defunct outposts of settlement left behind by receding European colonialism - such as Rhodesia and apartheid South Africa - is the preferred stance. Many of the ideas and prejudices held in these circles about Israel have been absorbed undigested from the norms of political debate in the Arabic-speaking world, via the alliance with Islamism. 
On the opposite side, as the debate grows in harshness, one may discern an increasing willingness to openly identify Israel as a valued ally. This is a cross-party phenomenon, though it is mainly to be found on the center-right in European politics. 
To continue with the British example, the new leadership of the U.K.'s Conservative Party combine an outspoken Atlanticism with an overt commitment to confronting the threat of radical Islam. In a speech given last year, William Hague, who will be the U.K.'s foreign secretary should the Conservatives win the next elections in Britain, told his audience that "the parallels with the rise of Nazism go further ... If only, some argue, we withdrew from Iraq, or Israel made massive concessions, then we would assuage jihadist anger. That argument ... is as limited as the belief in the 1930s that, by allowing Germany to remilitarize the Rhineland or take over the Sudetenland, we would satisfy Nazi ambitions." In less strident words, senior Labour figures have expressed a similar linkage. 
Of course, speeches given by politicians seeking office should be treated with caution. But the underlying idea here is a striking one. It holds that in the central foreign policy challenge of this generation, Israel is a natural, valued friend, its victory the victory of the wider Western world. 
In order to understand the passions raised in Europe by the Israel-Palestinian conflict, it is thus crucial to grasp that our dispute is no longer merely another item on the long list of foreign issues that occasionally trouble European political discussion. Rather, it has become to all intents and purposes part of the domestic debate. In the shrill, discordant attempt to single out the Jewish state as a uniquely nefarious presence in world affairs, whose rightful fate is dissolution - one sees into the heart of that alliance of far left and radical Islam that seeks appeasement and accommodation in the face of the Islamist challenge. And in the responses to the demonization of Israel may be glimpsed those forces coalescing to confront this challenge.

<title>Analysis / The IDF is out of ideas for fighting Islamic Jihad</title>
<date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
The Israel Defense Forces recently altered transportation arrangements in the West Bank. In effect, it has split the West Bank into three cantons - much like it used to do in Gaza.
Under the new orders, which are enforced by roadblocks and patrols, Palestinians are totally prohibited from moving from the Tul Karm region south toward Ramallah. In addition, severe restrictions have been imposed on traveling from the Jenin area southwest toward Tul Karm.
The restrictions, which the IDF says are temporary, are part of the army's manhunt for an Islamic Jihad network that murdered 24 Israelis last year. They were stepped up after the network's last attack, when a suicide bomber killed an IDF officer and two Palestinians near Tul Karm.
IDF inquiries indicate that the suicide bombers come from villages north of Tul Karm and proceed from Tul Karm toward Jerusalem, where they enter Israel through gaps in the separation fence.
The main difficulty in fighting Islamic Jihad lies in intelligence gathering. The organization's current activists are much more sophisticated than their predecessors. The IDF killed one of the network's leaders and arrested another, but seven or eight others are now running the show with extreme compartmentalization. The defense establishment believes that the network is preparing three or four suicide bombers to enter Israel at any given time. The absence of intelligence makes catching them more difficult, hence the drastic measures - like segmenting the West Bank.
Cutting Jenin off from Tul Karm is supposed to make it harder to transfer explosives, while blocking the way south makes it harder to reach Jerusalem. The changes may force the cells to alter their modus operandi, thus making it easier to catch them.
Over the last two years, the IDF has begun, albeit slowly, to remove roadblocks around Palestinian towns and villages. Fatah and Hamas have reduced their terror activity, yet now the IDF is resorting to drastic measures against a smaller, if more ruthless group.
But beyond the Jihad threat, cutting up the West Bank fits in with Sharon's plans: preserving settlement blocs, building the fence, possibly evacuating isolated settlements, and establishing separate road systems for Israelis and Palestinians. However, the roads designated for Palestinians are extremely poor, and international help in rehabilitating them is unlikely, as the whiff of apartheid hangs over the exercise.
The IDF has a tough job: Fighting terrorists operating within a civilian population requires deciding among several bad options. But the latest decision, cantonizing the West Bank, raises fears that the IDF is out of ideas in the war on Islamic Jihad. In the absence of answers, it is resorting to collective punishment.

NEW YORK - Under fire for his membership in a professional organization highly critical of Israel, Lord Richard Rogers, the British architect supervising the redesign of the Jacob Javits Center, has cut ties to the group in an effort to salvage his role in the $1.7 billion project.
But that hasn't satisfied several elected officials, including New York state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Rep. Anthony Weiner, who have each demanded Rogers be dropped from the project. And Friday, the chairman of the state commission overseeing the Javits Center redevelopment summoned Rogers to New York to discuss the controversy.
Rogers announced earlier this week he had severed his relationship with Architects and Planners for Justice in Palestine, a group of 60 prominent architects who have called on Israel to stop building settlements and the security barrier in the West Bank.
Last month, the organization issued a statement calling for a boycott of Israel and compared West Bank building firms to those that worked in South Africa during the apartheid era.
Rogers, whose other works include the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris and the Millennium Dome in Greenwich, England, hosted a meeting of the group at his London office but did not vote for the Israel boycott, his spokesman Howard Rubenstein said.
He has been quoted as saying that he supported "targeted activities" against Israel - a claim Rogers denies.
"I have never backed a boycott and I have personally never stated that I favor targeted activities," he said in a statement released Friday.
Rogers' statements were met with mixed reactions Friday from Jewish leaders.
Anti-Defamation League Director Abe Foxman said he had spoken to Rogers Friday, and was reassured by what he heard.
"If we didn't believe that people couldn't change hearts and minds, we wouldn't be in business," Foxman said. "As far as we're concerned, the issue is closed."
But others weren't convinced.
Weiner, a Brooklyn Democrat, released a letter Friday to the Empire State Development Corp. calling for Rogers' contract to be rescinded. The ESDC is overseeing the Javits project and has based its planning on Rogers' design, which would almost double the size of the center.
Weiner cited federal and state anti-boycott laws making it illegal to participate in boycotts of another country and said Rogers' stewardship of the Javits project would dishonor the memory of Javits himself.
"This is not just any project. This is a building that's named after one of the foremost fighters for the state of Israel," Weiner said in an interview.
Javits, a Republican, represented New York in the U.S. House and Senate from 1954 to 1981. He died in 1986, the same year the Javits Center opened.
Weiner added that he considered Rogers' public statements "too clever by half" and said he didn't believe they indicated a true change of heart.
"He's someone who is working on a very lucrative contract, and was caught being involved in an abhorrent organization," Weiner said.
Earlier this week, a spokeswoman for the ESDC told the Sun that ESDC officials were "satisfied" with Rogers' statements. But on Friday, ESDC chairman Charles Gargano announced he had requested a meeting with Rogers next week to review his relationship with the controversial group.
"I look forward to the opportunity to gain a better understanding of his position on these matters, which we take very seriously," Gargano said.
Silver, who had already urged both the ESDC and Gov. George Pataki to sever ties with Rogers, sent a letter to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg Friday urging him to discontinue Rogers' participation in the redevelopment of the East River waterfront.
"The message has to be clear: It's not the American way to punish people for their national origin," Silver said in an interview.
George Arzt, a communications strategist and one-time press secretary to former Mayor Ed Koch, said that while in some places an architect's foreign policy views may not seem relevant to his work, New York's ethnic stew presents an entirely different challenge.
"It's Israel, it's Ireland, it's Italy - in New York, people are very tied to the ethnic groups of their heritage," Arzt said. "Despite the fact that Mr. Rogers is a world-renowned architect, here in New York, the politics of the Middle East overwhelm any reputation he has."

<title>Balad MKs meet Hamas despite police intervention  </title>
<date>Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Israeli Arab lawmakers met with senior Hamas officials in the Al-Azariya neighborhood in East Jerusalem yesterday, after a large force of Border Police prevented them from meeting in the center of the city. 
Balad faction members Jamal Zahalka and Wasal Taha met Palestinian parliament members Mahmoud Abu Tir, Ahmed Atun and Mohammed Totah to express their solidarity and denounce Israel's decision to deny their residence right and expel them from Jerusalem. 
The meeting was scheduled to take place at the office of Minster for Jerusalem Affairs Khaled Abu Arafe, but after Border Policemen blocked access to the office, they were forced to relocate the meeting to a private house in Al-Azariya. 
According to Balad sources, the security forces also tried to stop the Palestinian minister from leaving the building to join the MKs as they left for the relocated meeting. He was able to leave the site eventually in MK Taha's car. 
The sources said also that Border Policemen stood at the entrance to the building and prevented the three  Palestinian parliament members from entering the building in East Jerusalem. 
Police, however, denied this report and it seems that the Palestinian legislators chose not to arrive after spotting police for fear of confrontations.  
The Arab MKs confronted the Border Policemen verbally. 
Zahalka told Haaretz that the meeting focused on the decision to deprive the three Palestinian MPs' Jerusalem residency. "This is a political decision in violation of international law that violates human rights and mutual agreements that Israel and the Palestinian Authority signed," he said. 
Meanwhile, the chairman of the interim Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, MK Yuval Steinitz is acting to prevent MK Taleb a-Sana (United Arab List) from taking part in the committee's debates, following the meeting of a-Sana and other MKs from his faction with Hamas MPs on Wednesday.  
Steinitz asked the Knesset's temporary speaker, MK Shimon Peres, to set up a temporary ethics committee that would forbid a-Sana from entering the committee's meetings. 
"I'll attend the meetings no matter what Steinitz says, he's behaving like the whites in apartheid South Africa," a-Sana commented.

<title>British academic boycott expires after teaching unions merge</title>
<date>Sun Jun 11 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The recent decision by the largest lecturers' union in Britain to encourage an academic boycott of Israel has expired, as was expected when it was implemented, said the union's general secretary this weekend.
Although the controversial decision was made only May 29, it stopped being valid two weeks ago because the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) has merged with another British union, the Association of University Teachers.
Mackney, general secretary of NATFHE and the merged union, sent a letter Saturday to a British lawyer representing Jewish lecturers against the boycott. The letter confirmed that the boycott decision was no longer valid.
NATFHE's decision encouraged lecturers to boycott Israeli institutions and individuals who do not publicly dissociate themselves from Israeli policies related to the occupation and from discrimination in the field of education.
It had previously been reported that the boycott decision would be valid for only a short time because of the merger. Nonetheless, Israeli anti-boycott groups said Sunday that they saw the move as an achievement of their struggle against the decision.
The International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom, a group that was founded at Bar-Ilan University in response to an earlier academic boycott and was a key player in fighting NATFHE's move, said in a statement Sunday that it was "pleased to announce that [the decision] has been canceled."
Education Minister Yuli Tamir said she "welcomes the cancellation of the British academic boycott thanks to the efforts of all the relevant groups in this matter."
By contrast, MK Rabbi Michael Melchior, the chairman of the Knesset Education Committee, noted that the expiry was a technical matter and "therefore does not indicate anything about a change regarding Israel."
"The celebrations over the revocation of the British academic boycott of Israel are premature and baseless," he said.
Supporters of the boycott said that the Israeli lobby falsely presented the expiration as a cancellation and a victory.
The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, an umbrella organization encompassing dozens of Palestinian nongovernmental organizations, said: "The significance of the academic boycott against Israel adopted by the largest British academic union cannot be viewed in legalistic terms," it said. "Its moral weight should not be underestimated." 
The group added that NATFHE's decision has proven that boycotting Israeli academic institutions because of their cooperation in preserving a special form of anti-Palestinian "apartheid" remains a priority for progressive Western and human rights activists.

<title>British professor confirms 'silent' boycott of Israel </title>
<date>Fri May 19 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
A British professor has refused a request to write an article for an academic journal funded by Israeli universities, saying that he was taking part in a boycott of Israel. 
"Alas, I am unable to accept your kind invitation, for reasons that you may not like. I have, along with many other British academics, signed the academic boycott of Israel, in the face of the brutal and illegal expansionism and the slow-motion ethnic cleansing being practiced by your government," wrote Professor Richard Seaford, from the University of Exeter in England. 
Seaford wrote to Bar-Ilan University's Dr. Daniella Dueck, a member of the Scripta Classica Israelica editorial board who had requested that the British academic write a book review for the journal. 
Seaford, the head of the Department of Classics and Ancient History at Exeter University, told Haaretz that the academic boycott "is just a small contribution to the long-term raising of international consciousness which represents the only hope for an eventual just peace in the Middle East. In this respect, there is a parallel with the academic boycott of apartheid South Africa." 
On May 27-29, the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will debate a proposal in favor of an academic boycott against Israel. 
The International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom (IAB), established at Bar-Ilan University to take action against academic boycotts, published a statement yesterday in which it "warns that a silent boycott by British and Israeli academics is already taking place," and called on an anti-boycott network of some 500 academics around the world to oppose it. 
In March, the London Jewish Chronicle reported that U.K. magazine Dance Europe refused to publish an article on Sally Ann Freeland, an Israeli choreographer, and her dance company. The magazine conditioned the publication of the article on an explicit declaration by Freeland against the occupation, which she refused to make. 
The boycott began in the United States and Europe during the first intifada, and intensified in 2002 after Operation Defensive Shield, during which the IDF occupied West Bank cities. 
The boycott movement began in response to a request by Palestinian organizations, such as The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, an umbrella organization for dozens of Palestinian NGOs. 
An attempt is made almost annually in the U.K. to formally instate an academic boycott on Israel, through official decisions by lecturers' unions. 
The proposal slated to be discussed later this month by NATFHE differs from previous ones. According to the proposal, the current boycott will deal not only with the occupation, but also with discrimination against different populations in Israel, mainly in the field of education. 
The proposal encourages academics to "consider the appropriateness of a boycott of those that do not publicly dissociate themselves" from discriminatory and unequal policies. 
According to the IAB, "Such boycotts have no place in the academic community. Scholarship and research, and their expression in the open and free exchange of ideas, are among the foundations of civilization, and without them there can be no true advancement of human knowledge."

<title>Carter talks with U.S. rabbis about controversial new book </title>
<date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
PHOENIX - Former President Jimmy Carter prayed with rabbis who are angered by his new book's reference to apartheid in describing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but he did not change their minds.  
The Board of Rabbis of Greater Phoenix said they would not call for a boycott of Carter's book, "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid," but they also would not suggest that anyone read it.  
"I don't know if he gets the evil that we are facing," said Rabbi Bonnie Koppell of Scottsdale.  
Carter, 82, was met by a crowd of protesters Tuesday as he appeared at a book store in suburban Tempe to autograph copies of the book.  
He said he chose the title to shine light on the festering conflict and give Americans a different point of view than what they're used to.  
"I wanted to provoke debate," Carter said. "I wanted to provoke discussion."  
Carter's book follows the peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians during his presidency in 1977-1980.   
He is critical of all players in not reaching a better accord, but he is especially critical of the Israelis.   
He previously told The Associated Press that Americans are rarely exposed to anything other than pro-Israeli views in the news media.  
Koppell said Carter's word choice was "gratuitously provocative" and meant to add fuel to an already incendiary subject and sell more books.  
"I don't really see the book as helpful," said Koppell, who has read it.

<title>Cinder blocks and skullcaps</title>
<date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
The stones that were thrown by skullcap-wearing youths from the rooftops of Amona, and the rolling of eyes heavenward (and also at the Israeli public) that followed, injured not only the head of the policeman who was rushed to the hospital in critical condition, but also, to the same extent, the heart of Jedaism, the Torah itself.The police's special patrol unit is the same special patrol unit; the minions, the hilltop youth, are the same minions. Only religious Zionism is not what it once was. From a glorious movement, a symbol and model of Jewish renewal in our times, it has become an extremist movement, irrelevant to the Judaism of the majority of Israeli society. The knitted skullcap has given way to ski masks, and the hoe and the tablets of the Ten Commandments - the symbol of the Bnei Akiva youth movement - to cinder blocks and stones.
It used to be different. From the days of rabbis Isaac Jacob Reines and Judah Leib Maimon to the government ministers Haim-Moshe Shapira and Zerach Wahrhaftig, religious Zionism presented an entirely different face. Its teachers and leaders preached compromise, peace, finding a common denominator. Out of a deeply rooted and burning Torah belief, they clung to the value of sensitivity to the suffering of the "other."
Like tens of thousands of other people, I grew up in the lap of religious Zionism. Because of it, I immigrated to Israel and I educated my children in accordance with its philosophy. In the Bnei Akiva movement they educated us to love of the land, to commitment to and solidarity with the Jewish people, and to adherence to the values of the Torah. This was an equilateral triangle, the power of which was in the combination of all of its elements, and especially the maintenance of the balance among them.In the mid-1970s the process of sliding down the slippery slope began. Fanaticism, extremism and insensitivity to the "other" replaced the old values. The delicate fabric of religious Zionism unraveled. The Jewish people and the Torah were sidelined and their place was taken by the land of Israel. Not the land "of milk and honey" of the prophets" vision, full of justice and equality, but rather a fundamentalist, xenophobic land of Israel. A land of bullying and violence, of injured policemen and uprooted olive trees.
The violent event at Amona hammered another nail into the coffin of religious Zionism and made the Torah a synonym for bullying, extremism and hatred of the "other." In the minds of the settlers there are the rights of humans, and then there are the rights of "our people." The events at Amona have taught us that uncompromising violence and the flying batons of the police know no bounds and do not discriminate between Jew and Arab. All are the same, and smashing the head of an Arab leads easily to smashing the head of a Jew.
Similarly, there is no such thing as halfway democracy. An entire generation of religious Zionism has been raised on the idea that if between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean there are 4.7 million Palestinians, it isn?t terrible if they remain without rights, and if their 6- and 7-year-old children have to be accompanied by Israel Defense Forces soldiers on their way to school for fear of the wrath of masked Jews. Then so be it. They should say thank you and shut up. It is no wonder, then, that when democracy was exalted by the settlers during the period of the disengagement, nobody believed them.
Vox populi vox dei. Between the special patrol battalions and the battalions of the minions this week, the Torah and the philosophy of religious Zionism stood off in a corner, grieving and in disgrace, scorned, mortified and ashamed. In a single day, they had become identified with people in masks hurling rotten eggs at IDF soldiers and large stones, lobbed at the police of the state "of the beginning of our redemption."
No less appalling is the terrible silence of the leaders and teachers. As the years go by, in the name of Torah, fundamentalist voices that our fathers never imagined are being disseminated. Indeed, the wrath of the minions has fallen upon the leaders of the flock, who disappeared, their voices stilled. The redemptive genie has been released from its bottle and has started to destroy everything good in religious Zionism.
As a result of these distortions, most of the people living in Israel are no longer aware of the wonderful, gracious deeds of religious Zionist society here and now, the pioneering spirit that continues to throb within it, its rallying to absorb immigration or the splendid educational institutions it has established.
The difficult scenes at Amona have caused unimaginable damage both to religious Zionism and to the State of Israel. Their effects are influencing the solidarity of Israeli society, the country's image in the eyes of the world and the eyes of world Judaism, and its ability to stand strong in the face of the challenges that still await it.
It is a debate about which direction we are heading, but we must not compromise for a single moment about the methods we use to get there.
For a generation now we have been fighting for the justice of our existence. Facing us are belligerent neighbors who wish to destroy us and fundamentalist states that possess weapons of mass destruction. In this state of affairs Israel must choose another way. One way. Not the way of apartheid, but rather the way of the Jewish and democratic state.
Indeed, this way necessitates painful compromise. Compromise that does not concede the idea of the land of Israel or the idea of redemption. Not disgust, heaven forbid, with respect to the beloved land, but rather the opposite - adherence to it, inside borders dividing us and the Palestinian state, without which we will not be a Jewish state, from a desire to have in it a society that will be a light unto the nations. A society of justice and peace, for every human because he is human.
Rabbi Michael Melchior is an MK representing the Meimad Party in cooperation with the Labor Party.

<title>Davos chair apologizes for magazine's Israel boycott call </title>
<date>Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
DAVOS - The chairman and executive director of the Davos World Economic Forum on Thursday offered a sweeping apology to all delegates for an article calling for the boycott of Israel that appeared in a prestigious magazine issued by the forum. 
Professor Klaus Schwab, who founded the annual Davos conclave 35 years ago, said he was "shocked" to read, just today, the article that appeared in the magazine "Global Agenda." 
Some American Jewish leaders attending the conference said they were not satisfied with the apology. 
"As a publisher," said Mortimer Zuckerman of U.S. News and World Report, "I have to take full responsibility for everything that appears in my publications, whether I read them or not." 
Zukerman, a leading real estate developer, is a former chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. He said he would be meeting with Schwab later Thursday and recommending tougher steps. 
The magazine, "Global Agenda" was prepared for the economic forum by Euromoney PLC, a company that specializes in magazines. Schwab said he would rather forgo having a magazine altogether at next year's conference unless he had "absolute guarantees that this would not happen again."
Among the contributors to the magazine are such world leaders as Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 
Mark Adams, head of press at Davos, explained that the magazine had arrived just a day before the publication deadline and neither he nor Schwab had had the time to browse through it, let alone read the articles in depth. 
The two-page article in question was headlined "boycott Israel." Written by American academic Mazin Qumsiyeh, its message summarized in the subheading was "global civil society ought to boycott Israel until it ends its Apartheid-like treatment of Palestinians." 
As part of its historical review, the article asserted that, "Zionism can be seen as 19th Century style chauvinistic, ethnocentric... nationalistic response to prevalent European chauvinistic, ethnocentric nationalisms. It is in this sense an attempt at assimilation by some Jews following a now-outdated European colonial model."
In the last paragraph he proposes that "global civil society ... build a "Movement Against Zionism" or a global "Movement Against Israeli Apartheid."
In his letter of apology, which Schwab said he would circulate to all delegates at Davos, he wrote: "With great concern and pain I just learned that 'Global Agenda,' a publication distributed to our members at the Annual Meeting 2006, contains an article calling for the boycott of Israel. This article is totally in contradiction to my own, and the Forum's, mission and values. For 36 years I have been committed to fighting for better mutual understanding in the world. The Forum has been deeply involved in efforts to create better relations and reconciliation in the Middle East... 
"As soon as I learned about this article I immediately investigated how this situation could have developed. I concluded that there was an unacceptable failure in the editorial process... an insufficiently short period for review of content, for which there is no excuse. I, on behalf on the Forum, profoundly apologize. I would like express my regret to everybody and can assure everyone that appropriate steps have been instituted to ensure that this situation will never happen again." 
Schwab called in Israeli newsmen to say how "terrible and pained" he felt when the article was brought to his attention. "It happened. I have to take responsibility. I will apologize personally to such good friends and Shimon Peres and Prof Avishai Braverman. 
He said that he would apologize personally when he chaired a session of the full Forum on Friday.

<title>Do boycotts work?</title>
<date>Tue May 30 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Britain's largest association of higher education lecturers this week approved a resolution urging the union's nearly 70,000 members to boycott all Israeli academics and universities unless they actively renounced what the group called Israel's "apartheid policies" in the territories.
The move, which prompted fierce criticism from Education Minister Yuli Tamir, as well as Israeli university leaders and faculty, was the latest in a series of boycotts, divestiture campaigns, and other efforts aimed at pressuring the Israeli government to modify its policies.
To what extent do boycotts and divestiture campaigns influence Israeli governmental policy and actions? Can, and should, the example of apartheid-era South Africa be applied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?

<title>Floating voter / No red carpet for  Dalai Lama</title>
<date>Thu Feb 16 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
The Dalai Lama of Tibet arrived yesterday for his fourth visit in Israel.
Unlike his two previous visits, he will not be meeting Israeli officials this time. The papers reported that Avishay Braverman is the only one with whom he will meet, but Braverman is not a minister, and it is doubtful if he will be.
It was also reported that the government of China was very annoyed. The Chinese are wasting their anger this time: the visit is a private one anyway, and all the ministers are keeping their distance from the exiled leader.
In days gone by, Israel Radio used to air at dawn summaries of the daily newspapers' editorials. I was especially fond of this item, and used to listen with wonder to the ultra-Orthodox Hamodia warning China for its iniquities. I have no doubt a billion Chinese were also impressed, and from time to time felt fear gripping them, for some unknown reason. I knew what it was: Hamodia had issued a warning. Who wouldn't run for his life?
I have no idea if that item is still being broadcast and when, and whether Hamodia is still warning China, or if things have turned around and now China is warning Hamodia. In any case, China has warned Israel this week in no uncertain terms not to roll out the red carpet for the Dalai Lama, because China has a monopoly on red.
And yes, official Israel is panicking - after all, we know how to deal with repressive dictatorships, it's our specialty. How well we cooperated with South Africa in the dark days of Apartheid, Argentina in the days of the brown generals, and China of Tiananmen Square, with all those vital interests, talks, obligations.
We are more afraid of the Chinese than others are. Even the president of the United States has already met the Dalai Lama despite the protests, but none of Israel?s wimpy ministers will meet the man, who is regarded throughout the civilized world as a great fighter against violence and for peace.
I myself received a warning call from the Foreign Ministry when I was environment minister and later education minister − two other realms identified with the Dalai Lama. Those officials, who were afraid of their own shadow, threatened me with a sharp crisis and even the severing of relations with China, which cast a giant shadow.
I reconsidered, and decided to meet him after all. We met twice, talked, and I expanded my horizons.And what do you think happened after a single Israeli minister met the Dalai Lama? Surprise surprise − nothing at all. Some time later the president of China came to Israel, together with his education minister, and the Chinese and Israeli ministers signed an agreement between the two states.
As we well know, our ministers find it easy to be always afraid, even easier to be ashamed. How much harder it is to be just a human being and fix one's gaze on the enlightened side of the world.

<title>Israeli envoy slams Canadian union's move to boycott Israel</title>
<date>Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Israel's ambassador to Canada on Friday condemned a move by the Ontario leg of the country's largest public employee union to join an international campaign protesting Israel's policies toward the Palestinian territories.
National Jewish groups and prominent Jewish politicians have also blasted the move by delegates at the Canadian Union of Public Employees convention, who voted Saturday to support the campaign calling for sanctions and disinvestment from Israel until it recognizes a Palestinian right to self-determination.
The Ontario branch represents nearly half of the 450,000 union members across Canada in health care, education, social services, universities, transportation and other sectors.
Ottawa is a close ally of Israel, yet also a strong proponent of Palestinian statehood. Canada, under Conservative Party Prime Minister Stephen Harper, was the first country after Israel to suspend financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority in March because the new Hamas-led government refuses to renounce violence and recognize Israel.
The campaign to boycott Israel started last year, spearheaded by the Jerusalem-based Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center, and has been supported by a growing number of groups around the world, including many North American churches and 20 Quebec organizations.
Britain's largest college teachers' union voted Monday to consider boycotting Israeli academics over what members termed "apartheid" policies and discrimination against Palestinians.
The movement has outraged Jewish leaders, who say the strategy is anti-Semitic and fails to recognize Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks by Palestinian extremists.
"Many, including members of CUPE, are questioning why CUPE is so unwisely injecting itself, its good name and the goodwill of its members in such a partisan and openly hostile manner into Middle East politics," Israel's Ambassador Alan Baker wrote in an editorial in the National Post on Friday.
Under the resolution approved by delegates, CUPE Ontario said it will develop an education campaign similar to one by the British Columbia CUPE chapter, which since 2000 has promoted a "solidarity campaign" with the Palestinians. The British Columbia chapter has noted that the International Court of Justice ruled in July 2005 that Israel's West Bank barrier was illegal and must be dismantled.
CUPE said in a news release after its Ontario convention that the Israeli "apartheid wall" has been condemned and determined illegal under international law.
The union noted that Canada's free-trade agreement with Israel was the only such pact the country has outside the Western Hemisphere. In Ontario, the provincial liquor control board carries more than 30 Israeli wines, many produced in the Golan Heights, CUPE said.
"Boycott, divestment and sanction worked to end apartheid in South Africa," said Katherine Nastovski, chairwoman of the CUPE Ontario international solidarity committee. "We believe the same strategy will work to enforce the rights of Palestinian people, including the right of refugees to return to their homes and properties."
MK Natan Sharansky (Likud) wrote in an editorial Thursday that he was "shocked and saddened" by the CUPE vote.
"This decision is totally out of sync with Mideast realities, and runs counter to every principle of justice and human rights," Sharansky wrote in The Globe and Mail.
Leaders of B'nai Brith Canada, the Canadian Jewish Congress and the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center also called the vote outrageous, saying Jewish and non-Jewish CUPE members had contacted them to complain they felt betrayed by the vote.
"What we are seeing is a blatant attempt by CUPE to advance a clearly politicized anti-Israel agenda that is inconsistent with the union's core mandate of serving its members," said Frank Dimant, vice president of B'nai Brith Canada.
The Anti-Defamation League harshly condemned the decision, calling it "deplorable and offensive." 
The decision was made by the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), which has 450,000 members. 
The union's decision says that it is joining an international campaign to boycott Israel and to impose sanctions on it, until it fulfills all UN resolutions including the right of return of Palestinian refugees from 1948. The union also intends to support pro-Palestinian organizations in an educational campaign, which will depict Israel as an apartheid state. It called on the national union to join and pass a similar resolution. 
ADL director general Abraham Foxman said "the union's resolution makes no effort to reflect current realities on the ground in the region. There is no mention of Israel's unilateral redeployment from Gaza and proposed action in the West Bank, nor is there any recognition of the challenges posed by ... Hamas' reign over the PA and its refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist or to renounce terror."

<title>Israeli scientists: British boycott may hinder younger researchers</title>
<date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Monday's decision by Britain's largest lecturers union in favor of an academic boycott of Israel has worried some academics here. They said on Tuesday that although it would probably not have an immediate impact on prominent Israeli researchers, it may affect their younger colleagues who have not yet established themselves in their fields.
The union has decided to boycott Israeli academics who do not publicly disassociate themselves from Israel's "apartheid policies."
"We don't know at what pace the practical impact of the decision will be felt," said Zvi Ziegler, a professor at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and chairman of the Israeli Inter-Senate Committee of the Universities, when asked for comment on the decision by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE). "But our fear is that the decision gives legitimacy to people who are debating whether to boycott Israel."
Ziegler stressed that all Israeli scientists are dependent on colleagues from abroad at various stages of their academic careers. 
"No one will prevent Nobel Prize winner Aaron Ciechanover from publishing an article in a scientific journal," he said. "But a young scientist who sends an article to a British journal is liable to encounter editors who hesitate to publish his article and delay its ublication."
The Inter-Senate Committee, which sharply condemned NATFHE's decision on Monday, is currently focusing on "making the academic boycott completely illegitimate because it is an assault on academic freedom, and getting the senior academic establishment in Britain to publish a declaration that academic boycotts are unacceptable," Ziegler said.
The Israel Science Foundation, the largest funder of basic research in Israel, sends out some 10,000 letters a year asking scientists to examine research proposals by Israeli researchers and decide whether they deserve funding. According to Professor Joseph Klafter, the ISF's chairman, about 10 scientists have refused to participate in the review process this year. He said that the foundation first began encountering such refusals following Operation Defensive Shield in March-April 2002. Such refusals typically say something like "I respect my Israeli colleagues, but until Israeli policy changes, I will be compelled to refuse your requests."
A forum comprised of the presidents of all Israeli universities discussed the boycott at its meeting on Tuesday and issued a statement describing NATFHE's decision as "harmful and dangerous." Professor Moshe Kaveh, the forum's chair and president of Bar-Ilan University, said: "The mixing of politics and scientific research is a destructive phenomenon that must be fought aggressively."
Professor Steven Rose, a prominent philosopher of science who serves as secretary of the British Committee for Universities of Palestine, said yesterday: "We recognize that this has not been an easy decision, with the extreme pressure put upon the Union by outside forces, including the Israeli government and the organized Israel lobby ... The vote is an historic step forward, both expressing our solidarity with Palestinian academic colleagues and also in helping persuade Israeli colleagues that it is time to cease silent complicity with the illegal acts of the Israeli state."
Tomorrow, however, NATFHE is due to merge with another lecturers union, which will render the boycott resolution advisory only.

<title>Jimmy Carter: Israel's 'apartheid' policies worse than South Africa's</title>
<date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter said in remarks broadcast Monday that Israeli policy in the West Bank represented instances of apartheid worse even that those that once held sway in South Africa.
Carter's comments were broadcast on Israel Radio, which played a tape of an interview with the ex-president, but did not specify to whom Carter was speaking. But has made similar remarks in recent interviews
"When Israel does occupy this territory deep within the West Bank, and connects the 200-or-so settlements with each other, with a road, and then prohibits the Palestinians from using that road, or in many cases even crossing the road, this perpetrates even worse instances of apartness, or apartheid, than we witnessed even in South Africa."
Carter said his new book
The book has sparked strong criticism from Jewish figures in the United States. Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, has said that some comments from the former president border on anti-Semitism.
"When you think about the charge that he has made that the Jewish people control the means of communication, it is odious," Foxman was quoted as saying last week. "If the Jews controlled the media, how come he is traveling around the country speaking about this book on talk shows?"
Carter has rejected the criticism of the book and its use of the word apartheid.
"I feel completely at ease," said Carter, about his commitment to the book, which accuses Israel of oppressing Palestinians. "I am not running for office. And I have Secret Service protection."
"The greatest commitment in my life has been trying to bring peace to Israel," Carter told the Atlanta Press Club last week. 
"Israel will never have peace until they agree to withdraw [from the territories]."

<title>Largest labor union in Ontario unanimously votes to boycott Israel</title>
<date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The largest labor union in the Canadian province of Ontario has voted unanimously to boycott Israel "until it recognizes the Palestinians' right of self-determination" and accepts all United Nations resolutions relating to Palestinians, including the right of return.
The Anti-Defamation League has harshly condemned the decision, calling it "deplorable and offensive." 
The decision was made by the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), which has 450,000 members. 
The union's decision says that it is joining an international campaign to boycott Israel and to impose sanctions on it, until it fulfills all UN resolutions including Resolution 194, which recognizes the right of return of Palestinian refugees from 1948. In addition, the union intends to support pro-Palestinian organizations in an educational campaign, which will depict Israel as an apartheid state.  
It called on the national union to join it and to pass a similar resolution.  
ADL Director General Abraham Foxman said that "the union's resolution makes no effort to reflect current realities on the ground in the region. There is no mention of Israel's unilateral redeployment from Gaza and proposed action in the West Bank, nor is there any recognition of the challenges posed by the terrorist group Hamas' reign over the Palestinian Authority and its refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist or to renounce terror." 
The vote by the Ontario labor union to boycott Israel came hot on the heels of a similar decision by British lecturers' made earlier in the week.
The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, the largest union of university teachers in Britain adopted this week a resolution encouraging an academic boycott of Israel. 
The decision by NATFHE, which has 69,000 members, enjoins members to consider boycotting Israeli academics and academic institutions that do not publicly take an explicit stand against the "apartheid policies" and discriminatory policy in the field of education. 
The resolution, passed at NATFHE's annual conference, aroused controversy, and at the end of the debate 53 percent of conference delegates supported it, while 38 percent voted against and the rest abstained. The resolution passed despite an aggressive and extensive campaign waged by Israeli organizations and Jewish groups in Britain and the United States. 
Members of the International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom, a body formed at Bar-Ilan University last year in the wake of an attempt to impose an academic boycott on Israel, said that "they will try to attack the resolution through legal channels." Last year, when a smaller British union, the Association of University Teachers (AUT), passed a resolution calling for an academic boycott of Israel, it was canceled a month later by means of a procedural clause in the AUT regulations that was found by a British-Jewish academic. 
Education Minister Yuli Tamir said that she will try to invite a group of senior academics from Britain to come to Israel "and prove that the boycott is on the fringes, and the mainstream actually views Israel as a partner."

Larry Garber is the CEO/Executive Director of the New Israel Fund (NIF)
Garber served as a senior policymaker with United States Agency for International Development (USAID) from 1993-99 and as Director of USAID's West Bank and Gaza Mission from 1999-2004 (full bio here
We will mostly discuss issues related to civil rights, the gaps between haves/have nots in Israel, and the Israel-Diaspora relationships pertaining to these topics. Readers are welcomed to send questions to rosnersdomain@haaretz.co.il
Dear Larry
I'll ask the last question for this week and dialog, and as most readers wanted to ask mainly about your involvement with Arab Israelis, I want to go back to the more general question of prioritizing the different competing causes that the NIF work for. How do you make the decision of what's more important, and more specifically, what do you think are the most 3-4 urgent issues on which you'd like NIF to have an impact in the coming years. 
Thank you for your time and cooperation.
Best
Rosner
Shmuel,
I appreciate your asking this more general question.  Too many people assume that the New Israel Fund works only in the Arab sector.  While we are proud of our efforts to combat discrimination against the Arab minority, NIF work in the Arab sector constitutes only 30 percent of our total program resources.  The remaining 70 percent of NIF programs address problems faced by other marginalized groups (e.g., new immigrants, the disabled, gays and lesbians, etc.) and, more generally, Israeli society (e.g., environmental degradation and non-recognition of Conservative and Reform movements) 
Five years ago, we undertook a comprehensive strategic planning process and identified the following major problems facing Israeli society: the widening gaps between rich and poor; and the lack of civic equality towards minority groups and towards those whose practices differed from religious orthodoxy.  These problems remain and pose subtle but real challenges to Israel?s security and democratic character.  For example, we read with surprise and concern that Israel, among developed countries, now has the largest gap between rich and poor and the highest percentage of children who live in households that are classified as falling below the poverty level, as defined by Israel?s National Insurance Institute.  This must change.
We maintain the areas of focus identified five years ago ? civil rights, social justice and religious pluralism ? even as we adapt our programs in response to specific developments.   Thus, last year we undertook a special campaign to ensure that the disengagement process was implemented in a manner that did not undermine Israel?s core democratic values.  And, we responded to this summer?s war with initiatives that addressed the psycho-social traumas inflicted upon segments of the population that were unable to leave their homes in the North and the economic hardships suffered by micro entrepreneurs, particularly women.  We also are now implementing new programs dealing with the problems of youth-at-risk in the Russian and Ethiopian communities and the mentally disabled.    
We are also concerned with the Israel-Diaspora relationship.  We track polls that show a growing disaffection with Israel among young Jews.  And, the vibrancy of the contemporary Jewish Diaspora experience is rarely appreciated by most Israelis.  We believe that the type of Israel-Diaspora partnership that NIF represents, and the type of civil rights and social justice issues that we address in Israel, provide opportunities to engage young Israeli and Diaspora Jews, who are determined to change the world or, in our language, to engage in Tikkun Olam.   
Let me close this dialogue with a personal note.  At the end of the day, I believe that Israel will prosper over the long-term only if a peaceful resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is attained.  And, having worked for five years with Palestinians, I am convinced that a majority of the Palestinians have reached a similar conclusion regarding what they need to achieve their aspirations.  However, unlike many of my friends, I do not believe that the starting point for achieving such a resolution is a new American diplomatic initiative, or even a dramatic change in policy by Israeli or Palestinian leaders.  Rather, attitudinal changes are required within both societies.  These changes will not come about merely through dialogues between Palestinians and Israelis, however worthy such efforts may be.  Instead, within each society a culture of tolerance and respect toward fellow citizens must be established, and an appreciation of what is required to sustain a democratic and prosperous society must be internalized.  These objectives motivated my work with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, and they do likewise for my current efforts with the New Israel Fund.
Shabbat Shalom and Happy last day of Hanukkah!
Larry
Dear Larry, 
You imply in your response to the previous reader that Israel's treatment of its Arab citizens is not equal. If that's the case, why do people jump all over the fact that former president Jimmy Carter called Israel an apartheid state? 
Nora Hassan,OH
Dear Nora,
I have not yet read Carter's latest book, so I will not comment on the content, or involve myself in the debate regarding Carter's motives, analysis or recommendations.  However, although Carter is apparently careful not to describe Israel as an apartheid state, his use of such a loaded term in the title, even if the reference is only to Israel's policies in the West Bank and Gaza, inevitably serves to provoke, rather than enlighten.  
Lest we forget, apartheid was a pernicious system of state-sponsored physical separation and constitutionally prescribed discrimination based on an overtly racist ideology. Israel, with a problematic history of unequal treatment toward its Arab citizens, is in no way comparable to the apartheid regime in South Africa. 
When I speak of Israel's unequal treatment towards its Arab citizens, my reference point is the contemporary U.S. experience with race. While the post-civil war amendments to the US constitution, theoretically, eliminated legal forms of racial discrimination, the reality was that, in much of the country, blacks could not purchase property in certain neighborhoods, send their children to quality schools, and participate in the political process. 
However, during the past 50 years, through a combination of political activism, civil rights legislation and precedent-setting court decisions, the situation has improved dramatically, although we are not free, nor may we ever be, of the legacy of our problematic history. 
The realities in Israel are also changing. In 1999, the Israeli High Court voided a practice that prevented an Israeli Arab couple from purchasing a home in the town of Katzir. And several months ago, the High Court voided a government policy that identified towns and villages as national preference zones because the policy was being implemented in a manner that discriminated against Israel's Arab minority.  
There are limits, however, to what can be accomplished through a litigation strategy. As is true today in the United States, the legacy of discrimination in Israel contributes to the lack of economic opportunities available to Israel's Arab citizens and to the poor physical and social infrastructures that affect their quality of life.  
We hope this will change. With the money that has been committed by the government and other resources that have been raised abroad, the government has a unique opportunity to address the wide economic and social gaps that exist between Jews and Arabs, and also among different segments of Israel's Jewish community.  
To monitor government commitments and to advocate for just reconstruction of the North during the post-war period SHATIL, NIF's technical assistance arm, has formed the North Star Forum, which comprises a conglomerate of diverse social change organizations. Already, the North Star Forum has convened a series of public hearings and organized demonstrations to ensure that the government's actions correspond with its rhetoric. 
Larry
Dear Mr. Garber,
I think the NIF got all mixed up. You think that by helping the Arabs (Arab Israelis and Arab Palestinians) you're helping the Jews. But it is not so. If you want to help the Jewish people - and the Jewish State - you should help, well, Jews, not Arabs. And so as to have a question at the end of my remarks let me ask this: Why do you invest so much of your money and effort in helping Arabs? Let the 22 Arab States contribute money for them. 
Thank you,Michael J. Nissenbaum
Dear Michael,
As I stated in a previous posting, NIF is committed to supporting Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.  Both Jewish tradition and democratic practice require that Israel treat all citizens in a non-discriminatory and just fashion. Unfortunately, as described in detail in the Orr Commission report, which was prepared following the events of October 2000 when 12 Israeli Arabs were killed by the police, Israeli governments have too often failed to respect these norms as they apply to the Arab minority. The result is that Israel?s Arab citizens, taken as a whole, rank at the bottom of virtually all socio-economic indicators and feel alienated from the state. 
In these circumstances, NIF is quite proud of the fact that for 27 years we have been a leader in funding organizations that advocate for equal treatment for all Israeli citizens, including the Arab minority. And, we are proud that some progress has been made, most notably as a result of a series of decisions by Israel?s High Court during the past decade that have proscribed the most egregious discriminatory practices affecting the Arab minority. Still, there is much work that needs to be done.
While I am comfortable relying on a values based argument, I am also are convinced that Israeli security requires the fair treatment of all citizens. Looking around the world, we see too many instances where the discriminatory treatment of an ethnic, religious or national minority leads to the minority?s rejection of the state's authority and the bloody consequences of an internal conflict. Certainly, the more effective and less costly approach is to address legitimate grievances forthrightly by changing laws, practices and attitudes.
NIF's promotion of equal rights for all Israelis was once viewed as a fringe position within the Diaspora Jewish community, but fortunately opinions are changing. The current head of the Jewish Agency, Zeev Bielski, has stated explicitly that his mandate covers the well-being of all Israeli citizens, Jews and Arabs. His view has now received the endorsement of the United Jewish Communities. And, an Inter-Agency Task Force on Israeli Arabs has now been operating for two years with a steering committee that includes the Anti-Defamation League, the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, the American Joint Distribution Committee, and the New Israel Fund.
Lastly, I would ask what those who critique my position want Israel to do. Establish two sets of laws governing the Jewish and Arab population, and overtly discriminate against the latter? Prevent the Arab population from taking advantage of living in a democracy by denying them the right to organize or to express themselves freely? I doubt such an approach would be tolerated by a majority of the Israeli population, and even Israel's friends in the international community would have a hard time defending such policies. 
Larry
Dear Larry,
My second question will be fairly abstract, but it is very important. I want you to try and draw for the readers the boundaries of Jewish-American intervention in Israel's affairs. And what do I mean: You (and the organization you work for) have many goals, some fairly consensual, some more controversial. However, your funding of social-justice activities in Israel can't be merely described as "social work," but rather as an ideological quest to change the nature of Israel. You try to promote certain Israeli policies and legislation; you recently called on the Prime Minister to reject a party or a person (namely, Avigdor Lieberman) from his cabinet. And other possible examples are endless. 
What is it that gives the New Israel Fund the right to meddle in internal Israeli affairs? Is it the fact that you have some Israelis as partners? Is it the money allocations? Is it the stake that every Jew has in Israel? And what will you consider an issue on which NIF can't take a position that's contrary to Israel's official policy? 
Best,Rosner
Shmuel,
Your question is abstract in the context of talking about American-Jewish organizations, in general.  As I constantly discover, there are many types of Jewish organizations and they would offer a range of answers to your question.  So, let me speak only as the Executive Director of the New Israel Fund.  
NIF was formed in 1979 as a partnership between Israelis and Diaspora Jews.  We have a single Board and a unified management structure.  Our program staff are all Israeli citizens; they live in Israel and they work directly with Israeli counterparts. Our grants committee, which determines the organizations that receive NIF support, is overwhelmingly Israeli.  Likewise, our SHATIL committee, which is responsible for supervising our technical assistance arm and implementing targeted projects.  Thus, when we take a position on a specific policy issue, we do so from the perspective of being part of the Israeli polity, and not as an external actor.  
More generally, NIF draws inspiration from both the prophetic tradition in Judaism and the Israeli Declaration of Independence.  When we seek to promote social change in Israel, these sources provide the intellectual basis for the policies and organizations that we support. At the same time, the Diaspora experience also may influence our substantive discourse and the approaches we use for achieving our social change objectives.
As an organization, NIF is firmly committed to Israel?s right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state. Our specific emphasis, for the past several years, has been on promoting civil rights and non-discrimination, social justice, and religious pluralism and tolerance for all Israelis. These objectives reflect our collective ? Diaspora Jew and Israeli ? understanding of both what is required to create a just and secure Israel.  
The Avigdor Lieberman case provides an excellent example of how our processes work.  When Prime Minister Olmert announced his intention to invite Lieberman into the government, we joined with a broad coalition of Israeli nongovernmental organizations to protest the decision and published an ad in the media explaining our concerns.  Ten days later, NIF President Peter Edelman and I published an op-ed in Newsday further articulating why including someone with Lieberman?s public views about Israel?s Arab citizens in the government coalition is so antithetical to Israel?s democratic values. 
We believe that, in a democratic society, the government should not be immune from criticism on any issue, even those that require a balancing of security considerations with human rights and other difficult issues.  Thus, we are thankful that Israel has competitive political parties, vibrant media outlets, active civil society organizations and a very independent judiciary.   In this democratic environment, NIF?s role is to support, consistent with our commitment to Israel?s special character and our agreed upon specific objectives, those nongovernmental organizations who seek to influence government policy, litigate before the high court or educate the Israeli public regarding particular matters. 
Larry
Dear Larry,
We will be discussing other issues this week, but I will start with the topic that now tops of the agenda around the world. As former director of USAID's West Bank and Gaza Mission (1999-2004), there aren't many Americans who can claim greater knowledge of Palestinian society than you. Does this help you to make an assessment of the recent moves by Abbas and Hamas? Are we on the way to the dreaded civil war? 
Best, Rosner
Shmuel,
Happy Hanukkah!
As you can imagine, I have been watching the situation in the West Bank and Gaza deteriorate with considerable consternation.  
Having spent five years as the Director of the USAID's West Bank and Gaza mission, I have many friends and former colleagues living in the Palestinian Territories. Their description of security and humanitarian conditions are depressing, and their expectations of a better future are growing increasingly faint.  
Tensions between Hamas and Fatah, at the political level and between their respective security forces, are real and escalating. Consequently, the likelihood of a civil war is a contingency that deserves attention by policymakers in Ramallah, Jerusalem and Washington.
I am always cautious, however, in predicting the immediate on-set of civil war. Several times during my tenure as USAID Director, and certainly in the year following Hamas' parliamentary electoral victory, the prospects of a civil war among Palestinians seemed imminent. Indeed, many in the international community and in Israel view such an outcome as a potentially positive development. 
The argument is that the Palestinians need an "Altalena" like event, whereby a single authority is recognized, and all independent militias dismantled by force or suasion.  Certainly, present circumstances are more dismal than ever before. 
The political rift between Fatah and Hamas is exacerbated by the fact that the various Palestinian security forces, many of which are dominated by Fatah loyalists, have not been paid their full salaries for months.  
At the same time, Hamas has been developing a security force to complement their existing militia. So far, we have only seen minor skirmishes, but the firepower is readily available for a much more sustained and bloody internal conflict.  
That said, I do not think a civil war is inevitable nor do I think a civil war would necessarily serve Israeli or U.S. interests.  Palestinians are accustomed to moving toward the brink of civil war, and then pulling back at the last moment. I suspect this may happen again. 
President Abbas' announcement on Saturday that he will seek early presidential and parliamentary elections may be a ploy to force Hamas to bargain more seriously about the formation of a National Unity government, which would obtain international legitimacy and facilitate the flow of aid from the international community and the withheld tax revenues from Israel.  
At the end of the day, Palestinian society, like Israeli society, is subject to many domestic political pressures and constraints. The party that instigates a civil war would lose significant public backing. And the reality of a Palestinian civil war is that Israel would be drawn more directly into the firing line and the restraints that have minimized the impact of what is happening in the West Bank and Gaza on the daily lives of most Israelis (i.e., excluding those in Sderot and the nearby kibbutzim) would be lifted.  
My last comment is that those who care about Israeli security should not look callously at the on-going suffering in the Palestinian Territories. Through my years as Mission Director, I became convinced that only when Palestinians (and Israelis) see positive improvements in their daily lives would the ground be fertile for the far-reaching concessions necessary for a permanent peace. We are continuing in the wrong direction; the further we slip into the abyss the harder it will be to reverse course.

<title>Major U.K. teachers union votes for academic boycott of Israel</title>
<date>Tue May 30 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The largest union of university teachers in Britain yesterday adopted a resolution encouraging an academic boycott of Israel. The decision by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE), which has 69,000 members, enjoins members to consider boycotting Israeli academics and academic institutions that do not publicly take an explicit stand against the "apartheid policies" and discriminatory policy in the field of education. 
The Guardian reported that the resolution, passed at NATFHE's annual conference, aroused controversy, and at the end of the debate 53 percent of conference delegates supported it, while 38 percent voted against and the rest abstained. The resolution passed despite an aggressive and extensive campaign waged by Israeli organizations and Jewish groups in Britain and the United States. 
Members of the International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom, a body formed at Bar-Ilan University last year in the wake of an attempt to impose an academic boycott on Israel, said that "they will try to attack the resolution through legal channels." Last year, when a smaller British union, the Association of University Teachers (AUT), passed a resolution calling for an academic boycott of Israel, it was canceled a month later by means of a procedural clause in the AUT regulations that was found by a British-Jewish academic. 
Education Minister Yuli Tamir said yesterday that she will try to invite a group of senior academics from Britain to come to Israel "and prove that the boycott is on the fringes, and the mainstream actually views Israel as a partner." 
On Monday, NATFHE secretary general Paul Mackney surprised the delegates with a speech against the motion. Secretaries general are not supposed to express their personal opinion, but are expected to support and work in accordance with any resolution passed by the union. Mackney was accused of "trying to undermine" the resolution. 
"Most of us are very angry about the occupation of Palestine. But this isn't the motion and it isn't the way," Mackney said. 
He also said that in order to adopt an academic boycott, a much more comprehensive debate on the issue must be carried out. "We need to develop a coherent and sustainable policy," Mackney said. 
He proposed that in place of the boycott motion, the union pass a resolution reaffirming solidarity with the Palestinians. 
'Reactionary and undemocratic'
Tom Hickey, a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Brighton and the sponsor of the boycott motion, argued at the conference that, "The majority of Israeli academics are either complicit or acquiescent in the Israeli policies in the occupied territories." 
According to Hickey, Israeli universities are places of freedom, but not for those excluded. "Where is the response from academic scholars to the horrors of life in the refugee camps? Where are the words of condemnation?" he asked. 
Ronnie Fraser, chair of Academic Friends for Israel, termed the resolution "reactionary and undemocratic," and warned that its passage "only brings dishonor and sheer ridicule upon our union." 
The motion ultimately passed by a delegate vote of 106 to 71. 
The NATFHE and AUT are slated to merge in early June. According to NATFHE, yesterday's resolution will last as official union policy only until the merger, after which it will be in the category of an advisory to the new union, which might adopt it or adopt a new policy. 
According to Prof. Hagit Messer-Yaron, vice president for research and development at Tel Aviv University, it is unlikely a scientist who has maintained ties with an Israeli scientist until now will sever these ties following the resolution passed yesterday. "However," she added, "whoever was inclined toward a boycott even before the resolution, has now received support." 
Prof. Yosef Yeshurun, rector of Bar-Ilan University and chair of the International Committee for Academic Freedom, ventured that "the decision will not have an impact on Israeli science in the near future. But you also have to take into account the long-term implications." 
According to Yeshurun, additional academic organizations in Europe might pass similar motions, and noted that such resolutions stand to hurt mainly young scientists who have not yet solidified a network of personal ties. 
Mackney said there were British academics boycotting Israel even before the "official boycott" was adopted. He added that he knows colleagues, who as a direct result of the debate provoked by the draft resolution "ask their colleagues in Israel about their attitude toward what's going on in the occupied territories." 
The efforts in Britain to impose an official academic boycott on Israel have received backing from dozens of Palestinian civilian organizations. The umbrella group Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel praised NATFHE for "leading the way in moral responsibility." 
According to the group, "The persistence of academic boycott efforts proves that many academics in the U.K. and beyond do not buy the disingenuous claim that boycott of Israeli academic institutions conflicts with 'academic freedom' or 'inadvertently promotes anti-Semitism.'" 
The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister, Lord Triesman, issued a statement yesterday saying: "We regret today's decision by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education to vote in favor of boycotting Israeli academics and institutions. The British Government has a record of supporting academic freedom for academics throughout the world. We also recognize the independence of NATFHE. We believe that such academic boycotts are counterproductive and retrograde. Far more can be obtained through dialogue and academic cooperation."

<title>Ministers, professors slam U.K. boycott of Israeli academe</title>
<date>Mon May 29 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Israeli leaders and academics Monday slammed a vote by the largest university and college lecturers' union in Britain in favor of a motion recommending that its members boycott Israeli academics and institutions that do not publicly declare their opposition to Israeli policy in the territories. 
The motion passed with 106 in favor and 71 against. There were 21 abstentions.
The 69,000-member National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) debated the proposal for the boycott at its annual conference in the northern English city of Blackpool. Two parts of the motion passed with a show of hands while a third went to a vote. Under the boycott, union members also will not submit articles to Israeli research journals. 
Education Minister Yuli Tamir lashed out at the boycott on Monday, calling it detrimental to the world of academia.
"The decision to boycott academic institutions is a move worthy of condemnation and revulsion," Tamir said. "Those how are implementing this boycott are harming academia's freedom and turning it into a tool for political forces." 
Last week, Tamir spoke with the British minister for higher education and requested that he act to prevent the boycott.
National Religious Party MK Zevulun Orlev, chairman of the Knesset Science Committee, appealed Monday to parliament members from Germany, Canada, Britain and France to condemn the teachers' union decision.
"This is a test of the free world," Orlev wrote to them. "We expect you to condemn this anti-Semitic and racist decision and to help institutions of higher education in your countries tighten their cooperation with science, technology and higher education institutes in Israel."
Haifa University also condemned the boycott.
"Any attempt to create ties between politics and academic research is simply McCarthyism. Haifa University rejects the decision by the British teachers' union to place a boycott on members of Israeli academia," university president Aharon Ben-Ze'ev said. 
"This is a hypocritical and callous decision that has no place in the academic world. Haifa University calls on all those who hold dear academic freedom to join us in fighting this decision and act to bring about its cancellation. The university will continue to cooperate with its colleagues and friends in Israel, Britain and around the world in an effort to defend the principle of academic freedom and to fight the intention to boycott members of Israeli academia."
The British government expressed its regret at NATFHE's decision, calling it counterproductive. 
Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister Lord Triesman issued a statement saying: "We regret today's decision by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) to vote in favor of boycotting Israeli academics and institutions. 
"The British Government has a record of supporting academic freedom for academics throughout the world. We also recognize the independence of NATFHE. We believe that such academic boycotts are counterproductive and retrograde. Far more can be obtained through dialogue and academic cooperation."
Triesman himself served as deputy general secretary of NATFHE in 1984 and was general secretary of the Association of University Teachers trade union from 1993 to 2001.
Israeli and Jewish organizations in the U.S. and U.K. ran campaigns against the boycott, including a series of petitions against the motion.
On Saturday, the Guardian published a letter
The NATFHE president, John Wilkin, also received a petition with 4,725 signatures from Scholars for Peace in the Middle East, an American organization whose mission statement includes encouraging academics "to develop effective responses to the ideological distortions, including anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist slanders..." 
On Monday, NATFHE Secretary General Paul Mackney surprised the union with a speech against the motion, prior to the vote.
"Most of us are very angry about the occupation of Palestine. But this isn't the motion and it isn't the way," Mackney said. 
He also said that in order to adopt a decision to boycott Israeli academia a much more comprehensive debate on the issue must be carried out.
"We need to develop a coherent and sustainable policy," Mackney said. 
The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel said, "The NATFHE vote proves once again that despite all the obstacles, boycotting Israeli academic institutions due to their complicity in maintaining Israel's special form of apartheid against the Palestinians remains prominent on the agenda of western progressives and human rights activists."
"This is a significant accomplishment considering the campaign of intimidation and bullying waged against proponents of the NATFHE academic boycott initiative by Israeli networks and powerful Zionist lobbies in the United Kingdom and the United States," the statement read.
"At this stage of the international boycott movement, Palestinian boycott advocates", they said, aim first to keep alive an open debate on the need for boycott and sanctions against Israel "until it fully complies with international law and universal human rights."

<title>New U.K. attempt to boycott Israeli universities, professors</title>
<date>Tue May 09 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The largest university and college lecturers union in Britain is likely to decide shortly to recommend that its 67,000 members boycott Israeli lecturers and academic institutions that do not publicly declare their opposition to Israeli policy in the territories. 
The boycott motion, which was drafted by the southeast region of the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE), will be brought to a vote at its annual national conference, which will be held May 27-29. It comes about a year after the last boycott by British lecturers. 
In April 2005, the British Association of University Teachers (AUT) decided to impose an academic boycott on Bar-Ilan and Haifa universities, but subsequently reversed the decision. The two lecturers organizations are slated to merge at the beginning of June. 
Unlike the previous boycott, which targeted two specific institutions, the current motion relates to all lecturers and academic institutions in Israel. Now that the University of Haifa has threatened the AUT with a lawsuit, the NATFHE motion is more cautious: instead of recommending the lecturers union boycott Israeli institutions, it calls on the union to suggest its members carry out the boycott. 
"The conference invites members to consider their own responsibility for ensuring equity and non-discrimination in contacts with Israeli educational institutions or individuals, and to consider the appropriateness of the boycott of those that do not publicly dissociate themselves from such policies," the NATFHE motion states. It also encourages lecturers to hold meetings on the issue on campus. 
'Apartheid policies'
The motion explicitly says NATFHE will recognize Israeli policies, while at the same time denigrating them as "apartheid policies, including construction of the exclusion wall and discriminatory educational practices." 
Ronnie Fraser, a NATFHE member who heads an organization called Academic Friends of Israel, said he didn't think any decisions made at the annual conference would have an immediate effect on the policies of the merged lecturers association, but his group called on NATFHE not to discuss the boycott altogether. 
"Academic work should not be blocked on political grounds," wrote Fraser in the name of the organization. Discrimination "on the grounds of nationality is pernicious," he said, calling academic discourse "crucial in keeping channels open to build opportunities for peace." 
In addition to the boycott motion, the annual conference will also discuss a motion condemning the "outrageous bias" of the British government in opposing Hamas' victory in the Palestinian elections and stating that NATFHE will "continue to help protect and support Palestinian colleges and universities in the face of the continual attack by Israel's government." 
In the past decade, the only country whose academia NATFHE has considered boycotting is Israel. 
Zvi Ziegler, a professor at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa who heads the Israeli Inter-Senate Committee of the Universities for the Protection of Academic Independence, said that if passed, the motion would provide justification for individuals to boycott Israeli academic institutions. 
"The decision may not be binding, but it will be the union's recommendation to all its members," said Ziegler. "It provides legitimacy for people who want to boycott Israel." 
Having learned their lesson last year, Israeli lecturers have already begun organizing meetings and conferences to speak out against academic boycotts. 
The Inter-Senate Committee, which was established in 2001 with the original purpose of preventing a change in the structure of Israeli universities, had all Israeli universities pass resolutions condemning academic boycotts and calling on academic organizations abroad - including in Britain - to pass similar resolutions. 
"We want to bring about a situation in which leading organizations say academic boycotts are improper," said Ziegler. "When they are faced with a leading academic body, organizations will hesitate to make a decision like this again."

<title>Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu to head UN mission to Beit Hanun</title>
<date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu has been named to head a United Nations fact-finding mission to the Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanun, where at least 18 civilians were killed earlier this month, UN officials said Wednesday.
The South African anti-Apartheid campaigner and former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town will travel to the Palestinian territory to "assess the situation of victims, address the needs of survivors and make recommendations on ways and means to protect Palestinian civilians against further Israeli assaults," according to the president of the UN Human Rights Council, Luis Alfonso De Alba.
Tutu chaired South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission after the end of white rule. 
Meanwhile, Anti-Defamation League National Director Abraham Foxman has condemned as an "overwhelming failure" efforts to reform and replace the UN Commission on Human Rights -  an organization widely criticized for concentrating its efforts on condemnations of Israel - calling its replacement a political tool of its Arab and Muslim majority.
The ADL said the new UN Human Rights Council has "ignored the world's worst human rights atrocities and instead has pursued Israel for political gain."
The 47-member council, which earlier this year replaced the discredited Human Rights Commission, has been severely criticized by some countries, including the United States, for moving four times to condemn Israel but not taking up human rights violations in Myanmar, North Korea or Sudan.
The Council has come under similar criticism from outgoing Secretary-General Kofi Annan. 
"From the day it opened for business, the UN Human Rights Council has never operated with any moral authority," Foxman said in a statement released on Tuesday. 
"The Council has failed in its most fundamental purpose: to monitor human rights abuses in all parts of the world. Instead, it has become a political tool wielded by its Arab and Muslim members who have the power of an automatic majority. The Council has ignored the world's worst human rights atrocities and instead has pursued Israel for political gain."
Earlier this month, the Council condemned an IDF artillery attack that killed 20 civilians in the northern Gaza Strip and ordered an on-site investigation by UN Human Rights Commissioner Louise Arbour.
The organization made no reference to Palestinian Qassam attacks. But when Arbour visited the area last week, she and her party were nearly hit by a Qassam that slammed into the Negev town of Sderot, in a salvo that killed a local factory worker.
"Closing in on six months since its first meeting, the Council has held one regular session and three special sessions and has yet to address a single state besides Israel," the ADL said in the statement. "The Council passed two resolutions yesterday condemning Israel while ignoring other more pressing problems around the world."
Annan chides Council 'preocupation with Israel'    Earlier this month, Annan declared that the Human Rights Council should broaden its focus beyond the Palestinian-Israeli issue to avoid accusations it is one-sided.
Speaking to reporters in Geneva for the last time before he is to step down as secretary-general at the end of the year, Annan said the council's preoccupation with Israel's actions in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories while ignoring the situation in Darfur had caused some to wonder whether it had "a sense of fair play."
"They [the council members] have tended to focus on the Palestinian issue, and of course if you focus on the Palestinian-Israeli issue without even discussing Darfur and other issues, some wonder 'what is this council doing?"' he said.
Annan's remarks coincided with the release of a council inquiry into Israel's actions during the monthlong conflict this summer, which accused Israel of "a significant pattern of excessive, indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force... against Lebanese civilians."
The inquiry, which was instigated by members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, was not mandated to look at the conduct of the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah during the fighting.

<title>Ontario union to boycott Israel</title>
<date>Thu Jun 01 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The largest labor union in the Canadian province of Ontario has voted unanimously to boycott Israel "until it recognizes the Palestinians' right of self-determination" and accepts all UN resolutions including the right of return. The Anti-Defamation League harshly condemned the decision, calling it "deplorable and offensive." 
The decision was made by the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), which has 450,000 members. 
The union's decision says that it is joining an international campaign to boycott Israel and to impose sanctions on it, until it fulfills all UN resolutions including the right of return of Palestinian refugees from 1948. The union also intends to support pro-Palestinian organizations in an educational campaign, which will depict Israel as an apartheid state. It called on the national union to join and pass a similar resolution. 
ADL director general Abraham Foxman said "the union's resolution makes no effort to reflect current realities on the ground in the region. There is no mention of Israel's unilateral redeployment from Gaza and proposed action in the West Bank, nor is there any recognition of the challenges posed by ... Hamas' reign over the PA and its refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist or to renounce terror."

<title>Palestinians banned from Israeli cars near Green Line </title>
<date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
The ban on allowing Palestinians to ride in Israeli cars in the West Bank will mainly be enforced near the border with Israel, and not throughout the West Bank, a senior Israel Defense Forces officer told Haaretz.  
The officer said that he himself gives rides to Palestinians, and that he personally would not bother enforcing the rule as long as it is clear that the ride was "ordinary" and that the destination was not inside Israel.  
The officer acknowledged that the ban, instituted by GOC Central Command Yair Naveh, does not "sound good," but insisted that it was meant primarily to prevent illegal Palestinian entrants from being smuggled into Israel in Israeli cars, whose occupants are usually checked less carefully.   
The order was issued, he said, to foil a trick that Israelis who smuggle Palestinians into Israel have discovered in order to evade the prohibition on doing so: Because many checkpoints are not built exactly on the Green Line (which separates Israel from the West Bank), these Israelis could take their Palestinian passengers through the checkpoints and then let them off a few hundred meters later - still in Palestinian territory, but with easy access to Israel - without breaking any laws.  
However, the Yesh Din organization has asked Defense Minister Amir Peretz to overturn the rule, arguing that it, like several other orders approved by Naveh, creates a legal mechanism of separation on the basis of national origin in the West Bank. As a result, they said, it is clearly illegal, and "constitutes an international crime, the crime of apartheid."  
A statement abut the new policy issued by the IDF Spokesman's Office last week said it was intended to fight terror rather than merely reduce the number of illegal entrants.   
The senior officer explained that the order was clearly aimed at this as well, but that the number of illegal entrants seeking work is much greater than the number of terrorists.

<title>Palestinian university president comes out against boycott of Israeli academics</title>
<date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Israeli academics threatened by boycotts have received support from an unlikely source: the Palestinian president of Al-Quds University.
"If we are to look at Israeli society, it is within the academic community that we've had the most progressive pro-peace views and views that have come out in favor of seeing us as equals," Sari Nusseibeh told The Associated Press. "If you want to punish any sector, this is the last one to approach." 
Nusseibeh acknowledged, however, that his is a minority viewpoint among his colleagues. 
Britain's main academic association recently called on its members to consider boycotting Israeli professors, and a top Canadian labor union voted in favor of divestment from Israel. 
The 69,000-member National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education in Britain, censuring Israel for "apartheid" policies. 
"It just reminds people that somehow Israel is always singled out, that we're the case study," David Newman, a professor of politics and government at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Be'er Sheva, said.
Israel has been targeted by numerous boycotts throughout its history, ranging from weapons embargoes to product blacklisting to the blocking of Israeli web sites. 
But the latest resolution by the British association, encouraging a boycott of Israeli academics, touched a raw nerve in the Jewish state. 
"I wonder why not China, why not Chile, why not Burma, where the human rights issue is far, far worse than here," Newman said.

<title>Petition against British academic boycott garners 16,000 signatures</title>
<date>Sun May 28 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Before a resolution to impose an academic boycott on Israel is accepted, Israeli and Jewish organizations have already started their battle. With the possibility that the largest university and college lecturers union in Britain, the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE), will adopt a boycott resolution, the union's London offices and British academics have been bombarded in the past two weeks calling them to vote against the motion or even keep it off the agenda at the annual national conference in Blackpool this weekend. 
"The idea is mass action," Haifa Technion professor and chairman of the Inter-Senate Committee of the Universities for the Protection of Academic Independence (ISC), Zvi Zigler, said. 
Although the anti-boycotters argue that it is a campaign for academic freedom, it seems it is a political struggle, driven mainly by Israeli and Jewish organizations. The Anti-Defamation League quickly went into action: "Once again, a group of British academics is targeting Israel," the ADL said in a press release. The ADL circulated a petition condemning the boycott as an assault on academic freedom. Ken Jacobson, associate national director of the ADL in the U.S., said in a telephone interview that 12,000 people had signed the petition, which was sent to the president of NATFHE, John Wilkin. 
Wilkin also received a petition with 4,725 signatures from Scholars for Peace in the Middle East, an American organization whose mission statement includes encouraging academics "to develop effective responses to the ideological distortions, including anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist slanders..." 
Also fighting the battle is the International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom (IAB), which was created last year at Bar-Ilan University to fight academic boycotts against Israel and has a network of 500 members around the world. "IAB is responsible for at least 2,500 letters that were sent to NATFHE," Ofir Frankel, a doctoral candidate at Bar-Ilan who plays a major role in the IAB campaign, said. 
"We have issued press releases, warnings about what is happening, we have made sure our members send out letters. [Richard] Seaford, [the British professor who refused to write an article for an Israeli academic journal because of the boycott - T.T.] received hundreds of letters from us," Frankel said. 
The Guardian newspaper yesterday published a letter signed by over 600 academics and initiated by several organizations including Engage, which was established in Britain last year after the Association of University Teachers (AUT) adopted a resolution supporting a boycott of Bar-Ilan and Haifa universities. (The resolution was rescinded about a month later under pressure from Jewish and Israeli groups.) 
Yesterday's letter claimed the boycott motion, which "invites members ... to consider the appropriateness of a boycott of those who do not publicly dissociate themselves from [Israeli apartheid] policies" forces a political test on Israeli academics, which they called McCarthyism. 
"We oppose forcing academics to sign a statement to demonstrate political cleanliness," the letter said. 
Only four days
However, in an article published on the Guardian Web site by Steven Rose, a professor at the Open University in Britain and one of the founders of the British Committee for the Universities of Palestine, he asked, "If [an Israeli] institution does indeed ensure equity and non-discrimination, what have they to fear?" 
According to Rose, "The onus is on [self-styled friends of peace with justice in the Middle East] to answer: If not boycott, what? Forty-nine years of hand-wringing and resolutions by the international community have simply prolonged Israeli immunity and the sufferings of the Palestinians." 
Even if the boycott motion is approved, according to NATFHE national press officer Trevor Phillips, "it will only last four days." Shortly after the union's national conference, NATFHE will merge with the AUT. Following the merger, Phillips says, the resolution will be only an advisory for the united organization, which will make its own policy decisions. 
One of the sponsors of the motion, Tom Hickey of the University of Brighton's School of Historical and Critical Studies, said in a telephone interview that his colleagues must ask themselves whether they want to continue their activities in organizations that collaborate in their name in what is happening in the occupied territories. He added that he hopes the issue will receive its due during the conference and not be buried immediately with the usual argument that all action against Israel is anti-Semitic.

<title>Sweden labels Golan wines: 'Made in occupied Syrian land'</title>
<date>Thu Jun 08 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Sweden has started to note that wines produced in the Golan Heights originate in "Israel, occupied Syrian land," the Golan Heights Winery has informed the Israeli Embassy in Sweden. Winery sources told Haaretz that the step is unprecedented and worrisome. 
The embassy is investigating claims that the warning is being issued for several wines on the Web site of the Swedish government's chain of shops that sell wine. The chain is the only Swedish body permitted to market alcoholic beverages. 
Swedish Jews have protested the step, claiming that the new way of listing the wines from the Golan Heights is a political move by a government body. The sources also said such an indication had never been made regarding any other country - not even South Africa during apartheid. 
The Golan Heights Winery approached the commercial attache at the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm this week, and requested Foreign Ministry intervention. "We produce wine, not politics," the winery said yesterday, adding, "happily, this subject does not bother most consumers in Europe."

<title>Tutu to head UN rights mission to Gaza Strip </title>
<date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
GENEVA - Nobel Laureate Desmond Tutu has been named to head a United Nations fact-finding mission to the Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanun, where 19 civilians were killed by an Israeli artillery barrage earlier this month, UN officials said yesterday.  
The South African anti-apartheid campaigner and former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town will travel to Gaza to "assess the situation of victims, address the needs of survivors, and make recommendations on ways and means to protect Palestinian civilians against further Israeli assaults," according to the president of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Luis Alfonso De Alba.  
The mission will report its findings to the Geneva-based body by mid-December, the statement said.  
The shelling, which Israel said was unintended, came after Israel Defense Forces troops wound up a weeklong incursion meant to curb Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel from the town, which the Israeli army said was a rocket-launching stronghold.  
Tutu chaired South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission after the end of white rule.

<title>U.K. academics to back sweeping boycott of Israeli universities </title>
<date>Tue May 09 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>

The largest university and college lecturers union in Britain is likely to decide shortly to recommend that its 67,000 members boycott Israeli lecturers and academic institutions that do not publicly declare their opposition to Israeli policy in the territories.

<title>UN blasts Israel for plight of Palestinians</title>
<date>Wed Sep 27 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
NEW YORK - The human rights situation for Palestinians has deteriorated to a new low, a United Nations rights expert said yesterday, blaming the West for contributing to the "tragic" situation in Gaza and the West Bank. 
John Dugard, a South African civil rights lawyer, said Israel is largely responsible for the "intolerable" situation of the Palestinians. 
"I hope that my portrayal of hardships experienced by such people will trouble the consciences of those accustomed to turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to the suffering of the Palestinian people," Dugard told the UN Human Rights Council. 
"Gaza is a prison and Israel seems to have thrown away the key," Dugard said. Itzhak Levanon, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, rejected Dugard's allegations as "one-sided" and not reflecting reality. 
"What Israel chooses to describe as collateral damage to the civilian population is in fact indiscriminate killing prohibited by international law," Dugard said." 
"This report is characterized by errors of omission as well as distortions of both fact and law," he said, adding that Dugard described the situation in the territory of the Palestinian Authority in an "oversimplified manner." 
Dugard, an anti-apartheid civil rights lawyer in the 1980s, was appointed by the now defunct UN Human Rights Commission in 2001 to investigate only rights violations by the Israeli side. 
Dugard also criticized Western nations for cutting off funding to the Palestinian Authority after Hamas' victory in legislative elections in January. 
"In effect, the Palestinian people have been subjected to economic sanctions - the first time an occupied people has been so treated," Dugard said. "Palestinian people are punished for having democratically elected a regime unacceptable to Israel, the U.S. and the EU."

A UN mission to investigate the deaths of 19 civilians in the Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanun, led by South Africa's Desmond Tutu, has been delayed because Israel has yet to authorize the trip, a spokeswoman said Saturday.
The Nobel Peace laureate had been due to leave for the Middle East at the weekend, but he would not now leave before Monday, mission spokeswoman Sonia Bakar said.
"We are still waiting for a sign from Israel. It (the departure) will not be before Monday," she said.
Tutu was to begin leading a six-member team this weekend in the town to investigate the killings of 19 civilians in an errant Israel Defense Forces shelling November 8.
But Israel has yet to grant the South African anti-apartheid campaigner and former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town the necessary travel clearance, said three different officials close to the talks between the global body and Israel.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions were continuing, said they had yet to receive any indication from Israel that the mission will take place at all.
Israeli officials in Geneva said they were unable to comment immediately.
Tutu's team was supposed to report its findings to the UN Human Rights Council by mid-December.
The 47-nation council authorized the mission last month, asking Tutu to assess the situation of victims, address the needs of survivors and make recommendations on ways to prevent further casualties.
The shelling, which Israel said was unintended, came after its troops wound up a weeklong incursion meant to curb Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip town.
The IDF said Beit Hanun was a rocket-launching stronghold.
Tutu chaired South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission after the end of white rule. Tutu, who was in Geneva, could not be reached for comment.
Earlier Friday the UN Human Rights Council passed a seventh resolution criticizing Israel on Friday, this time for its failure to act on earlier recommendations that it end military operations in the Palestinian territories and allow a fact-finding mission to the region.
The rights body, which has only condemned the Israeli government in its seven-month existence, noted with regret its July resolution urging the release of all arrested Palestinian ministers has yet to be carried out.
"Violations of the fundamental rights of the Palestinians continue unabated," said Pakistani diplomat Tehmina Janjua on behalf of the 57-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference, which proposed the resolution. "The Palestinian ministers, officials and civilians have not been set free."
Janjua demanded that UN human rights expert John Dugard be allowed to conduct an "urgent" fact-finding in the region, which the council ordered at an emergency session only one month after it was called into existence to replace the discredited Human Rights Commission.
Criticism by the council brings no penalties beyond international attention. Countries, however, lobby hard to avoid having their rights records scrutinized.
Dugard, a former anti-apartheid civil rights lawyer from South Africa, has frequently clashed with Israel, who note that he has been mandated only with investigating violations by the Israeli side. The United States - which along with Israel is only an observer at the 47-nation council - also has dismissed Dugard's reports as one-sided.
Only Canada voted against Friday's resolution. Cameroon and Japan joined the 10 European members of the council in abstaining. The rest of Africa and Asia, along with all of Latin America, voted in favor.
Israel's ambassador to the global body in Geneva criticized the council for ignoring a Nov. 26 cease-fire agreement that ended five months of fierce fighting in Gaza.
"Why does this resolution fail to make any mention of the cease-fire between Israelis and Palestinians, that persists despite the continuation of Qassam rockets fired on Israel?" Itzhak Levanon asked the council.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the watchdog last month to deal with the Mideast conflict in an impartial manner, and said it was time to focus attention on "graver" crises such as Darfur.
Despite his plea, the council has passed only a watered-down resolution on the western Sudanese region proposed by African countries, which urged all parties to the conflict to end human rights violations.

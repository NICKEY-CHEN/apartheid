<title>'The Settlers' gives Sundance a window into extremist West Bank movement</title>

JTA - What is a settler?
That’s the question that opens the new documentary film “The Settlers,” which premiered last week at the Sundance Film Festival.
Written and directed by Shimon Dotan, the film offers an answer almost immediately: a religious fundamentalist driven by messianic ideology who believes Jews have the exclusive right to the West Bank and may use all manner of subterfuge, violence and law breaking to fulfill the divine imperative of settling the Holy Land.
There is truth in this answer, but it is not the whole truth.
Most settlers, as Dotan himself acknowledged in an interview with JTA, do not fit this description. They are “economic settlers” – Israelis who live in the West Bank because it’s cheaper than living in Israel proper. They are overwhelmingly law abiding, reside mostly within commuting distance of major Israeli cities and include secular Jews among their ranks.
Dotan said that 320,000 of the West Bank’s 400,000 settlers fall into this category. Only the remaining 80,000 are “ideological settlers,” who live there for reasons of religious or political principle. Of those, a fraction are extremists.
That context is largely missing from his film, which focuses almost exclusively on the far-right religious extreme – the hilltop youth who illegally occupy remote outposts, the young Jews who perpetrate and celebrate violence against Palestinians, residents of the most fanatically anti-Arab communities in the West Bank.
Dotan told JTA he focused on the fringe because the extremists determine the course of the entire movement.
“If you want to understand a phenomenon, you have to go the fringes, to the leaders,” Dotan said.
By failing to provide much context about mainstream settlers, the film conveys the message that the Jews of the West Bank are exclusively racist, murderous zealots and the sole impediment to Israeli-Palestinian harmony. Or, as veteran Haaretz columnist Akiva Eldar describes them in the film, “a monster of half a million people standing in the way of peace.”
That’s not to say settler extremists aren’t an important subject for consideration. Though relatively small in number, they wield outsize influence on the settlement enterprise, on Israeli-Palestinian relations and on Israeli policy. Increasingly, they are a focus of worldwide attention. On January 18, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Daniel Shapiro, made headlines when he warned of unchecked “Israeli vigilantism in the West Bank.”
Dotan’s film forces us to reckon with the ugliness in the settler movement, even as he showcases the West Bank’s beauty with some stunning aerial photography. His subjects are the settler from Tekoa who proudly declares himself a racist, the father who talks jovially to his young sons about beating up Arabs when they grow up, the settlers who want their enterprise eventually to swallow the Kingdom of Jordan — and maybe even all the land from the Nile River in Egypt to the Euphrates in Iraq.
“Today, almost 50 years after the first settler made his home in the West Bank, the settlement drive is a clear-cut success,” the film’s narrator says. “The settlers see themselves as pioneers, the leaders of Israeli society. The question is: Where are they leading it — to divine redemption, as they claim, or to apartheid?”
Dotan, 66, who has lived in the United States for the past 20 years and teaches political cinema at New York University, approaches his subject chronologically. He starts with the leaders of Gush Emunim, the ideological movement that, influenced by the teachings of Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook, believed that the 1967 war heralded divine redemption and that settling the newly conquered territory would help usher in the messianic age.
The film intersperses interviews with the movement’s aging leaders with archival footage of those leaders as young men, leading demonstrations, establishing new West Bank outposts, celebrating with followers. Where there’s no footage, Dotan relies on illustrations and voice-overs to tell crucial parts of the story. The beautiful illustrations are the work of artist David Polonsky, who did the animation for “Waltz with Bashir,” the Oscar-nominated 2009 Israeli film about the Lebanon War.
The result is a fascinating look at how the settlements came into being, and the men and women on the movement’s fringe who continue to push its boundaries – both ideologically and physically. “The Settlers” also documents how the Israeli government — sometimes willingly, sometimes unwillingly and often unwittingly and without foresight – helped build and reinforce the settlement enterprise.
In one scene, Sarah Nachshon, who played a seminal role in establishing the Jewish settlement in Hebron, recalls how she forced the reopening of the old Jewish cemetery at a time when it wasn’t clear Israel would allow Jews to remain in the city. In was the mid-1970s, and her infant son had just died in his crib. She insisted on burying him in Hebron, though no Jew had been buried there since before Israel’s establishment.
When Israeli officials refused, Nachshon simply ignored their orders, marching past Israeli soldiers with her dead baby in her arms. Once the baby was interred, the cemetery became another site Israeli soldiers were compelled to patrol – another active Jewish outpost in the West Bank.
The film features interviews with unrepentant members of the Jewish Underground, who in the 1980s carried out bombing attacks against the Palestinian mayors of Nablus, Ramallah and El Bireh (two were maimed, one escaped unharmed), plotted to blow up the mosque at the Temple Mount and planted bombs on Arab buses. Israeli officials caught them and defused the bombs before they exploded.
We see undated scenes of Jews beating Arabs in their fields with crowbars, Jews beating Arabs in the streets of Hebron, a Jew explaining how in the Jewish tradition, “Revenge is an important thing.”
Palestinian violence against Israelis goes almost unmentioned, except for a few oblique references. In Dotan’s film, the only Palestinians we see are victims. Palestinian violence is “irrelevant” to this story, Dotan said.
Dotan says his primary target for this film is Israelis, among whom he hopes the movie will spark conversation. Dotan is still looking for an American distributor for the film.
“I think Israelis know very little about what’s happening in the West Bank and little about the ideological origins of the settlements,” Dotan said. “This film gives settlers’ voices a platform. I hope people will listen.”

<title>Oxford University Labour Club co-chair resigns over Israel Apartheid Week dispute</title>
<date>Tue Feb 16 11:59:43 IST 2016</date>
<content>
The co-chair of the Oxford University Labour Club has resigned after the club's decision to endorse Israel Apartheid Week.
Alex Chalmers, the co-chair of the student organization affiliated with the British Labour Party, stated that he did not feel comfortable with the direction the society was moving in, and could no longer defend its actions, according to Oxford's Cherwell student newspaper.
"Despite its avowed commitment to liberation, the attitudes of certain members of the club towards certain disadvantaged groups was becoming poisonous," Chalmers wrote.
"Whether it be members of the Executive throwing around the term 'Zio' (a term for Jews usually confined to websites run by the Ku Klux Klan) with casual abandon, senior members of the club expressing their 'solidarity' with Hamas and explicitly defending their tactics of indiscriminately murdering civilians, or a former Co-Chair claiming that 'most accusations of antisemitism are just the Zionists crying wolf,’ a large proportion of both OULC and the student left in Oxford more generally have some kind of problem with Jews," Chalmers continued. 
"The decision of the club to endorse a movement with a history of targeting and harassing Jewish students and inviting antisemitic speakers to campuses, despite the concerns of Jewish students, illustrates how uneven and insincere much of the active membership is when it comes to liberation."
"I had hoped during my tenure as Co-Chair to move the club away from some of its more intolerant tendencies; sadly, it only continued to move away from me," he wrote in a Facebook post. "A large proportion of both OULC and the student left in Oxford more generally have some kind of problem with Jews."
Chalmers told Cherwell that he no longer recognized the club he joined last year. "I hope my decision will go some way in raising awareness of the campus anti-Semitism that has gone unnoticed for far too long in Oxford," he was quoted as saying.
Noni Csogor, Chalmers' co-chair, said that while she respected his decision to quit, the endorsement did not represent a blanket position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
"I understand Alex’s position, but am looking forward both to running the events we’ve organised for the rest of the term, and to contributing to an ongoing discussion about the complex intersection of justice for Palestine and the safety of Jewish students," Csogor said.

<title>Variety refuses to publish a pro-BDS ad accusing Israel of apartheid in Oscars issue</title>
<date>Tue Feb 23 18:11:04 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Entertainment magazine Variety refused to publish an advertisement that says, “Don’t endorse Israeli apartheid," in its upcoming Oscars issue.
Jewish Voice for Peace, or JVP, a group that supports the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel, announced Monday that the magazine initially accepted payment for the group’s ad, but then said it could not publish it since “it would need to have a softer tone.”
The ad, whose top line reads “Free Trip to Israel at the Expense of Palestinians,” calls on Oscar nominees to refuse a free Israel trip worth $55,000 offered in their “swag bags.”
JVP said in a statement it had asked for suggestions of “specific edits,” but was told that:  “The topic is too sensitive at this time and we will not be in a position to add it to next week’s edition.”
JVP Executive Director Rebecca Vilkomerson called the refusal “a clear and disturbing example of the constraints on public debate about Palestine and Israel. Variety’s refusal to print our ad — especially in the context of the pro-occupation ads they have published in the past — illustrates a clear bias. Messages that support Israel are acceptable, while those that assert the humanity of Palestinians are censored.”
JVP, which co-sponsored the ad together with the US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, was apparently referencing a December 2011 ad Variety published from the Emergency Committee to Protect Israel. That advertisement does not explicitly support Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, but it asks: “Why does the Obama administration treat Israel like a punching bag?”
Variety did not respond to a request from the Forward for comment.
The Israeli government is sponsoring the $55,000 all-expense paid, 10-day luxury travel pack with first-class air to Tel Aviv that is included in swag bags for Oscar host Chris Rock and all nominees in the best actor/actress, best supporting actor/actress, and director categories.
So far two Oscar nominees, Mark Rylance and Asif Kapadia, have pledged not to visit Israel professionally, according to JVP.

<title>Oberlin professor's anti-Semitic posts are 'personal views,' says college</title>
<date>Sun Feb 28 01:01:14 IST 2016</date>
<content>
In response to an article revealing that an Oberlin College professor made numerous postings about Jews and Israel to Facebook, the liberal arts college’s president said the college “respects the right of its faculty, students, staff and alumni to express their personal views.”
Marvin Krislov’s statement came after The Tower on Thursday published an article about Joy Karega, an assistant professor of rhetoric and composition at the elite Ohio institution.
Karega, who took down her Facebook posts and Twitter account after the article’s publication, had made comments accusing Israel and “Rothschild-led bankers” of responsibility for downing a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine in 2014. She also posted a graphic of Jacob Rothschild, a member of the prominent Jewish banking family, with a caption reading: “We own your news. The media. Your oil. And your government.”
Screenshots of many of her posts were published originally on The Tower.
In a statement posted on Oberlin’s alumni Facebook page on Thursday, Krislov, who is Jewish, added, “The statements posted on social media by Dr. Joy Karega, assistant professor of rhetoric and composition, are hers alone and do not represent the views of Oberlin College.”
Alan Dershowitz, an emeritus professor of law at Harvard University, criticized Krislov’s response, telling The Tower: “If Karega had expressed comparably bigoted views about Blacks, Muslims or gays, the President of Oberlin would not have posted the boilerplate he posted. He would have condemned those views, even if he defended her right to express them.”
In one post, Karega accused “the same people behind the massacre in Gaza” of shooting down the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine. She continued: “With this false flag, the Rothschild-led banksters, exposed and hated and out of economic options to stave off the coming global deflationary depression, are implementing the World War III option.”
Karega’s social media posts drew attention after she was listed as co-sponsor of an event at Oberlin scheduled for March 2 in which Robin Kelley, a history professor at UCLA, is due to deliver a lecture entitled, “Fighting Apartheid Since 1948: Key Moments in Palestinian and Black Solidarity.”
Karega declined to respond to The Tower, but posted on Facebook Friday: “Robin Kelley IS still coming to Oberlin next week, despite efforts by some to prevent it. Trust, when I come up out of my Unbothered state of being, I’ll have a lot to say (analysis, no doubt) about the kinds of intimidation and silencing tactics that are rhetorically enacted in digital spaces, through email, through telephone communication, and propagandized editorial articles, masquerading as ‘journalism,’ and how common it is for Black women, who are early in their career on the tenure track as part of the professoriate, to be prime targets for these kinds of activities and practices.”
Oberlin has drawn attention in recent months for what some alumni claim is a culture of tolerance for anti-Semitism. More than 250 alumni have signed an open letter to Krislov voicing concern about this and mentioning several incidents at the school, including the expulsion of the Kosher Halal co-op from the Oberlin Student Cooperation Association and a protest against Israel on Rosh Hashanah that Jewish students had to pass through on their way to holiday services.
Some Jewish student leaders criticized that letter in an op-ed published in the Cleveland Jewish News this week, saying the letter “lack(ed) a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics on Oberlin’s campus” and expressing concern that “there was virtually no student involvement or input on the letter’s contents.”
The school also garnered headlines in December when African-American student activists issued a 14-page list of demands to Krislov, including that the school divest from companies doing business with Israel. The document also demanded that Krislov guarantee tenure “upon review” for Karega and seven other African-American tenure-track faculty members.

<title>Columbia University professors sign petition in support of BDS</title>
<date>Wed Mar 02 11:07:44 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Forty Columbia University faculty members have signed a petition urging the New York school to divest from companies that “supply, perpetuate, and profit from a system that has subjugated the Palestinian people.”
The petition was released Monday morning to mark the first day of Israel Apartheid Week, the Columbia Spectator reported.
According to the petition, the signatories “stand with Columbia University Apartheid Divest, Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine as well as with Jewish Voice for Peace in calling upon the University to take a moral stance against Israel’s violence in all its forms.”
They include Rashid Khalidi, a history and Middle Eastern studies professor who is a longtime critic of Israel and supporter of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement; Joseph Massad, a professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history who sees Zionism as a racist and colonialist movement, and Nadia Abu El-Haj, an anthropology professor who received tenure in 2007 following a heated battle over the merits of her work, particularly a book that accuses Israel of manipulating archaeological findings to legitimize its existence.
The most heavily represented departments among the signers are Middle Eastern South Asian and Africa studies, or MESAAS, English and comparative literature, and anthropology.
Partha Chatterjee, an anthropology and MESAAS professor at the Ivy League school who signed, told the Spectator in an email that he wanted to protest Israel’s security regime, which “virtually amounts to apartheid.”
“I fully support every effort to put pressure on the Israeli government to end its illegal occupation of Palestinian lands,” he said.
Dirk Salomons, a signatory who is a senior lecturer at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs, told the Spectator, “I’ve always had a feeling as a Jew that a Jewish state should rise slightly above the lack of morality of its neighbors. It pains me to see how a country which I love and which I have visited many times can be so blind to the needs of its neighbors.”

<title>New York City Council's Jewish caucus drafting bill to combat anti-Semitism at CUNY</title>
<date>Thu Mar 03 21:23:01 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Members of the New York City Council’s Jewish caucus are drafting legislation aimed at combating anti-Semitism at the City University of New York.
Councilman Mark Levine, who chairs the 14-member caucus, said he expects legislation to be submitted within a month, the New York Post reported Wednesday. The law would require CUNY officials to report all incidents of bias at its campuses to the council.
“We’re not convinced that the university is adequately tracking what is clearly a pattern of bigotry,” Levine told the Post.
On Monday, the Post reported that James Milliken, the chancellor of CUNY, a 24-campus public university in New York City, had appointed two attorneys to investigate claims of anti-Semitism. According to the Post, the school will also establish a task force to address campus bigotry.
The news comes barely a week after the Zionist Organization of America sent Milliken a 14-page letter detailing several incidents of concern at four CUNY colleges. The letter, which was copied to New York Mayor Bill de Blasio as well as several members of New York’s congressional delegation, detailed numerous instances of alleged anti-Semitism reported to the ZOA by CUNY students. Among the incidents were reports of members of Students for Justice in Palestine yelling epithets at Jewish students, including “Jews out of CUNY” and “Jews are racist sons of bitches.”
ZOA National President Morton Klein told JTA that his organization was informed that it would be meeting in the near future with the two attorneys leading the probe. Klein alleged that campus activism by pro-Palestinian students infringed on university rules that prohibit obstructing free speech rights, verbal and physical abuse, and the endangerment of anyone’s physical or mental health.
“If they were simply having rallies that Israel was an occupying force or an apartheid state, this might be within the rules,” Klein said. “But they go far beyond that.”
Klein said he was seeking to have Students for Justice in Palestine stripped of its status as a student group at CUNY.

<title>CUNY to probe anti-Semitism after 'Zionist pig' incident at Brooklyn College</title>
<date>Fri Mar 04 20:09:49 IST 2016</date>
<content>
After last month’s anti-Zionist incident at Brooklyn College, the City University of New York launched an investigation into allegations of anti-Semitism at several of its campuses.
In addition to the probe directed by CUNY Chancellor James Milliken, the university is establishing a task force to foster a more understanding and respectful environment.
The probe follows a string of recent incidents across CUNY campuses that the Anti-Defamation League characterized as featuring “anti-Israel bias” in a statement Friday, in which it also praised the university for its actions.
The Zionist Organization of America sent Milliken a letter about the incidents on February 22. ZOA National President Mort Klein told JTA that his organization was informed that it would be meeting in the near future with the two attorneys leading the probe.
On February 16, students at Brooklyn College allegedly demanded that “Zionists” leave campus and referred to a professor at a meeting as a “Zionist pig,” prompting strong condemnations of the incident by the college administration.
That Thursday, state assemblyman from Brooklyn, Dov Hikind, called on Brooklyn College to discipline the involved students.
“The university needs to act on this and enforce disciplinary action on the students that participated,” the Democrat said in a statement. “It’s nice to issue a statement apologizing for what occurred, but actions speak much louder than words.”
In November, the New York City chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine invoked what ADL called an anti-Semitic stereotype in the lead-up to the “Million Student March” rally at Hunter College when it referred to those who run CUNY as a “Zionist administration.”
The pro-Palestinian organization said its members “categorically refute all claims of racism being thrown at the Million Student March and various chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine.”
Additionally, several hate messages, including anti-Semitic, anti-gay and racist graffiti were discovered in restrooms and a classroom on the campus of John Jay College last year.
Klein alleged that campus activism by pro-Palestinian students infringed on university rules that prohibit obstructing free speech rights, verbal and physical abuse, and the endangerment of anyone’s physical or mental health.
“If they were simply having rallies that Israel was an occupying force or an apartheid state, this might be within the rules,” Klein said. “But they go far beyond that.
Evan R. Bernstein, ADL New York regional director, said, “Over the past few years, students have expressed to us firsthand a growing concern over a climate of anti-Jewish animus on some” CUNY campuses. “We are also troubled by the manifestation of anti-Israel bias that has left some Jewish students feeling singled out.”
The formation of a task force composed of members of the administration, faculty and students is “an additional step that indicates that CUNY is taking these allegations seriously,” Bernstein said.

<title>BDS activists label Israeli products in Canadian stores</title>
<date>Tue Mar 15 14:31:53 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Two Canadian corporations have promised vigilance after pro-Palestinian activists plastered their products with anti-Israel stickers.
In recent weeks, Facebook posts by those advocating the boycott, divestment and sanctions or BDS campaign against Israel have shown warning labels affixed to bottles of Israeli wine for sale in Vancouver and grocery products at a store in Calgary.
“Shopping was fun!” announced Calgary BDS activist Billie Jones on her Facebook page earlier this month. A photo there shows anti-Israel labels stuck on several grocery products.
The photo reveals the act took place at an outlet of No Frills, a chain owned by Canadian grocery giant Loblaw Corp. Ltd.
“I can confirm that an individual placed stickers on some products in a Calgary No Frills last week,” Catherine Thomas, Loblaw’s director of external communications, said in response to a JTA query.
“The stickers were removed immediately by store staff,” Thomas added. “However, no one saw the person who applied them. In instances like this, our general practice would be to ban the individual from the store moving forward.”
The stickers read: “Warning! Made in Israel: A country violating international law, the 4th Geneva Convention, and fundamental human rights…
BDS.”
They were stuck on Pampers diapers, made by Proctor & Gamble, one of the largest clients of an Israeli company that supplies diaper products; on Coffee-mate, made by Nestlé, which has a large business footprint in Israel; and McCafé coffee by McDonald’s, which BDS activists say has partnered with U.S. Jewish groups to promote trips to Israel.
Meanwhile, stickers proclaiming “Israeli apartheid, don’t buy into it” were affixed to five bottles of Efrat white wine, made in the Judean Hills, at a Vancouver liquor store.
Photos of the stickers on the wine bottles also were posted on Facebook.
Employees “immediately” removed the stickers, said Viola Kaminski, a spokesperson for the British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch.
“While this appears to be an isolated incident at this point, we are advising store managers to be extra vigilant in monitoring these wines,” Kaminski said, adding: “our corporate loss prevention team is also aware of this issue and is advising store security teams to continue monitoring these wines carefully as well.”

<title>U.K. Jewish weekly highlights concern about anti-Semitism in British Labour Party</title>
<date>Fri Mar 18 02:22:00 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Virtually the entire front page of the current issue of the Jewish Chronicle of London is devoted to a scathing editorial that takes the British Labour Party to task, saying that it "now seems to be a party that attracts anti-Semites like flies to a cesspit."
The party, which last governed Britain under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown between 1997 and 2010, is now led by Jeremy Corbyn, who since his election as party head last summer has engendered concern in the British Jewish community and elsewhere for views that are seen by some as extreme and likley to doom the party to remaining in opposition. 
Criticism of Corbyn features prominently in the editorial in the Jewish Chronicle, a Jewish weekly that is not only influential in Britain but is also thought to be the oldest Jewish weekly in the world, having been founded in 1841.
"Last summer, as Jeremy Corbyn was gliding serenely towards victory in the Labour leadership election, this newspaper asked him a series of questions about his associations with various anti-Semites," the editorial states. 
"We said that we believed we spoke for the vast majority of British Jews in expressing deep foreboding at the prospect of his election as leader, a view that was confirmed the following week by a poll of the community which showed that over 80 percent were concerned by his contacts, and by such comments as his reference to terrorist groups Hamas and Hizbollah as 'our friends.'"
The article continues: "Mr. Corbyn has now been leader for six months, and the only conclusion that can be drawn is that our fears were justified. Labour now seems to be a party that attracts anti-Semites like flies to a cesspit. Barely a week goes by without the identification of a racist party member or allegations of racist behavior by those involved in the party. And the target of that racism seems always to be Jews."
The article then goes on to cite the case of Gerry Downing, who is said to have opposed condemnation of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, and who this month was expelled from the party. It also notes the case of Vicki Kirby, a former Labour Party parliamentary candidate who took heat in 2014 over Tweets in which she reportedly stated that Adolf Hitler might be the "Zionist God” and that Jews had “big noses.” She was suspended from the party twice.
The editorial also noted the case of the Oxford University Labour Party Club. In mid-February, Alex Chalmers, co-chair of the club resigned after the body decided to support Israel Apartheid Week. He claimed many club members “have some kind of problem with Jews." The scandal deepened after the Oxford Jewish Society released further allegations of harassment against Jewish students. The Chronicle noted that Dowing and Kirby were suspended from the party, and that an inquiry into the Oxford University party branch was launched.
"But when these were first identified, party officers appeared to have almost no interest — as if the very mention of anti-Semitism was worthy of little more than a yawn," the editorial asserted. And it added: "Mr. Cobyn appears to be genuine in his rejection of anti-Semitism. And yet for all the fine words that he speaks, the plain fact is that he leads a party that anti-Semites clearly feel is their natural home. If that does not worry him then — to put it mildly — questions need to be asked."
Britain's New Statesman magazine ran a statement by the Labour Party that stated: "The Labour Party takes all allegations of anti-Semitism, racism, bullying, intimidation and candidate misconduct very seriously.  Baroness Jan Royall [a former leader of the British House of Lords] is currently leading an investigation into the conduct of individual Young Labour Party members. Baroness Royall will consider all allegations and all relevant evidence.”
For its part, however, the Jewish Chronicle editorial concludes: "If Labour is not to lose the last residue of trust from our community, it must recognize and deal with that cancer."

<title>Prominent trans activist cancels Brown Hillel speech amid 'pinkwashing' protest</title>
<date>Sun Mar 20 13:33:43 IST 2016</date>
<content>
A prominent African-American transgender activist canceled her scheduled appearance at the Brown University Hillel after facing criticism for allegedly supporting the Jewish group’s “pinkwashing” of Israeli treatment of the Palestinians.
Janet Mock announced Wednesday that she had cancelled her talk scheduled for March 21 at the Providence, Rhode Island Ivy League school, The Brown Daily Herald reported.
Moral Voices, a Jewish student group, had invited her in partnership with the Brown Center for Students of Color, Sarah Doyle Women’s Center, LGBTQ Center, Sexual Assault Peer Educators and other campus groups, along with the Brown/RISD (Rhode Island School of Design) Hillel.
In a petition on Change.org, 159 Brown students urged Mock to disassociate her lecture from Hillel because “Hillel as a corporation has consistently defended and even advocated for the Israeli state’s policies of occupation and racial apartheid. Israel’s violent policies center on colonialism, ethnic cleansing, and genocide of native Palestinians.”
The petition also claimed that Moral Voices’ focus on LGBT rights “hides the fact that for decades, the state of Israel and Israeli advocacy organizations (like Hillel) have been engaging in pinkwashing,” or allegedly highlighting Israel’s queer friendliness “to deflect attention from Israel’s colonization and occupation of Palestinians.”
The Moral Voices group, which is funded by a grant from Hillel, has said it takes no position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In a statement on its Facebook page, Moral Voices wrote, “This cancellation is the result of gross mischaracterizations of Brown RISD Hillel and the intentions of the student activists on the Moral Voices Committee who worked since last spring to bring Ms. Mock to Brown …”
In a response to the Change.org petition published March 10, before Mock cancelled, Moral Voices’s leaders wrote:
We, the MV leadership, are neither equipped for nor invested in arguing the merits of Brown RISD Hillel’s Israel/Palestine-related programming. This petition does, however, make us ask: given that Hillel is the center for Jewish life on this campus — with a mandate to support the interests and meet the needs of a very diverse constituency of Jewish students on College Hill (ranging widely in their political, religious, and cultural inclinations) — does simply engaging in a Jewish space render one unfit to do justice work?
The discussion of lateral violence within the LGBTQ+ community itself is central to this year’s topic. In challenging the legitimacy of our social justice work based on the group’s Jewish affiliation, the petition seeks to undermine our right to intersectional engagement and implies a need for us to cede spaces and relinquish causes that are very much ours.

<title>Oxford Labor Club officer steps down, citing anti-Israel motion</title>
<date>Mon Mar 21 09:24:22 IST 2016</date>
<content>
A second officer of Oxford University’s Labor Club has resigned after leveling discrimination charges.
The club’s disabilities officer, Brahma Mohanty, stepped down after claiming the club forced members to “subscribe to a radical ideology of division and isolation,” the London-based Telegraph newspaper reported Friday.
Last month, Alex Chalmers resigned as co-chair following claims that his colleagues “have some kind of problem with Jews.” Chalmers, who is not Jewish, said at the time he was leaving the “poisonous” club after it endorsed Israel Apartheid Week —  a string of activities against Israel that takes place annually in several dozen cities and especially on campuses.
Mohanty said in his resignation letter, according to the Telegraph, “I have personally experienced in recent weeks and meetings that this does not appear to be an ethos shared amongst the OULC body in light of the passing of the Israeli Apartheid Week motion and the more recent motion which essentially ‘purges’ the OULC membership and forces members to subscribe to a radical ideology of division and isolation.”
He added, “Simply put, I cannot in good faith carry out my duties in promoting access and engagement with a club that I feel is projecting itself in the complete opposite manner.”
Earlier this month, the club passed a motion to limit voting privileges to just those members who support only the Labor Party or its aims, according to The Telegraph.

<title>Leading Jewish figure in U.K. Labour Party threatens to quit over anti-Semitism</title>
<date>Tue Mar 22 11:51:19 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Lord Michael Levy, the chief fundraiser for Britain's Labour Party when Tony Blair was at its helm, issued a warning on Sunday on Britain's Sky News station that he might quit the party if it doesn't do more to confront anti-Semitism.
"Anti-Semitism in any political party cannot be tolerated, and it is for the leadership to make that absolutely clear," said Levy, who has also served in leading positions in the London Jewish community, according to the Jewish Chronicle of London. "If they don't make that clear, I will start to question that myself and actually question my being a Labour peer and a proud member of the Labour Party."
The issue of anti-Semitism in the party that most recently ruled Britain between 1997 to 2010 was highlighted last week in a front-page editorial in the Jewish Chronicle. The editorial described concerns in the British Jewish community when Jeremy Corbyn took over as Labour Party leader last year. The paper cited references that Corbyn reportedly made to the Islamic militant groups Hezbollah and Hamas as "our friends." Arguing that those earlier concerns were now found to be justified, the Chronicle said that "Labour now seems to be a party that attracts anti-Semites like flies to a cesspit."
For his part, however, Corbyn appeared on Sky News on Monday to say that Levy is well aware that he has in fact decried anti-Semitism and any other forms of prejudice on numerous occasions. He invited members of the Jewish community in Britain to come forward with any concerns that they may have.
Recently in the news over her reported reinstatement to the Labour Party was Vicki Kirby, a former party parliamentary candidate who took heat in 2014 over Tweets in which she reportedly stated that Adolf Hitler might be the "Zionist God” and that Jews had “big noses.” She was suspended at the time. She was reportedly suspended again after it was learned this month that she has since been appointed to a local Labour Party post. 
In another incident of alleged anti-Semitism in the party, Alex Chalmers, co-chair of the Oxford University Labour Party Club resigned after the group decided to support Israel Apartheid Week mid-February. He claimed many club members “have some kind of problem with Jews." The scandal deepened after the Oxford Jewish Society released further allegations of harassment against Jewish students. An inquiry into the Oxford University party branch was launched.
In response to Levy's comments on Sky television, Corbyn, told the station: "Lord Levy clearly hasn’t been listening to the seven times since I became leader I’ve absolutely condemned anti-Semitism. I've condemned Islamophobia. I've condemned any form of racism anywhere within our society. It is absolutely something I totally passionately believe in, and I’m disappointed that Lord Levy has made these remarks. He knows full well what my views are.”

<title>U.K. Labour Party member in hot water after saying Israel's Mossad is behind ISIS</title>
<date>Tue Mar 29 18:05:57 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
In another of a seemingly unending string of controversies over anti-Jewish or anti-Israeli comments by members of Britain's Labour Party, Bob Campbell, a party activist who has reportedly claimed that ISIS is controlled by Israel, denies that he has been the suspended by the party.
The London-based Jewish Chronicle and Sunday Times have reported over the past several days that Campbell was suspended pending a party investigation after allegedly posting a claim on Facebook that the Israel's Mossad intelligence agency runs ISIS. He is also said to have claimed Israel was behind this month's terrorist bombing in Brussels.
But Britain's Independent news website, which added that Campbell alleged on Facebook that ISIS has refrained from attacking Israel "because the dog doesn't bite his own tail," said the Labour Party member denied having been suspended. Media reports have said that such a suspension came at the request of his local member of parliament, Tom Blenkinsop of the Labour Party. Blenkinsop represents the Middlesborough region of northeast England, where Campbell lives.
Recent scandals involving extremism of Labour Party activists include Gerry Downing, who is said to have objected to condemnation of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. He was expelled from the party this month. Vicki Kirby, a former Labour Party parliamentary candidate, took heat in 2014 over tweets in which she reportedly stated that Adolf Hitler might be the "Zionist God” and that Jews had “big noses.” She was suspended from the party twice. In mid-February, Alex Chalmers, the co-chair of the Oxford University Labour Party Club, resigned after the group decided to support Israel Apartheid Week. He claimed many club members “have some kind of problem with Jews."
The party, which last governed Britain under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown between 1997 and 2010, is now led by Jeremy Corbyn, who since his election as party head last summer has engendered concern in the British Jewish community and elsewhere for views that are seen by some as extreme. For his part, however, Corbyn recently told Britain's Sky News: "Since I became leader I’ve absolutely condemned anti-Semitism. I've condemned Islamophobia. I've condemned any form of racism anywhere within our society. It is absolutely something I totally passionately believe in."

<title>U.K. Labour Party former mayor under fire over Facebook post saying Hitler killed 'six million Zionists' - Jewish World</title>
<date>Sat Apr 02 20:45:46 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
A former U.K. mayor has resigned the Labour Party after it has launched an investigation into anti-Semitic posts on his Facebook page, the Jewish Chronicle reported on Friday, in another in a seemingly unending string of controversies over anti-Jewish or anti-Israeli comments by members of the Labour Party.

In one Facebook post, Khadim Hussain, former Lord Mayor of Bradford, alleged the Israel was secretly arming ISIS. Hussain also allegedly shared a post which attacked Holocaust education in schools and said that Hitler killed "six million Zionists."
                
“Your school education system only tells you about Anne Frank and the six million Zionists that were killed by Hitler,” the post read. 
                
Hussain, who was suspended by the party after complaints were lodged over his Facebook use, said he decided to quit the party due to its handling of the matter, and claimed that he received no answer to his letter rejecting the allegations of anti-Semitism. 
                
“[The] party didn't give me a fair hearing to listen to my side before the suspension. That left me with no choice to sever my links with the party," he told the Chronicle. "I worked hard for interfaith dialogue and community cohesion. I will continue to play my role in that regard,” he added.
                
Earlier this week, Bob Campbell, a Labour Party activist, was reportedly suspended pending a party investigation after allegedly posting a claim on Facebook that the Israel's Mossad intelligence agency runs ISIS. He is also said to have claimed Israel was behind this month's terrorist bombing in Brussels.
                
But Britain's Independent news website, which added that Campbell alleged on Facebook that ISIS has refrained from attacking Israel "because the dog doesn't bite his own tail," said the Labour Party member denied having been suspended.

<title>University of Chile’s Law Faculty Student Union approves Israel boycott resolution</title>
<date>Mon May 02 19:05:49 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
The University of Chile’s Law Faculty Student Union voted to approve a boycott, divestment and sanctions resolution against Israel.
The resolution approved a week ago prohibits any academic interaction with the State of Israel or its citizens.
The Simon Wiesenthal Center on Friday urged the University’s rector, Ennio Vivaldi Vejar, to nullify the resolution called “closer to the Inquisition than an institution that claims to oppose discrimination and encourage international dialogue.”
“A boycott falsely accusing the State of Israel of Apartheid, in fact, is practicing Apartheid against Israel and its Jewish and non-Jewish supporters,” said Dr. Ariel Gelblung, the Center’s Latin American representative. “Maintaining this resolution would presage a multiplier closing university ties at the whim of individual or group prejudices based upon nationality, race, religion or gender – an unthinkable fate for any campus, but especially for a law faculty.”
The students voted on two questions. When asked if the students agreed to ban “activities that involve the participation of functionaries of the State of Israel or with funding from the Israeli embassy in the law school,” 515 or 56.3 percent voted yes, and 399, or 43.6 percent, voted no.
When asked:  “Do you agree that the University of Chile should not maintain institutional links with Israeli universities that directly contribute to the violation of human rights of the Palestinian people,” some 582 or 64 percent, voted yes, and 327  or 36 percent voted no.
The Palestinian Federation of Chile celebrated the results of the election, calling it a demonstration of the law students against “Israeli Apartheid.”
The Palestinian community in Chile is believed to be the largest outside of the Middle East. At least 300,000 Chileans are of Palestinian descent, according to reports. Some 15,000 Jews live in Chile.
The University of Chile is the largest and one of the most prestigious in the country, according to the 2015 rankings from America Economia magazine and El Mercurio newspaper, and is also is one of the best Chilean universities in global rankings.
“This vote strengthens the academic boycott to keep pushing for our home of studies to be free of Israeli apartheid so that we can breathe clear and democratic air, without segregation, without oppression, without colonization,” said BDS UChile, a broad student coalition for BDS at the University of Chile.
According to the BDS movement, the academic boycott of Israel has been growing in Latin America. Earlier this year, more than 200 Brazilian professors and researchers declared their commitment to BDS. In Argentina, more than 100 professors, hundreds of students and 11 academic institutions have also signed an academic boycott pledge against Israel.

<title>Bruce Springsteen guitarist to BDS supporters: You're obnoxious idiots </title>
<date>Tue May 03 12:05:19 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
JTA – Amid rumors that Bruce Springsteen will perform in Tel Aviv this summer, he and his E Street band have come under fire from supporters of boycotting Israel.
On Monday, band guitarist Steven Van Zandt – who is also known for playing a mobster on HBO’s “The Sopranos” – responded in typically direct style. In a series of tweets, he called Israel boycotters “politically ignorant obnoxious idiots” and suggested to one: “go f*** yourself.”
Van Zandt has taken tweet heat before for the unconfirmed show. And he’s not alone among his bandmates.
Bassist Garry Tallent has been heckled by the Twittersphere. And self-described anti-Zionist Stanley Cohen, who has more than 20,000 Twitter followers, went after the Boss himself back in February.
The latest BDS brouhaha emerged unexpectedly from a seemingly unrelated Twitter conversation. On Sunday, a fan bemoaned to Van Zandt Springsteen’s cancellation of a show in North Carolina last month in opposition to the state’s recently enacted “bathroom law” – which targets transgender people by requiring bathroom use according to the gender on a person’s birth certificate.
Another Twitter user then accused Van Zandt of touring other countries “which do much worse.”
Van Zandt responded that he held the U.S. to a higher standard.
In response to a skeptic who said “not buying that one,” the rocker got testy.
When someone suggested he “quit justifying 
hypocrisy,” Van Zandt got downright mad.
After some debate about what makes America so great, and whether it’s OK to call it America, the argument came around to the boycott issue. A user asked why, if Van Zandt gave other countries a pass, had he gotten involved in the movement against South African apartheid with the 1985 protest song “Sun City.” Van Zadnt said that was about the U.S. too.
Then, a certain Patrick – whose Twitter bio reads: “I have one issue human rights for Palestine people” – brought Israel into it.
This earned a double-tweet smackdown from Van Zandt.
Told “Israel totally meets apartheid definition under under itl law,” Van Zandt averred it was complicated.
Then he said it twice more.
Replying to Van Zandt’s assertion that boycotting Israel “would accomplish nothing,” someone tweeted, “But a boycott in north Carolina will ?” Van Zandt had a simple answer for that one.

<title>How the on-campus brawl is turning young Jews off Israel</title>
<date>Mon May 09 12:00:39 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
It was curiosity, rather than strong political tendencies either way, that drew Stanford freshman Madeleine Chang to her first student government debate on sanctions against Israel. That experience served as her introduction to the nasty world of identity politics on campus – and left her pretty devastated.
“Literally, all my Jewish friends were sitting on one side of the room and all my other friends – most of whom look more like me – were on the other,” she recalls, describing the scene she encountered last year upon entering the rowdy auditorium hall. “On each side people were waving and begging me to join them, and I felt totally paralyzed.”
Rather than pick a side, Chang, whose mother is Jewish and father Korean, decided to sit in the back and simply observe. At issue was whether the California university should divest from companies active in Israel (the motion was ultimately passed by the student government, but soon thereafter vetoed by the administration). “What ensued was an awful shouting match,” she says, “and I was pretty shaken up by the lack of discourse.”
The vast majority of Jewish students on campus are not nearly as adventurous as Chang. Rather than set themselves up for what are inevitably unpleasant confrontations over Israeli policy and actions, many are simply checking out.
As University of California, Berkeley junior Dylan Noceda observes, the rhetoric has become so vile and the stakes so high that for students like him, the best course of action has been to take no action at all. “You could risk losing friends from the other side,” explains the easy-going English major. “So when I’m asked, I just say that I love all people.”
Noceda considers himself part of a growing “silent majority” of Jewish students with no strong sentiments one way or the other about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – and they prefer to keep it that way. An Orange County native, he grew up, like many Jewish college students on the West Coast, in a rather unaffiliated home. Although both his parents are Jewish, Noceda’s Cuban-born father was raised Catholic. 
But that is hardly an excuse for UC Davis junior Zoe Robinow: Her mother is Israeli and her boyfriend is a well-known Zionist activist on campus. Yet Robinow, who grew up in Hawaii and belongs to a Jewish sorority on campus, has also resisted pressure to enlist with the Israeli cheerleading forces on her campus.
“Whenever BDS comes up, it’s like, Why is this even an issue for discussion when most people have no idea what it’s about?” asks the neurobiology major, who describes herself as a “mixed feelings kind of person.”
Even here in California, the epicenter of the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, many Jewish students say they have yet to form an opinion on whether they endorse a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that involves one state, two states or no state at all.
Some simply don’t care enough to risk antagonizing friends or jeopardizing their studies. Others would rather attend fraternity parties and football games than participate in shouting matches over land disputes taking place halfway around the globe. Still others say they fear being targeted for being Jewish.
While most students differentiate between criticism of Israel and outright anti-Semitism, many say they feel uncomfortable as Jews when anti-Israel events are held on their campuses.
On a two-week tour of California college campuses spanning from late February through early March, Haaretz sought to look beyond the hysteria surrounding BDS and – through dozens of interviews with Jewish students, staff, faculty and community members, along with on-the-ground observations – determine how Jewish students are really faring on campus.
Although the stated goals of the BDS movement are to force political concessions on Israel through economic and cultural sanctions, many Jewish leaders and professionals in California tell Haaretz they believe the ultimate objective, at least on campuses, is to make Israel a toxic issue.  
“Divestment is not meant to inflict pain on Israel,” says Rabbi Doug Kahn, the executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater San Francisco. “Rather, its goal is to shape the narrative and influence future leaders as they think about the conflict today.”
Judging by that measure, says Stanford University political science professor Larry Diamond, the BDS movement has already scored significant points. “We can’t ignore it because it’s making Jewish students feel marginalized and silenced,” says Diamond, who also sits on the board of the campus Hillel. “They feel torn and besieged, and that’s neither fair nor civil.”
Disengaging from Israel
Based on estimates provided by Jewish professionals and faculty in California, anywhere between 75 to 95 percent of Jewish students on college campuses in the state belong to the “soft middle” – that is to say, they are not engaged in Jewish campus life and want no part in the debate over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And as that debate gets louder and nastier, their ranks are growing.
“Most of the students here are either ignorant or unsure and prefer to steer clear of the issue because it’s so contentious,” says David Biale, a distinguished professor of Jewish history at UC Davis. “I think most of them are being pushed away. A small minority have staked out positions. But for the vast majority, what’s happening in the Middle East is a problem without a solution, and they ask themselves why they should get involved if there are other issues they can devote themselves to.”
Gil Bar-Or, copresident of the J Street U chapter at UCLA, has witnessed this trend firsthand among his own friends and classmates. “The average Jewish kids don’t want to be associated with the debate because it’s so vicious,” says Bar-Or, the child of Israelis who volunteers that his own grandparents, still living in Israel, are very critical of their government. “There is a huge group of Jewish students here who are not involved and don’t want to be involved.”
Or as Jennifer Fineman, a second-year, pre-law student at UC Santa Cruz, puts it: “My top priority here is keeping up my GPA and doing well on my LSATs. I don’t necessarily believe I have to talk the talk and fight the fight. We don’t live in Israel, so what good does it do for us to argue about all this here?”
While California may not be representative of the entire United States, Jay Sanderson – president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles – urges American Jewish leaders to take note of developments in his home state. 
“I think the West Coast is unique in that the bigger challenges are bigger here,” he says. “Intermarriages are higher west of the Mississippi than east of the Mississippi, and so the issue of lack of affiliation and lack of connection to Israel is probably a little higher here than it is over there.”
But, as Sanderson notes, California could serve as a barometer of where things are heading. “It used to be that trends started in the East and then went west,” he says, “but today they start in the West and then go east.”
A key finding of Haaretz’s visit was that only a small fraction of Jewish and non-Jewish students – including on those campuses known for being more politically active – are actively engaged in the Israel debate. On campuses where Students for Justice in Palestine (the driving force behind the BDS movement) has a presence, there are often no more than a dozen students active in the chapter, with Jews disproportionately represented among them.
The same is true of Jewish Voice for Peace, an organization highly critical of Israel, which likes to boast that it is the fastest growing Jewish student group on college campuses. Even its most active California chapters have less than a handful of members. (At Berkeley, the JVP chapter was defunct for several years before being revived last fall.)
Ditto for the other side: Although almost all campuses have their own pro-Israel group named after the university mascot (a la “Bruins for Israel” at UCLA and “Bears for Israel” at Berkeley) and host chapters of national Jewish organizations, the number of core activists is never more than one or two dozen. And while most universities have a Hillel chapter on site, the number of students actively involved in the Jewish campus life organization is relatively small.
At campuses like UCLA and Berkeley, where the Jewish student population is estimated to be several thousand, a Hillel event is considered successful if it draws 100 students.
What’s changed?
There is no denying, however, that something palpable has changed on many California campuses in recent years. Its most visible signs are the numerous student government divestment votes against Israel in recent years and the regular disruption of Israel-themed events on campus – most recently April’s pro-Palestinian shout down of Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat at San Francisco State University.
Todd Presner, director of the UCLA Center for Jewish Studies, believes a key catalyst has been Israel’s recent wars in Gaza.
“When things happen over there, they come to roost locally,” says Presner, who has been teaching at UCLA for 14 years.
For students who lack perspective beyond the four years they typically spend on a given college campus, it’s often difficult to pinpoint what exactly has changed and why. Jonathan York, who started as an undergrad at Stanford and is now attending law school on the same campus, has a longer-range view than most.
“It seems to me that what’s changed is that it’s more OK these days to cover your ears and just yell,” he says. “It also seems that people are more comfortable surrounding themselves with people who agree with them on all things. I think that’s a shame.”
It’s not that the yelling has gotten louder, some would argue, but that those doing the yelling have changed. If Jewish groups were once able to form natural coalitions with other minority organizations, that’s no longer the case, they point out. And today, these former allies, together with their new Palestinian partners, are ganging up on the Israel-supporting Jews.
Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller, who served as director of UCLA Hillel for 40 years, dismisses this claim, noting that the old coalitions dissolved years ago unrelated to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “In the process of becoming Americanized, Jews have become whites, and they’ve lost their sense of seeing themselves as a minority,” he says.
What’s changed, in his view, are the tactics employed by the pro-Palestinian side.
“We’re seeing something we never saw before, and that something is anti-normalization – not talking to the pro-Israel side,” says Seidler-Feller. “That form of delegitimization didn’t exist before, and it’s turned this into a dirty war.”
For pro-Palestinian advocates on campus, he notes, this has come to mean that “we can say what we want because you oppressed us, and we earned that right, while you can’t say anything. And whatever you say about our suffering is not welcome, not legitimate and not sincere.”
Seidler-Feller believes another factor that has changed the dynamics of the campus debate, is the growing influence of external Jewish organizations.
“Some of them are run by well-meaning Jews for whom the historical sense of being pursued by others is the driving factor in their Jewish life – and that’s the lens through which they view the contemporary campus reality,” he says. “It’s much easier for them to promote a negative agenda than a positive agenda, and it protects them from taking a deeper inward look that would require assessing our own responsibilities for this situation and to what extent Israel has contributed to this dire situation on the campuses.”
Seidler-Feller’s own community of Los Angeles serves as headquarters to the most prominent of these organizations, StandWithUs. It is also the home of Israeli-American real estate investor Adam Milstein, who has poured a considerable amount of money into fighting BDS on college campuses, most recently through the Campus Maccabees program he founded together with casino mogul and Republican Party mega-donor Sheldon Adelson. It’s an ambitious initiative designed at convincing the world that BDS is not only bent on eradicating the Jewish state but also all of Western civilization.
The problem, according to UC Santa Cruz physics professor Michael Dine, is that the individuals running many of these organizations and initiatives are not necessarily in tune with the political sentiments of most of the students.
“They tend to be made up of people closely identified with one political party,” he says, referring to the Republicans, “trying to influence a population that is 70 percent Democrat.”
That may explain why their strategies sometimes backfire, UC Davis student Yonatan Zelnik being a case in point. “For me, it was really frustrating seeing how groups like StandWithUs were trying to make political capital out of what was happening on campus,” says the Israeli-born computer science major.
The turning point for him was a StandWithUs Facebook post that tried to link a divestment vote on campus to a swastika inscribed on the Jewish frat house where he lives. 
“There was no evidence whatsoever of any correlation,” he says, “and I found that post so misleading that it pushed me completely in the opposite direction.” Today, Zelnik has become active in the UC Davis chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace and describes himself as leaning toward being “pro-BDS.”
Over at UC Santa Cruz, senior Josh Frank had been recruited to organize an on-campus event for StandWithUs last year. A group of former Israeli soldiers were touring the United States at the time, and Frank was in charge of finding them a venue to meet with students and advertising the program. As often happens at such events, pro-Palestinian students planted themselves in the audience and disrupted the speakers, not allowing them to get a word in. Frank was devastated.
“After that experience I mentally checked out,” he says. “I later began asking myself, what was the point of it all?”
Even when things seem to be going well, the constant fighting and strategizing can be draining, acknowledges Yael Globerman, a senior communications major at UCLA and president of the local Hillel chapter.
“The first divestment vote we had here, we managed to defeat” she recalls, “and that was after 12 hours of having people yell at each other across the room. I remember walking out of there and feeling absolutely shattered, even though we had won.”
UC Santa Cruz’s Dine believes the goal of BDS is to distance Jewish students from Israel, and laments that the big Jewish organizations, despite their best intentions, are sometimes inadvertently lending a helping hand.
“I’m concerned about alienating kids with legitimate questions,” he says, referring to those Jewish students expressing reservations about Israeli policy and actions, “and in some parts of the community we are already at that stage.
“There’s been a deliberate effort to slander J Street, for example,” adds Dine, who serves as a board member of the Hillel chapter on his campus, “and it’s a little scary because that is the only organization that provides a voice to those students who love Israel but not the occupation.”
Damned if they do, damned if they don’t
Though the vast majority of students shrug off the tensions, those interested in exploring their views on Israel find themselves wedged uncomfortably in the middle. On their right, hard core Zionist activists wince when they use terms like “occupation” and “settlements” to expresses their reservations about Israeli policy. On their left, minority students and others that identify as oppressed groups on campus criticize them for opposing BDS, or at least not supporting it wholeheartedly.
It is typically members of J Street U – a left-wing Zionist organization with chapters on several key California college campuses – who say they find themselves in this impossible situation.
That would include students like Stanford’s Chang, who joined the organization soon after the ugly divestment debate she witnessed on campus last year. ”What piqued my interest was the basic refusal of Jewish students to engage with issues like occupation, and instead to call anyone critical of Israel an anti-Semite,” she said. “Fortunately, I’ve discovered a growing group of people like me willing to venture into this gray area.”
For Zoe Goldblum, another Stanford sophomore, it was actually the intransigence she discovered on the pro-Palestinian side that drew her to the more nuanced message of J Street U.
During her first year on campus, Goldblum recounts, she was active in the Black Lives Matter movement as well as other social justice causes. “But when the divestment issue came up,” she recalls, “I felt the message being put out was that if you’re pro-Israel, you’re automatically anti-social justice and believe that Palestinians should suffer, and that if I didn’t agree 100 percent with the furthest leftist interpretations of the Palestinian narrative, I wasn’t welcome into any social justice organizations.”
Over at UCLA, Bar-Or, who describes himself as a progressive Zionist, also feels torn. “I wanted to be involved with other minority groups, but it’s become an issue,” he says. “In a way, you have to choose between being pro-Israel or pro-anything else.”
Stanford freshman Matthew Wigler concurs. “I was very disappointed to discover when I came here that intersectionality doesn’t apply to Jews,” he says, citing the term popularized on college campuses to describe the bonds that exist among those identifying as oppressed groups and which pro-Palestinian groups have used to their advantage in forging alliances with other minority organizations. “Standing against hatred has come to mean standing against Israel,” Wigler adds.
Particularly painful to Zach Brenner, a J Street U activist at UC Santa Cruz, is the ignorance that drives many of his fellow student activists on both sides of the battlefield. It is rare, he sighs, to find people with a "nuanced understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
USC, Berkeley and all that’s in between
It’s hard to generalize about Jewish student life in California, because no two campuses are alike.
On one side of the spectrum is the University of Southern California (USC), in Los Angeles, a private and largely apolitical institution where the biggest threat most Jewish students face on a given day, as one campus professional notes, is being hit by an errant skateboard. And at the Jesuit-run University of San Francisco, where Hillel has only recently set up base, several Jewish students acknowledged that they had never heard the term BDS before being interviewed for this report and had never witnessed anti-Israel protests on their campus. 
“As much as I’d like to advocate for Israel here on campus, there’s really no need,” says Rya Fishman, a USF junior majoring in psychology.
UC Berkeley is clearly on the other side of the spectrum. It was there that Students for Justice in Palestine set up its first branch in 1993, and it was there that the first in the latest round of student-backed divestment motions against Israel was passed, in 2013. (Despite the relatively large number of divestment motions that have received student support on campuses around the country since then – a disproportionately large share of them in California – not one has been ratified by university administrators or boards of trustees.)
BDS has also gained a big following at UC Santa Cruz, a campus situated in the midst of a lush forest overlooking Monterey Bay, and known to attract students with a penchant for radical politics and marijuana. Unlike Berkeley, however, Santa Cruz has fewer pro-Israel organizations and fewer Jewish students’ groups active on campus.
That could explain why students there were more likely to tell Haaretz they perceived attacks on Israel as anti-Semitic and directed at them personally, and also why they were more likely to conceal outward signs of their Jewishness. So could the fact that a divestment motion had passed on their campus just a few months earlier, and they were still digesting it.  
“You can’t be visibly pro-Israel on this campus without getting dirty looks,” declares Spencer Johnswick, a senior ecology major who sports a Star of David tattoo on the back of his neck but prefers to keep the Chai (Hebrew word for “life”) pendant on his necklace tucked inside his shirt. As a high school student in the Bay Area, he recounts, he was active in various social justice organizations. But although he considers himself both “pro-Israel and pro-Palestine,” that became impossible at university.
“I wanted to get involved in those sort of spaces here too. But as soon as I told people I had been on Birthright, it really turned them off,” he notes, referring to the organized educational trip to Israel for Diaspora Jews. “It was like, ‘How could you step on that soil?’ and it really drove a wedge between us.”
Adam Lieber, a senior studying business management, agrees. “There’s pressure here not to act Jewish,” he says. As an example, he reports that a member of his Jewish fraternity, one of the few students on campus to regularly wear a yarmulke, recently removed it from his head. “He didn’t feel comfortable walking around with it any more.”
Small anti-Israel or anti-Jewish incidents on campus do tend to get blown out of proportion because of social media, acknowledges UC Santa Cruz sophomore Talia Gnessin, whose parents are Israeli.
Still, she says, as a matter of principle she avoids wearing T-shirts with Hebrew writing on them. “Not because of anything specific that happened to me or any of my friends,” she explains, “but because I know the conflict does exist and is part of who I am, and I don’t want to have to discuss it with passersby who might take offense.”
Unsafe or just uncomfortable?
In March, the University of California became the first public university in the United States to issue a statement condemning anti-Semitism on its campuses, though it stopped short of a blanket denunciation of anti-Zionism. Recognizing that some, but not all, forms of anti-Zionism are anti-Semitic in nature, the statement referred specifically to “anti-Semitic forms of anti-Zionism” as having “no place” on its campuses.
The driving force behind this landmark declaration was a small but very vocal organization operating out of UC Santa Cruz known as the AMCHA Initiative, whose declared mission is combating anti-Semitism on U.S. college campuses. In its latest annual report, published in March, AMCHA found “objective confirmation of student reports of widespread anti-Semitic expression, BDS activity, and behavior which targets Jewish students for harm,” and said those factors had created what was perceived as a “hostile environment for Jewish students.”
The AMCHA report put several of the University of California campuses at the top of its list of universities with the highest number of incidents of students being targeted for being pro-Israel. The organization and many of its partners in the pro-Israel advocacy world have come under attack, however, from groups more to the left for conflating anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism.
Among some of the more vocal opponents of the declaration was Diane Wolf, director of the Jewish Studies program at UC Davis, who says she fears it will be used to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel on campuses. 
“Why is this story of widespread anti-Semitism on the campuses being pushed and perpetuated?” she asks. “I believe it’s an attempt to quash any discussion of BDS. Personally, I am very much against boycotting Israeli academics, but I feel students should be discussing these issues."
Seidler-Feller, the former UCLA Hillel director, doesn’t deny that incidents of anti-Semitism occur on California college campuses, or that the BDS movement is fueled in part by anti-Semitism.
“But you want to know what the right policy for anti-Semitic inscriptions on the wall is?” he asks. “You get the cleaning crew to clean it off. We’ve always had incidents like that, but you have to be able to distinguish between hooliganism and anti-Semitism. And what passes for anti-Semitism these days? Students feeling uncomfortable. You know what? Maybe one of the reasons you go to university is to feel uncomfortable.”
Most Jewish students on California campuses are able to identify moments when they feel uncomfortable and even threatened because of the natural tendency to associate them with Israel. That would be on days when divestment votes are being held or during Israeli Apartheid Week – an anti-Israel event typically held in March. It could also be on days when they are forced to walk through fake “Israeli checkpoints” set up by pro-Palestinian activists as part of their efforts to give other students a taste of life for Palestinians under occupation. 
But based on conversations with dozens of Jewish students on eight California campuses, very few, if any, believe anti-Semitism is prevalent at their universities.
This sentiment is borne out by a recent University of California Campus Climate Study, which found that 84 percent of Jewish students and faculty in the state university system feel comfortable on campus – a higher rate than among both Muslims and Christians.
Only at one college did a Jewish student agree that it would be correct to describe the atmosphere on his campus as anti-Semitic.
That student was Daniel Bernstein, vice president of the UC Santa Cruz Jewish Student Union, and a member of the student governing body. Before the Santa Cruz student government approved a motion last November to divest from companies doing business with Israel, he reported being asked to sit out the vote because of his “Jewish agenda.”
Then there are students like Jacob Kaplan-Lipkin, who says he often feels uncomfortable on campus not because he's Jewish but because of his visible affiliation with what is widely perceived to be the wrong side of the conflict. A freshman from nearby Palo Alto, Kaplan-Lipkin is one of a handful of students at this elite private institution who sports a yarmulke. On this particular day he is also wearing a T-shirt with "Stanford" written on it in Hebrew lettering.
“Although this a safe place for Jewish students," he says, "I definitely feel uncomfortable here being a Zionist and pro-Israel.” Kaplan-Lipkin made this comment before the recent controversy that erupted when a Stanford student government leader declared that it was not anti-Semitic to say Jews control the media and the economy.
The kids are alright
Probably more than any other California college campus, UC Irvine has seen its reputation tarnished by allegations of anti-Semitism. In 2010, an ugly confrontation erupted there when pro-Palestinian demonstrators tried to prevent Michael Oren – at the time Israel’s ambassador to the United States – from addressing a campus audience.
The event, in which 11 activists were arrested, sent shock waves through the Jewish community. Right-wing Jewish organizations immediately responded by urging Jewish parents to keep their children away from Irvine, and their calls were heeded.
Following several years of plummeting enrollment within this demographic, however, Jewish students are heading back to the southern California campus. More importantly, they say they feel fine here.
“There is no problem of anti-Semitism on this campus,” declares Lauren Kerner, an honor’s history student active in the UC Irvine Hillel. “I wear my hamsa [a Jewish charm necklace] everyday, I feel comfortable wearing my IDF T-shirt to gym and class, and I have no problem being vocal in my support for Israel – even in classes where I know my teachers support BDS.”
Several of her fellow pro-Israel activist friends sitting around the table at a campus café during a lunchtime break echo these sentiments.
UCLA had its own big moment last year when Rachel Beyda, a sophomore active in Jewish campus life, was asked during confirmation hearings for a student government post whether her religious affiliation might affect her ability to vote objectively.
Refuting those who rely on this case to claim that anti-Semitism is rampant on U.S. college campuses, Presner – the director of the UCLA Jewish Studies department – asks: “Is this representative of something pervasive and fundamental, or is it more about a naive student asking a stupid question? I think the latter.”
Wolf, the UC Davis professor, concurs. “I get emails from Jewish mothers asking me if it’s safe to send their child here, and my response is that it is perfectly safe,” she says. “There has never been any physical threat on campus. In fact, I would be much more concerned about sending a daughter to college in this day and age.”
Even at Berkeley, many Jewish students shrug off concerns.
“My parents’ friends always ask why would a nice Jewish girl like me go to Berkeley,” says Becca Berman, a junior history major, “but it’s the best thing I’ve ever done. It helped me realize how important my Jewish identity was to me.”
With 14 different Jewish student groups active on campus, including political, social, professional interest and Greek organizations, she notes, “Jewish life here is extremely robust.”
Sonia Brin, a junior majoring in public health at UC Berkeley, agrees that the Jewish community’s hand-wringing is largely unwarranted. In her opinion, social media is to blame for perceptions about her school, which she believes have been blown completely out of proportion. 
“I think it’s funny when I see friends suddenly sharing an article on Facebook about some incident that happened at Berkeley,” says the J Street U activist. “I then have to explain to them that it wasn’t a big deal.”
In fact, most Jewish students questioned by Haaretz say the Middle East conflict is hardly an issue for them – and neither is their religious identity. Based on conversations and observations during Haaretz’s mid-semester visit, students were far more concerned with midterms and upcoming spring break trips than with attempts to delegitimize Israel on their campuses or with anti-Semitism.
On an unusually warm late February afternoon, Hillel student leaders at UCLA were hanging out at a café trying to figure out exactly what Reconstructionist Jews do and don’t believe. It was part of preparations for an upcoming event devoted to the various religious streams in Judaism. Not a word about Israel.
Just outside, the Israel advocacy group StandWithUS had just brought in a group of former IDF combat soldiers for a special tabling event. An Israeli television channel making a documentary about the BDS movement on U.S. college campuses had been tipped off that this could mean trouble.
But alas, no angry pro-Palestinian types showed up to provoke the Israelis. That evening, a lecture on the history of Zionism was delivered at the campus Hillel by a popular local rabbi. The Jewish Agency envoy at UCLA had reached out to the two sole members of Jewish Voice for Peace on campus – not usually welcomed at such events – and invited them to attend. They did – and the discussion, as later reported, was extremely civil.
At Berkeley, the scene is not much different from UCLA. Smack in the center of campus, a right-leaning, pro-Israel group called Tikvah (“Hope” in Hebrew) is set up at a table with a large sign advertising its Zionist affiliation. Two Jewish students sitting behind piles of flyers and Israeli flags scan their laptops for lack of much else to do.
The blatant symbols of the Jewish state hardly draw any attention from the throngs of students passing by on their way to class or lunch. And not because of any competition from pro-Palestinian activists, who on this particular afternoon are even less visible.
"The media discourse around BDS is 100 times greater than the reality of what’s happening on campus," sums up UCLA's Presner. “The vast majority of Jewish students are untouched and uninvolved. So when I hear reports that Jewish students are feeling unsafe, I just shake my head in disbelief.”

<title>Anti-Semitism charges cast ugly shadow on bucolic Oxford</title>
<date>Wed May 18 09:49:38 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
JTA — For a city that has made headlines recently for its anti-Semitism problem, Oxford has a pretty laid back Jewish scene.
On a recent Friday night, dozens of Jewish families and students wearing kippot were enjoying the afternoon sun as they strolled to one of Oxford’s two synagogues.
They converged at a modern building that houses a Jewish community center, complete with a kosher kitchen and a shul with a tall, sloped ceiling of white plaster that evokes the feeling of standing between the pages of a giant book. The same building has separate halls for Progressive congregants (Conservative and Reform) and Orthodox prayer, where services are held simultaneously.
Across Britain and Western Europe, worshippers more commonly cover their kippot with a hat on the way to synagogue, where they are inspected or questioned – and sometimes even frisked – at the entrance by police or military. And while the Oxford Jewish Centre has some security, visitors can often walk in no questions asked.
It’s part of living in a city with hardly any violent anti-Semitic incidents, says Jake Berger, a third-year psychology student from Manchester.
“I definitely feel safer walking around with a kippa here compared to Manchester,” Berger said.
Yet despite the rarity of physical attacks on Jews, anti-Semitic rhetoric and hate speech against Israel in Oxford has invited scrutiny and cast an ugly shadow on this bastion of the British left. A picturesque university town of 160,000 residents 60 miles northwest of London, Oxford is internationally famous for its scholastic excellence and for churning out leaders in a variety of fields. The University of Oxford was ranked as the world’s fifth best in the Center for World University Rankings this year.
Students fill the many affordable pubs here until deep into the night. On weekends, lovers and hikers walk or sail along the Oxford Canal, which intersects the city’s center and stretches for 80 miles.
Especially for Jews who are openly supportive of Israel, Oxford is “an Eden with a dark underbelly,” according to Richard Black, a fourth-year history student and former member of the local JSoc, the Oxford University Jewish Society. As a pro-Israel activist, he has been called “baby killer” several times in Oxford.
He says he overheard a classmate explaining that Jews exploit the memory of the Holocaust while committing their very own Holocaust against Palestinians, adding that Jews control American finance and media. After an argument on Israel, Black recalls, a member of the academic faculty told him that the Hebrew Bible was “genocidal” and that Black provided “the best advertisement for anti-Semitism.”
Black also recalls that at one event in 2011, a pro-Palestinian activist told him that “Adolf Hitler was a good man.” She was holding a banner supporting Palestinians and speaking with Black calmly about the factors that led to Israel’s existence, including the Holocaust.
“I was shocked back then, but I have grown accustomed,” Black said.
Like many Jewish students at Oxford, Black cites the increasingly popular pejorative of “Zio” as proof of widespread but covert anti-Semitism. Short for Zionist, “it’s shorthand, used by people who hate Jews as cover for what they’re really saying: ‘Dirty Jew,’” Black said. “The true meaning lies in context: Zio media, Zio lobby – You overhear this sort of thing here.”
Last year, African rights activist Zuleyka Shahin, during a failed campaign for president of the Oxford Union, wrote on Facebook that “Judeo-Christian white men” and “Zio white men” are “complicit in the funding of wars and the social genocide of my people.”
In February, a non-Jewish Oxford student had enough of anti-Semitic chatter. Alex Chalmers, a co-chair of the university’s Labour chapter, resigned his post over the chapter’s passing of a motion endorsing Israel Apartheid Week, explaining that he no longer wanted to be associated with a framework that has “some kind of problem with Jews.”
The word “Zio,” he wrote in an op-ed explaining his move, “was part of the [Labour] club’s lexicon.” The song “Rockets over Tel Aviv” was a favorite among a certain faction of the club. Concerns of Jewish students “were ridiculed,” Chalmers added.
His resignation triggered an internal probe by Oxford’s Labour chapter which found that the Oxford University Labour Club is not institutionally anti-Semitic, but faces “difficulties” that must be addressed, the Jewish Chronicle reported Tuesday.
More significantly, it also started a chain reaction, exposing the left-wing party to intense media scrutiny in Britain that generated one of its worst public relations fiascoes in years. Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn – himself branded untrustworthy by Jewish community leaders over his support for the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah – was forced to suspend at least 20 of the party’s members for making hateful remarks or statements on Jews and Israel.
Among those suspended this month were former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, who said Hitler supported Zionism in defending a Labour lawmaker who had been suspended earlier for making a similar statement.
Earlier this month Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, told The Times of London that Jewish students at British universities, including Oxford, face a “wall of anti-Zionism, which they feel and know to be Jew hatred.” He is scheduled to speak later this month at the Oxford Union.
For some Jewish students and faculty, the storm is “just brouhaha,” said Jonathan, a former computer science student who graduated in 2013.  He returns to Oxford regularly for JSoc activities and to attend lectures.
Jonathan, an observant Jew who did not want his last name mentioned, said: “The ones who experience anti-Semitism are the hacks,” meaning people active in student or university politics.
Most Jews in Oxford “enjoy a very good situation of safety and a robust Jewish community with excellent facilities that are actually far better than what one finds in many other British universities,” said Berger, the psychology student from Manchester. Even Black – a supporter of the Conservative Party – said that “for every negative experience” with non-Jews in Oxford, he has had “a hundred positive ones.”
While the recent scandal exposed widespread hate speech at Oxford, it also reinforced growing rejection of anti-Semitism “by the vast majority in Oxford” who understand “how criticism of Israel spills into anti-Semitism,” Black said.
Last month, four of Oxford’s six delegates to Britain’s National Student Union said their university should disaffiliate from the union following the election of Malia Bouatia as its president. Bouatia, a student at the University of Birmingham, is accused of justifying violence against Israelis and opposing a motion to condemn the Islamic State terror group lest it stigmatize Muslims. She also blamed the “Zionist-led media” for oppression in the global south.
Two British universities, Lincoln and Newcastle, this month disaffiliated with the union, citing lack of confidence in its leadership. Oxford is set to hold a disaffiliation referendum in the coming weeks.   
As for Israelis living in Oxford — there are hundreds of them, mostly students and researchers — they say they suffer no discrimination or abuse for their country of origin.
“It’s a very international place, many languages spoken, very tolerant,” said Lior Weizman, 36, a father of four who moved to Oxford last year to work as a post-doctoral fellow at Oxford specializing in medical imaging of the brain.
“I’m not a political person,” he said. “But if there are situations of people being singled out in Oxford because of their country of origin, I haven’t encountered them.”

<title>Don't believe the hype: The Israel boycott movement is a marginal phenomenon</title>
<date>Thu Jul 14 18:47:35 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
JTA — Ever since the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel began picking up steam three years ago, its proponents have brazenly declared the movement’s inevitable triumph. In April, for example, a pro-divestment group at the University of Chicago issued a statement proclaiming that by the school’s student government passing a BDS resolution, the university “finally put (itself) on the right side of history.”
BDS proponents interpreted the momentum in progressive circles, such as student government and academic bodies, as a sure sign from the political gods that BDS will gain acceptance in wider and wider swaths of American society. Eventually, they assert, Americans will realize that their supposed ally Israel is an apartheid state and will cease their support.
I must admit to the occasional bout of exasperated resignation. There’s no denying that increasing numbers of progressives were embracing the BDS cause. A number of student governments that had initially rejected BDS had later endorsed it. Momentum had turned in the movement’s favor.
Could there be, as the BDS proponents alleged, an unfolding historical dialectic at work here — one as unmistakably foreseeable as the eventual triumph over apartheid South Africa — that would culminate in Israel’s ultimate delegitimization in American society? Is it just a matter of time?
Not so fast. In the past several months, the tables have turned. Anti-BDS bills have passed in state legislatures by huge margins and BDS resolutions have gone down in defeat at several progressive institutions.
At last count, 19 states have passed anti-BDS bills in this past legislative session alone. Some of the legislation merely condemns BDS and encourages a negotiated solution. And some measures place companies that accede to a BDS campaign on a state no-buy list, forcing them to think long and hard before pulling out of Israel. In the Illinois House of Representatives, the anti-BDS bill passed by a vote of 102-2, and in the Florida Senate it was 38-0 with 2 abstentions. In every state legislative body that had a roll call taken, the anti-BDS bill passed by decisive if not overwhelming margins.
The state-level anti-BDS onslaught demonstrates that BDS is a marginal phenomena, confined to the extreme left. BDS proponents have picked their battlefields carefully, looking for places where they have a shot at winning. But once the battlefield is widened to state legislatures representing mainstream sensibilities, BDS not only fails to persuade, it is utterly repudiated.
Even in progressive circles, where BDS had been gaining ground, it has suffered a series of significant setbacks. At the Presbyterian Church (USA) General Assembly in Portland, Oregon, in June, a slanted report on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict prepared before the conference was accompanied by a series of more balanced amendments passed during the conference.
“The PCUSA pretty much endorsed Zionism,” said Ethan Felson, executive director of the Israel Action Network, a joint project of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs and the Jewish Federations of North America.
At the United Methodist’s General Conference in May, the church body rejected four divestment resolutions. In June, members of the American Anthropological Association narrowly defeated a resolution calling on the association to refrain from formal collaborations with Israeli academic institutions.
These wins show that when the Jewish community effectively organizes, builds strong ties before the vote with key people in the institutions targeted by BDS campaigns, and appeals to the sensibilities of people sitting on the fence of the BDS debate, it can prevail over Israel’s detractors. Strategic advocacy and relationship building actually work. These victories turn the BDS “right side of history” narrative on its head, for if BDS can’t win over the anthropological association, who can it convince?
This is not to say that maintaining long-term American support for Israel is any more pre-ordained than America’s ultimate embrace of BDS. Halting the BDS train is not inevitable and will not happen on its own. But the victories of the past several months should give us tremendous confidence in our ability to maintain and grow support for Israel. We, too, can be on the right side of history.
David Bernstein is the president and CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs.

<title>U.S. Green Party presidential candidate would cut military aid to Israel</title>
<date>Mon Aug 08 17:38:15 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
United States presidential candidate Jill Stein says she would put an end to American military aid to Israel if elected president.
Stein, a Jewish physician and environmental activist from Chicago, was nominated last week to lead the American Green Party in the 2016 presidential election.
As Green Party candidate in the 2012 election, Stein received just under half-a-million votes, some 0.36 percent of the ballots cast. She was an unsuccessful candidate for governor of Massachusetts in 2002 and 2010.
Continuing U.S. military aid to Israel would be "decisively against our common values, to support apartheid, to support home demolitions, to support occupation, to support violations of international law," Stein said in an interview with Newsweek, published on Friday.
Stein added that her relationship with Israel would be "ethical."
"As an American Jew, I have a relationship with Israel, she said. "Unfortunately, Sheldon Adelson contributes a huge amount of money to [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu. Why should the Sheldon Adelsons of America be messing with the politics of Israel?"
"If I was living in Israel, and I knew that one of the major funders of a very oppressive right-wing government was coming from outside of my country, I would be up in arms about it."
Stein explained that her ethical foreign policy would apply to all countries and not just Israel. "I would bring ethical foreign policy to all countries," she said.
"We should not be selling weapons or funding armies of countries who are violating our basic values of human dignity and human rights. I would go to Israel—and to Saudi Arabia—with all humility, because nobody has been a bigger violator of these rights and values than our own country."

<title>Peace activist Stanley Sheinbaum dies at 96 in Los Angeles</title>
<date>Tue Sep 13 08:43:44 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Stanley K. Sheinbaum, a former economics professor whose drive for Mideast peace had him mingling with presidents, royalty and movie stars, has died. He was 96.
Sheinbaum died of heart disease on Monday at his home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, said his assistant, Marti Maniates.
Sheinbaum gave up teaching to devote himself to what he called his quest to "create a little peace and justice in this unjust world."
He raised funds to defend Daniel Ellsberg during the military analyst's trial for releasing the Pentagon Papers, a secret study of the Vietnam War.
Never one to shrink from controversy, Sheinbaum met with late Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in an unofficial diplomatic mission to bring peace to the Middle East. The meeting propelled him into headlines and sparked protests from Israelis and the American Jewish community.
"For a while, I was the most hated Jew in America ... by other Jews anyway," he said in his 2011 autobiography. But he added, "I didn't waste time agonizing."
Still, he acknowledged, his mission for peace failed.
Sheinbaum "was a tireless advocate whose courageous stances breathed life into monumental change on both the local and global stages," Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a statement.
"His work will forever inspire everyone who believes in bringing people together to transform our world for the better," he said.
Sheinbaum's causes ranged from reforming the LAPD to urging California universities to divest from their holdings in South Africa during apartheid.
His book, "Stanley K. Sheinbaum: A 20th Century Knight's Quest for Peace, Civil Liberties and Economic Justice," was written with a co-author when he was in his 90s. It contained book jacket testimonials from President Bill Clinton, Barbra Streisand, Jane Fonda and Norman Lear, who summed up his friend's legacy by saying: "He's addicted to fairness and justice."
In 1971, hearing that Ellsberg was to be prosecuted, Sheinbaum saw a cause that meshed with his anti-Vietnam War sentiments. He volunteered to organize Ellsberg's legal team and raise money for his defense. He and his wife Betty moved to Los Angeles for the trial and never left. He recruited Hollywood celebrities to hold fundraisers and he signed up two of the most prominent civil liberties lawyers in the country, Leonard Boudin and Leonard Weinglass.
After many months of legal drama, the case was dismissed for governmental misconduct involving a break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office and the judge's meetings with members of the Nixon administration.
In the 1980s, Sheinbaum became obsessed with the cause of peace in the Middle East. He managed to arrange a meeting with Palestinian Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat and the picture of him with his arm around Arafat that appeared on the front page of the Los Angeles Times set off a firestorm of protest within the Jewish community. He was booed when he spoke at synagogues. But he continued his mission, meeting with Arafat several more times and trying to negotiate peace with Israel.
When Arafat died, he said hope of a peace agreement died with him. His dream of peace had failed.
"My failure is the greatest disappointment I have ever experienced," Sheinbaum said, "and I can only take solace from the knowledge that I really, really tried. I really did."

<title>James Mattis, Trump's reported pick for defense post, sees Israel turning into apartheid state</title>
<date>Thu Dec 01 23:35:17 IST 2016</date>
<content>
James Mattis, a former Marine General reported to be U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s choice for Defense Secretary, has said West Bank settlements are turning Israel into an apartheid state.
Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, who was known as “Mad Dog,” also has said that the United States pays a price for its support of Israel, the Times of Israel reported.
Mattis met with Trump Saturday at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey
An unnamed official “familiar with the transition process” told CNN that Mattis can be considered a leading candidate for secretary of defense.
When Trump was asked by reporters whether Mattis is a candidate to lead the Defense Department, Trump said, “All I can say is he is the real deal. He is the real deal.”
Mattis ran U.S. Central Command in from August 2010 to March 2013. In that position he had command authority for all U.S. forces in the Middle East.
“I paid a military security price every day as the commander of CentCom because the Americans were seen as biased in support of Israel, and that moderates all the moderate Arabs who want to be with us, because they can’t come out publicly in support of people who don’t show respect for the Arab Palestinians,” Mattis said in 2013 at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado.
At the same forum he criticized Israel for settlement building, saying that the settlements “are going to make it impossible to maintain the two-state option.”
He said the settlements would undermine Israel as both a Jewish and Democratic state, and said the settlements would lead to apartheid.
“If I’m in Jerusalem and I put 500 Jewish settlers out here to the east and there’s 10,000 Arab settlers in here, if we draw the border to include them, either it ceases to be a Jewish state or you say the Arabs don’t get to vote — apartheid,” he said.
Mattis was an outspoken critic of the Iran nuclear deal, which exchanged a nuclear rollback for sanctions relief.
Also on Saturday, Trump met 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney for over an hour, fueling speculation that Romney could be Trump’s choice for secretary of state.
Following the meeting Romney told reporters that he and Trump “had a far-reaching conversation with regards to the various theaters in the world.

<title>Israeli BDS activist a top candidate for president of U.K. Union of Jewish Students</title>
<date>Tue Nov 22 20:20:02 IST 2016</date>
<content>
One of three candidates nominated for the presidency of Britain's Union of Jewish Students is an Israeli-born activist in BDS, a movement that calls to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel, the London-based Jewish Chronicle reported Tuesday.
The candidate, Eran Cohen, has also been involved in promoting pro-Palestinian events related to Palestinian Apartheid Week on his campus, the University of York, the Chronicle said.
The Chronicle made reference to a Facebook post by Cohen explaining his support for BDS as in keeping with his view that there should be one state in what is now Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
"I support it because I believe it will bring about a secular state for all its citizens from the river to the sea. Some people equate that with the destruction of Israel. I don't."
A spokesperson for the Union for Jewish Students quoted by the Chronicle said the nomination for presidency required the three candidates to secure support from at least 10 students from five British campuses. Voting ends December 9.
"Our students have nominated three very different candidates for the UJS presidency. We are excited about the levels of engagement in our representative cross-communal union this dynamic and contested election should generate," the UJS said.
“UJS should represent all Jewish students, Zionist or not," Cohen said, according to a statement the Chronicle received from his campaign team.
"I am a Diasporist. I believe the focus of Jewish life is wherever Jews live, and excessive focus on Israel damages the U.K. Jewish community. There are many left-wing Jewish students, both Zionist and not, who support my campaign. Jewish students are diverse, and UJS is supposed to be democratic. It doesn’t stand for anything other than what Jewish students want at any particular time,” Cohen said.

<title>Elie Wiesel, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and renowned Holocaust survivor, dies at 87</title>
<date>Sat Jul 02 22:09:06 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Holocaust survivor, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, prolific author and outspoken activist Elie Wiesel died Saturday at the age of 87. Wiesel was perhaps best known for his major role in promoting Holocaust education, and for perpetuating the memory of the Holocaust in the post-World War II era with his memoir “Night,” based on his experience as a teenager in the Auschwitz concentration camp.
Eliezer “Elie” Wiesel was born on September 30, 1928 in the Romanian town of Sighet, to Sarah and Shlomo Wiesel. His maternal grandfather, Dodye Feig, was a member of the Vishnitz Hasidic sect; his strong influence over Wiesel was seen later in some of his writings. Wiesel received a traditional religious education while growing up in Sighet; many years later, in 2002, he returned to his hometown to dedicate the Elie Weisel Memorial House at the site of his childhood home.
The Wiesel family’s lives were seriously disrupted in 1940, when Hungary annexed Sighet and all the Jews in town were forced to move into one of two ghettoes. In May 1944, the Nazis, with Hungary’s agreement, deported the Jewish community of Sighet to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. The teenage Wiesel was sent with his father Shlomo to the Buna Werke labor camp, a sub-camp of Auschwitz III-Monowitz, where they were forced to work for eight months before being transferred to a series of other concentration camps near the war’s end.
The malnourished and dysentery-stricken Shlomo Wiesel died after receiving a beating from a German soldier on January 29, 1945, several weeks after he and Elie were forced-marched to the Buchenwald camp. Wiesel’s mother Sarah and younger sister Tzipora also perished in the Holocaust. He would later recount those and other events in his 1955 memoir “Night.”

After the war, Wiesel was sent with other young survivors by the French Jewish humanitarian organization Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants to an orphanage in Écouis, France. He lived for several years at the home, where he was reunited with the only surviving members of his immediate family: his older sisters Beatrice and Hilda.
In 1948, the 20-year-old Wiesel pursued studies in literature, philosophy and psychology at the Sorbonne, but never completed them. Around the same time, after working a series of odd jobs including teaching Hebrew, Wiesel – who mostly wrote in French throughout his life – became a professional journalist, writing for both French and Israeli publications. In 1948, he translated Hebrew articles into Yiddish for Israel’s pre-state Irgun militia. Wiesel visited the nascent State of Israel in 1949 as a foreign correspondent for the French newspaper L’arche. He was subsequently hired by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth as its Paris correspondent, and also worked for the paper as a roving correspondent abroad. He also covered the 1961 trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann for the New York-based Yiddish newspaper The Forward.
It was during his time in Paris that Wiesel was said to have studied with a mysterious and renowned Jewish scholar known simply as Monsieur Chouchani (also spelled Shushani in certain sources) after meeting him at a synagogue. Wiesel described Chouchani in an article in Yedioth Ahronoth as “a modern legend,” and after the man’s death, went on to pay for his tombstone in Montevideo, Uruguay, and wrote his epitaph: “The wise Rabbi Chouchani of blessed memory. His birth and his life are sealed in enigma.”
Despite or perhaps because of the major traumatic impact the Holocaust had on his life, Wiesel did not write about those experiences until encouraged to do so during a conversation with French Nobel Laureate for Literature Francois Mauriac, in 1954. The original version of his first memoir was over 800 pages, written in Yiddish and entitled “Un di velt hot geshvign” (“And the World Remained Silent”). He wrote a much shorter version in French, published in 1958 as “La Nuit” and it was translated into English as “Night,” two years later. Despite, its eventual popularity, “Night” sold less than 2,000 copies in its first 18 months in the United States. However, the book did attract much attention among reviewers and created a higher media profile for Wiesel; it has gone on to sell more than six million copies.
In 2006, popular talk-show host Oprah Winfrey selected a new translation of “Night” by Wiesel’s wife Marion for her book club, helping to push the book to a top spot on The New York Times’ best-seller list for nonfiction paperbacks. The book now appears in 30 languages.
“Night” would form the first part of Holocaust memoir trilogy that would include “Dawn” and “Day.” All told Wiesel wrote more than 40 works of nonfiction and fiction, including “A Passover Haggadah” and “Wise Men and Their Tales: Portraits of Biblical, Talmudic, and Hasidic Masters.”
In 1955, Wiesel moved to New York to cover the United Nations. During his time in the city he was hit by a taxi, requiring a prolonged convalescence in the hospital. Following his recovery, Wiesel applied for permanent residency and in 1963 became a U.S. citizen; this was the first citizenship he held since becoming stateless during the Holocaust.
A longtime bachelor, Wiesel eventually met his wife to-be, divorced Austrian Holocaust survivor Marion Rose, in New York. They married in Jerusalem in 1969. Marion served as the English translator for Wiesel’s subsequent books.
The world-renowned Holocaust survivor received numerous awards and honors over the years, including the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom and the rank of Grand-Croix in France’s Legion of Honor, and he was knighted as Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Perhaps the highest honor of all was the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986 for his role in speaking out against violence, repression and racism. Wiesel was also the recipient of over 100 honorary doctorates, and received France’s distinguished Prix Medicis for his 1968 book “A Beggar in Jerusalem,” describing the Jewish response to the reunification of Jerusalem following the Six-Day War.
In Israel, in 2007, then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reportedly suggested nominating Wiesel as candidate for president of Israel on behalf of the Kadima party, but Wiesel was said to have declined the offer. Olmert eventually selected Shimon Peres as Kadima’s candidate for president; Peres would later award Wiesel the President’s Medal of Distinction in 2013.
Despite his life experiences, Wiesel was not without a sense of humor, which he displayed, for example, when given the World Jewish Congress’ Theodor Herzl Award by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2013. “There were two great men in Europe at that time: Herzl and Freud,” Wiesel was quoted as saying, by The Forward. “Luckily they never met. Just imagine Herzl knocking on the door of Dr. Freud: ‘I had a dream.’ Freud would have said, ‘Sit down. Tell me about your mother.’”
In addition to his writing, Wiesel enjoyed a second career as an academic. From 1972 to 1976, he was professor of Judaic Studies at the City University of New York. Thereafter, he was Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities at Boston University, and a member of both its philosophy and religion departments. Wiesel was Henry Luce Visiting Scholar in Humanities and Social Thought at Yale University (1982-83), and visiting professor of Judaic studies at Barnard College of Columbia University from 1997 to 1999.
It can be said, however, that Elie Wiesel was best known for his role in keeping alive the memory of the Holocaust and for promoting Holocaust education. Over the years, he spoke of these subjects innumerable times, before countless audiences, around the globe.
In 1978, U.S. President Jimmy Carter appointed him as chairman of the Presidential Commission on the Holocaust (later renamed the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council), a role in which he served until 1986. In that capacity, Wiesel became a major, driving force behind the establishment of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. His words, “For the dead and the living, we must bear witness” are engraved in stone at the entrance to the museum.
In 1986, after receiving the Nobel, he and his wife established the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity to combat intolerance and injustice around the world through dialogue in general, and via programs for youth. The following year Wiesel served as a witness during the trial of war criminal Klaus Barbie in Lyons, France, during which he spoke of his bitter experiences in Auschwitz.
In 2003, Romanian President Ion Iliescu appointed Wiesel to lead the International Commission for the Study of the Holocaust in Romania. This group, later referred to as the Wiesel Commission, was tasked with setting the record straight regarding the involvement of Romania’s fascist Iron Guard regime in Holocaust atrocities against Jews, Roma and others. The Romanian government recognized the commission’s findings, as published in 2004, including the assessment that between 280,000 and 380,000 Jews and over 11,000 Roma died during World War II as result of policies advanced by the Romanian authorities.
Following the commission’s work, the Romanian government also decided to mark October 9 – the day in 1941 that Romanian Jews were deported to ghettos and forced labor camps – as the country's annual day for commemorating the Holocaust.
In 2012, Wiesel gave back the Grand Cross Order of Merit award he had received from Hungary in 2009, in protest of what he called the “whitewashing of tragic and criminal episodes” that happened in that country during the Holocaust.
In early 2006, around the time “Night” was re-issued, Wiesel took talk-show host Oprah Winfrey on a well-publicized trip to Auschwitz. Three years later, he accompanied President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on a trip to the Buchenwald concentration camp.
Also in the latter years of his life, Wiesel was in the headlines for an entirely unrelated reason: as one of the more prominent victims of Wall Street financier Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity lost $15.2 million it had invested with Madoff, and the Wiesels lost their own life's savings, reported to be around $1 million. The foundation later managed to raise about one-third of the money it lost to Madoff from sympathetic donors, and to continue to function. When asked to describe Madoff by a New York Times journalist, Wiesel said, “Psychopath – it’s too nice a word for him.”
Elie Wiesel was noted during his lifetime for using his celebrity appeal to promote Holocaust remembrance, but also to speak out on various political issues, including instances of genocide around the world. In September 2006, for example, he appeared with Hollywood actor George Clooney before the UN Security Council to bring attention to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. In 2007, the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity issued a letter criticizing the denial of the Armenian genocide at the hands of the Ottoman Turks; it was signed by Wiesel and 52 other Nobel laureates.
Wiesel was concerned about human rights in general, serving on the International Council of the Human Rights Foundation and he spoke out against South African apartheid, Argentina’s policy of “disappearing” people during its Dirty War, and the Bosnian genocide during the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. In 2010, he came out publicly against the Netanyahu government’s decision to deport 400 children of migrant workers from Israel.Weisel was an advocate when it came to a host of Jewish issues, and in particular was stridently pro-Israel. Following a visit to the Soviet Union in 1965, he wrote about the plight of Soviet Jews in a book called “The Jews of Silence,” and spoke out in favor of the struggle to allow them to emigrate; he was also a vocal supporter of the immigration of Ethiopian Jews to Israel. In April 2010, he took out advertisements in four major newspapers, criticizing the Obama administration for pressuring the Netanyahu government to halt construction in Jewish neighborhoods located across the Green Line in East Jerusalem. Wiesel repeated that tactic in 2013 when he took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling on the U.S. administration to demand the total dismantling of the nuclear infrastructure in Iran because that country had called for Israel’s destruction.
In a 2012 interview with Haaretz, Wiesel said he would bequeath the archive of his writings to Boston University, where he had taught for decades. Wiesel is survived by his wife Marion, their son Shlomo Elisha Wiesel, and his stepdaughter Jennifer and two grandchildren

<title>Catholic bishops prevented from reaching separation fence near Bethlehem</title>
<date>Wed Jan 13 21:18:17 IST 2016</date>
<content>
A number of Catholic bishops were prevented from reaching a construction site on the separation barrier on the West Bank near the Cremisan Monastery just south of Jerusalem, the London-based Catholic Herald reported on Wednesday. 
Israeli security forces asked the bishops to leave the construction area and before being escorted away, they "prayed together for peace and justice in the Holy Land." They said they came to see for themselves the effects of the construction on the local farmers. 
Bishop Stephen Brislin of Cape Town told journalists who accompanied the bishops: “It breaks my heart to see what has happened here… we had been here for about five minutes just to have a look and compare with last year before the police came and it just reminded me so much of apartheid times, the type of intimidation, the exhibition of power," reported the Catholic Herald. 
The bishops were part of the annual Holy Land Coordination pilgrimage of 14 members of the Bishops Conferences from Europe, North America, and South Africa. The group is visiting local parishes, schools and aid and development organizations to show the support of the worldwide Christian community and gain insights into the complex problems underlying Israeli-Palestinian relations.
The group will visit in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and Jordan from January 9-14.

<title>Israeli academics feel shunned as boycott movement gains steam</title>
<date>Mon Feb 01 11:04:53 IST 2016</date>
<content>
AP - Israeli anthropologist Dan Rabinowitz is a leader in his field, heading a prestigious school of environmental studies at Tel Aviv University, authoring dozens of publications and holding visiting teaching positions over the years at leading North American universities.
But the British-educated Rabinowitz fears that his younger counterparts may not enjoy the same professional opportunities for a very personal reason: They are Israeli.
As a global boycott movement against Israeli universities gains steam, Israeli professors say they are feeling the pressure from their colleagues overseas. Although the movement ostensibly targets universities, not individuals, Israeli academics say they are often shunned at the personal level. They experience snubs at academic conferences, struggle to get recommendations and can experience difficulty publishing their work in professional journals.
"This is highly personal and personalized," said Rabinowitz.
The academic boycott is part of the broader pro-Palestinian BDS campaign, which advocates boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel. Inspired by the anti-apartheid movement, BDS organizers say they are using nonviolent means to promote the Palestinian struggle for independence.
Israel says the campaign goes beyond fighting its occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and often masks a more far-reaching aim to "delegitimize" or destroy the Jewish state. But the BDS movement's decentralized organization and language calling for universal human rights have proven difficult to counter.
The BDS website says "the vast majority of Israeli intellectuals and academics have either contributed directly to the Israeli occupation and apartheid or at the very least have been complicit through their silence."
And yet Israeli universities are widely seen as liberal bastions, and their professors are some of the most vocal government critics.
Already enjoying significant support in the U.K., the academic boycott has chalked up a series of accomplishments in the United States.
In recent years, the Association for Asian American Studies, the American Studies Association, the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association and the National Women's Studies Association have approved boycott measures.
In November, a meeting of the American Anthropological Association overwhelmingly endorsed a motion supporting a boycott of Israeli universities.
Domino effect
Peretz Lavie, president of the Technion, Israel's premier science and technology university, said the effect of such decisions has so far been minimal.
Lavie, who chairs the Association of University Heads in Israel, said relations between Israeli and American universities remain strong at the institutional and leadership levels, and praised this month's decision by the Association of American Universities reaffirming its opposition to the boycott. The group, which represents 62 leading U.S. universities, said the boycott "violates academic freedom."
Nonetheless, Lavie said the boycott movement has become a top concern for Israeli university leaders, particularly as it gains support at the "ground level" from U.S. student unions and academic associations.
"There may be a domino effect," he said. "If we do not deal with it, it will be a major problem."
Lavie is now leading a battle against the boycott. While acknowledging that Israeli government policies are open to criticism, he said that holding universities responsible for them is unfair and asked why countries with abysmal human rights records, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, have been spared.
"We have the feeling that these movements treat Israel differently than any other country in the world," he said.
Rabinowitz counts the November vote by the anthropological association as one of the most painful chapters of his career. He said he personally tried to alter the boycott resolution twice — only to be rejected with little or no debate. He said the rejection by his colleagues was a "defining moment" for him. In a statement, the association confirmed Rabinowitz's account, noting that the meeting was "highly charged."
Ed Liebow, the association's executive director, said the organization felt "a strong commitment" to take some sort of action. "The one thing we can't do is nothing," he said. The measure goes to the association's more than 10,000 members for a vote this spring.
Although the American anthropologists have never before proposed a boycott of academic institutions, the association said it commonly takes public stands against governments accused of restricting academic freedom. It recently sent a letter to leaders of Turkey, criticizing them for allegedly curbing scholars there.
Ilana Feldman, a professor of anthropology at George Washington University and a boycott supporter, said the proposal, if passed, would not impede professors "in any way" from working with Israeli scholars.
Rabinowitz, however, said it is impossible to distinguish between a person and his institution, which becomes part of one's professional identity.
Israeli academics say such feelings are increasingly common.
Rachelle Alterman, a professor emeritus of urban planning at the Technion, said she still has strong working relationships with colleagues around the world, but the pro-boycott camp is a "rising minority" in academia. She said it is less of an issue in the hard sciences like medicine and physics, and much more palpable in more subjective social sciences. Younger academics trying to establish a reputation are especially vulnerable.
Alterman said she has begun to feel a "coldness" from some colleagues at conferences that was not there in the past. She said some colleagues refuse to attend conferences in Israel, and editors at professional journals tell her it is difficult to find people willing to review papers by Israeli academics.
"I call it the dark matter. It's there all the time, but elusive, hard to spot," she said.
In one recent case, a British colleague coolly rejected a request to assist one of her graduate students.
"I am afraid that as part of the institutional boycott being observed by some academics in relation to Israeli organisations I am unable to help with your request," the British professor wrote in an email.
Rabinowitz said the boycott efforts will backfire by undermining Israeli moderates and playing into the hands of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government.
"It is the best present they can give Netanyahu and the radical right in Israel," he said.

<title>BDS founder urges Hollywood A-listers to reject Israel's Oscar swag bag 'bribe'</title>
<date>Wed Feb 10 12:58:57 IST 2016</date>
<content>
The offer of a free 10-day trip to Israel, valued at $55,000, in the swag-bag provided to select Oscar nominees has raised the ire of the international boycott movement, which on Wednesday called on the actors and actresses to decline the offer.
The trip to Israel, underwritten by the Israeli government, is just one of numerous goodies provided to the nominees. Also included is a walking tour of Japan, a year's worth of unlimited Audi rentals, private fitness sessions and a bizarre item described as a Vampire Breast Lift.
Twenty-six film stars, among them Jennifer Lawrence, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, are eligible for the luxury vacation. "Their visit will have enormous resonance among millions of fans," Tourism Minister Yariv Levin said on Sunday.
But BDS founder and Palestinian activist Omar Barghouti called on the nominees on Wednesday to reject the gift.
“Israel is desperately trying to fight its increasing international isolation through bribes and intimidation rather than by ending its occupation and apartheid,” Barghouti said.
"There are no Hunger Games in Gaza but there is real hunger," he added.
Lash Fary, founder of Distinctive Assets, the company that puts together the bags, said in a press release that this year’s bag is “once again a blend of fabulous, fun and functional items meant to thrill and pamper those who may have everything money can buy but still savor the simple joy of a gift.”
The bags are reportedly worth more than $200,000 each, and are only offered to nominees in the main acting and directing categories.
"In this year of 
OscarsSoWhite and 
FeelTheBern, there is something even more unsavory than usual about this shameless attempt to shower excessive wealth on the excessively wealthy," wrote Matt WIlstein in The Daily Beast.
"When companies feel the need to pay off celebrities who 'have everything money can buy,' then really, no one wins."
As for the Vampire Breast Lift, The Daily Beast describes it as a "procedure which uses blood-derived growth factors to revive rounder cleavage without implants. Women can now also soften implant scars and irregularities (and restore sensation). Using technology used by plastic surgeons for years to help correct post-mastectomy scarring and to heal wounds, the Vampire Breast Lift procedure uses a woman’s own blood to improve appearance."
Now we know.

<title>Netanyahu's 'wild beast' quote was apartheid-speak, says chief Palestinian negotiator</title>
<date>Wed Feb 10 18:52:46 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of "adopting the laws of the jungle" on Wednesday, after the premier said that Israel needed to surround the country with fences and barriers "to defend ourselves against the wild beasts" in neighboring countries.
Netanyahu's statement was "the same as those of the heads of apartheid in South Africa," said Erekat, who is also the general secretary of the PLO.
Netanyahu made his statement on Tuesday, while on a tour of the construction site of a barrier on Israel's eastern border.
"At the end, in the State of Israel, as I see it, there will be a fence that spans it all," said Netanyahu. "I'll be told, 'this is what you want, to protect the villa?' The answer is yes. Will we surround all of the State of Israel with fences and barriers? The answer is yes. In the area that we live in, we must defend ourselves against the wild beasts."
Netanyahu added that the government was preparing a multi-year plan to surround all of Israel with security barriers, as well as a plan to close the breaches in the separation barrier between Israel and the West Bank.
"This thing costs many billions, and we're working on a multi-year plan of prioritization so it would be spread out over years in order to gradually build it, but to complete it to defend the State of Israel," Netanyahu added.

<title>U.K. to bar publicly funded bodies from boycotting Israeli goods </title>
<date>Tue Feb 16 10:06:08 IST 2016</date>
<content>
The British government is set to announce procurement guidelines that will prevent publicly funded bodies from boycotting Israeli goods, the Guardian reported on Monday.
Matthew Hancock, the Cabinet Office minister, will announce the regulations on his upcoming visit to Israel. According to the Guardian, the government is concerned that such boycotts could fuel anti-Semitism.
“We need to challenge and prevent these divisive town hall boycotts," said Hancock about the plans, which were first announced in October. He added that the new guidance "will help prevent damaging and counterproductive local foreign policies undermining our national security.”
The regulations make exempt from boycott any signatory to the World Trade Organization government procurement agreement and provide for potentially severe penalties for violating the guidance. According to the guidance, ministers deem procurement boycotts by public authorities “inappropriate, outside where formal legal sanctions, embargoes and restrictions have been put in place by the government,” the Guardian reported.
The Labour party assailed the plan as restricting democracy and freedom of expression. “This government’s ban would have outlawed council action against apartheid South Africa," a spokesman for party leader Jeremy Corbyn told the Independent. "Ministers talk about devolution, but in practice they’re imposing Conservative party policies on elected local councils across the board.”
The Leicester city council voted in 2014 to boycott goods from Israeli settlements.

<title>Netanyahu asks Britain to remove anti-Israel posters hung in underground trains</title>
<date>Mon Feb 22 19:23:33 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Israel has asked the British government to remove hundreds of pro-Palestinian posters hung in London underground trains over the weekend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday.
The city's transport authority said the posters were unauthorized and would be removed,
“It is fly posting and therefore an act of vandalism which we take extremely seriously," a spokesman for Transport for London said, according to the Evening Standard website.
“Our staff and contractors are working to immediately remove any found on our network.”
The posters were hung by London Palestine Action, a pro-Palestinian activist group, which said it was part of their Israeli Apartheid Week campaign.
“It’s to highlight the illegality of Israel’s occupation of Palestine and the involvement of British companies there,” one of its activists said.
The number of posters hung in the trains is unclear. Estimates range from 100 to 500. In many cases, they were hung on top of existing advertisements.
Many of the posters targeted the BBC, which activists maintain is biased in favor of Israel. Several included mock-ups of BBC reports.
Others targeted security company G4S, which operates some prisons in Israel and the West Bank, according to the Jewish Chronicle. The posters accused the firm of “securing Israeli apartheid” and doing “whatever it takes to secure profits.”
Yet another, which was headlined “Apartheid is Great Britain,” said British-made arms were allegedly being used by Israel in Gaza.
“These posters are awful smears that do nothing to contribute to peace and dialogue, placing significant strains on inter-community relations across London," said a spokesman for the London Jewish Forum.
“They are an act of vandalism, seeking to undermine the UK’s relationship with Israel and designed to foster discomfort. We welcome Transport for London’s commitment to quickly remove them.”
Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid criticized the government for "doing nothing" in response to the posters.
"Since the Israeli government did nothing, as usual - nothing at all - I contacted the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson - a great friend of Israel - and I explained to him that Israel will not tolerate this [propaganda] and that we're asking him to intervene," he told a party meeting.
"Whoever said that we're not taking action is lying," Netanyahu responded. "I spoke earlier with |Foreign Ministry Director General Dori Gold, who is in London, and asked him to demand from the British government that the posters be removed," he told a meeting of his party's Knesset caucus, according to a report in Maariv..

<title>Pro-BDS groups urge Oscar nominees to skip free Israel trip</title>
<date>Thu Feb 25 16:51:43 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Oscar-nominated celebrities were urged on Wednesday to skip a $55,000 trip to Israel offered as part of an awards gift bag.
Two U.S.-based groups campaigning for an end to Israel's occupation of the Palestinian Territories made the plea in a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times that appeared five days before the Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday.
"
SkipTheTrip. Don't endorse Israeli apartheid," said the ad, sponsored by the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation and Jewish Voice for Peace.
The ad said the trip, which is partially paid for by the Israeli government, was part of a larger "'Brand Israel' strategy to distract from almost 50 years of illegal occupation of Palestinian land."
"As was the case many years ago in South Africa, celebrities are being asked to refrain from whitewashing apartheid policies," Yousef Munayyer, executive director of the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, said in a statement on Wednesday.
The trip is one of the most expensive items in a swag bag handed out to the five Oscar-nominated directors and 20 lead and supporting actor and actress nominees, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Sylvester Stallone, Mark Rylance, Cate Blanchett, Jennifer Lawrence, Matt Damon and Kate Winslet.
The gift bag is not affiliated with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organizes the Oscars.
The Academy last week filed a lawsuit against Los Angeles-based Distinctive Assets accusing the gifting group of promoting the bag as official Oscars swag.
The Israeli government earlier this month confirmed it was funding $15,000 to $18,000 of each 10-day trip as a means of offsetting news coverage of the country's troubles.
"These are the most senior people in the film industry in Hollywood and leading opinion-formers who we are interested in hosting," said Israeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin. "They will experience the country first-hand and not through the media."
It was not immediately known whether any of the Oscar-nominated directors, actors and actresses will take up the offer, which must be declared to U.S. tax authorities.
"Creed" supporting actor Stallone signed a pro-Israel petition during the 2104 Gaza war, while "Bridge of Spies" nominee Rylance has signed a petition circulated by Artists for Palestine UK which calls for a cultural boycott of Israel.

<title>Britain reportedly cuts funding for charity behind 'Israeli Apartheid Week' </title>
<date>Sun Apr 03 17:15:08 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
The British government has halted funding to the War on Want charity for its sponsor of events accused of promoting hatred and violence against Jews, the Telegraph reports.
The charity helped pay for Israeli Apartheid Week in February.
War on Want reportedly received some 260,000 pounds ($370,000) from Britain's Department for International Development in the past two years, the newspaper writes.
A spokesman has said that it has ceased funding War on Want, with the exception of a small project in Northern Ireland.
However, in response, War on Want dismissed the report, saying it was a "fabrication."
"War on Want has not sought any U.K. government support for its operations for a number of years now, so it is absurd to suggest that we have had our funding 'pulled,'" said John Hilary, the group's director. "The insinuation that we have been criticized by the government for standing up for the rights of the Palestinian people is equally bogus. We will be contacting the Telegraph to help it set the record straight."
At a rally sponsored by War on Want, a speaker was said to have alleged there was a "rumor" that Israelis were harvesting dead Palestinians' organs, the paper reported.
In a related development, the newspaper says it has obtained undercover recordings of events where academics and others from prestigious universities have expressed anti-Semitism, demands for Israel's destruction, or support for terrorism.

<title>Israeli film on prejudice against Arabs wins Tribeca foreign feature award</title>
<date>Sun Apr 24 11:45:35 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
The film "Junction 48" by Israeli director Udi Aloni about prejudice against Arabs in Israel won Best International Narrative Feature at the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival on Thursday night in New York City, Army Radio reported.
The film follows the story of an Arab rapper as he forges his artistic path in the mixed city of Lod. It deals with anti-Arab bias in Israeli society as well as violence and conservatism among members of its Arab minority. In February, the film won the top audience award at the Berlin International Film Festival. According to Channel 10, the film was produced in part with state funding.
“A heartbreaking portrayal of the intersection of personal and political tragedies, 'Junction 48' questions to what extent music can be dissociated from politics,” a synopsis of the film on the festival’s website read. It will be screened on Sunday at Manhattan’s Regal Cinemas Battery Park 11.
Aloni, the son of the late Meretz party leader Shulamit Aloni, said during the screening that Germany should stop extending military aid to Israel and called its government fascist.
He has said that its government has racial segregation worse than South Africa’s apartheid and opposes its definition as a Jewish state. He also opposes the two-state solution, arguing instead for the creation a country where Israeli Jews and Palestinians from the West Bank, Gaza and Israel would live as part of one nation.  This, he argued in a 2010 interview with Yedioth Achronoth, “would liberate Israel from Zionism.”
“Instead of the dream of a Jewish state, we need to broaden this dream to Jews and Palestinians,” he said in 2010 during a television interview. In it, he also said that Israel “is like Pakistan, which was founded by secular Muslims but gradually became a Taliban state as they lost control of power. The same thing is happening in Israel.”

<title>Lawmaker: If Israel took revenge against Palestinians, Jewish attacks could have been preempted</title>
<date>Fri May 06 19:16:09 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
A leading right-wing lawmaker said Friday that if Israel had pursued appropriate acts of revenge against the Palestinians in the past, it could have prevented subsequent Jewish attacks on Palestinians, including a July 2015 arson attack that killed three members of a Palestinian family.
MK Bezalel Smotrich (Habayit Hayehudi) claimed that revenge is an “important and moral value” that must be carried out only by the state, not by citizens taking the law into their own hands.
Smotrich is no stranger to controversy. His past comments include calling for segregating Jewish and Arab birth-mothers, insisting that the Duma arson was not an act of terrorism, and for organizing the anti-gay "Beast Parade" in 2006.
In the post on Facebook on Friday, Smotrich explained that if the state had taken revenge and deterred the Palestinian enemy, it could have prevented later events such as the arson attack on the Dawabsheh family home in Duma, which killed three people, including an infant boy, or the July 2014 immolation of the Palestinian teenager Mohammed Abu Khdeir in East Jerusalem.
Revenge “has certain ways and goals against which it can be turned,” Smotrich wrote. “It is not given to the individual and cannot be aimed at every target identified with the enemy.”
Smotrich also criticized the government for not taking the initiative for reprisals “in legitimate ways.”
“It is possible to assume that if the State of Israel had not erased, under the influence of twisted Christian morality, the word revenge from its lexicon and had done things in legitimate ways and deterred the enemy, we would not have been faced with these harsh incidents of private individuals taking the law and revenge into their own hands,” he wrote.
In his long and carefully reasoned post, Smotrich made clear that the Abu Khdeir and Dawabsheh murders were not the result of racism, but came from justified aspirations for revenge.
“Steps of revenge are improper. ... The murder of the youth Mohammed Abu Khdeir and the murder in Duma (if it was carried out by Jews) are serious and forbidden, but they do not stem from racism – whose meaning is the hatred of the other only because they are different – or from the desire of someone in Israeli society to destroy the Arab people. They reflect anger and a desire for revenge, justified in their own right, on the basis of the hostility and war of annihilation the Arabs are conducting against us,” he added.
Smotrich called such acts of revenge a mistake and even a crime, noting that whoever commits such acts must be punished.
“If the Arabs had not fought against us, not a single Arab would have been killed here. If the Arabs had not murdered us night and day, not a single Jew here would have wanted to harm them. War is a bad thing, and during it we are required sometimes to take unpleasant defensive measures. It happens sometimes that mistakes are made as part of it, and even difficult mistakes that are almost criminal. But it is light years away from racism and apartheid,” wrote Smotrich.
Smotrich also addressed the speech by IDF Deputy Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Yair Golan on Holocaust Remembrance Day, in which Golan seemingly compared recent developments in Israeli society to events that unfolded in Europe before the Holocaust.
“Really, truly, there is no connection whatsoever between negative phenomena that occur today in Israel – and which, it seems, the deputy chief of staff referred to – and the Holocaust and its lessons.
“Marking with a yellow star and limitations on movement and place of residence were one of the signs of Nazi anti-Semitism in Germany. Racial segregation on buses and in schools were signs of the unacceptable apartheid policies in the United States and South Africa. Erecting barriers, placing limits on movement and the separation on buses conducted in [the West Bank] between Jews and Arabs for security reasons resulting from the situation of war that exists here, even though from a technical aspect there are similarities between these and the previous examples, are something completely different. That the same sun shone here and in Germany does not mean the Nazis and we are the same,” wrote Smotrich.

Social media users took up the gauntlet laid down by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, flooding his 
AskNetanyahu hashtag with negative comments.
"Ever wanted to ask me a question? Now's your chance!" the 
AskNetanyahu page proclaimed, inviting people to tweet their questions for a live Q&A session at 3:30 P.M. Israel time, just ahead of Israel's Memorial Day and Independence Day.
Almost immediately, the hashtag was flooded with accusations of Israel being an apartheid or terrorist state. User sent questions like "When will Israel stop murdering children?" or "When are you going to end illegal settlement on West Bank & end the occupation of Palestinian land?"  Some questions focused on problems in Israeli society like, "Why are so many Holocaust survivors living in poverty in Israel despite you scrounging over $3 billion from the US?" One user took a more humorous tone. Raz asked, "Who do you identify with the most: Voldemort, Darth Vader or Hannibal Lecter?"
Netanyahu did have his share of supporters. "@IsraeliPM love this great man," wrote Carolyn G, while Yoel Mukalay chimed in, "the only question I can have, how is it that some people can't appreciate you!? You are the right man on the right place."
According to Middle East Eye, the failure of the 
AskNetanyahu campaign "harks back to a failed Hamas campaign in March 2015," in which the 
AskHamas hashtag drew "more ridicule and abuse than genuine questions."

<title>Amid Israeli Independence Day celebrations, thousands of Arabs rally to mark Nakba </title>
<date>Thu May 12 18:05:17 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Thousands of Arab Israelis marked Nakba Day on Wednesday with a march near the Negev Bedouin town of Rahat, the main event of which was a mass vow to preserve Bedouin lands and not to concede the “right of return.”
Nabka Day, which commemorates the flight or expulsion of more than 700,000 Arabs during Israel’s War of Independence in 1947-49, is usually observed on Israeli Independence Day as well as its official date of May 15. The right of return refers to the Palestinian demand that both the original Palestinian refugees and all their descendants be allowed to resettle in Israel.
Wednesday’s event was attended by Arab Knesset members, the heads of the Higher Arab Monitoring Committee, which constitutes the unofficial leadership of the Israeli Arab community, and thousands of people displaced from their original villages by the War of Independence.
“For the Palestinians, the Nabka isn’t just a historical event, but a personal wound in the heart of every refugee and displaced person,” said Mohammed Barakeh, head of the Higher Arab Monitoring Committee, at the event. “People didn’t flee, as some claim, but were uprooted. Yet even if they fled, they fled out of fear and suspicion, due to the crimes that were committed. And this doesn’t cancel out their right to return.”
“What happened in the Nakba was a crime of slaughter and displacement, and it’s impossible to correct this injustice without ensuring the right of return,” he continued. “What’s happening today is clear. Israel is degenerating into an apartheid state, but still, the world praises Israeli democracy.”
MK Ayman Odeh, chairman of the Joint Arab List, sounded a similar note in his speech. “The question of the Nakba isn’t a question of the past, but a question of the future,” he said. “Recognizing the Nakba, this terrible crime, and working to correct the injustice is the only path to true reconciliation between the two peoples.
“I’d like to stress the importance of our being here in the Negev today to mark the Nabka and express our determination to demand recognition of the injustices that were done and achievement of a just solution that will ensure the people’s rights,” he added.
Gadi Algazi, a history professor at Tel Aviv University, told the gathering that anyone who manages to make the public forget the Nakba and the right of return would also be ignoring the Gaza Strip with its large population of Palestinian refugees. It is impossible to talk about a peace agreement without negotiating over the refugee problem and the right of return of the refugees to what is now Israel, he said. 
Sources at the National Committee for the Defense of the Uprooted, which has organized the march in support of the right of return for the past 19 years, said the decision to hold the events in the Negev this year is also meant to convey the message that the Israeli Arab public has concerns about the situation in Israel's south and over government plans to resettle Bedouin living in unauthorized communities in the region.

<title>Ehud Barak’s top 12 zingers and putdowns of Netanyahu and Co.</title>
<date>Fri Jun 17 04:21:07 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
1. “Who, in the name of God, authorized Netanyahu and his government to take us to the edge of the abyss with their continuous, deceptive and calming murmur that supposedly broadcasts the complete opposite?”
2. “For over a year we have been led by a prime minister and a government who are weak, feeble and clamorous, deceitful and extreme, who have failed again and again.”
3. “Obtuse extremism, hubris and blindness have taken control of the prime minister and the government of Israel, in the name of an ostensibly hidden agenda with a touch of messianism. It is dragging us all into an moral and functional abyss, the bottom of which cannot be fathomed.”
4. “There’s been a hostile takeover. A fanatic core of extreme ideology has taken control of the Likud and purged the party leadership of anyone who preferred democratic values over populism or momentary gain. Netanyahu bears responsibility for the actions of his ‘hijacked’ government and its failures, whether it’s because of his weakness of will or personality, a ‘Stockholm Syndrome’ or his own positions, inspired by his family and his close circle.”
5. “The prime minister’s Hitlerization of the transient regional threats, dangerous as they may be, is Holocaust degradation at its worst.’
6. “We are at the beginning of a road that will lead to an inevitable aftermath like Belfast/Bosnia or old Johannesburg – perhaps all three of them together – through blindness, internal strife and stupefaction that can rival only the tragedies that peer at us from archeological remains, the pages of the Talmud and [Josephus Flavius’] “The Jewish War.”
7. “The hidden agenda will inevitably create one state, which will either be an ‘apartheid state’ that will face resistance from those it controls and be ostracized by the entire world and ultimately collapse. Or it will be a binational state with a minority of Jews in a generation or two, which will most likely descend into a protracted civil war between its two sides.”
8. “At the top of their true agenda, Netanyahu and his government don’t have the country’s security, safeguarding democracy or internal unity, but rather a devious and creeping advancement of a ‘one-state’ agenda, from the Jordan to the sea, which constitutes a direct threat to the very identity and future of Israel and the entire Zionist project.”
9. “In world capitals, in London and Washington, in Berlin and Paris, in Moscow and Beijing – no leader believes even one word from Netanyahu and his government. The government’s hidden agenda will enlist the entire world against us, undermine Israeli society and tear it from within and sever us from the young generation of American Jews.”
10. “Out of reckless frivolity, Netanyahu squandered a rare opportunity to anchor generous force-building agreements with the United States [following the Iran deal]. In my opinion we will get $7-10 billion less than we might have gotten last year.”
11. “Why do we see in the government and its leader pessimism, passivity, anxiety, paralysis – instead of self-confidence, courage and a determination to act? Wailing victimhood steeped in self-pity, instead of pride in every Israeli’s heart? Division and discord, incitement of one against the other, instead of genuine fostering of national unity as well as the right to disagree? Preferential treatment for ‘big money’ instead of the citizen, his family, his right to earn a living and the future of his children? Rabble-rousing and brutalization rather than a tolerant and attentive discourse that recognizes the numerous varieties and culture that we harbor?”
12. “Only a blind, disingenuous, ignorant or kowtowing person will fail to recognize that the [government’s proposed laws] are a process of eroding democracy and the roots of fascism that have taken hold in this government. If it looks like the roots of fascism and walks like the roots of fascism and barks like the roots of fascism, then it is the roots of fascism.”

<title>Will Marwan Barghouti be the Palestinian Nelson Mandela?</title>
<date>Tue Jul 05 02:20:21 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
1. RAMALLAH, 2002
On April 15, Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz called the defense minister, Benjamin Ben-Eliezer. “The Shin Bet has tracked him down. We know where he’s hiding,” Mofaz told the minister.
“I don’t want him liquidated – just arrest him,” Ben-Eliezer implored Mofaz. In his view, the most-wanted individual would be the next leader of the Palestinians, after the Yasser Arafat era.
“If he tries to resist and fight, we will shoot him,” Mofaz told his boss, “but I’m willing to bet he will give up without a fight. He has no guts.”
In the months before he was located, Marwan Barghouti behaved like a hunted man. “We tried to eliminate him twice, we wasted his people right and left,” Avi Dichter, the head of the Shin Bet security service at the time, told Haaretz.
On March 29, 2002, the IDF launched Operation Defensive Shield, to conquer the Palestinian cities in the West Bank. The month that heralds spring would be remembered in Israel as “Black March”: 110 civilians and soldiers were killed in terrorist attacks, mostly in suicide bombings.
After the army took control of Ramallah again, Marwan Barghouti, a member of the Palestinian parliament, secretary general of Fatah and leader of the Tanzim militia – the “chief of staff of the intifada,” from Israel’s point of view – disappeared as though the earth had swallowed him up. “We were told something we rarely heard,” Capt. A., from the undercover Duvdevan unit told Haaretz, “namely that the order to capture him was a directive of the prime minister, Ariel Sharon.”
Wiretapping revealed that Barghouti was hiding in a safe house. The commander of the army’s Ramallah Brigade at the time, Brig. Gen. (res.) Ilan Paz, told Haaretz: “When the intelligence arrived that he was in a building in the heart of a Ramallah neighborhood, [forces from] an armored brigade surrounded the site and the baton was passed to me. The Duvdevan unit was under my command. We understood that he was in the building. One of the soldiers saw him through the window, taking cover close to what looked to us, at least, like an old woman who was lying on a bed. We removed everyone from the building. I called the division commander, Yitzhak Gershon, and told him that if I were in his place, I would reconsider the whole matter.
“To take a political leader into captivity is no trifling matter,” Paz continued. “At the end of the day, he had not murdered anyone with his own hands. I wondered to myself about the need for the operation, which might end with him being killed. The reply I got was: ‘Moving ahead.’ In cases like these we implemented the ‘pressure-cooker’ procedure. You gradually degrade the event, in order not to risk soldiers’ lives, until antitank fire is directed at the house or bulldozers are called in. In this case, the event ended when we went, armed and with dogs, to the door of the building in which he was hiding. He came out, looking frightened.”
Gershon, the division commander, took Barghouti’s hand and led him out of the apartment building. “I put him in the command car,” Gershon related in a conversation with Haaretz. “I took out my canteen and gave him water. He was kind of flipped out. Very frightened. I said to him: Don’t worry. We will not do to you what you would have done to us.”
Added Gershon: “In my opinion, he should be released unconditionally at this point. And not as a collaborator with us, but as someone who will see to the [future of the] Palestinian people, if there is even a small chance that he may become a leading figure on the other side. I say this even though I know he has blood on his hands, as the leader of the Tanzim in the second intifada. Peace is made with powerful enemies whose honor has not been trampled.”
‘The myth will grow’
The army officers who captured Barghouti are convinced that he should now be set free. The same view was held by Ehud Barak. Shortly after Barghouti was captured and taken in for interrogation by the Shin Bet, Barak – the prime minister at the time the second intifada erupted, but by then a private citizen – spoke to Chief of Staff Mofaz. “Have you lost your mind? What’s the story with Barghouti?” Barak asked rhetorically. “If it’s part of your struggle against terrorism, it’s meaningless. But if it’s part of a grand plan to make him a future national leader of the Palestinians, then it’s a brilliant scheme, because what’s really missing in his résumé is direct affiliation with terrorism. He will fight for the leadership from inside prison, not having to prove a thing. The myth will grow constantly by itself.”
Prime Minister Sharon, who gave the order to kill or arrest Barghouti, agreed to free him for a different reason: as part of a potential deal with the Americans in return for the release of the spy Jonathan Pollard. But that didn’t work out. Yuval Diskin, deputy chief of the Shin Bet during the intifada, said in private conversations that Barghouti’s release was definitely possible as one step within the framework of negotiations with the Palestinians. (Diskin did not reply to a query from Haaretz on the subject.)
In contrast, former Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon, who was deputy chief of staff at the time of Barghouti’s capture, believes that his place remains in prison. That opinion is shared by Avi Dichter, who headed the shadow organization that came up with the information about Barghouti’s whereabouts. “When I was head of the Shin Bet,” he says, “there were ministers in the Sharon government who tried to pressure me to take a stand in favor of his release. I told them not to bother. A very senior Israeli political figure described him to me as ‘Mandela.’ [Former Meretz leader] Haim Oron saw him as the future of the Palestinian nation. I told them all that he had bought his leadership with the blood of Jews.”
The Israeli civilian and military leadership that was dealing with the second intifada was thus split on the fraught question of whether to release Barghouti. But that entire story is but a promo to the drama that could ensue when the current Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) steps down. Ill, tired and faring disastrously in the polls (65 percent of the Palestinian public wants him to go), Abbas might declare his resignation soon. “He has no support,” says Yossi Beilin, who co-authored a draft peace agreement with Abbas in 1995. “He is functioning as in other regimes that we know: by means of presidential edicts, loyal security forces and a significant diminishment of human rights. His regime is weak, and therefore the circumstances of his leaving are not necessarily related to the state of his health.”
In the meantime, Barghouti has already announced that if Abbas steps down and a presidential election is held, he will run from his cell in Hadarim Prison, near Haifa, where he is serving five life sentences. .
“He [Barghouti] has been well ahead of his rivals in every public opinion poll conducted in recent years,” Dr. Khalil Shkaki, director of the Ramallah-based Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, told Haaretz. In the center’s most recent poll, conducted this month with the participation of 1,200 interviewees in the West Bank and Gaza, support for Barghouti stood at 40 percent, as compared with 20 percent for Abbas and 35 percent for senior Hamas figure Ismail Haniyeh.
In a poll conducted last March, which posited a scenario of an election fought between Barghouti and Haniyeh, the former received 57 percent, the latter 39 percent. The poll found that in a contest between Haniyeh and Abbas, the Gaza-based leader would win handily, by 52 percent to 41 percent.
According to Shkaki, it’s important to bear in mind that the majority of the Palestinian public doesn’t believe that an election will be held anytime soon. Nevertheless, he says, in a scenario in which Abbas’ term suddenly ends, Fatah and PLO institutions will have to take immediate steps to bring about the election of a successor. “There is no doubt that Marwan Barghouti is in a better opening position than any other candidate,” Shkaki concludes.
Mass nonviolence
Even if he wakes up to a prison rollcall every morning for the rest of his life, Barghouti today appears to present a complete conceptual alternative to Abbas when it comes to key issues: reconciliation with Hamas, the immediate cessation of security cooperation with Israel, Palestinian Authority support for nonviolent mass protest against Israel and a boycott of Israeli goods. Barghouti thinks that the “intifada of knives” is a fatal mistake. In a conversation via a mediator who visited him in prison in late June, he told Haaretz that a popular protest should encompass hundreds of thousands of people from all the Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The protest has to be persistent and systematic, in order to create international pressure on Israel to return to the negotiating table and end the occupation.
“There is readiness for a struggle among the Palestinian people; they need someone to lead them,” Barghouti told his interlocutor. “I still unequivocally support the idea of two states for two nations. The PA can proceed in one of two directions today: to serve as an instrument of liberation from the occupation, or to be an instrument that validates the occupation. My task is to restore the PA to its role as an instrument of national liberation.”
Barghouti is regularly visited by Arab Knesset members, some of whom see him as a future leader. “He has an 86-percent support rating among the Palestinians,” says MK Ayman Odeh, head of the Joint List of Arab parties. Odeh recently brought Barghouti the massive 1999 biography of Nelson Mandela by the British journalist and writer Anthony Sampson.
MK Jamal Zahalka, chairman of the Balad party, a faction within of the Joint List, visited Barghouti a week ago and relates that the latter viewed the collective run of the Arabs in the last Knesset election as a model for emulation, “for his aspiration to unite Fatah and Hamas in a nonviolent protest revolution. He is the best candidate for president. He has an enlightened worldview about women’s rights, for example,” Zahalka notes.
Barghouti’s close friend and lawyer, Elias Sabbagh, visits him weekly. Last week they met at Gilboa Prison, to which Barghouti was abruptly moved when the Hadarim Prison authorities received “intelligence information about a planned disciplinary infraction,” according to an Israel Prison Service source.
“For Barghouti, the nonviolent struggle is an instrument, and not a goal,” Sabbagh explains, “as long as the settlements continue to be built and Jerusalem to be Judaized. He told me that negotiations are possible if Israel expresses readiness to end the occupation and return to the 1967 lines within a time frame of a year.”
But Barghouti is pessimistic about that happening in the foreseeable future. “No de Gaulle or de Klerk has yet arisen in Israel,” he noted from his cell.
A document in Haaretz’s possession, which was drawn up by the intelligence department of the IPS, states that Barghouti “initiated, taught and institutionalized the idea of underground academic studies for security prisoners, recruiting Arab universities for this goal. The prisoner is in ongoing contact with political figures in Fatah on the outside by various means, including visits by lawyers who are a conduit for receiving and transmitting messages and dealing with coordination on his part. The prisoner was involved in organizing and coordinating violent and active protest measures against the IPS, mass hunger strikes … This prisoner has a senior status within and outside the detention facility, he is a self-styled candidate for the leadership of Fatah, and as such is a subject of interest on the part of figures in the Israeli political arena and elsewhere.”
2. RAMALLAH, 2016
“The idea is to mobilize hundreds of thousands of people, who will march to Jerusalem,” former PA Minister Qadura Fares tells us as he stubs out another Rothmans cigarette. Fares is considered a close associate of Barghouti, his representative on the outside. He too is very familiar with Israeli prisons, having spent 15 years in them for his membership in a Fatah armed squad. He was released in the wake of the Oslo accords. Recently, the journalist Avi Issacharoff revealed the existence of understandings that were reached earlier this year between Fares and senior Fatah officials close to Barghouti, and Hamas, concerning the renewal of the Palestinian struggle in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi.
“Another way is for tens of thousands of people to sit on the bypass roads [in the West Bank] from dawn to sunset,” Fares says. “And let’s say a settler fell into the hands of the masses? There is no need to harm him, only to say to him: ‘Leave this place.’ I am talking about an intensive popular revolution that will disrupt the settlers’ lives. I want to play chess with my friends? We will sit on the road. Someone wants to have a wedding celebration? It will be held on a bypass road.”
You have consistently failed to conduct a nonviolent struggle, and instead were tempted into suicide attacks.
Fares: “Okay. It will require a few months of training and preparation. But I can reveal to you that all the people I have spoken with in the top ranks of Hamas agree to the idea of an intensive, nonviolent mass protest.”
A photograph in Fares’ office shows Barghouti, in a prison uniform, powerfully gripping the hands of a young prisoner named Thaer Hamed, the two of them flashing victory smiles. Here they are, the two symbols of the second intifada.
At 6 A.M. on March 3, 2002, Hamed lay in ambush on a hill overlooking an army checkpoint in Wadi Haramiya, between Ramallah and Nablus. Armed with an old Mauser rifle, he shot and killed seven IDF soldiers and three civilians, before escaping and becoming a folk hero in the territories. Legends arose about the identity of the mysterious sniper, who was not arrested until two years later. “In my eyes he is a hero, like all the Palestinian prisoners,” Fares told us. “He killed soldiers who caused suffering and humiliation to tens of thousands of Palestinians, and he vanquished them with one outmoded weapon.”
How do you resolve the contradiction between admiring the sniper and urging nonviolent protest? Are we to conclude that you believe the second intifada was a mistake?
Fares: “In the course of our history, we have fought with our blood far more than with our heads.”
International struggle
Attorney Fadwa Barghouti, the prisoner’s wife, has an office on the sixth floor of a gleaming office building in the center of Ramallah. On the walls are photographs of and paintings by her jailed husband. Since Barghouti’s incarceration, Fadwa has managed a PA-financed fund whose purpose is to create international pressure to bring about his release and in general to cultivate his myth, which has much in common with the aura that developed around Mandela in South Africa. She travels widely, meeting with foreign ministers and shapers of public opinion.
The campaign for Barghouti’s release was launched in 2013 from Nelson Mandela’s cell on Robben Island, in South Africa, where many leaders of the anti-apartheid struggle were imprisoned. Squeezed with Fadwa Barghouti in the tiny cell on the occasion was Ahmed Kathrada, another fighter against the racist regime, who also served an extended sentence in the prison. 
Signing the Robben Island declaration calling for Barghouti’s release were eight Nobel Peace Prize laureates, including former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Desmond Tutu, himself a veteran of the South African campaign. This year, Tutu sent a letter to the Nobel committee, urging it to bestow the Peace Prize on Barghouti. Adolfo Perez Esquivel, the Argentine human-rights activist who himself won that prize in 1980, together with several Belgian members of parliament, has also proposed that the prize be given to the man now serving five life sentences in Israel, after being convicted of murder – noting his commitment to democracy, human rights and equality between men and women. 
In his first years of imprisonment her husband was in solitary confinement and she was not allowed to see him, with the exception of one dramatic visit that was authorized by the bureau of Prime Minister Sharon. In recent years, she has been allowed two 45-minute visits a month. Phone calls are prohibited. She brings him books he requests (she’s allowed to bring one book a month). In addition to obsessive reading of books (eight to 10 a month, according to his confidants, including, recently, David Landau’s biography of Sharon), he has a subscription to Haaretz English Edition, watches the daily current-events program “London and Kirschenbaum” and Israeli newscasts religiously, exercises in the small courtyard and gives talks to prisoners.
Marwan Barghouti was born in Kobar, a small village near Ramallah, in 1959. He was arrested for the first time at age 15, for taking part in demonstrations against the occupation. In 1978, at age 19, he was tried and sentenced to five years in an Israeli prison for being a member of Fatah squads. During his prison term he completed his high-school studies. After his release he married Fadwa, a distant relative; their wedding was postponed time and again because of Barghouti’s frequent interrogations and arrests. “He wasn’t by my side in any of the births of my four children,” Fadwa Barghouti relates. The couple’s firstborn was named Qassam, after Iz al-Din al-Qassam, a pioneer of the Palestinian national struggle.
Barghouti studied political science at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank and was elected chairman of the student union. “In those years he lived between interrogation and arrest, an underground life,” his wife says. “The university was the core of national Palestinian agitation.”
In May 1987, Barghouti was expelled to Jordan. His deportation, along with some of the university’s leaders, was meant to be an Israeli “preemptive strike,” to contain ferment. However, seven months after the wave of arrests, the first intifada erupted, stunning the Shin Bet and the Israeli intelligence community – and Yasser Arafat and the PLO leadership in Tunis, as well. Fadwa Barghouti joined her husband, and their family moved back and forth between Jordan and Tunisia. According to a former senior Shin Bet official, during the intifada, there was at least one case of the murder of a settler that showed involvement by Barghouti, who was in Jordan at the time.
In 1994, following the signing of the Oslo Accords and the advent of PLO leadership in the Gaza Strip, Israel allowed Barghouti to return.
“In contrast to others, he really and truly believed that Oslo would be a five-year period after which the Palestinian state would be established,” Fadwa Barghouti recalls. “But the assassination of [Prime Minister Yitzhak] Rabin caused tremendous damage to the process. After the rise to power of [Benjamin] Netanyahu, he understood that the process would not be realized. Contrary to your description, Barak’s offer at Camp David was not generous. The growth in settlement construction and the building of the bypass roads showed us that you had no interest in reaching an agreement.
“My and Marwan’s generation still harbors a spark of a hope that the conflict will end with a two-state solution,” she adds. “My children don’t believe in that; they aspire to a single, democratic state.”
In the period between Oslo and the second intifada, Barghouti forged an extensive network of social ties with Israeli politicians. One of Barghouti’s close friends at the time was Haim Ramon, a former cabinet minister.
“We used to meet every week, usually on Fridays in Tel Aviv,” Ramon recalls. “He was one of the most moderate figures in the PA. He told me then that it was possible to conclude an agreement, including the refugee issue. In our conversations, he said that it was clear that not one refugee would return to Israel, other than those in the camps in Lebanon, who he said were the most wretched of all. He had a pathological hatred of the settlers. In the second intifada, he adopted terrorism. After he was jailed, I received messages from him in the spirit of, ‘Why doesn’t Ramon come to visit me?’
“There is no doubt that he will be the next Palestinian president,” continues Ramon. “He’s the consensus. He is very much accepted by Hamas. When that happens, strong international pressure will be exerted on Israel, which will be forced to release him.”
In 1996, the first election for the Palestinian parliament, the Legislative Council, was held. “At that time, Barghouti issued leaflets in favor of the political process, Oslo and an agreement, but that was an anomalous, one-time case,” says Dr. Matti Steinberg, an expert on Palestinian politics and an adviser to four Shin Bet directors. “Barghouti’s life embodies the hope and the disappointment in a political agreement with Israel. I anticipate a crisis in the wake of Abu Mazen’s departure, after which they will call on the savior from prison. We may well see a development similar to what happened in South Africa: a Palestinian leader in prison. That is a very dangerous situation, which will lead to international pressure for his release.”
During Barghouti’s years of flirtation with the Zionist left, he occasionally made statements that fractured his image as an optimal partner, and perhaps augured the future. Examples are his suggestion to the Palestinian parliament to send condolences to the family of a terrorist who blew himself up in Café Apropos in Tel Aviv in 1997, and a reference to the Gaza-based bomb-maker, Yahya Ayyash, known as “the Engineer,” as a shahid, or martyr for the cause. “It is an internal Palestinian discourse,” Barghouti explained to Israelis who felt he was deceiving them. In those years he established the Tanzim, a political organization that reflected the status of the local population as against the suited, cigar-smoking figures who arrived from Tunis.
“The Tunis group viewed us as soldiers, and Marwan wanted them to see us as partners,” Qadura Fares notes about the internecine feud within Fatah. “He had been deported and was familiar with both worlds, so he was acquainted first-hand with the huge disparity between the standard of living of the leadership in Tunis and the poverty in the territories. He fought for equality and democratization. He worked to integrate people from the territories into the PA apparatus.”
Barghouti opposed the security mechanisms created by Arafat, and accused their chiefs publicly of thuggery and corruption.
“His office in Ramallah was a residence, with children peeing in the stairwell. That was the setting he chose in order to underscore the fact that he came from the ordinary people,” says the journalist Danny Rubinstein, who was a close friend of Barghouti’s. “The Tanzim was a civilian militia loyal to him. He was the major opposition to the Tunis group. That was his political calling card, and it was meant to take him to the leadership after Arafat. He was totally in favor of an agreement. I met with him two days before he went into hiding and the hunt for him began. It was in the lobby of the Park Hotel, in Ramallah. He told me that the place might be blown up – he was afraid that he was about to be liquidated.”
In 2000, on the eve of the Camp David conference, Barghouti declared that, “Arafat does not have the right to forgo the refugees’ right of return.” The conference ended in failure, with Ehud Barak declaring that there was “no partner” for peace. Two months later, on September 28, 2000, MK Ariel Sharon, the leader of the opposition, visited the Temple Mount. Riots broke out across the territories. The IDF, which in the months preceding Camp David had trained for a Palestinian-initiated war, reacted aggressively.
“Initially, the proportion of those killed was 15:1 against the Palestinians,” former Shin Bet director Diskin noted in an interview with the Channel 10 program “The Source,” which dealt with the lessons of the second intifada. Diskin disagreed with the claim by the heads of the IDF that the Palestinians had planned a war.
But the IDF’s two top officers at the time, Mofaz and Ya’alon, put forward a narrative suggesting just that. They claimed that the so-called Al-Aqsa intifada had been planned long before and that Sharon’s visit to the Temple Mount was only an excuse. A few months earlier, Barghouti had lost to Hussein a-Sheikh in the election for Fatah secretary general. Arafat ignored the results. Ya’alon was convinced that it was a sly, deliberate move by Arafat, who had designated Barghouti – considered a charismatic, militant figure – to lead the intifada. The deputy chief of staff saw a clear portent of things to come in the events in 2000 that marked the Nakba (what Palestinians regard as “the catastrophe” of the establishment of Israel in 1948), which were spearheaded by Barghouti, a few months before the Camp David summit. During the commemoration of the Nakba in demonstrations that continued for three days, stones and Molotov cocktails were thrown at soldiers. Eight Palestinians died in the subsequent exchanges of fire between Israeli troops and Tanzim militiamen. To this day, Ya’alon is convinced that this was the promo, and that Barghouti was then, and more particularly during the intifada, “Arafat’s alter-ego.”
Arafat’s right hand
Three days before Sharon’s visit to the Temple Mount, and the subsequent outbreak of disturbances in the territories, Carmi Gillon, a former Shin Bet director who was then head of the Peres Center for Peace, met with Barghouti in the lobby of the Hyatt Hotel in Jerusalem, in order to plan joint projects for Israeli and Palestinian youth.
“He didn’t look like someone who was spending his nights planning the intifada and his days in initiating peace projects,” Gillon recalls. “My impression was that he advocated an agreement. The eruption of the intifada surprised him, as it did Arafat. And then he rode the tiger. Barghouti understood that the political track of supporting an agreement would not help him to become leader. There is no doubt that he is very much liked by the people and is a serious candidate for president. We had a clear interest to release him. There is nothing to release him for now, because there is no momentum toward an agreement.”
This line is endorsed by another former Shin Bet head, Ami Ayalon: “In the first week of the intifada, Barghouti and his associates were as surprised as everyone else. The Shin Bet’s analysis was spot on: It was a popular uprising. And then, he [Barghouti] started to shape the operative and political logic of the second intifada. He became Arafat’s right-hand man and he believed that the intifada was the way to reach the goal of two states for two nations. When I was a cabinet minister in the government of Ehud Olmert, I told [the prime minister], during the negotiations on the release of [kidnapped soldier Gilad] Shalit, that we should release as many prisoners as possible who were Fatah assets, and above all, Barghouti. Olmert wasn’t cut out to listen to ideas of that kind.”
In the early days of the second intifada, Barghouti led mass demonstrations. When the confrontations escalated, he declared, “The time when only we sacrifice victims is past. We must take revenge. We must kill Israelis. Yes. We have bullets. We have rifles, and they will be aimed at the occupation.”
He was then considered the leader of the militant stream. Some senior IDF personnel claimed at the time that he overshadowed Arafat in his power and influence, and that the Tanzim he led were armed, contrary to the Oslo Accords. “Maybe you can send him to Alaska for a few weeks for a cooling-off period?” Foreign Minister Shimon Peres suggested to Arafat in a meeting.
Subsequently, the Shin Bet received intelligence to the effect that Barghouti, through people loyal to him in the Tanzim and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, provided funding and arms that were used in a series of terrorist attacks in the territories against soldiers and settlers. A Greek monk was killed because assassins mistook him for someone else.
“The second intifada started as a popular struggle, and the Israeli army drowned it in blood,” Qadura Fares tells us in his Ramallah office. “We attended funerals in which people called on Barghouti to take revenge. Marwan, a leader with direct ties to the grass roots, could not ignore those calls, as opposed to the behavior of members of the [Fatah] Central Committee [such as Abbas]. He understood that a serious competitor to Fatah had arisen in the form of Hamas. Marwan wanted to keep Fatah strong. He was 100 percent coordinated with Arafat in the second intifada. That doesn’t mean that they sat up at night planning every detail. Barghouti understood what Arafat wanted, from hints and body language. If Arafat had wanted to stop the shooting, it would have stopped.”
Probably the most highly charged moment of the second intifada came in January 2002. The American envoy Gen. Anthony Zinni had arrived in Israel a few weeks earlier and negotiated a cease-fire, which collapsed when the IDF assassinated Raad al-Karmi, from the Tanzim, by means of a bomb. Karmi, who had carried out dozens of terrorist attacks against Israelis, was on his way to his lover at the time. The assassination, which provoked a fierce debate within the Israeli defense establishment, led to Black March and Operation Defensive Shield in April. Barghouti, who had been Karmi’s patron, called for revenge. Some Tanzim attacks were perpetrated within the Green Line, including the shooting of three people at Tel Aviv’s Sea Food Market restaurant. Barghouti would later claim that he had given instructions that the attacks be carried out only in the West Bank.
This was the juncture at which the decision was made to intensify the effort either to arrest or assassinate the No. 1 wanted Palestinian.
After his arrest, Barghouti underwent intensive interrogation by Shin Bet agents “Mofaz” and “Smith.” The memoranda that the interrogators wrote to sum up the conversation with Barghouti constitute his narrative about the origins of the second intifada.
“It was meant to be popular in character, and I was among its initiators,” he admitted. “But things lurched out of control.” Sharon’s visit to the Temple Mount “was only the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he maintained, and went on to list the factors that led the Palestinians to foment disturbances: “Expansion of the settlements, loss of hope in the wake of the failure at Camp David, loss of hope for independence and Arafat’s failure to bring it about, the corruption of the PA and the refugee problem.”
Barghouti admitted to the interrogators that his involvement in the violence was partly due to the power struggle in the Palestinian street, “in order to force out Hamas and Islamic Jihad,” and inter-generational struggles for control among the Fatah leadership.
From his point of view, he said, the violence was not a strategic but a tactical move that was intended to bring about the Palestinian state. “The second intifada,” he predicted, “will be the last round of violence, because the Palestinians have a feeling that they restored their self-respect through the attacks. A balance was created between the sides, as happened to Israel with [Egypt’s President] Anwar Sadat after the Yom Kippur War.”
He told the interrogators that he assumed full responsibility for the Fatah attacks, but not for those inside Israel, to which he was adamantly opposed.
In his long conversations with Shin Bet agents, Barghouti showed himself to be an ambitious, calculating politician. He took part in the cycle of blood, he related, in part so that “in the future, he would be able to say of himself that he acted for peace and also in war, whereas other leaders did not dirty their hands. Thus he would gain the sympathy of the Palestinian people.”
The interrogators noted that “the interrogee has a well-developed sense of humor and regaled us with several amazing jokes.”
They were probably not referring to the following remark that he made: “I will soon be released in a prisoner exchange, like in the Jibril deal of 1985.”
Four months after his arrest, the state accused Barghouti of involvement in 37 terrorist attacks and acts of terror. The justice minister at the time, Meir Sheetrit, suggested that his trial, in a civilian court, be televised, “like the Eichmann trial” (which was broadcast live on the radio). Barghouti declined to defend himself or summon witnesses, claiming vehemently that he did not recognize Israel’s right to try him. He was convicted on five counts of murder and sentenced to five cumulative life terms in prison plus 40 years for attempted murder and membership in a terrorist organization.
The judges found that Barghouti had led terrorist squads of the Tanzim and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, provided the squad commanders with funds and arms, and in a number of cases had approved the attacks in advance. “I thought that his trial was very problematic for Israel,” Ami Ayalon says, adding, “If I believed in conspiracy theories, I would think that possibly it was an Israeli conspiracy aimed at forging a leader who believes in the two-state solution. But I had a professor at Harvard who said that conspiracy theories should always be left to the end as a last resort. Most of what we see is random or dumb.”
Beilin agrees that “the trial was a mistake,” noting that “even the presiding judge, Sara Sirota, thought it was wrong. The trial turned him into Mandela, and Barghouti is not Mandela. He’s a street cat who in large measure was behind the second intifada. He thought he could control the flames, but no one ever controls any flame.”
Postmortem
Following Yasser Arafat’s death, in November 2004, Mahmoud Abbas, who opposed the path of armed struggle followed by Arafat and Barghouti, was appointed his temporary successor. From his isolation cell, Barghouti declared that he himself intended to run for president. Information reached the Israeli leadership that the two people closest to Barghouti – his wife Fadwa and Qadura Fares – were opposed to the idea, and they convinced him to withdraw. Unusually, the Prime Minister’s Office allowed the two to visit Barghouti, who had been in total isolation in the Be’er Sheva Prison for two years. “I went to see him at Abu Mazen’s request. Today I admit that I made a mistake when I pressured him not to run,” Fares admits, and recalls the dialogue between them.
Fares: Marwan, let’s say that on January 10, 2005, we get up in the morning and you are the president of Palestine. What will you do for us? You are in solitary here in Be’er Sheva.
Barghouti: And what will Abu Mazen do?
Fares: I am under no illusions that Abu Mazen will succeed in establishing Palestine. But he can rehabilitate the home after the destruction of the intifada, rebuild the institutions, promote democracy and continue the political process.
Barghouti: Remember, Qadura, the Israelis will not give us anything. They will not allow you to achieve anything.
Fares: Why?
Barghouti: When a leader has only one option, there is no reason for the Israelis to give him anything. And Abu Mazen will go only for the diplomatic option, for negotiations. We’ve tried a struggle without negotiations, and negotiations without a struggle, and it didn’t help. Only negotiations and a struggle will assure the liberation.
In 2004, Barghouti supported the Israeli government’s plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. He later sent a letter from prison asking the Palestinians not to react with violence when Israel evacuated the Gaza settlers. On the eve of the dramatic move by Sharon, an imagination-firing Israeli initiative was put forward by the ambassador to Washington, Danny Ayalon.
“I received Sharon’s tacit agreement before the disengagement for the following move: Barghouti’s release in return for Pollard,” Ayalon recalls. “To that end, I met with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. I knew that the Americans supported Barghouti’s release, in order to strengthen Fatah. I asked her: ‘Would you be willing to release Pollard in exchange for Barghouti?’ She replied: ‘Danny, don’t go there.’”
The Barghouti-for-Pollard initiative under Ariel Sharon sank like a rock. Barghouti was placed in the top slot on Fatah’s list of candidates in the legislative election of January 2006. When the results came in, Abbas was forced to appoint Ismail Haniyeh as prime minister. Amid what looked like incipient signs of an impending civil war among the Palestinians, Barghouti drew up an ambitious document to block the currents that were flowing outside. He entered into a lengthy dialogue with security prisoners from the various Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The result was the “prisoners document.”
That formative text calls for the establishment of two states alongside one another, based on pre-1967 boundaries, implementation of the right of return and adoption of previous agreements between the sides, abandonment of the armed struggle within Israel proper, and the introduction of democracy as well as equal rights for women.
However, on June 25, 2006, the day on which Hamas Prime Minister Haniyeh was supposed to announce the document’s acceptance in the name of the organization, members of Hamas’ military wing kidnapped Corp. Gilad Shalit along the Gaza border. The signing ceremony was suspended. It would be another five years before Netanyahu, who became prime minister for the first time in 2009, would sign an exchange-of-prisoners deal for Shalit – without Barghouti’s inclusion. Earlier, the Olmert government had also left him incarcerated.
Haim Oron, the former Meretz leader, relates that Defense Minister Ehud Barak told him that he considered Barghouti’s arrest to have been a fundamental mistake. Nonetheless, the Olmert-Barak government did not free him, either.
Barghouti supported the negotiations conducted by Olmert. He told confidants at the time that if it depended on him, he could sign off on a final-status agreement “within a few days.” Some in the Israeli establishment believed that Barghouti’s support for negotiations was authentic. As proof, they noted that Barghouti’s closest confidants, led by Fares, had signed the Geneva Initiative, an unofficial framework for an agreement worked out by teams of Israelis and Palestinians, a few years before. “I would not have signed it if I were against it,” Fares told Haaretz.
Others suspected that the moderation Barghouti displayed in his prison conversations had a personal motivation: his release as part of an agreement, after which he would resume his militant line. “I know that Abu Mazen put forward Marwan’s release as a condition for an agreement,” Fadwa Barghouti says, “and later also to the U.S. secretary of state, John Kerry. I was told this personally.”
Other Israeli governmental sources, however, maintain that Abbas has always behaved duplicitously. “We know that he occasionally asked the Americans for his [Barghouti’s] release, including in a tete-a-tete with President Obama,” says a knowledgeable source. “But there were also assessments that, for fear of his own survival, Abu Mazen preferred that Barghouti remain in prison.” According to MK Zahalka, “There were years when they didn’t want to hear his name in the Muqata” – the Palestinians’ headquarters in Ramallah.
“Over the years, Abu Mazen did not make the required effort for my release,” Barghouti himself told Haaretz.
In recent months, Jerusalem Affairs Minister Zeev Elkin has met with academics to discuss the situation that will ensue after Abbas’ departure. Most of his interlocutors told him that Barghouti is the only Fatah figure who could defeat Hamas in an election. This has not led Elkin to join the chorus of those urging his release.
“On the day after Abu Mazen, the PA will collapse, and we need to be ready for that,” Elkin tells Haaretz apocalyptically. “In my estimation, Fatah will not risk an election, which it might lose to Hamas, and even if it takes the chance, the Netanyahu government will not allow the Arabs of East Jerusalem to vote.” Elkin sees a likely situation of chaos and violence in the immediate post-Abbas period, and also believes that Barghouti will rot in prison.
In the view of some, Abbas’ three posts (PLO chairman, Fatah chairman, PA president) will be divided among three different individuals. The PLO chairman will be the senior figure and will spearhead political moves, the PA president will be a technocrat who will handle administrative affairs, and the Fatah leadership will be taken by a third person from the organization. And what will happen if there is an election and Barghouti wins it? “The [Israeli] security cabinet has not yet held a discussion relating to that question,” a cabinet minister tells Haaretz.
President Reuven Rivlin, who is today against Barghouti’s release, has held a few meetings with political figures in which the question arose of what Israel should do if Barghouti is elected president. Rivlin said in those conversations that the country’s leaders should, in that event, recalculate their course and do what meets Israel’s interests best. In Rivlin’s opinion, if the international community sees him as a Mandela-like figure and exerts pressure for his release, it will be against Israel’s best interests to have him remain in jail.
Barghouti himself recently told one of his visitors that he is vehemently opposed to having Abbas’ successor chosen in an election in the style of the Arab states. “The only way is a completely democratic election under international supervision,” the prisoner said. “Anyone who thinks that the next Palestinian president will not be elected via the ballot box is living under illusions.”

<title>Africa has no better friend than Israel, Netanyahu says during Kenya visit</title>
<date>Tue Jul 05 19:00:20 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Africa has no better friend than the state of Israel for the practical needs of security and development, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday on the second leg of a four-country tour to pursue better relations with the continent.
Netanyahu is the first ruling Israeli prime minister to visit Kenya. He met with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on counter-terrorism, energy and agriculture, amid tight security. Netanyahu is also visiting Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia.
Israel played a prominent role in assisting newly independent African countries in the 1960s, but those relations crumbled in the 1970s, when Arab countries, promising aid, pressured African nations to limit or cut ties with Israel. African states were also opposed to Israel's close ties to South Africa's apartheid government.
In exchange for its expertise in security and other fields, Israel now wants African states to side with it at the United Nations, where the General Assembly overwhelmingly recognized Palestine as a non-member observer state in 2012.
Israel and the region also have a shared interest in confronting Islamic extremists.
"Things are changing in the world, things are changing in the Middle East, and things are changing in the relations between Israel and many of our Arab neighbors. A similar change is now undergoing our relation with African countries," Netanyahu said.
He said Kenyatta told him that African leaders would work to restore Israel as an observer to the African Union. "I think that it will have very considerable effect regarding Israel's international relations in the future, vis-à-vis our effort to bring about a very great number of countries that support Israel," Netanyahu said.
Kenyatta said the threat of extremism demands partnership with nations with a common position against it.
"That's why I strongly believe it's critical for us reevaluate our relationship ... with the state of Israel given the challenges that in we in the African continent are faced with today," Kenyatta said.
Kenya has long been a target of extremist attacks which have hit Israeli interests. In a near simultaneous attack in 2002, Al-Qaida extremists blew up an explosives-laden vehicle at an Israeli-owned hotel on the Kenyan coast, killing 11 people, while others shot at an Israeli jetliner.
Kenyatta also said his country supports talks between Israel and the Palestinians.

<title>Netanyahu visits Rwanda genocide memorial, noting similarities to Holocaust - Israel News</title>
<date>Wed Jul 06 18:35:07 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday toured a memorial for victims of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda during the first visit by a sitting Israeli prime minister to sub-Saharan Africa in three decades.
                
Netanyahu laid a wreath at the mass graves honoring the more than 800,000 victims of the genocide perpetrated by Hutu extremists against the Tutsi ethnic group and moderate Hutus.
                
"We are deeply moved by this memorial to the victims of one of history's greatest crimes and reminded of the haunting similarities to the genocide of our own people," he and his wife, Sara, wrote in the visitors' book.
                
Netanyahu, who is pursuing closer security and other ties with African nations, has already been to Uganda and Kenya this week and was moving on to Ethiopia later Wednesday.
                
In exchange for its expertise in security and other fields, Israel wants African states to support it at the United Nations, where the Palestinians were recognized as a non-member observer state in 2012.
                
Israel played a prominent role in assisting newly independent African countries in the 1960s, but those relations crumbled in the 1970s, when Arab countries, promising aid, pressured African nations to limit or cut ties with Israel.

<title>On Palestinians, Elie Wiesel had nothing to apologize for</title>
<date>Sun Jul 10 13:48:26 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
He had suffered unimaginably, persevered, fought incredible odds and won. But while he was regarded by most of the enlightened world as a hero, he also had a tendency to overlook the crimes of his allies and disregard those suffering under them.
This could describe Mohandas Gandhi, his “Dear Friend” letters to Adolf Hitler and attempts to build an alliance with the Axis nations against the British. It could be Nelson Mandela who, after becoming South Africa’s president, bestowed honors on tyrants who had supported him in the past such as Kadaffi, Castro and Suharto. How about Muhammad Ali, favored guest of African dictators, of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran? When Mandela died in 2013 and Ali last month, you heard nearly nothing about their unsavory friendships in the chorus of adulation for their greatness.
Compare that with the small but vocal corner of public opinion and punditry which over the last week since Elie Wiesel passed away, seems to be obsessed with the fact that he didn’t care much for the Palestinians. I’m no fan of the “don’t speak evil of the dead” school and there are enough examples of me trashing the reputations of the dearly departed in the archives of this newspaper, but why exactly are Wiesel’s views on the Israel-Palestine conflict even relevant to summing up his life’s work? I suppose if you were writing a 10,000-word obituary this might warrant a couple of sentences somewhere towards the end. But for a disturbing number of people, some of whom should at least know better, Wiesel’s views on Palestinian statehood were the litmus test by which they judged him.
But then, it was hardly surprising that there would be those who, in the immediate aftermath of his death, would seek to besmirch Wiesel’s record. For decades he was accused of being the showman of the Shoah business. Of hobnobbing with presidents and potentates. Of selling out to big money. Of being a fraud and a hypocrite. After all, he made too many people uncomfortable with his constant reminders that not long ago Jews were an endangered and hunted-down species. What was easier than using the ancient tactic of framing him as a money-grubbing Jew. And it was hard not to detect a tinge of schadenfreude in the reports that Wiesel’s own foundation was among those that had lost nearly all its millions investing in Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. Excoriating him for his perceived callousness towards the Palestinians is just another more fashionable way of taking that uppity dead Jew down a few pegs.
There were always those who would never forgive Wiesel for not remaining a young poor survivor on the wooden bunk in Buchenwald. Just as there are those who can’t accept that in the 70 years since over a third of the Jews were wiped out, the survivors and their children are now living prosperously in the comfortable communities in the West or in their homeland and sovereign state. But Wiesel had to pay the price for his success and for playing the role of the man who made the Holocaust real for millions who knew nothing about it.
Someone had to be the most famous Holocaust survivor in the world, the Shoah’s celebrity. It would have to be someone living in the United States, comfortable appearing alongside presidents and movie stars. He would have to be something of a showman, with a deft turn of phrase, a certain talent for public relations and the flexibility to adapt the trauma of his personal experiences, originally written in 900 pages of Yiddish, to a Hollywood script. It was inevitable that in becoming the face of his people’s genocide, one man representing six million dead men, women and children, as well as those who had survived, Wiesel was also setting himself on a pedestal from which some would try to knock him down.
In the decades that passed between the war and his transformation into Elie Wiesel, the writer and philosopher of the Holocaust, he was a journalist, writing mainly in Hebrew and French, neither his mother tongue. He was moderately successful as a journalist because he knew how to write both for his editors and his audience, which was not necessarily what he might have chosen to write for himself. He learned that a popular writer needs to make compromises. Wiesel was aware that he wasn’t the best survivor-writer. On a literary level he was nowhere near as good as fellow Auschwitz inmates Primo Levi and Imre Kertesz. This probably bothered him, but at least he sold many more books than they did and besides, they didn’t have the public role that had been thrust upon him. They didn’t have to act as a “voice of world’s conscience” and represent six million without a voice. Kertesz’s Nobel Prize was for literature; Wiesel’s was for peace. While you could argue whether his work advanced the cause of peace in the world, Yasser Arafat and Henry Kissinger also got Nobel Peace Prizes.
So Wiesel was not interested in speaking out against injustices done to Palestinians. After the Holocaust, he felt that Israel’s war for independence was his own. He feared, with good reason, that once again the Jews would lose and another genocide of 600,000 would take place should the Arab armies invading the new state succeed. He visited in 1949 while Israel was still barely hanging by a thread, while absorbing millions of survivors like him and Jewish refugees from Arab lands. His political conclusion was that Israel must never concede ground to its enemies. I expect younger Israeli politicians to adapt their views, but what right did we have to expect that of Wiesel?
It would have been wonderful if he had used his voice to urge Israelis and Israel’s supporters to seek a better way of solving the conflict with the Palestinians. But that wasn’t his role. Had Wiesel returned to live in Israel in his old age, I’m pretty certain we wouldn’t have been voting for the same party or the same candidates in the Knesset election. So what? He saw Israel as the haven that must be protected at all costs and though I and many others believe that Israel will be safer living aside a Palestinian people with rights and dignity, he thought otherwise. To blame him for holding this view is as churlish as insisting that Mandela should have shunned those dictatorships that supported him during his incarceration and long battle against apartheid. Blame the politicians who feted Wiesel and used him for their purposes, not the man who had seen his family and community destroyed and felt that Israel should take no risks in ensuring that Jews would have a place somewhere to ensure that it never happened again.
Wiesel played a role in giving both those who died in the Holocaust and those who lived through it a face and a voice. He enjoyed fame and fortune for doing so, but also had to pay a price by enduring ridicule and often unfair criticism for shedding his anonymity and putting himself up on the world stage. His goals were to make sure the Jews who had died were not forgotten and that those who lived could survive and prosper. He still found time to speak out on behalf of Cambodians, Bosnians, Rwandans and other victims of genocides. But he wouldn’t do so for those who he saw as endangering his own people. I think he was wrong in that but in no way does that invalidate his life’s work. Those who upon his death are rushing to tar him for that are no different than those who during his life criticized his financial success and fame. Elie Wiesel paid the price for his victory and had nothing to apologize for.

<title>After stormy debate, Knesset approves law allowing ouster of lawmakers</title>
<date>Wed Jul 20 00:43:59 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
The Knesset passed into law a bill that lets it oust a sitting lawmaker – legislation that critics say targets Arab lawmakers deemed to be inciting against Israel’s interests.
According to the law, which was passed with a majority of 62 votes against 45, the Knesset can oust a lawmaker for incitement to racism and support of armed struggle against the state. The expulsion requires a majority of 90 lawmakers, while to launch expulsion proceedings, the votes of 70 of the Knesset's 120 members are required, including 10 from the opposition. The original version of the bill only required 61 MKs to launch the proceedings, and not necessarily anyone from the opposition.
Members of the Joint List of Arab parties said they intend to appeal the Supreme Court against the law. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated the new legislation, saying in a Facebook post that it "puts an end to the absurdity: Those who support terrorism against the State of Israel and its citizens – won't serve in Israel's Knesset."
"Like in any democracy in the world, Israeli democracy also has the right and the duty to defend itself," he added.
Opposition leader MK Isaac Herzog slammed the law, saying on Twitter that it is a "dark mark on Israel's face. The hate-filled government is busy widening the rift that threatens Israel more than any outside enemy."
MK Nissan Slomiansky (Habayit Hayehudi) rejected claims that the law is targeting the Arab lawmakers. "You know that in actual fact, the only time this calling card has been activated was against Jews," he said, referring at the rightwing extremist Meir Kahana, who was disqualified from running for Knesset in the 1980s. 
"The Knesset will no longer be a shroud for terrorism and racism. Members of the Knesset whose paycheck is funded by the state cannot use it to undermine its foundations," Slomiansky said earlier. MK Yousef Jabarin (Joint List) said the law would turn the Arab lawmakers into "MKs on probation," adding: "This is apartheid legislation, which paves the way for a political transfer of the Arab public's elected officials."
Coalition Chairman MK David Bitan, who had been trying to shelve the bill due to concerns over the difficulty of its implementation, said after the vote that the Knesset has spoken with an absolute majority, and termed the law "a whip against those who think they can exploit Israeli democracy to undermine the State of Israel." 
On the other side, MK Dov Henin (Joint List) said the law is an example of the tyranny of the majority, and "directly targets the Arab public's elected officials, chosen to voice their stances."
"This law is a black page on Israel's code of laws, which reflects anti-democratic policy and maneuvers by an anti-democratic government, which will go on to harm more and more populations," he said.
Ahead of the vote, some in the coalition also voiced dissatisfaction with the law, albeit with the limits placed on its usage. “This law is a failure. It will be impossible to implement,” a senior Likud official said. “They’ve raised the threshold of MKs so high that there’s no longer any point to it.”

<title>Black Lives Matter endorses BDS: Israel is 'apartheid state'</title>
<date>Thu Aug 04 10:49:16 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
The wide-ranging new platform of a coalition growing out of the Black Lives Matter movement includes harsh criticism of Israel, which it describes as an “apartheid state” that, it claims, perpetrates “genocide” against the Palestinian people, endorsing the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign.
Released Monday, the platform of the Movement for Black Lives calls for “an end to the war against Black people” and is the campaign’s first comprehensive document addressing specific federal policies.
Black Lives Matter Network is one of over 50 black-led organizations in the coalition.
While the majority of the document addresses issues other than Israel, the section on foreign policy, titled Invest-Divest, objects to U.S. military aid to Israel, which it describes as “a state that practices systematic discrimination and has maintained a military occupation of Palestine for decades.”
While the section addresses other foreign policy issues, particularly the movement’s objections to the drug war and the war on terror, it criticizes no foreign country other than Israel.
The section also argues that the U.S., because of its alliance with Israel, is “complicit in the genocide taking place against the Palestinian people.”
According to the platform, “Israel is an apartheid state with over 50 laws on the books that sanction discrimination against the Palestinian people.”
The platform claims Palestinian property is “routinely bulldozed to make way for illegal Israeli settlements” and that Israeli soldiers “regularly arrest and detain Palestinians as young as 4 years old without due process.”
“Everyday, Palestinians are forced to walk through military checkpoints along the U.S.-funded apartheid wall,” the platform adds, referring to the security barrier Israel erected in response to a wave of terrorist attacks committed by Palestinians from the West Bank.
The section expresses support for the BDS campaign against Israel, and credits Adalah-The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, as one of its “authors & contributors.”
Formed in response to growing outrage over the criminal justice system’s treatment of African Americans — particularly police violence against them — the Movement for Black Lives describes itself on its website as “a collective of more than 50 organizations representing thousands of Black people from across the country.”

<title>Jewish groups condemn Black Lives Matter platform for accusing 'apartheid' Israel of 'genocide'</title>
<date>Fri Aug 05 11:53:09 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
A new platform associated with the Black Lives Matter movement that describes Israel as an “apartheid state” committing “genocide” against the Palestinian people has triggered critical responses from Jewish organizations — even its allies.
“[We] are extremely dismayed at the decision to refer to the Israeli occupation as genocide,” a statement from T’ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, read.
Since Black Lives Matter took shape in 2013 to protest police killings of African Americans, Jewish groups across the country have struggled to strike the right tone in their responses to the movement. Activists aligned with Black Lives Matter have frequently visited the occupied Palestinian West Bank in what some call “solidarity tours,” as recently as July 30.
Black Lives Matter has again risen in prominence in the run-up to the presidential election and amidst a spate of video-taped killings, grimly detailed, of African Americans by police. Now the platform, announced on July 3, has prompted several Jewish organizations to more precisely define their relationship to the movement.
T’ruah is one of several Jewish organizations that have stood with the grassroots movement to end police brutality against African Americans.
The organization also praised “the leaders of Black Lives Matter for insisting that the United States meet its human rights obligations, and for concretizing these into specific policy recommendations.”
“I am struggling with ‪
‎BlackLivesMatter‬ but I believe black lives matter,” wrote Rabbi Ari Hart, from the Bayit Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, on his public Facebook page.
Other groups, including Boston’s Jewish Community Relations Council, had harsher words — saying they would be disassociating themselves with any group aligned with Black Lives Matter from now on.
“We cannot and will not align ourselves with organizations that falsely and maliciously assert that Israel is committing ‘genocide,’” a statement from the group read. “We reject participation in any coalition that seeks to isolate and demonize Israel singularly amongst the nations of the world.”
For some Jews of color, particularly African American Jews, who had embraced the popular movement, the language of the new platform was especially troubling.
“It broke my heart,” said Stacey Aviva Flint, a student at Chicago’s Spertus Institute who is African American and Jewish and writes on parallels between black and Jewish nationalist movements.
“I understand what Zionism was about when it first started. You had a group of people who were seeking self determination. And self determination was also something that African Americans desperately needed and wanted,” said Flint.
“[In past months], I really thought, ‘a movement is starting, I want to support this, as African Americans are being targeted by the police,’” Flint said.
“This dashed my hopes.”
Flint said that calling Israel an apartheid state would only “muddy” Black Lives Matter’s message. “Now people don’t see Black Lives Matter as a legitimate platform.”
Jews of color have taken center stage in a series of Black Lives Matter-inspired protests happening in New York City. The Jews of Color Caucus, which is a smaller body within Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, most recently staged a protest of more than 100 in Downtown Brooklyn.
Speaking on the topic, but before the new platform was released, founding member of the caucus Yehudah Webster said, “It’s important for white Jews and Israelis to recognize, yes, the Palestinian-Israeli situation is unique, but still it does play into this global system of white supremacy.”
“I consider myself a Zionist,” said Webster, “but being a patriot means pushing your government and people to be better. That’s why I want Israel to be the best it can be.”
The platform of the “Movement for Black Lives,” a coalition under the Black Lives Matter umbrella, calls for “an end to the war against Black people.” It is being called the campaign’s “first comprehensive document” addressing specific federal policies.
Most of the document has nothing to do with Israel. But the section on foreign policy (called “Invest-Divest”) criticizes American military aid to Israel. Israel is “a state that practices systematic discrimination and has maintained a military occupation of Palestine for decades,” the platform reads.
The section dealing with Israel also calls on activists to “build invest/divestment campaigns” to end “US Aid to Israel’s military industrial complex” and credits Adalah, an Israeli advocacy group for Arab rights, among its “authors & contributors.”
Right-wing Jewish groups, including the Zionist Organization of America have condemned Black Lives Matter since the movement’s early days.
The Anti-Defamation League’s Jonathan Greeblatt has said that racial justice for African Americans is one of “the struggles of our time,” and the ADL includes educational material about Black Lives Matter on their website.

<title>World sees Israel as a pariah state, senior gov't official says</title>
<date>Sun Aug 07 12:49:00 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Israel is perceived a "pariah state" in the international community, Strategic Affairs Ministry Director General Sima Vaknin told lawmakers on Sunday, adding that the ministry intends to reverse this stance in the next decade.
Vaknin said that a team of 10 officials from a various ministries has been created to agree on a desired alternative narrative they would like to see in the world regarding Israel. Vaknin's comments were made during a meeting of the Special Committee for the Transparency and Accessibility of Government Information headed by MK Stav Shaffir (Zionist Union).
"Victory for me will be a change of narrative in the world toward Israel - that the narrative in the world won't be that Israel equals apartheid," Vaknin said. "[T]oday in the countries of the world, Israel is a pariah state. Our goal is that in 2025 no one in the world will question Israel's right to exist."
Shaffir requested that Vaknin reveal the ministry's budget, strategy and work plan regarding its fight against the delegitimization of Israel. Vaknin agreed to divulge little details and said that she would be able to offer more information only in a closed discussion with the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
Vaknin, who until a few years ago served at the chief military censor, said she wanted her ministry to work in greater secrecy and she even asked Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan to avoid public comments regarding the ministry's work.
"We want most of the Strategic Affairs Ministry's work to be classified," she said. "There is great sensitivity and I can't even discuss in an open forum why there's sensitivity... A large part of what we do is under the radar."
Some two weeks ago, during an open discussion in the State Control Committee, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel had "defeated" the movement to boycott, divest and sanction Israel, known as BDS. Vaknin denied that Netanyahu said anything of the sort, but agreed with Netanyahu's assessment that supporters of the movement are on the defensive, unlike in the past.
"There is strategic competition between us and our opponents," said Vaknin. "We are shifting from containment and reaction to initiative and attack... BDS activists are on the defensive because we announced publicly and showed through back channels that we will fight back."
One of the only details that Vaknin agreed to reveal was the ministry's budget. According to her, the ministry's day-to-day budget amounts to 44 million shekels ($11.4 million) for 2016 and the budget specifically allotted for taking action against delegitimization in 2016 was 128 million shekels.
In the course of discussion, Shaffir asked Vaknin how the ministry defines delegitimization against Israel. Vaknin responded that the cross-ministry team is currently working on establishing a legal definition of the term. In the meantime, she said, the ministry is using the definition established a few years ago.
Vaknin's deputy, Zachi Gavrieli, read the current definition out loud, noting that "Delegimization is the gathering of organizations and ideas around a contemporary theme to reject the idea of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people."
On this note, Vaknin said that the Strategic Affairs Ministry believes "that any harsh criticism against Israel is legitimate but the denial of Israel's right to exist isn't." She said the ministry would like to collaborate with different organizations according to the principle of the "widest possible tent" and welcome in both staunch Israel supporters and critics, as long as all recognize Israel's right to exist.
"I'm a civil servant and I'm not addressing political issues," Vaknin said. "But in my view... whoever accepts our existence here - including the biggest critics - is our partner. Whoever does not - he is an opponent. If an organization says that we need to return all of the [occupied] territories but recognizes Israel's existence as a nation-state [of the Jewish people] - as far as I'm concerned it is a partner, even if there is those who won't like it."
Vaknin told the panel that the diplomatic-security cabinet decided to allow the Strategic Affairs Ministry to move offices from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. She noted that the grounds for the move were confidential and said that part of the ministry will remain in Jerusalem. Despite Vaknin's claims, Minister Erdan already revealed several months in a similar discussion in the Knesset that the reason for moving part of ministry is the need for physical proximity to military headquarters at the Kiryah complex and other intelligence organizations.

<title>N.Y. venue nixes Black Lives Matter benefit over Israel-bashing platform</title>
<date>Sat Sep 10 01:52:43 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
A New York venue cancelled a concert raising money for Black Lives Matter over a recent policy platform by an affiliated group, which called Israel an “apartheid state” perpetuating “genocide” against the Palestinian people.
An email sent to ticket holders this week said that the owners and managers of Feinstein’s/54 Below had “become aware of a recent addition to the BLM platform that accuses Israel of genocide and endorses a range of boycott and sanction actions.”
The cabaret club, which is located close to Times Square, “would have preferred to hold the concert in support of the 
BlackLivesMatter movement, without endorsing or appearing to endorse the entirety of the Black Lives Matter organization and its platform but we’ve found that a distinction impossible for us to effect,” the email read, according to Playbill.
“As we can’t support these positions, we’ve accordingly decided to cancel the concert,” it continued.
According to the venue’s web site, it is owned by a team of Broadway producers, including Tom Viertel, Marc Routh, Richard Frankel and Steve Baruch. The site says the venue has a “creative partnership” with singer and pianist Michael Feinstein.
The concert was scheduled for Sept. 11 and was to be directed by Tony Award-winning actress Tonya Pinkins.
Last month, The Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of groups affiliated with Black Lives Matter, released a wide-ranging platform calling for “an end to the war against Black people.”
The majority of the document addressed issues other than Israel,, including discrimination and police violence directed at African Americans,  but the section on foreign policy objected to U.S. military aid to the Jewish state.
The section criticized no foreign country’s policies other than those of Israel.
The statements on Israel drew strong criticism from many Jewish groups, including T’ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, which said it was “extremely dismayed” that the platform accused Israel of genocide.

<title>Ex-PM Barak: Netanyahu's interference in U.S. politics cost Israel a better aid deal</title>
<date>Thu Sep 15 20:44:45 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak severely criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a Washington Post op-ed published on Thursday, saying that the PM's "irresponsible management" of relations with the White House damaged the defense aid deal signed with the U.S. on Wednesday. 
According to Barak, the deal – which would see Israel receive $3.8 billion annually until 2029 – was an "important contribution" to Israel's security but "far less than what could have been obtained before the prime minister chose to blatantly interfere with U.S. politics."
Barak, who served as defense minister under Netanyahu between 2007 and 2013, also said that the rising cost of arms means that the sum represents no greater purchasing power since the last 10-year agreement. 
Barak also wrote that Netanyahu has allowed his party, the Likud, to be been taken over by a "militant, nationalist minority," which has hijacked the national agenda in the service of a "messianic drive" toward a one-state solution. 
"This overarching ambition is bound to culminate in either a single, binational state, which, within a generation, may have a Jewish minority and likely a Bosnia-like civil war, or else an apartheid reality if Palestinian residents are deprived of the right to vote. Both spell doom for the Zionist dream," Barak wrote.
Likud called Barak's op-ed "nonsense penned by the most failed prime minister in Israel's history." In a statement, the party said that the aid deal with the U.S. was the biggest in U.S. history, and that the op-ed proves that Barak isn't interested in what is best for the country or for Israel's security, but only in his own interests. 
Barak has since responded to the Likud, telling Army Radio that if Netanyahu had conducted himself appropriately facing the U.S., Israel could have gotten $4.5 billion more. 
This was not the first time Barak has attacked Netanyahu recently. About a month ago Barak said that a series of events in recent months caused damage to Israel's security as a result of Netanyahu's mistaken judgment and his rocky relations with U.S. President Barack Obama. Barak noted in his speech that he could give no further details as to the incident because of its sensitivity. Earlier this month, billboards were put up in Tel Aviv calling on Barak to return to politics. "Barak you must run, Netanyahu is ruining the country," read the billboards.

<title>Watch //Obama: Peres understood the Jewish people 'were not born to rule another' - Israel News</title>
<date>Fri Sep 30 12:02:14 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
U.S. President Barack Obama eulogized Israel's former President Peres on Friday by quoting the statesman as having said that "the Jewish people weren't born to rule another people."
                
"He would say: We are against slaves and masters." Obama said.
                
Obama said further that he saw Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' presence at the late statesman's funeral "is a gesture and a reminder of the unfinished business of peace."
                
Follow Haaretz's live updates from Shimon Peres' funeral

Obama said that the younger generation remembers only Peres' unsuccessful quest for peace, and was shaped by the critics who said he "refused to recognize the wickedness of the world and called him naive."
                
But, as Obama saw it, Peres' "pursuit of peace was never naive." He thought that Peres must have found it amusing that the critics who called him naive "depend on the defense architecture that he himself helped to build.
                
Peres, he said, "learned from hard earned experience that true security comes from making peace with your neighbors."
                
Obama compared Peres' campaign for peace to that of anti-apartheid activist and former president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
                
"Even in the face of terrorist attacks, repeated disappointments at the negotiating table, he insisted that Palestinians must be seen as equal in dignity to Jews and therefore equal in self-determination."
                
"He believed that Israel would be best protected when Palestinians had a state of their own." 
                
Obama applauded Peres' range of contributions to Israel and the wider world.
                
“I could not be more honored to be in Jerusalem to say farewell to my friend, to Shimon Peres, who showed us that justice and hope are at the heart of the Zionist idea," Obama said.
                
"A free life in homeland regained, a secure life of a nation that can defend itself by itself, a full life of a friendship with nations who can be counted on as allies, always…. this was Shimon Peres's life. This is the state of Israel. This is the story of the Jewish people.
                
"Shimon once said the message of the Jewish people to mankind is that faith and vision will triumph over all adversity," Obama said, adding that "It is a full life, driven by the simple pleasures of family and by big dreams. This is Shimon Peres' life. This is the State of Israel."
                
"We won them all he said of Israel’s wars, but we did not win the greatest victory we aspire to, release from the need to win victories.
                
“For a younger generation Shimon is possibly viewed more as leader of a peace process that never reached its endpoint. He understood this volatile region where Arab youth are taught to hate Israel at an early age… His pursuit of peace was never naive,” Obama said.

<title>Obama loves Israel à la Peres, not Netanyahu</title>
<date>Sat Oct 01 11:43:20 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
President Obama's eulogy for Shimon Peres was a work of love. One didn’t need the funeral to know that the American president was fond of the former Israeli leader: you could see it in his eyes from the first moment they met. But the full extent of Obama’s affection was evident in his moving initial statement upon receiving the news of Peres’ death, in his bold decision to lower U.S. flags to half mast, in his participation in the Jerusalem funeral early on Friday morning at the head of an impressive U.S. delegation and in his exquisite farewell, part political manifesto and part poignant lament. 
It was an ode to an idealized and sanitized version of Peres, for sure, but that’s the way of the world. Obama’s comparison of Peres with Nelson Mandela, for example, was laced with irony. When Mandela was in his second decade in jail on Robben Island in the mid-1970s, Peres was swearing allegiance to the “shared ideals” of Israel and apartheid South Africa and reportedly trying to sell it nuclear weapons. Ten years later, in the midst of his conversion from hawkish to dovish, Peres tried unsuccessfully to cajole Pretoria to release Mandela in a transcontinental prisoner swap that would have included Prisoner of Zion Natan Sharansky. By the time the Oslo Accords were concluded, Mandela was out of prison, Peres was a changed man and the two hit it off famously. It was this latter-day Peres that Obama was eulogizing.
The president drew a stark contrast between Peres and those who “posture or traffic in what’s popular at the moment." He asserted, somewhat naively, that Peres, unlike lesser men, had no more need for polls and sound bytes. Obama didn’t mention the current Israeli prime minister by name, but he didn’t have to. You knew whom he was thinking about, even if he didn’t. Jeffrey Goldberg, who has the president’s mouth, has repeatedly reported how Obama regards Netanyahu as a “political coward” who has the ability to bring about a two-state solution but “is too fearful and politically paralyzed to do so.”  
Obama conveyed a rueful sense of missed opportunity: if only Peres had been the Israeli leader that I engaged with, we could have changed the world. The feeling, of course, is mutual: Netanyahu must also fantasize about the good times that he lost because Mitt Romney wasn’t elected president, leaving him stuck, twice and (hopefully) thrice in a row, with Democratic presidents who couldn’t stand him.
Israel, good and bad
Obama spoke of Peres as a comrade in arms, as one speaks of a dear departed family member and at times, despite the huge gaps between them in years, background and temperament, as an alter ego of himself. “Our friendship was rooted in the fact that I could somehow see myself in his story, and maybe he could see himself in mine,” Obama said. He would never dream of saying that about Netanyahu, of course, despite the fact the two are much closer in age, education, background and embrace of American culture. With Netanyahu, it is a clash of their undistilled core.
It is in this sense, and in this sense alone, that Obama is “anti” Israel, though disdainful might be a better word. He loves the kind of Israel that Peres embodied but detests the one that Netanyahu represents. Obama is a Zionist but his Zionism is imbued with liberal values, embracing “a moral and ethical vision” that he ascribed on Friday to Peres. Peres believed that “human beings should be filled not with fear but with hope," Obama said, striking dread in Netanyahu’s heart. Take away the fear factor, and Netanyahu, the hope-killer, will evaporate into thin air.
Much more than his pursuit of the Iran nuclear deal or a Jewish settlement freeze, it is this differentiation between a “good” Israel and a “bad” Israel that drove Netanyahu and his fans crazy from the day Obama took office. Although the feelings were mutual – Netanyahu, after all, feels the same scorn towards liberal America as Obama does towards rejectionist Israel – the U.S. president’s distinctions were perceived as both a personal insult as well as a political liability. Reluctant to admit to the Israeli public – and possibly to himself as well – that Obama had a personal and ideological problem with him in particular and with his political camp in general, Netanyahu opted to inspire his mindless disciples to paint the U.S. president as a Muslim-loving, anti-Semitic enemy of the Jewish people. It’s not Netanyahu that Obama has a problem with, they claimed, it’s with Israel itself.
Existentialist fight
The fact that Obama had been inspired by American Jewish liberals such as Chicago’s Rabbi Arnold Jacob Wolf didn’t mitigate Netanyahu’s scorn but inflamed it. Netanyahu grew up in a home where Jews with agendas such as Wolf’s were viewed as the worst of the worst, destroyers from within, leftists, as Netanyahu once said, who’ve forgotten what it means to be a Jew. The fact that Obama probably knows more Yiddishkeit than Netanyahu or that he steadfastly and conspicuously marked Passover, Hanukkah, Jewish Heritage Month and other Jewish events more than any previous president meant nothing to Netanyahu’s political camp. If you don’t support settlements, if you utter the words “Tikun Olam," if you’re overly concerned with the plight of the Palestinians, if you dare to compare Jewish suffering with African American travails and declare them both “universal," as Obama did, you’re putting Netanyahu and his nationalist, fundamentalist and restrictionist coalition on notice that they are in your sights, and they react accordingly. Not in kind, but with everything they’ve got: it’s not a conflict of views that Obama has with the hard core Israeli right, but an existentialist fight to the death, as far as they’re concerned. They’re not here to argue with Obama; they’re mostly out to destroy him.
The past few weeks have shown just how craven the relentless eight-year campaign against Obama, inspired by Jerusalem but carried out by Netanyahu’s moneymen and media groupies in America, truly was. By Netanyahu’s own belated testimony, Obama contributed more to Israeli military might than any previous president, concluding his tenure with, love it or loathe it, an extraordinary long-term American commitment to Israel’s security. Peres’ passing then gave the president an opportunity to show skeptical Israelis, drunk with the right-wing’s toxic brew of anti-Obama bile, just how genuine and deeply-felt his commitment to Israel really is. True, Obama’s feelings don’t extend to Netanyahu’s Israel but the same can be said of a large chunk of Israeli society as well.
Obama probably lacks a proper grasp of the Weltanschauung of the Israel that Netanyahu represents and he certainly couldn’t have picked it up at Peres’ funeral. There were no right-wing ministers on hand proposing little apartheid-style Bantustans as a permanent solution, no settler vigilantes uprooting olive trees and shouting “death to the Arabs," no ultra-Orthodox politicians espousing Jewish supremacy or demanding regressive Iran-style legislation and no Netanyahu cabinet ministers or Likud and Habayit Hayehudi parliamentarians explaining how the U.S. president is out to destroy Israel because he wants an independent Palestinian state or believes that diplomacy can contain a nuclear Iran. True, there were no Israeli Arabs there either, but that’s another story altogether.
This is the second time that Obama is capturing Israeli hearts and minds: the first was in his 2013 visit. It happens when he takes the trouble to address the Israeli people directly, rather than through the distortive filters of the prime minister and his spinners. Gifted orator that he is, if Obama devoted more time and effort to presenting his case for a two-state solution to the Israeli people in the first place, he would have had a fighting chance of breaking through. Unlike Netanyahu, however, Obama didn’t deign to get his hands dirty or to appear to be delving in another country’s politics. Perhaps if he had been less aloof, if he had emulated Peres’ indefatigable pursuit of peace and plodded on, regardless of the pushback and pitfalls, Obama’s might have celebrated on Friday the fulfillment of Peres’ dream rather than helplessly marking its burial in the ground beside him.

<title>Roger Waters urges Chemical Brothers to cancel show in Tel Aviv 'hipster bubble'</title>
<date>Fri Nov 04 17:22:16 IST 2016</date>
<content>
British rock star Roger Waters called on the Chemical Brothers this week to cancel their upcoming show in Tel Aviv.
The former Pink Floyd bassist signed an open letter penned by the Artists for Palestine organization telling the electronic music duo that while they may think that playing in Tel Aviv "is a cool thing to do," in fact the city's "hipster vibe is a bubble on the surface of a very deep security state that drove out half the indigenous Palestinian population in 1948 and has no intention of letting their descendants back in."
The Chemical Brothers are set to perform at the Tel Aviv Convention Center on November 12. As of November 3, tickets for the British duo's show were still on sale and the performance was still listed on the band's website.
The open letter was also signed by 10 other British artists, including actress Maxine Peake ("The Theory of Everything") and playwright Caryl Churchill.
In addition to the letter, more than 7,000 people signed a petition urging the Chemical Brothers to withdraw from the show.  
"Artists both on stage and in the media make pious comments about 'peace' and 'coexistence,' whilst hinting that the occupied and occupier should 'live side by side,'" the petition says. "This doesn’t change the fact that artists that are performing in Israel are actually taking part in whitewashing the occupation and apartheid."
Last month, The Chemical Brothers' Ed Simons told the Israeli news site Walla that the band has not been pressured to cancel the show. "We go anywhere young people want to see us playing," he said. "We are not really involved in all the rest."
Also in October, the New York Post reported that American Express pulled out of a $4 million sponsorship of Waters’ 2017 tour in North America following his partisan and anti-Israel rhetoric at the Desert Trip festival that the credit giant sponsored.
Waters had also joined former Pink Floyd members David Gilmour and Nick Mason in supporting the women's flotilla that sought to break the Gaza blockade last month. The flotilla, which sailed from Barcelona, was ultimately intercepted by the Israeli navy off the coast of Gaza. On Facebook, the band said it "stands united in support of the Women of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla, and deplores their illegal arrest and detention in international waters by the Israeli Defense Force."

<title>A free nation in our land </title>

Since 1967, Israel has effectively become two states: Israel within the Green Line, a democratic, multi-party state whose citizens enjoy freedom of speech and movement; and next to it, the Palestinian territories under military rule, where the exact opposite is the case. At first it seemed that this would be a temporary situation until a settlement of one sort or another was worked out. For that reason, the internal contradiction between the two kinds of authority wielded by Israel was not profoundly understood. The Oslo agreements only deepened the perception that the situation was temporary.
But a situation that persists for decades has its own internal logic. Add to that an expanding population of settlers - about a quarter of a million today - who live in the West Bank under Israeli civil law, and not military rule. Hence, a situation has been created under which two populations live in the same territory under two legal systems, with national affiliation the deciding factor. Not exactly apartheid, but certainly not equality before the law.
For decades it seemed to most Israelis, including those who support a withdrawal from the West Bank, that this is a tolerable situation - not exactly what we would like to see, but temporarily, certainly not the worst option. Increasingly, this appears to be an illusion, because what goes on in the occupied territories is now starting to seep into Israel proper. Many who during their military service got used to treating Palestinians as an occupation army treats the occupied, began to treat - at least mentally, if not in practice - Israeli Arabs in the same way. The tolerance shown by the authorities for the violence of some of the settlers against Palestinians shaped a worldview that became acceptable to many with regard to Israeli Arabs. Shady deals aimed at taking over land in the territories became a model for taking over Arab properties in East Jerusalem, supposedly an integral part of Israel. And there are plenty of other examples.
The Green Line has been blurred in such a way that the norms that exist in the reality of the occupied territories have became increasingly acceptable norms within Israel proper. It is clear that racist legislative initiatives in the Knesset, as well as despicable statements made by some rabbis, are fed by the atmosphere created by Israel's rule over the territories. McCarthyist proposals to investigate the funding sources of NGOs that criticize IDF actions in the territories are obviously connected to the simple fact of the ongoing occupation. Indeed, how true it is that he who represses another people ultimately loses his own freedom. It doesn't happen overnight, but gradually, bit by bit.
Perhaps the people of Yisrael Beiteinu do understand what ruling another people means for the future of Israel. But Netanyahu, who comes from a different background, should be aware of the consequences and object to them. For him, it seems, the challenges facing the Jewish state are perceived exclusively in narrow security terms: balance of power, firepower, deterrent capabilities and amassing territory. He has never uttered a word that might suggest he understands that the problem - a problem that had contributed in no small measure to the delegitimization of Israel - is not the control of territory, but ruling people against their will.
Not for the sake of the freedom of the Palestinians must Israel make every effort to reduce and minimize as much as possible its rule over another people - but for the sake of our own freedom. And this must be done even in the absence of negotiations.

<title>An Israeli process of reconciliation </title>
<date>Fri May 06 01:46:54 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
 The Palestinian factions have reached a power-sharing deal - albeit a fragile one. Regional developments helped, affecting the calculations of both Fatah and Hamas. The role of post-Mubarak Egypt and its emerging independent regional policy cannot be underestimated. Israel's current government, though, is key to the glue binding Fatah and Hamas together. While the peace process has long been moribund, the Netanyahu government's refusal to indulge in the make-believe of possible progress rendered obsolete even Fatah's well-honed capacity to suspend disbelief. 
 Yet if the deal is to last, the Palestinian factions will eventually have to address substance: their national goals and the strategies to be pursued in attaining them. A real political dialogue will force both Fatah and Hamas out of their respective comfort zones. Fatah will have to elaborate a post-negotiation and  (one imagines ) non-violent plan for freedom, and decide how such a plan co-exists or breaks with existing donor and international relations, including coordination with Israel. Hamas will have to confront the requirements of international law  (including abandoning the use of violence against civilians ), and ultimately resolve its own verbal acrobatics regarding a Palestinian state alongside Israel - if a serious deal becomes available. 
 Not surprisingly, unity is also popular in Israel. Israeli unity that is. Palestinian unity has been met with almost blanket condemnation at the political level. But in reacting to Palestinian developments, we Israelis should first of all be asking what the problem is that we need to address. For the Netanyahu government that major problem, apparently, is Israel's international image and the prospect of pressure being exerted on Israel to advance peace. In the community of nations, Israel's standing has further plummeted under the tutelage of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman. The intra-Palestinian deal therefore offers a delightful opportunity for Israel to register some big points on the "Who's to blame for no peace?" scorecard and to fend off any such pressure. 
 Israel's challenge, though, goes way beyond public relations. Israel's challenge is how to adapt, shape and secure its future in this region. 
 For that reason alone, we would benefit from our own national reconciliation dialogue, one focused on what Israel's aspirations and strategies should look like. 
 As tectonic plates shift around us, Israel is clinging to an illusion, namely that when and if the Palestinians are ready, Israel will be able and willing to deliver a dignified two-state solution. The truth is less comforting. Currently there is no political path to an Israeli governing majority that could deliver a mutually acceptable two-state outcome. And there is no status quo: Israel's predicament is deteriorating, not stable. It is time for Israel to engage in the exercise that Palestinians have begun, and to ask what it is that we really want for ourselves. 
 Such a conversation might go in a number of directions. 
 Perhaps, in an honest dialogue regarding our future, enough of a consensus could be reached to allow for the actual evacuation of at least 100,000 settlers, a withdrawal from the vast majority of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and agreement on a two-state border delineation  (with equal land swaps ), even as other outstanding issues and a full end to conflict are left to future state-to-state negotiations. 
 A second option could be to build on the above, taking it in a more challenging direction - that of a full truth and reconciliation process with the Palestinians, addressing all claims. That would necessitate a difficult preliminary phase of Israeli introspection - are we ready to come to terms with the Nakba, with sharing Jerusalem's holy sites, and with being a fully democratic state, including for our Palestinian citizens? 
 If significant settler evacuation has become a red line that is impossible for Israel's political realities to cross, and alongside that a two-state solution is still preferred, then a third set of possibilities come into play. Israelis might develop a sufficient consensus that, while being unwilling to uproot fellow citizens, we are still willing to cede sovereignty over the '67 Palestinian territories. One might then enter into a negotiation over the rights and responsibilities of former settlers as residents in Palestine and what Israel would offer in exchange for these arrangements. 
 Alternately, we could pursue the two-ethnic-states model to its logical conclusion and call for a border that would be a modern-day version of the 1947 partition plan - and probably closer to a 50-50, rather than a 78-22, divide on the percentage of territory. This would be an intellectually honest platform for Lieberman's party. 
 If Israel cannot remove settlers, cannot engage in a genuine truth and reconciliation process, cannot cede sovereignty on the '67 lines to the Palestinians, or ask the United Nations to re-partition Palestine, then we must be honest and translate the existing one-space reality into a political plan for a one-state democracy - whether on the basis of a federal system, a cantonal system, a binational democracy, or a still more creative formulation. Perhaps just having such a conversation will help generate a governing majority for the more conventional two-state outcome, perhaps not. The more we avoid this conversation, the more we endanger our future in this democratizing region, and the more we entrench a reality of apartheid-by-stealth. 
 It is doubtful that such a conversation can evolve without an external impetus. It took Egyptian intervention to revive a serious Palestinian national dialogue. Is it too much to suggest that our American ally, apparently politically unable to lead a solution, could at least help lead a conversation?

<title>Arab world is deposing rulers, Israel is blowing leaves</title>
<date>Thu Apr 28 01:46:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Sometimes I'd watch him, the leaf blower. Making a racket, raising clouds of dust but doing a wonderful job of cleaning our streets. Crouching along the sidewalks of the city, he would never get anything but barrages of curses from passersby. Yesterday his work ended. The new noise prevention regulations went into effect, and with them, the end of the leaf blower.
I loved them, but apparently most Israelis thought otherwise. The Environmental Protection Ministry declared this nothing less than a "revolution" - the leaf blower revolution. The Arab world is deposing rulers and we are deposing the leaf blower. Now they will inundate the streets with thousands of African sanitation workers, who will sweep our streets in a hush and clean up after us ever so quietly with their wretched brooms of twigs, these sub-contracted workers, who earn the very minimum of the minimum wage and do not receive any social benefits or health insurance. But what's important is that our rest is not disturbed and our tranquility is preserved, no matter the cost.
This is how we are, we Israelis. We love to eat our cake and have it, too. We love the artfully achieved natural "look." We want someone to clean up after us but without making noise; we want someone to sweep up after us in conditions of near enslavement and without making a sound. It's not Israeli raucousness, the persistent honking of car horns, and the music blaring out of these cars - all the work of our own hands - that disturbs us. What disturbs us is the leaf blower. It's not the sounds of the seething environment that disturbs us. Not the outcries of the oppressed among us, not the mutterings of the world that opposes us and not the moans of those under our occupation. These do not disturb our serenity. Only the leaf blower does.
This leaf blower is, indeed, a metaphor. There are many other leaf blowers and brooms out there that Israelis would want to "do their work" for them, to clear away the fallen leaves and the piled up garbage, but they better not disturb their tranquility.
The separation wall is a case in point. They are there and we are here (and also there ), but the main thing is that the Palestinians disappear from our sight - separation and sweeping without any noise. Every time the occupation has the gall to proclaim its existence and make a racket like a leaf blower, we hasten to issue regulations to muffle it and use violent means to silence it.
Like the cleanliness of our cities, we want the occupation to continue but without making noise. We want violent wars and brutal military operations but without a peep from the world in their wake. We want crude violations of human rights but without the clamor of criticism; to preach to the world to boycott Hamas but to be against international boycotts. We want democracy but without the background noises of the minority. We want to live in a near theocracy, one of the most religious countries in the world, and to imagine we are living in a secular and liberal democracy. We want to consider ourselves enlightened and to vote for Kadima - a rightist, nationalist party in every respect, only without the leaf-blowing racket of the undisguised right-wing nationalists.
We say that most of us are in favor of the two-state solution, but we vote for parties that will do nothing to advance it. We vehemently oppose a one-state solution but we live, in fact for decades, in an apartheid state. We favor free access and worship at Joseph's Tomb but not at Al Aqsa. We remember 1948 but without the Nakba. We oppose returning Palestinian property from before 1948 but we evict Palestinian inhabitants in Hebron and Sheikh Jarrah on the grounds that their homes were under Jewish ownership before 1948. We shoot passengers in Palestinian cars who refuse to stop at roadblocks, but when the Palestinian police do the same, we call it a "murderous terror attack." We call the Israeli army Defense Forces, while most of its work is occupation. We live without a civil society but believe that tying a yellow ribbon onto our car mirrors for Gilad Shalit is an act of protest. We support Shalit's release but oppose the release of 450 terrorists in exchange for him. And we sweep and sweep, but without making any noise.
I loved the leaf blower, but not only for his effectiveness: Sometimes it is, in fact, the silence that is rubbish. I, too, love quiet but not imaginary quiet, not quiet that sweeps things under the rug and deceives. If it is necessary to clean, let us do it with the necessary clamor, without disguising anything. Hence this desperate cry that stands no chance: Bring back the leaf blower.

<title>Before the lights go out </title>
<date>Mon Mar 21 02:27:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
 
On Wednesday, Meretz party chairman Haim Oron will retire from the Knesset. On Sunday, the central committee of the Labor Party will convene. The connection between these events is indirect, but it is there. The invitations sent to the delegates gives the agenda of the confab as follows: "1. Rescind the committee's decision of August 5, 2009, regarding the introduction of a new party constitution  (the Barak constitution ), and the reinstatement of the previous constitution, from January 1998."
The rest is irrelevant. Oron is gone, Labor is getting rid of Ehud Barak once and for all. No historians are needed. All that is required is to look at the list of those who have left - Oron, Shulamit Aloni, Yossi Sarid and Yossi Beilin from Meretz; Barak, Shimon Peres, Dalia Itzik, Haim Oron, Shalom Simhon, Matan Vilnai and Orit Noked from Labor - and to look at where they are now, and recall the reasons for and circumstances behind the fall of the left.
But in order to grasp the depth of the pit it fell into, we must also add Amram Mitzna, Avraham Shochat and Uzi Baram to the list. It's a bad story that is a jumble of ego, ego and ego, naivete, manipulation and aggression, all of which were never in short supply on the left.
In recent days, much ink has been spilled celebrating Oron. He, on the other hand, did not spare associates near and far from his sharp tongue during an interview in Haaretz Magazine  (Gidi Weitz, "No hard feelings," March 18 ): Oron spelled out, in great detail, why Barak "is the most dangerous person in Israel"  (Shochat said the same thing a few months ago ), Avigdor Lieberman "frightens" him and Shelly Yachimovich earned a remark on the limits of social democracy: "I don't know what kind of a social democrat is very sensitive to the poverty and suffering of his own people but is not equally sensitive to the poverty of someone who lives a mile away, in the occupied territories."
Today, three days after publication, the response from a Barak spokesman that accompanied the article reads very badly  (and not only in the communities bordering the Gaza Strip ): "The facts are that during Ehud Barak's tenure as defense minister, Israel has enjoyed quiet such as has not existed for many years ... " Another part of this response, as well as Yachimovich's full response, deserve their own column in order to examine their extraordinary arrogance and condescension  (Yachimovich, in the Hebrew version: "Haim Oron is considered an impressive individual, but to our regret ... " ).
The vote-getting talents of the successors to Barak and Oron are still an unknown quantity. What is known is that the left has been sliding down a slippery slope for 15 years. If it persists in whining about the damage wreaked by Barak and to babble on about what's more important, an apartheid state or social democracy, and does not transform the party institutions and with them its Knesset candidates, any possibility for the formation of a legislative bloc large enough to block the right - in other words, to redraw the political map - will be lost.
Oron, contrary to what some people say, was not Meretz's gravedigger. Yachimovich alone cannot save Labor. Oron was too weak to lead his movement to the creation of a new movement. His colleagues shot him in the foot, and he, with characteristic quiet, didn't provide cover for his other foot. His supporters outside the party were no big help, either.
The distance between expressing political support at a public event and closing a thriving law practice, resigning from a board of directors or taking a leave of absence from academia in order to run for election, was and remains great. If it cannot be bridged this time around, the left will disappear. Shochat and Oron continue, each in his own way, in what could be a last attempt to foment such a change. If it fails, well-meaning, enlightened leftists with justice on their side will be able to tell their children and their grandchildren where they were and what they were doing when Israel's lights went out.

<title>Deconstructing some pet theories </title>
<date>Fri Dec 02 03:50:48 IST 2011</date>
<content>
 Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken's essay in last Friday's paper  ("The necessary elimination of democracy," November 25 ) represents a contrived attempt to shoehorn current events to fit pet theories long endorsed by the Israeli left. 
 The left has consistently argued that if the settlement project over the Green Line was maintained, its baleful influence would eventually seep back within the Green Line and contaminate Israeli democracy. As the Israeli government per Schocken is merely the cat's paw of Gush Emunim, the settler movement, it has endorsed the current legislative campaign and its three major thrusts: preventing foreign meddling via politicized NGOs; restoring the Supreme Court to the relative judicial restraint that characterized it before the Likud took power in 1977; and redressing the balance between the press and the victims of press libel. 
 Having taken the thoroughbred endangered democracy hobby horse for a canter, Schocken also trots out two venerable nags: the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, which he says abruptly terminated a process that would have extricated Israel from its descent into dictatorship and apartheid; and, the fact that Israel paid for abandoning the "Rabin legacy" by sustaining aggravated isolation and helplessness when confronting the Iranian nuclear program. 
 Schocken's major thrust recalls the old joke about the Jew who voraciously consumed the anti-Semitic press. When pressed to explain his perverse delight, the Jew replied that he enjoyed discovering that Jews wielded such power. The settlement movement can similarly only dream of the power Amos Schocken attributes to it. 
 Had Schocken made this argument in 1980 rather than 2011, he would have still have been wrong but less wildly implausible. Then, the settlement movement was at its zenith, after Menachem Begin's ascent to power in 1977 and his festive promise of many Elon Morehs  (the flagship settlement nucleus of the long-deceased Gush Emunim that Schocken resurrects from the dead in his opinion piece ). In their period of peak power, both the Begin government and Gush Emunim acquiesced to the Supreme Court, which then enjoyed a better reputation for impartiality, in its ruling on the 1979 Elon Moreh case, in which it mandated the evacuation of a settlement built on private land without convincing security justification. 
 Ever since, the settlement movement has been in retreat, rather than steadily accumulating power, as Schocken argues. Jewish communities are now confined to the "pale of settlement" carved out in the 1980s, and building has effectively been frozen by the Netanyahu government to the extent that an announcement of construction in Efrat  (deep in the consensus settlement blocs ) or even Jerusalem arouses attention. Conversely, Arab construction continues without any restrictions, with the new Palestinian city of Rawabi providing convincing testimony. 
 If apartheid roads do exist in Judea and Samaria, it is Jewish travel they effectively bar, sometimes onerously extending a commute to work or school. The major arteries that serve Jews are open to Palestinian traffic. We experienced in 2005 a disengagement/expulsion that razed the Jewish communities of Gaza and northern Samaria. A further installment was in the offing under Ehud Olmert, who announced in the midst of the Lebanon campaign the following year that the war's success would further accelerate the expulsions of Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria. It was only the failure of the Second Lebanon War that discredited Olmert sufficiently to thwart the plan. 
 Paradoxically, it was the same Olmert government, whose policy on settlements was largely congruent with Amos Schocken's, that sought to reclaim spheres of authority usurped by an activist court. The point man for this policy was then-Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann, a law professor whose political home was Meretz. Friedmann could in no way be depicted as an ally or tool of the settlers. He simply felt the need to restore the balance between the various branches of government. 
 It is incredible that anyone can still claim that Rabin's assassination thwarted Oslo, rather than providing it with a new lease on life. Rabin, who bribed two Knesset members to cross the aisle and pass Oslo B  (a ploy which, since it advanced a cause favored by the left, could not be considered a threat to democracy ), was sinking in the polls like a stone following the suicide-bombing offensive. He would have lost badly in an election, or he may have gone the route of Generals Moshe Ya'alon and Uzi Dayan, who originally supported Oslo but ultimately became critics of it. 
 Rabin's assassination ushered in a period of intellectual terror sponsored by the same people who currently bewail the purported threat to democracy. It provided a spurious "Rabin legacy" to enshrine and radicalize Oslo that was as manipulative and fraudulent as Stalin's recruitment campaign following the death of Lenin. 
 Equally fantastic is Schocken's argument that by sacrificing the settlements, Israel would have secured greater international support against Iran. Actually, Olmert peddled this grand bargain at Annapolis and received in return the U.S. National Intelligence Assessment downplaying the Iranian nuclear program. Europe was not about to abandon its critical and lucrative dialogue with Iran before it had become an obvious farce in the previous decade; the Obama administration - irrespective of settlements - would still have wasted years on engaging Iran, while China and Russia have remained wedded to a policy prioritizing energy security, trade and twisting Washington's tail over curbing the centrifuges. 
 The ideological gulf between my viewpoint and Amos Schocken's is wide, but what makes it more tragic is that it no longer centers on different conclusions one draws from the facts but on the facts themselves.

<title>Ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, or, democratic Israel at work</title>
<date>Thu May 12 02:04:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
It happened on the day after Independence Day, when Israel was immersed in praise of itself and its democracy almost ad nauseam, and on the eve of (virtually outlawed ) Nakba Day, when the Palestinian people mark the "catastrophe" - the anniversary of the creation of Israel. My colleague Akiva Eldar published what we have always known but for which we lacked the shocking figures he revealed: By the time of the Oslo Accords, Israel had revoked the residency of 140,000 Palestinians from the West Bank. In other words, 14 percent of West Bank residents who dared to go abroad had their right to return to Israel and live here denied forever. In other words, they were expelled from their land and their homes. In other words: ethnic cleansing.
While we are still desperately concealing, denying and repressing our major ethnic cleansing of 1948 - over 600,000 refugees, some who fled for fear of the Israel Defense Forces and its predecessors, some who were expelled by force - it turns out that 1948 never ended, that its spirit is still with us. Also with us is the goal of trying to cleanse this land of its Arab inhabitants as much as possible, and even a bit more. After all, that's the most covert and desired solution: the Land of Israel for the Jews, for them alone. A few people dared to say it outright - Rabbi Meir Kahane, Minister Rehavam Ze'evi and their disciples, who deserve a certain amount of praise for their integrity. Many aspire to do the same thing without admitting it.
The revelation of the policy of denying residency has proved that this secret dream is in effect the establishment's secret dream. There one doesn't talk about transfer, heaven forfend; nobody would think of calling it cleansing. They don't load Arabs onto trucks as they once did, including after the Six-Day War, and they don't shoot at them to chase them away - all politically incorrect methods in the new world. But in effect that's the goal.
Some people think it's enough if we make the lives of the Palestinians in the territories miserable to get them to leave, and many have in fact left. An Israeli success: According to the Civil Administration, about a quarter of a million Palestinians voluntarily left the West Bank in the bloody years 2000-2007. But that's not enough, so various and sundry administrative means were added to make the dream come true.
Anyone who says "it's not apartheid" is invited to reply: Why is an Israeli allowed to leave his country for the rest of his life, and nobody suggests that his citizenship be revoked, while a Palestinian, a native son, is not allowed to do so? Why is an Israeli allowed to marry a foreigner and receive a residency permit for her, while a Palestinian is not allowed to marry his former neighbor who lives in Jordan? Isn't that apartheid? Over the years I have documented endless pitiful tragedies of families that were torn apart, whose sons and daughters were not permitted to live in the West Bank or Gaza due to draconian rules - for Palestinians only.
Take Dalal Rasras, for example, a toddler with cerebral palsy from Beit Omar, who was recently separated from her mother for months only because her mother was born in Rafah. Only after her case was publicized did Israel let the mother return to her daughter "beyond the letter of the law" - the cruel letter of the law that does not permit residents of Gaza to live in the West Bank, even if they have made their homes there.
The cry of the dispossessed has now been translated into numbers: 140,000, only until the Oslo Accords. Students who went to study at foreign universities, businessmen who tried their luck abroad, scientists who went abroad for professional training, native Jerusalemites who dared to move to the West Bank temporarily - they all met the same fate. All of them were taken by the wind and expelled by Israel. They couldn't return.
Most amazing of all is the reaction of those responsible for the policy of ethnic cleansing. They didn't know. Maj. Gen. (res. ) Danny Rothschild, formerly the chief military governor with the euphemistic title "coordinator of government activities in the territories," said he heard about the procedure for the first time from Haaretz. It turns out that not only is the cleansing continuing, so is the denial. Every Palestinian child knows, and only the general doesn't. Even today there are still 130,000 Palestinians registered as "NLR," a heartwarming IDF acronym for "no longer a resident," as though voluntarily, another euphemism for "expelled." And the general who is considered relatively enlightened was unaware.
This is an absolute refusal to allow the return of the refugees - something that would "destroy the State of Israel." It's also an absolute refusal to allow the return of the people recently expelled. By next Independence Day we'll probably invent more expulsion regulations, and on the next holiday we'll talk about "the only democracy."

<title>Goldstone regrets</title>
<date>Mon Apr 04 00:42:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Retired Judge Richard Goldstone chaired a three-person fact-finding mission to investigate charges of war crimes on the part of Israel and Hamas during Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip two-and-a-half years ago. The commission disbanded after the report was submitted, and there is no procedure in place for revoking or revising it. Neither have its other members made their voices heard. As in other cases involving "water under the bridge," there is little weight given to regrets after time has elapsed or circumstances have changed.
Given these reservations, and in the spirit of the current tides sweeping the region, (in Libya, for example ), Goldstone's comments in The Washington Post should be taken for what they are worth. Goldstone was invited to chair the committee because of his standing as a jurist in South Africa, which moved from an apartheid regime to democracy (with all the problems that entails ), and because of his Jewish roots and basic sympathy for the State of Israel. The "Goldstone commission" and "Goldstone report" are brands associated with his name.
The dispute surrounding the report, published in September 2009, was concerned less with the facts on the ground and more with the significance attached to them. There was a bit of debate about the definition of "civilians" - for example, did it include Hamas people who earned their living as police in the daytime and were active in the terror attack system after work? But the main dispute was over the question of why civilians were being harmed: Was it a matter of intentional policy, an overriding order that was translated into implementation? Or were these exceptional cases, mostly unintentional, and had the minority of cases that turned out to be intentional properly addressed in legal or disciplinary forums?
The government of Israel and the Israel Defense Forces General Staff adhered from the outset, and rightly so, to the narrative of exceptions and investigations. The Goldstone report seemed to adopt as its working assumption, however, that these incidents were the outcome of policy - a view reinforced by rash declarations by government ministers. Also contributing to this interpretation was Israel's refusal to cooperate with the work of the fact-finding mission, lest this be taken as an endorsement.
Israel does not need a comparison with Hamas, whose members launch rockets at civilian sites in order to exculpate themselves. Its internal, moral obligation - and not just for reasons of international utility - is to do everything in its power to avoid harming the innocent. A certain amount of regret on Goldstone's part must not cause Israel to regret the limitations it has imposed on its army.

<title>Gov't protects the people, not the other way around</title>
<date>Fri Jan 14 02:35:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
The campaign of intimidation being waged by the right against left-wing organizations - which ranges from arbitrarily arresting activists and throwing them in prison, as in the case of Jonathan Pollak, to establishing parliamentary committees of inquiry - has one clear objective: to identify opposition to the government and its policies with rejecting the legitimacy of the state. The right is trying with all its might to inculcate the public consciousness with the idea that the government is the state and the government's interests are identical to the aims of Zionism.
It is a national duty to denounce this crude lie, both in Israel and abroad. It is a national duty to recite and teach that not every Knesset decision is legitimate. In a democracy, restrictions must be imposed on legislation, because the purpose of a liberal democratic regime is to protect human and civil rights and ensure equality.
When the legislature ignores these basic duties, it undermines the very reason for democracy's existence. Since the 17th century, liberal thought has recognized the right to oppose a government that infringes on fundamental rights, and this is a basic tenet of any free regime.
Similarly, it is a duty to resist legislation that would prevent non-Jewish Israeli citizens from living in Jewish communities. Now the old slogan "Yesha ze kan" [the West Bank and Gaza are here] is coming true: The settlements are taking over Israel. After all, for a regime of ethnic and religious separation to be established within the Green Line would be just a natural continuation of the apartheid regime that has been in effect in the territories for more than 40 years. Once that happens, it will be a mockery to continue to speak of Israeli democracy in the present tense.
Therefore, those who collaborate with this creeping Lieberman-ism, whether actively or passively, will bear responsibility for the real delegitimization of Israel worldwide. And we should not be surprised, or complain of anti-Semitism, when the European Parliament proposes drastic changes in Europe's relations with Israel. In these difficult times, it is only the human rights organizations that are saving Israel's honor.
One immediate conclusion is that when a parliamentary committee of inquiry whose only purpose is to intimidate the left is set up, it would be best to ignore its existence and refuse to appear before it. This committee has neither the moral nor the legal authority to force any citizen to attend its sessions.
If the committee wants to keep up an appearance of objectivity, it will have to open probes into all foreign sources of funding for all Israeli political bodies, including the sources that fund the Likud and Yisrael Beiteinu election campaigns. An investigation of left-wing bodies only, due to both its discriminatory, violent nature and the cheap demagoguery that will accompany it, does not deserve any kind of attention.
Finally, since there has been a great deal of talk recently about the analogy to McCarthyism, it is worth stressing that the situation here is worse than it was in the United States in the 1950s. On one hand, the Israeli Supreme Court lacks an entrenched constitutional status and contempt for it is only growing, while in the United States, it was the Supreme Court that eventually put a stop to this phenomenon. On the other hand, unlike McCarthy, Avigdor Lieberman is one of the pillars of the government, and McCarthyism has gained control of the political establishment itself.
Just as was true in Europe in the past, Lieberman-ism will most likely gradually destroy the last vestiges of the liberal right. And Israeli society will pay a heavy price for a political elite that has lost its way.

<title>Heading toward an Israeli apartheid state</title>
<date>Mon Apr 04 00:42:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
It has been 60 years since the apartheid state was established in South Africa. In March 1951, a few years after the racist National Party came to power, racial segregation was anchored in law. As was common in other countries that adopted racist laws in the 20th century, those in South Africa were accompanied by "laundered" explanations.
Hitler declared after the Nuremberg Race Laws were passed in 1935 that they would create a suitable basis for a separate but worthy existence for Jews in Germany alongside German society. The race laws in South Africa established that people of different colors cannot exist when mixed with each other - only in separate, protected spaces.
The tsunami of racist laws passed by the Knesset in recent months is also being explained by reasoned and worthy arguments: the right of small communities to preserve their own character (the Acceptance Committees Law ); the state's right to prevent hostile use of the funds it allocates to education and culture (the Nakba Law ); and the right to deny citizenship to persons convicted of espionage or treason (the Citizenship Law ). But I believe that as in other historical instances, the aim of this legislation is the gradual establishment of an apartheid state in Israel, and the future separation on a racial basis of Jews and non-Jews.
An apartheid state is not created in the blink of an eye. What was created in Germany in 1935 was the outcome of a long and sometimes violent debate, which had been ongoing since the middle of the 19th century, about the place of Jews in modern Germany and Europe. Indeed, the desire to isolate and distance the Jews from society - legally and socially - was part of the belief system of anti-Semites in Europe for decades before Hitler came into power.
In this respect the Nazi regime, along with other regimes that passed racial separation laws (among them those in Romania, Hungary, Italy and Vichy France in 1940 ), only anchored in legislation a reality that had already been enthusiastically received by the populace. Of course, when such laws were enacted, the regimes involved did not support or imagine that at the end of the road, a "final solution" was waiting in its Nazi format. However, once the seeds were sown, no one was able to figure out what fruit they would bear.
The historical background of the Israeli apartheid state-in-the-making that is emerging before our eyes should be sought in 1967. It is part of a process that has been going on for about 44 years: What started as rule over another people has gradually ripened - especially since the latter part of the 1970s - into a colonialism that is nurturing a regime of oppression and discrimination with regard to the Palestinian population. It is robbing that population of its land and of its basic civil rights, and is encouraging a minority group (the settlers ) to develop a crude, violent attitude toward the Arabs in the territories. This was exactly the reality that, after many years, led to the establishment of the apartheid state in South Africa.
In her book "The Origins of Totalitarianism," Hannah Arendt draws a sharp picture of the process of the development of the society of racial segregation in South Africa, from the start of the Dutch Boer colonialist settlement there. Assumption of racial superiority - the subordination of the black population - was the only way the "whites" could adjust to life in the midst of that race. The nurturance of feelings of racial supremacy, to which were added the belief in cultural superiority and the justification for economic exploitation - these are what, in a decades-long process, gave rise to the need to anchor this situation in proper legislation.
Thus, the dehumanization of the blacks, who at the start of the colonization period were perceived as no more than enhanced work animals, led to the establishment of a regime of racial separation 60 years ago in South Africa, which for decades left tens of millions of black people mired in a situation of harsh poverty, exploitation and atrophy.
It is not hard to identify this sort of worldview developing - with respect to Arabs - among widening circles of settlers in the territories and among their supporters within the (pre-Six Day War ) Green Line. It also has quite a number of supporters in the Knesset, even if they will not admit this outright.
Israeli racism, whose natural "hothouse" is the colonialist project in the territories, has long since spilled over into Israeli society and has been legitimized in the series of laws recently passed in the Knesset. Only people who avoid looking at the broad historical context of such a process are still able to believe it is possible to stop the emergence of an Israeli apartheid state without getting rid of the colonialist-racist grip on the territories.

<title>In dealing with flotilla, Israel is anything but smart</title>
<date>Thu Jul 07 03:16:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
CRETE - Like an anti-Semitic caricature, Israel has extended its long tentacles around the globe in an effort to stop 10 decades-old ships from sailing to Gaza. Many Israelis interpreted this as a great victory.
The story could be read as follows: The Greek government wanted to save people whom it surely views as eccentrics and professional trouble-makers, even if naive, from a traumatic and perhaps even fatal experience. The Greek foreign minister rejected claims that Israeli pressure led his government to ban the flotilla's departure. He explained that Greece wanted to prevent a "humanitarian disaster" in the event of a clash between the Israel Defense Forces and the protesters.
Indeed, a Greek police officer - one of those who tried  (in vain ) to discover from passengers on the Tahrir who was piloting their ship - did not beat around the bush. We wanted to save you from the Israeli army, he told one of them. The Jew of the blood libel, of whom one must be wary, has been replaced by an Israeli navy commando.
In anti-Semitic caricatures, the cunning Jew is doomed to lose and his control over the world is fated to come to an end. But Israel's government is revising the caricature and sketching a glorious victory. A war of attrition, in the form of mysterious breakdowns and unprecedented red tape by the Greek authorities, thwarted the flotilla's original plan to anchor off the Gaza coast. When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu openly thanked the Greek government, he knew full well what he was thanking it for.
We must now await future media leaks to know what exactly Greece received in exchange, other than closer military ties. Perhaps money, to complete the caricature?
This is a convenient time to be using pressure tactics. Greece's socialist government is in a fragile situation, as the European Union and the International Monetary Fund are forcing the country to adopt an austerity plan that most of its people oppose. True, the fact that Greece has become a subcontractor of the Israeli army did not bring the masses into the streets, but there is no doubt about it: The sympathy of the Greek soldiers who arrested the Tahrir's passengers and of the bureaucrats who delayed them was with the flotilla and with Gaza, not with their government's orders. That's all we need: another country whose government gets along well with Israel in complete opposition to popular sentiment.
The flotilla's organizers added a term from the world of business and globalization to their description of Israel's domination of the Palestinians. Israel, they said, was outsourcing the industry of the blockade on Gaza. In exchange for reward, a foreign government - Greece - took on an active role and adopted a deliberate policy of keeping the Gaza Strip one huge prison.
Logic dictates that a government whose policy validates anti-Semitic stereotypes ought to worry Israelis and Jews worldwide. But the Israeli government is doing what its voters want and believe in. For there is one stereotype that has not been recycled here: that of the wise Jew.
Outsourcing, aggressive and vocal diplomacy and ridiculous lies thwarted the flotilla, but they have not taken Gaza off the international agenda. If Israel - which knew full well that there was not one gram of explosives aboard the ships - had let them sail to Gaza, the flotilla would not have preoccupied the international media as it did.
Blocking the flotilla did not discourage the organizers, who are graduates of the anti-apartheid and anti-white supremacy struggles. Rather, it provided ample proof of how white Israel is. As a result, blocking the flotilla only increased their motivation to keep placing the Palestinians' demand for freedom at the forefront of the international agenda.

<title>In lieu of a holiday interview </title>
<date>Wed Apr 20 01:01:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for agreeing to answer our questions, despite your tendency to avoid interviews with the print media. We'll open, of course, with the diplomatic situation.
"Our political situation is excellent. The wave of revolutions in Arab countries and the expected collapse of those regimes still standing show the West that Israel is its only dependable ally in the Middle East."
The situation is excellent? The defense minister has warned of an approaching "diplomatic tsunami" in September and that Israel will be denounced and ostracized as an apartheid state - and you think everything is fine?
"We have disagreements with our friends in the West over the settlements in Judea and Samaria, but that is nothing new and it is not expected to change. What has changed is the strategic situation in the region. Iran is growing stronger and the moderate regimes have disappeared. We've seen the poor job the NATO forces are doing in Libya. They don't have enough strength or determination to fight even a legitimate target like Muammar Gadhafi. The only power protecting Western interests in the Middle East and preventing the region from falling to Iran is the Israel Defense Forces."
Next month you will address the U.S. Congress. What do you plan to say?
"Exactly what I have just told you: That America has no better partner and ally than Israel, and that the current situation in the Middle East proves this."
What partnership? Everybody knows that President Barack Obama can't stand you, and sees you as responsible for the diplomatic freeze - which makes his Nobel Peace Prize look like a joke.
"Politics is comprised of interests, not love. Churchill and Roosevelt couldn't stand each other, but together they defeated Hitler. Beyond Israel's strategic importance, Obama also has domestic considerations. He's running for reelection, and Israel enjoys great sympathy among the American public. Why would he irritate his voters and supporters?
"I don't know what Obama thinks of me deep down, but his practical policy supports us. He vetoed the condemnation of the settlements in the United Nations; he postponed the meeting of the Quartet that was to have moved a forced solution forward. Before the Passover seder, he called to wish me a happy holiday; we talked about our cooperation in the war against terror and the success of Iron Dome. I'm sure our relationship will only continue in this way."
Why will you speak in English on Capitol Hill and not in Hebrew?
"Because the public at home accepts my evaluation of the situation - that we do not now have a Palestinian partner for an agreement, and that with the region in flames, we must not take any chances. We have to keep the Palestinian Authority under our control in Judea and Samaria, continue with controlled settlement construction and deter Hamas in Gaza, while keeping open the option to attack Iran during the summer."
But even if you persuade Congress, and Obama offers his support, you'll still have a serious problem in Europe. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel don't believe you, and British Prime Minister David Cameron is ignoring you.
"That's why I'm looking for a nice fat bone to throw to the Europeans so they won't support the declaration of a Palestinian state in September; a package of steps on the ground, maybe even a withdrawal from a few hilltops, just so they'll calm down."
Did I hear you correctly? Withdrawal? Would Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman let you withdraw - and not use the situation as an opportunity to bring you down and take over as the leader of the right wing?
"What right wing? Lieberman is scared of going to jail and he's trying to kowtow to the prosecution and the leftist media. He only just heard about the indictment against him, and he's already proposed formulating a final status agreement with Tzipi Livni, who supports withdrawal from almost every inch of the territories. He lashes out at me sometimes, but he doesn't really have anywhere else to go. He will support whatever decisions I make."
And finally, we must ask you about your trips with your wife Sara to fine hotels and castles, traveling abroad via private jets. Looking back, don't you think you overdid it a bit with the minibars, the spas and the laundry service?
Netanyahu unwraps a cigar and smiles. "Nu, I got out of that nicely, didn't I? The comptroller is investigating everyone's trips, [journalist] Raviv Drucker is busy defending himself against my libel suit, and now everybody's preoccupied with Lieberman's indictment."
Thank you very much and enjoy your Passover holiday.
"The same to you and your readers - and don't forget to grab a copy of the booklet 'Talking Facts,' which I wrote about the government's achievements."

<title>Israel has become a society of force and violence</title>
<date>Thu Jun 30 01:46:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Are we listening to ourselves? Are we still aware of the awful noise coming from here? Have we noticed how the discourse is becoming more and more violent and how the language of force has just about become Israel's only official language?
A group of international activists is slated to sail a flotilla to the shores of the Gaza Strip. Many of them are social activists and fighters for peace and justice, veterans of the struggle against apartheid, colonialism, imperialism, pointless wars and injustice. Just stating that is difficult here, since they have already been described as thugs.
There are intellectuals, Holocaust survivors and people of conscience among them. When they fought against apartheid in South Africa or the war in Vietnam, they won admiration for their actions even here. But to say an admiring word now about these people, some of whom are elderly, who are risking their lives and investing their money and time for a goal they see as just, is considered treason. It's possible that some violent people have intermingled with them, but the vast majority are people of peace, not haters of Israel but those who hate its injustices. They have decided not to remain silent - to challenge the existing order, which is unacceptable to them, which cannot be acceptable to any moral person.
Yes, they want to create a provocation - the only way to remind the world about Gaza's situation, in which no one takes an interest unless Qassam rockets or flotillas are involved. Yes, the situation in Gaza has improved in recent months, in part because of the previous flotilla. But no, Gaza is still not free - far from it. It has no outlet to the sea or air, there are no exports, and its inhabitants are still partially imprisoned. Israelis who freak out if Ben-Gurion International Airport shuts down for two hours should be able to understand what life without a port is like. Gaza is entitled to its freedom, and those aboard the flotilla are entitled to take action in an effort to achieve this. Israel should be allowing them to demonstrate.
But look at how Israel is reacting. The flotilla was described immediately, by everyone, as a security threat; its activists were classified as enemies, and there was no doubt cast on the ridiculous assumptions that defense officials are making and the press has lapped up eagerly. We haven't heard the last of the campaign to demonize the previous flotilla, in which Turkish citizens were killed for no reason, yet the new campaign has already begun. It has all the buzzwords: danger, chemical substances, hand-to-hand combat, Muslims, Turks, Arabs, terrorists and maybe some suicide bombers. Blood and fire and pillars of smoke!
The unavoidable conclusion is that there is only one way to act against the passengers aboard the flotilla: by force, and only by force, as with every security threat. This is a recurring pattern: first demonization, then legitimization (to act violently ). Remember the tall tales about sophisticated Iranian weaponry coming through arms-smuggling tunnels in Gaza, or those about how the Strip was booby-trapped? Then Operation Cast Lead came along and the soldiers hardly encountered anything like that.
The attitude toward the flotilla is a continuation of the same behavior. The campaign of scare tactics and demonization is what contributes to the violent rhetoric that is taking over the entire public discourse. For what will Israelis think about when they are spoon-fed scary stories about the flotilla, if not about the use of force? Those activists want to kill Israel Defense Forces soldiers? We'll arise and kill them first.
Now the politicians, the generals and the commentators are competing with one another over who can provide the most frightening description of the flotilla, who can most inflame the public, who can best praise the soldiers who will save us, and who can deliver the most pompous rhetoric of the kind one would expect before a war. One important commentator, Dan Margalit, has already waxed poetic in his newspaper column: "Blessed are the hands," he wrote of the hands that sabotaged one of the ships meant to take part in the flotilla. That's another thuggish and illegal action, one that wins immediate applause here, without anyone asking: By what right?
This flotilla, too, will not get through. The prime minister and the defense minister have promised us this. Once again Israel will show them, those activists, who's more of a man - who's strongest and who's in charge, in the air, on land and at sea. The "lessons" of the previous flotilla have been learned well - not the lessons of the pointless killing or the violent and unnecessary takeover of the ship, but of the humiliation of Israel's military.
But the truth is the real humiliation lies in the fact that naval commandos were deployed to intercept the ships in the first place, and that is something that reflects on us all: how we have become a society whose language is violence, a country that seeks to resolve nearly everything by force, and only by force.

<title>Israel has to choose: Mideast peace or apartheid </title>
<date>Fri May 13 03:22:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Having all Palestinian political factions come together for national reconciliation was an emotional experience for all Palestinians who witnessed the events taking place in Cairo. The Arab Spring has finally reached Palestine. The left, the religious right, and the nationalist camp − across the Palestinian political spectrum − with the support of the new Egyptian government, reached an agreement to establish a technocratic administration in order to hold elections within one year and rebuild the Gaza Strip. This is a critical step in our path toward freedom and independence.
This ceremony was a representation of the will of our people. After the reconciliation ceremony, a young boy from Gaza was reported to have said, “I call on Fatah, Hamas and the rest of the factions to march hand in hand toward independence, to open and build our country.” From the mouths of babes come the most simple and powerful sentiments. In this case, that sentiment represents those of Palestinians everywhere, from Chile to Lebanon.
As President Mahmoud Abbas said in Cairo, with the establishment of a government of national unity, we will have closed one of the darkest periods in the history of our people.
Palestinians are looking forward now. We will continue to work hard on gaining international recognition for the State of Palestine in the 1967 border with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Today, we have received such recognition from 112 countries. The latest vote in the UN Security Council calling for an end to settlement expansion ‏(14 countries voting in favor and the United States against‏) shows unprecedented support for the Palestinian position: The Israeli occupation of Palestinian land must end.
Under the leadership of President Abbas, we are concluding the process of building Palestinian institutional capacities. According to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations and the European Union, Palestine has reached a point where it is ready to take the reins of state. Only the Israeli occupation stands in the way of our progress.
In September 2011, a united Palestinian people will go to the United Nations to request that the State of Palestine be admitted as a full member of the UN. It is time for Israel to stop denying freedom to the Palestinian people. We deserve to live free just like all other peoples in the world. Our message is very simple: The Palestinian people will not remain hostage to Israeli intransigence and unilateralism; settler violence and expansion are not going to stop us.
National reconciliation will also re-energize and empower our nonviolent struggle for justice and peace. We have been inspired by the determination shown weekly by young Palestinians and Israelis, Europeans and Americans, demonstrating together every Friday against the Israeli occupation policies in dozens of places, from Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan to Bil’in and Nabi Saleh.
So as we continue our efforts at uniting our people and building our state, we call on Israel not to interfere in domestic Palestinian politics. Israelis are free to elect whomever they choose to represent them, whether they be from the peace or the anti-peace camp. We have respected their choice by negotiating with every single Israeli government since 1991, including with the current Israeli coalition government, not a single member of which recognizes Palestinian national rights.
The choice is not between Hamas and Israel, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested. The choice is between settlement-colonies or states: between accepting two states with the 1967 border outlining the shape of the future for Israelis and Palestinians where real peace is possible, or maintaining an apartheid regime that will define our relationship with Israelis as one of oppressor and oppressed. We have clearly made our choice; we are waiting for Israel to do the same.
Only days before our national reconciliation, Prime Minister Netanyahu complained to the international community regarding the lack of a unified Palestinian government. He asked, “Shall I make peace with Gaza or with the West Bank?” To Netanyahu we can now reply, “You shall make peace with the State of Palestine.” Netanyahu may persist to find excuses why he will not negotiate in good faith with us, and we will persist to take our case to the United Nations.
Gaza is not to be regained by bullets but by the ballot box. The way to peace is through reconciliation and democracy. I hope that Israelis and the international community will stand shoulder to shoulder with us in order to support peace and reconciliation between Palestinians and Israelis by ending the Israeli occupation and consolidating a sovereign Palestinian state in the 1967 border.
The writer is the chief Palestinian negotiator.

<title>Israeli courts must end anti-Arab discrimination</title>
<date>Wed Aug 03 02:42:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Israeli courts discriminate against Israeli Arabs. If there had been any doubt left about this, a comprehensive, first-of-its-kind study commissioned by Israel's Courts Administration and the Israel Bar Association just determined it decisively.
According to the study, whose main findings were reported by Tomer Zarchin in yesterday's Haaretz, Arabs are given jail sentences more often than Jews convicted of the same offenses, and Arabs receive longer sentences than Jews who are jailed. The study's authors conclude that their most conspicuous finding is the tendency of Israeli courts to treat Arab defendants more harshly: When Arabs wind up in court, they are more likely to be convicted; when convicted, they are likely to receive a stiffer sentence than a Jew normally would. It's hard to imagine a more disturbing fact.
This is no longer just a matter of discrimination on the basis of national identity by small communities' admissions committees or by bouncers at nightclubs. This isn't just a matter of budgetary discrimination. This worrisome paroxysm has already reached its pinnacle: the court system itself, which is supposed to serve as society's beacon of law and justice.
The Courts Administration and the Bar Association did well to commission the study. But now, it is incumbent upon the court system to eradicate this plague of systematic discrimination.
Israel's judges dwell among their people, but they must not allow themselves to become infected by the racist mood that is spreading through Israeli society. On the contrary, the court system must battle against this morally reprehensible attitude.
Arab citizens must have equal rights in every regard - but first and foremost when dealing with the law enforcement system. They must know they will never face discriminatory sentencing because of their national identity. This essential condition, however, is not currently being met.
Every level of the court system, from the Supreme Court down, must designate this as one of its most pressing and important missions - to grant equal treatment to all who appear before it. Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch must send an urgent and unequivocal message to every judge in Israel: Sentencing discrimination against Arabs must end. Racism? Not in the courts.
Because otherwise, those who accuse Israel of maintaining an apartheid regime will be justified with regard to Israel's own Arab citizens.

<title>Israeli policy will end up isolating it to the point of sanctions</title>
<date>Wed May 18 02:29:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
In an op-ed piece in yesterday's New York Times, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas wrote that the Palestinian initiative to obtain international recognition for an independent state along the 1967 borders is not a stunt.
Approaching the United Nations, he wrote, was aimed at assuring the basic right of the Palestinian people to live freely in an independent state along the June 4, 1967 borders, i.e., in 22% of Mandatory Palestine.
Abbas repeated the Arab League formula for a just and agreed-upon solution to the refugee problem on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 194. He also said that the decision to approach the international community came after years of fruitless negotiations with Israel about permanent arrangements, and Israel's continuing control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to the Knesset plenum on Monday strengthens the Palestinian claim that direct diplomacy with Israel is a dead end, and justifies the Palestinians' petition to the United Nations.
Only minutes after praising Theodor Herzl, who in fact knew how to adapt his vision to changing realities, Netanyahu sketched out a diplomatic plan devoid of vision and totally detached from the new reality developing in the region.
On the eve of his meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama and his address to a joint session of Congress, Netanyahu presented obsolete positions. He refrained from mentioning the 1967 borders as a starting point for a final-status arrangement, and committed to demanding a military presence along the Jordan River, to perpetuating the annexation of East Jerusalem and to demanding Palestinian recognition of Israel as the home of the Jewish people.
The prime minister even made canceling the reconciliation agreement between Fatah and Hamas a condition for resuming negotiations.
Government policy, as expressed in Netanyahu's speech, will end up isolating Israel to a point that it could face economic and cultural sanctions similar to those once imposed on apartheid South Africa. Responsibility for such a crisis will lay squarely on the shoulders of the prime minister and his colleagues at the top of the diplomatic ladder. The price will be paid by the public, partying on a slippery slope.

<title>Israeli right-wingers, you're in control, so stop whining</title>
<date>Sun Jul 03 02:19:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
 
A foreigner who heard Israel's  (very shallow ) political debate would surely conclude that the left has been ruling the country unchallenged for many years. All aspects of government are in its hands, and it runs them as it sees fit. The legal system is left-wing, the army is left-wing, the police are left-wing, the prosecutors are left-wing, the education system is left-wing and the media is horrifyingly left-wing.
The right is all but obliterated, its activists arrested and their rights trampled on. The settlement enterprise, discriminated against and dejected, groans under the brunt of the leftist regime, the Arab citizens are blissfully overprivileged and rabbis are wantonly persecuted. A foreigner hearing all this moaning and groaning would conclude that the right-wingers are ruthlessly oppressed.
This was always the rightist way - the way of the robbed Cossack, the rich and cruel robber who not only robs but protests that he is the real victim. The right has never admitted that it took power 34 years ago and has hardly been out of power since. It has never acknowledged that the country has been galloping to the right for years; neither does it recognize that Israel today is ruled by the most rightist-nationalist government in its history, one of the most right-wing, nationalist governments in the world, and the parliament barely rests between one piece of anti-democratic legislation and the next.
Weep and legitimize, weep some more and acquire more loot - this is the way of the robbed Cossack. The cynical manipulation has proved itself: Quite a few of the right's achievements have been won through complaining and blackmailing, weeping and self-victimizing. All these methods have been breaking records in recent weeks. Anyone listening to right-wing spokesmen would think Israel is an apartheid state - an apartheid against the disenfranchised right-wingers.
Just take the settlement project. No group seems to complain about its woes as incessantly as the settlers. Their construction is frozen, their houses are demolished, their movements are constrained, their leaders are persecuted, their produce is boycotted. Gewalt - they even get called "settlers."
Reality, of course, is the exact opposite. No group terrorizes all sides of government as incessantly, plotting and extorting. Its enterprise is blooming, receiving constant investments in the billions of shekels, practically untouched by the law, feared by the army, police, government, prosecution and courts. Violent settlers roam free, murderers are freed from prison almost immediately, land robbers and arsonists are not even questioned.
But for this group nothing is ever enough. Let's start an almighty din over the hour-long detention of a rabbi, in the robbed Cossack tradition. And this method is proving itself: Next time, the police will think twice before they dare.
The right-wingers portray the courts, which discriminate for the settlers and against the Palestinians, as persecutors. They portray the Supreme Court, the one that has never called the settlement enterprise illegal, the one that decade after decade has rejected petitions demanding human rights and law enforcement in the territories, the one that has yielded every so often to the military - even that court they audaciously portray as left-wing. Even Deputy State Prosecutor Shai Nitzan and Col. Nitzan Alon are lefties, it turns out.
The same description is applied to the media. Preposterously, the media, which on some matters takes an establishment, not to say governmental, propagandist and biased line, which blindly and automatically recites the defense establishment's positions on nearly every issue, is described as "a leftie mafia." The same description is applied to the military radio station, in which debates between "left" and right are conducted between the right and the radical right. And this method is proving itself, of course: The media apologizes, gets defensive and drifts ever further to the right.
So here's a reminder for right-wingers. You're in control. You've been in control for years. You'll probably be in control for many years to come. You're legislating right-wing laws and running a right-wing policy, and there's nobody to stop you. So please, stop your wailing, the moan of the robbed Cossack. You don't need it anymore.

<title>Israel's diplomats are spineless propagandists</title>
<date>Sun Mar 06 01:53:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
This happened long ago: I wanted to get accepted into the Foreign Ministry's cadets course. Israel was a different country then, my views about the state were not the same as they are today and Israel's envoys abroad were actually ambassadors. Lots of champagne has flowed since then; and, fortunately, I was not accepted. Of course, it would be impossible for me to ever explain the country's policies today. Somewhat belatedly, Ilan Baruch, a veteran Israeli diplomat, acknowledged his inability to represent or explain these policies either. Last week he handed in his resignation letter, a resonating and impressive document that ought to be studied in the next cadets course.
His vision may be impaired - Baruch was wounded in one eye during the War of Attrition - but he managed to see something that still remains opaque to his colleagues: Israel's "malignant dynamic," as he phrased it. As a result of this dynamic, he summoned the courage to resign - a decision that should be commended. Baruch's resignation and the cowardly silence of his colleagues exposed the decrepit state of Israel's choir of ambassadors.
Our diplomatic corps today is comprised primarily of spineless propagandists void of values or a conscience. Certainly there are some diplomats among them who identify with the current government's policies, and perhaps even the scandalous behavior of its foreign minister. But the truth is apparently more sordid: A large portion of them oppose the conduct of the state they represent. They are nothing more than puppets in an ugly show window, backup singers for Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman.
Probably better than any other Israelis, the diplomats know what the world thinks of Israel, and why. They know that under Lieberman's watch the Foreign Ministry has become a vessel of rage toward the entire world. They know that no ambassador is sufficiently adroit to explain the brutality of Operation Cast Lead, or the pointless killing on the Mavi Marmara ship. They know that no country on the planet actually accepts the occupation, the settlements or the indications of Israeli apartheid. They know that no diplomat out there can persuade anyone that Israel is truly aimed toward achieving peace. They know that there is a new world alignment out there - one with no patience for tyranny of the kind enforced by Israel's occupation.
They know all of this, yet they keep quiet. We already have pilots who refuse to carry out orders, and soldiers who refuse to serve against their conscience; yet until the patriot Ilan Baruch spoke out, Israel did not have a single diplomat who refused to carry out policies that conflict with his or her moral sense.
True, in this new era, an ambassador's role has lost much of its substance. The connection between a diplomat's swollen sense of self-importance and his actual task has become tenuous. Virtually all that remains is power, prestige, fancy cars, opulent residences and other relics from the days of great empires, when ambassadors served at great distances from their home countries. Most diplomats stationed around the world today are simply policy advocates. But, as opposed to advocates who represent criminals in court, ambassadors need to identify to a large extent with those who send them on their diplomatic errands.
It can be assumed that a certain portion of Israel's diplomatic corps lack such an ideological and emotional sense of identification, but simply keep quiet about it. Many simply want to serve their country faithfully, and thus they try to peddle, despite everything, the product of "beautiful Israel." The result can be pathetic.
I recently caught an interview conducted at one of our consulates in the United States with the Israeli who created the "Zenga Zenga" clip lampooning Muammar Gadhafi (the latest YouTube sensation ); following that, they presented a winning Israeli recipe for an eggplant dish. Excellent! Such ambassadors warrant the disparaging "cocktail-shmocktail" description David Ben-Gurion allotted them.
True, it's not easy to be an Israeli ambassador in this day and age - not because of the world's hostility toward us, but because of the country's policies. What is an ambassador supposed to say about his nation's "efforts for peace" when his foreign minister states before the United Nations that such efforts have no chance? And what is a diplomat supposed to say about the democratic character of his state at a time when the Palestinians live without rights?
It's not easy to stand in judgment of others, and demand that they relinquish their careers and their ephemeral glory. But is it excessive to expect that they make their voices heard and show some fortitude? Some integrity? They should look at their colleague, Baruch, the blessed.

<title>Israel's left now has a chance to awaken the public</title>
<date>Wed Aug 24 03:02:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Were Shelly Yachimovich the only one to raise the banner of selective justice, there would be no need to state here that the settlements are no sin in exactly the same way that traffic in women is no crime and concentrating Jews from Arab lands in weakened towns on the periphery is no injustice. There would be no reason to recall that once, there was a consensus over slavery, and that there is ever only one Master; he merely changes his name from time to time: men in a patriarchal society, whites in South Africa, Jews in the state for Jews-above-all.
Unfortunately, however, many activists in and supporters of the Israeli protest movement accept the logic of social-nationalist justice. Were Yachimovich in the minority, at least 10 percent of the quarter-million demonstrators would have protested against the wall of sin in Walaja, Bil'in, Na'alin and Ma'asara. They would have marched en masse to the stolen Nebi Saleh spring and liberated it. Then, they would have returned home with the soldiers, together prevented the destruction of houses in Lod and demonstrated in front of the Interior Ministry until its bureaucrats were ordered to immediately prepare a master plan for every unrecognized village, starting with Al-Araqib. It's so simple.
Because Yachimovich represents the many, does that mean that leftists  (both Jewish and Palestinian ) ought to desist from their internal debate over whether to participate in a protest movement whose justice is selective and simply walk away? If this new social movement were a final paper awaiting a grade, the answer would be "Yes. This is a movement that launders the dispossession of Palestinians both past and present with superficial yuppie charm. We do not belong in it, so we'll return to the tear gas, the rubber-coated steel bullets and the arrests."
But the social movement that sprung up in Israel this summer is not a final paper. Nor is it a political party. It is a process, a new and developing situation that reinvents itself frequently, an intensive course in developing political understanding. It must not be left to the new-old social right.
In effect, the challenge goes much deeper than merely conflicting opinions. Yachimovich frankly enunciated our position as Israeli Jews: We are profiting from the occupation even as we groan under regressive taxation. Whether our families came from Katrielevka or Baghdad, we are profiting from the structural discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel and from the very fact that they have become a minority in their own land.
So is the solution to this troubling existential dilemma simply to leave? To emigrate to countries free of injustice and dispossession, like the United States of America, Germany or South Africa, in which apartheid based on class is competing successfully with its predecessor, apartheid based on race?
Internal contradictions are the daily fare of liberation struggles, and purist excuses for not participating don't resolve them. As the female activists of every national liberation struggle know quite well, patriarchy is not a secondary, negligible mechanism of oppression compared to colonialism. Sexism was present in the Solidarity Movement in Poland and the African National Congress in South Africa. Nevertheless, women joined these movements and were active in their ranks.
The role of the left - for whom the value of equality is its Ten Commandments - is not to look on from the sidelines and make do with handing out grades. The left must try to influence this new, dynamic process. Its role is to learn from other people's struggles and to teach, without lowering itself, while abandoning the arrogance of the past and bearing in mind the terrible wrongs committed in its name.
Leftist activists are educated to make use of their excess privileges insofar as possible to fight the whole system of privileges. Now, when, there is a collective awakening from long years of apathy, the left can and must use the experience, knowledge and human and cultural capital it has accumulated. For there is now a great chance of proving to at least parts of this awakening public that the benefits of occupation today are the strategic danger of tomorrow.

<title>Israel still has a partner for peace </title>
<date>Tue Jan 25 00:56:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
On Sunday, Haaretz reported on Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman's proposal to promote a long-term interim arrangement with the Palestinians. A few hours later, Al Jazeera and the Guardian published documents detailing the negotiations over the final-status arrangement held between the previous government and the Palestinian leadership headed by Mahmoud Abbas.
The documentation, conducted by the Palestinian team heads, illustrates the serious and down-to-business approach of the Palestinians with regards to the central core issues - borders, Jerusalem and holy places.
The documents testify yet again that Israel has found a pragmatic Palestinian partner, interested in implementing the two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders. This solution consists of border adjustments that would enable annexing a considerable part of the settlements, in this way gaining international recognition for annexing the Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem.
The Palestinians even said they were ready to discuss a special regime in the Old City. The documents point to the isolated West Bank settlements of Ma'aleh Adumim and Ariel and to the Har Homa neighborhood at the Jerusalem city limits - established after the Oslo agreements - as the main obstacles to a fair, sensible demographic partition.
The documents include a transcript of the statements made by Negotiations Department head Saeb Erekat at a meeting with American officials about a year ago. It reflects the Palestinian leadership's deep frustration with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to open a serious debate on the central issues. Without a solution to these issues, Netanyahu's declarations in support of a two-state solution are devoid of meaning.
Lieberman's argument that the documents prove a long-term interim agreement is the only realistic solution is groundless. Olmert's government ended its term before having completed the final-status negotiations. There is not, nor will there be, a Palestinian partner to a 20-year - or more - interim arrangement without delineating permanent borders and reaching an agreed upon solution to the refugees problem.
If Israel continues to prefer expanding the settlements to ensuring its status as a Jewish democratic state, we will lose the last Palestinian partner who could prevent its perpetuation as an isolated, condemned apartheid state.

<title>Itamar murders don’t justify stripping Palestinians' rights  </title>
<date>Wed Apr 20 01:01:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
The Israeli settlement enterprise does not need the murder of Jewish families in order to strip Palestinian families of their land and endanger the future of both peoples. But when such a murder "falls into its hands," the settlement enterprise knows how to make the most out of it, by building new neighborhoods and outposts, blaming Palestinian nature and education, and dropping biblical terms like "bitter enemies" and "Amalek."
The history of white settlement in other peoples' countries is full of sickening murders carried out by individuals who belonged to the indigenous peoples or by African slaves. These actions did not prevent the systematic expulsion and near extinction of the original inhabitants. It is not acts of murder that brought an end to slavery or apartheid. At the same time, abominable murders in Algeria did not make French colonialism, or any other colonialism, legitimate.
At the time, the whites attributed the murders to the nature of the savages, their inborn viciousness and their lowly race. The takeover and murderous enslavement were regarded as a divine and courageous mission and as a means of preserving law and order. Now, decades or centuries later, many recognize the brutality that characterized the settlement enterprise of their forefathers.
The attempt to guess what will be in 150 years is best left to soothsayers. We are interested in today and tomorrow. And today we must take seriously the words of the former chief rabbi of the Israel Defense Forces, Brig. Gen. Avichai Ronski, one of the founders of Itamar. Speaking in an interview with the Walla news website, even before the release of the names of the suspects in the murder of the Fogel family, Ronski said: "A village like this, like Awarta, from which the murderers of the Fogel family and of the Shebo family emerged, must suffer as a village. A situation must be created whereby the inhabitants prevent anyone in this village from harming Jews. Yes, it is collective punishment. They must not be allowed to sleep at night, they must not be allowed to go to work, they must not be allowed to drive their cars. There are many ways."
Not a single word about the two murderers who came from Itamar or about the Authorities of Law and Order which excelled at not finding the murderers of two other Palestinian farmers who had been shot to death near Itamar.
Even before the suspects were caught, the soldiers punished Awarta collectively. After all, in the jargon of Israeli street judgments, a Palestinian is convicted even before he becomes a suspect.
The gag order on the investigation of the murder did not allow us to write what the army did in the village during the past month. But why, in order to collect fingerprints or DNA samples, did soldiers have to break washing machines, refrigerators, televisions and toys? Why should bags of rice, sugar and bottles of oil be emptied on the floor?
But for our former chief military rabbi this is not enough. He is demanding more. Will his former colleagues, still in uniform, not follow orders? Will his spiritual pupils not translate his words into deeds? And whoever protests will be accused of condoning the slaughter of infants.
But even without murder, the Palestinian villages suffer, as do the cities and towns, at the hands of the settlers and the Israeli authorities. There is abuse by individuals and structural and institutional abuse. All are exacting revenge on the Palestinians because this is their land. The individuals are taking over olive groves and water springs, and they expel people from their homes. The authorities are prohibiting construction and planting, confiscating land by the force of decrees, destroying houses and expelling. The water sources have been taken over long time ago. And everything is immersed in a mikveh of court rulings.
Our law and order authorities do not protect the Palestinian villages from the thugs who "exact a price" from Palestinians in revenge for the razing of an unauthorized settlers' hut by authorities. How can we expect them to protect the Palestinians against the avengers of the murder of the Fogel family? The settlers are sent there by the state. How can we expect the state to prevent them from continuing to do what they have been sent to do? To plunder, abuse and sabotage the future for all of us.

<title>It isn't about the camel </title>
<date>Fri Feb 25 02:10:48 IST 2011</date>
<content>
 I was at Ben-Gurion airport, about to board a return flight to Paris recently, when I spotted a brochure rack - the last item that caught my eye before I entered the ramp to the plane. It displayed colorful pocket-size leaflets in Hebrew. The title on the cover, "Masbirim Israel"  (Explaining Israel ), seemed intriguing enough. Ever the curious mind, I picked one up. After all, I spent a whole decade of my life in Israel, now I come to visit from France twice a year, most of my relatives and friends live in the country, and I'm still not sure what to make of Israel's many contradictions. Maybe this would enlighten me? 
 Surprise! The leaflet wasn't aimed at explaining Israel to departing visitors  (which would have been odd, but funny ). Rather, it is intended to prompt traveling Israelis to speak well of their homeland when journeying abroad - a most noble mission now made a lot easier, with all of Israel's achievements conveniently listed in a pamphlet small enough to be carried in a pocket or purse. The brochure, the brainchild of the Ministry of Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs, is the latest government effort to revamp Israel's image across the world. Data on Israel's global leadership in software development and technological innovations, on agricultural miracles in the desert - it's all in there, all of the modern-day Israeli public-relations razzmatazz. 
 One statement, though, truly stands out: "Since its creation," the leaflet says, "Israel has inscribed on its flag the respect of human rights and minority rights, and has been an outstanding democracy." Really? Why then did I see so many Israelis watch in anguish as a democratic tidal wave swept through Egypt from Tahrir Square? Why did a panicked Netanyahu keep waving, as the events unfolded, the red flag of an Islamic threat - one of two pillars of legitimation for his brand of leadership, the other being Ahmadinejad's Iran? 
 What Middle Eastern nation should have been the first to rejoice but the one that claims to have been an outstanding democracy - the only democracy in the region - since its inception? Why all the fear and guardedness, just at the dawn of such a movement, which might constitute the birth of the "third way" that Arab societies have been waiting for, to break away from the either-autocracy-or-else-theocracy conundrum? Why the hostility when this movement might, in fact, be the best news in a long time for Israel - a chance to perhaps see new Arab regimes that won't use the suffering of the Palestinians as a diversion to stall development and deny their own people a share of the global cake? It's far too early to tell, but is it completely impossible to imagine that Arab governments to come might not have hatred of Israel as their overriding guiding principle? 
 Of course, Israel's murky preference for autocratic regimes didn't start yesterday. It was already in evidence in the 1970s and 1980s when the country was a major arms and warfare expertise supplier for the military dictatorships of Latin America and Africa, and for the apartheid regime in South Africa. Israel's history has been enmeshed in the support of nondemocratic regimes. Not to mention its own record. Outstanding democracy? For Jewish Israelis only. Respect of minority rights? Ask the Bedouin in the Negev and the Palestinians in East Jerusalem about house demolitions. And, of course, there's the icing on the democratic cake: the occupation. 
 Despite all this, Israel wants to be seen as a full-fledged democracy. Of course pathetic propaganda campaigns reminiscent of Soviet days will never do the trick. So why does Israel even bother to create them? Perhaps because, most of all, Israel needs to convince itself. Its politics are more and more out of tune with the world. The West it so much wants to be part of now strives to achieve a form of democratic society based on inclusiveness and respect for people from all walks of life. Meanwhile, Israel is moving in the opposite direction. As its sense of isolation grows in the future, it will gradually lose the ability to comprehend how it is viewed from the outside. Self-delusion can protect it from having to face up to these harsh facts. But for how long? 
 One sign that Israel's march toward an increasingly autistic version of its former self is already under way may be the photo on the cover of the leaflet: A Western-looking man is seen holding the halter of a camel, and the caption above says, "The camel is a popular means of transportation in Israel." It takes the reader a few seconds to understand that this is an example of the myths the campaign was devised to debunk. Is this the kind of misperception the current government believes the world has of Israel, that it is some kind of backland in need of development and modern technology? Is this what they really think the problem is with Israel's image abroad? Think again, Ministry of Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs. It isn't about the camel.

<title>Katsav, not the president, is a rapist </title>
<date>Thu Jan 06 03:30:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
With former President Moshe Katsav's foolish behavior and his decisive conviction by the court, a new tune can now be heard in the public discourse: questioning the institution of the presidency. Who needs such a thing, a rapist president? We're wasting money that could instead be channeled into more positive ventures, such as helping the poor, they are saying. But these comments are not rooted in a profound discussion of the significance or symbolic value of the institution, but the fact that a convicted rapist served as president of the country.
This formula is based on a combination of words: Moshe Katsav the man, who committed rape, also served as president of Israel. The analogy has been made, and the phrase has begun to dominate the discourse: a rapist president. This phrase indicates our problematic use of language and the way in which our thinking is dependent on it. We shoot out words every day, we release them easily - after all, there is ostensibly no danger in the flow of words; with so many words out there, maybe nobody even notices one word or another.
But this is an illusion, that words are simply erased into thin air. In effect, we etch words into our consciousness. Words can construct a reality. For example, asking for forgiveness at a critical moment of tension will likely lead to reconciliation and the turning of a new leaf in relations.
In South Africa, during the transition period between the despotic apartheid government and the democratic government, which was still fighting for its establishment, the words "I'm sorry" coming from the former oppressors provided an opening for forgiveness and cooperation. Our reality is constructed in our minds from words, our thought processes are composed of words, and these words guide our perception of the world around us and the ways in which we orient ourselves on its complex paths.
And so the saying that words can kill is true, especially when these words include stereotypical terms, like racist or rapist. When certain rabbis issue a flyer that is defined as racist, suddenly all the rabbis become racists and the generalization is perpetuated. Over time, the word loses its dictionary meaning and becomes part of a new context, a magic word.
Eytan Sheshinski, for example, is no longer the man himself, but a symbol and expression of the pressures exerted by business tycoons and of surrendering to the omnipotent. A rapist president has now also become a symbol - and the reaction is that we should abolish the institution of the presidency. Journalists of all people must be particularly careful about the phrases they coin and perpetuate.
So many women are jumping for joy. "Skipping around the house like an idiot," says Merav Michaeli, quoting her friends, because they convicted the rapist, and all women everywhere are now "extremely excited." What is that, if not a generalization itself? Did the Katsav case provide an ultimate characterization of the rapist male sex? Don't these women understand that by using the stereotype, by generalizing that all men are rapists, by saying that only now, thanks to Judge George Karra  (oy, a man ) and his two female colleagues  (luckily women ), the men were caught before being able to carry out their evil intentions - don't they realize they're only reinforcing the gap between men and women?
The language of generalization is dangerous; it's the language of propaganda, the language of hatred, the demonic rhetoric of fascist regimes which fans the brotherhood of the masses through incitement against the other, based on stereotypes that reinforce such hatred. Generalization versus specifics. We of all people, here in Israel, must insist on specifics. Moshe Katsav himself was accused of rape, and was found guilty by the court. That's all; not every single male nor every single president.

<title>Left can unite to lead Israel once again</title>
<date>Fri Feb 25 02:10:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
For the first time in a long while, a real buzz is being felt among the left in Israel. Groups are getting organized with the intention of showing a presence in the street. The Labor Party, too, is waking up from a long period of paralysis imposed on it by Ehud Barak. However it will not be able to be a relevant force again in the politics of the left unless it separates itself, once and for all, from all those who cooperated with Barak in setting up the Netanyahu-Lieberman government.
True, not everyone who believed that the old-new leader would succeed in dragging Netanyahu to a peace agreement with the Palestinians deserves to be denounced at the pillory, but those who continued sitting in that government until they were thrown out, must go. In that way it will be possible to begin gathering the forces for establishing a credible social democratic party.
The major obstacle is the lack of willingness on the part of people with a coherent ideology to reach a compromise among themselves. There are a number of bodies currently active in the Zionist left that are divided by differences of nuance, and sometimes also of real content, but not by critical differences.
From the Sheikh Jarrah group to the "National Left"  (this term when translated into one of the European languages sounds really bad ) and including Meretz and those people from Labor who are sick and tired of the opportunism of their leaders, there is a sufficiently broad common denominator that can create a tool for changing the reality.
Indeed, they all share the opinion that an end must be put to the occupation and a Palestinian state must be established. They all have in common the understanding that a continuation of Israeli rule over the Palestinians will create an apartheid state here or destroy Israel as a country in which the Jewish majority enjoys sovereignty and self-rule.
They are all repulsed by the burgeoning racism that is spreading through this society at the initiative of the right wing. And what is no less important, they are all convinced that economic neoliberalism is a recipe for social disaster and eventually also for economic collapse. They also all believe that society and the state exist for the benefit of the individual, and that the human being is the objective of social and political activity. Likewise, they all know that democracy is based on human rights.
Such a principled outlook produces clear political conclusions, which form the basis on which it is possible to unite the forces.
It should be emphasized that a political party is not a pressure group for achieving one goal, no matter how lofty it may be. A party must reflect a comprehensive view of the social and political reality, and needs basic guidelines in all spheres of public life.
This remark is aimed specifically at Knesset member Shelly Yachimovich; she is a determined and courageous woman but turning her back on the existential need to reach a peace agreement with the Palestinians will not be to her benefit. If she wishes to lead the left, she must not ignore the disaster that the occupation produces and hope that by virtue of closing her eyes in this manner, the lower income groups will rush to her side.
Those who wish for inspiration for a new start would do well to look toward the West rather than backwards. The Israeli labor movement was an ad hoc invention for the purpose of achieving independence, but no more than that.
Even in the distant past it would seem from time to time that the Histadrut labor federation was closer to being a corporation than a workers' organization fighting to change the face of society.
In principle, it would be appropriate to build the new party on different ideological streams. The differences of opinion would find expression at the local level and in various elected central bodies, and every year a convention would discuss the proposals for policy, and this is where the platform and directives for action would be formulated. All the opinions would be aired and the decisions would be binding on all.
The party that would be established would not be a ruling party immediately, but its influence would be much greater than what there is today, and as a beginning, that is not something negligible.

<title>Netanyahu is fanning the flames of religious incitement</title>
<date>Tue Dec 27 03:17:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Benjamin Netanyahu is not guilty. He learned that trick the first time he was elected. After he took part in orchestrating the rallies inciting against Yitzhak Rabin  ("With blood and fire we will expel Rabin" ), along came the assassination. Netanyahu recognized the significance of the role he played and was certain the right wing was going to collapse in the next election. But miraculously, the non-right didn't raise the assassination or the incitement during the election campaign - the shooting was reduced to the act of a single bad apple - and Netanyahu became prime minister.
Netanyahu is not the first to identify the formula. In the 1980s several fires broke out on Israel Air Force bases. It was always the same firefighter who was the first to notice the fire, arrive, put it out and reap the praise. As the incidents piled up, an undercover investigation began. The firefighter, it turned out, was the one setting the fires.
The Hasidic man from Beit Shemesh who was interviewed for a TV news segment that aired Friday has revealed the truth even to those who excel at repression. He is the product of an educational system that incites its students, creates segregation between boys and girls from childhood, and teaches boys that religious law states that spilling their seed is the worst of all sins - and that the spilled seed of sinning Jews gives rise to all the demons in the world, which are responsible for every tragedy, including, of course, the Holocaust. When the Israeli government allows itself to fund such an educational system, a place like Beit Shemesh can be expected to flourish. It's clear to the product of this incitement that if a "normal man" like him doesn't forcibly cover the arms of an 8-year-old girl, the world will be filled with his demons.
This normal man from Beit Shemesh continued to cover the arms of truth when he said "we have rabbis, and they're the ones who order us to take action." And that is the essence of the incitement. In the rallies that led to Rabin's assassination, Netanyahu was assisted by Rabbi Dov Lior and his followers. Menachem Livni, the operational head of the Jewish Underground in the early 1980s, who was convicted of killing Arabs, has said Lior was the one who pressured him to kill and sent him out to do so. Lior was not questioned seriously, nor was he put on trial. He later went on to announce that his former student - Baruch Goldstein, who massacred 29 Muslim worshipers in the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron in 1994 - was a martyr, greater than all the martyrs of the Holocaust. And several rabbis have said Lior was the rabbi who ruled that Rabin should be killed because he was a rodef and moser, meaning that he was seeking to kill Jews and give up Jewish land. Rabin's would-be assassin, Yigal Amir, attended many of Lior's gatherings.
Today, the Netanyahu government is giving Lior tens of thousands of shekels a month in the salaries he receives in various capacities. When Netanyahu returned to Israel as a victor after confronting U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this year, he went straight to Mercaz Harav Yeshiva, pointed to the podium where Lior was sitting, and said that was the elite commando unit leading the Jewish people.
The "normal" bad apples who called Israelis soldiers "Nazis" also have rabbis. Lior has ruled that soldiers who evacuate outposts are like Nazis, and should be treated as such. The Netanyahu government is continuing to waste millions of shekels on education that passes on the kind of values embraced by Lior - who also heads a large hesder yeshiva, combining Torah study and military service. And it's not just Lior. This week Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Netanyahu's "moderate" partner, ruled that Jewish doctors should not treat non-Jews or secular Jews on Shabbat. In 1997 Netanyahu told the late Rabbi Yitzhak Kadouri that Israel's leftists had forgotten what it means to be Jewish. In that spirit, most young Jews are now being taught what being Jewish is all about: segregation, and the creation of hierarchies that fervently discriminate.
If I wanted to establish a school system that separates redheads from everybody else and teaches them that they are inferior, that the sight of them causes demons to be born and so they should not be seen, I would probably be either hospitalized or arrested. But the Israeli government is sending most of the first-graders it classifies as Jews to religious schools, whether Orthodox or ultra-Orthodox. Those schools are doing essentially the same thing; they are operating an apartheid system that discriminates against girls.
At the end of the McCarthy era, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that separate is not equal. For all that he was a Republican, President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent federal troops into Arkansas to uphold the right of black students to attend the same schools as whites. In Israel there's no need to send in the army; it would be enough to stop funding every segregated school. No so-called education system that segregates boys and girls should get a single shekel from the state. That would be enough to stop the madness.
Israel has a clear choice to make. It can continue with the Netanyahu government - which is igniting, fanning and subsidizing the rabbinical flames of incitement and, as the fire consumes all, promises to take care of the bad apples - or another government can step in and put out the fire.
Each of the three instances since 1977 in which the right lost the vote all had something in common: In all three cases, the public became more aware of the domestic threat, consisting primarily of religious extremists threatening to take over. By now it's no longer just a threat. Israel only has a very brief time left while change can still take place. It must either stop feeding the fire that is consuming it, or the country will cease to exist.

<title>Netanyahu's policies have turned Israel into Iran</title>
<date>Fri Nov 18 02:40:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
I don't know if Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Rabbi Ovadia Yosef have their dressy robes and turbans made by the same tailor and milliner, and whether the gold decorations woven into their clothes symbolize some sort of rank in their divine status or are just foppishness. Some say it's both. They have adopted the Ottoman tradition of clerics who vied in their day with the dandyish sultans. In any case, both Khamenei and Yosef have influence on questions of war and peace. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad isn't going to push that button without authorization from Khamanei, just as our prime minister and defense minister make pilgrimages to Our Master and Teacher on the issue of the Iranian threat.
The advice Khamenei gives is within the realm of the secret. Some believe that he will not lightly approve what we fear. As for Rabbi Ovadia, his solution has been cited as the Holy One, Blessed Be He, will thwart them: "Their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bows shall be broken"  (Psalms 37:15 ). Interior Minister Eli Yishai, one of the eight decisive votes in the cabinet that will determine whether or not to attack, has declared: "We have no one upon whom to rely except for our Father in Heaven." Information about what our father in heaven thinks is not really in our hands.
About two weeks ago 19 retired Israel Defense Forces generals published a letter to the defense minister and the chief of staff demanding a stop to the continuing harm to the military service of women in the IDF.
The generals warned of damage to women's motivation to serve and to the basic values of Israeli society. They noted that they cherish the contribution of religious IDF soldiers and respect their rights but these must be ensured without imposing a religious way of life on the rest of those serving in the military.
Maj. Gen.  (ret. ) Mendi Meron has said that everyone who has commanded soldiers from hesder yeshivas - an arrangement whereby conscripts split their time between religious studies and active service - knows there are no words to describe their dedication, but that has nothing to do with the exclusion of women. Nonreligious people also have rights in the army. Exclusion of women in the IDF is just the tip of the iceberg. At the base is the question: Who gives the orders in the army - the commanders or the Holy One, Blessed Be He?
Former Mossad chief Efraim Halevy observed, "The ultra-Orthodox are scarier than the Iranian bomb." It goes without saying that before you could say Jack Robinson he had to apologize. It is hard to believe we are getting close to a situation in which nonreligious people don't even have the right to be caustic.
With the start of the Knesset session, a series of proposed laws are leading the country into dangerous realms. Add to this the apartheid developing between men and women in Jerusalem and Kadima MK Avi Dichter's proposal to declare Israel a Jewish state and not count its Arab inhabitants. This statement won him compliments from one MK, who said that at long last we see the Likud is in control.
The prime minister and several of his extremist colleagues have come back from their summer vacation brimming with ideas for laws about holding hearings for candidates for the Supreme Court and restrictions on foreign funding of the  (mainly leftist ) non-profit organizations.
It is odd to hear a demand like that from the right. During my time as diplomatic correspondent for Haaretz in Washington I was amazed at the skills demonstrated by the heads of the Israeli right in raising funds from strange and sundry non-profit organizations. The law for drying up funds will anger Europe and the liberal donors in the United States. There is fear that donations to hospitals and universities will cease. The attorney general has made it unambiguously clear that these proposals are unconstitutional and damaging to the political discourse, freedom of expression and the freedom of association.
On the other side, Minister without Portfolio Yossi Peled says Israel must not agree to foreign donations to organizations like Breaking the Silence, for example, which persecutes IDF soldiers. Following this argument, an American citizen could wonder whether it is necessary to continue providing financial aid to a country that is not lifting a finger for peace.
Prime Minister Benjamin  (Bibi ) Netanyahu is acting to neutralize all the mechanisms that aren't under his government's thumb, like the Supreme Court, the media and the non-governmental organizations. In the meantime, he has retreated slightly in the face of the public's reaction. However, recent events add to the sense that Iran's spirit is taking control of us, through rightist legislation, creeping ultra-Orthodox extremism and disrespect for minority rights. Iran is already here.

<title>Netanyahu's 'speech of truth' at the UN</title>
<date>Mon Sep 19 03:49:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised that in his speech at the United Nations on Friday, he will "tell the truth." This is no trivial matter when it involves a politician who invented an encounter with British soldiers that happened before he was born. Nor is it obvious for a person who retroactively brought Rehavam Ze'evi into his government after the latter had already passed away.
One of the rare times Netanyahu told the truth was when he admitted that he had  (also ) misled his third wife. Then, too, he did so out of fear of the release of a tape supposedly revealing an extra-marital affair. After the fact, Bibi learned that he did not have to tell the truth, since the tape was nothing but a rumor.
The following lines are an attempt to formulate Netanyahu's truth ahead of one more speech of a lifetime.
"I came to this chamber, in which 64 years ago the nations of the world declared the establishment of a Jewish state, although the Arabs have an automatic majority here. Yes, I know that that does not matter much, since we have the automatic veto of the United States in the Security Council. More importantly, we have an automatic majority in the U.S. Congress and our lobby, AIPAC, has a grip on President Obama in a sensitive place. But how can we even compare the automatic majority against Israel to the automatic majority for it?
"Having already made Sara come all the way to New York, I will present to you my truth with regard to the Palestinian request that you recognize, ostensibly, a state of their own in the 1967 borders whose capital is East Jerusalem.
"I do not understand why they are making do with one country. I am ready to offer them at least four: one in Gaza, the second an enclave in the Nablus area - with perhaps a tunnel to Tul Karm, the third in the Ramallah district, and the fourth in the Hebron Hills, without, of course, Baruch Marzel and the Tomb of the Patriarchs.
"You can learn about my truth with regard to the Jordan Valley from the tape of the meeting with settlers in Ofra 10 years ago. I told them that during my first term as prime minister, the Americans promised me that I would be the one to sketch the borders of 'defined military sites' in the territories that according to the Oslo Accords would remain in Israel's hands. I told the settlers that the way I see it, the entire Jordan Valley is a military zone and I boasted that 'from that moment I stopped the Oslo Accords.'
"I said in my speech at Bar-Ilan University that I support a two-state solution. That was shortly after President Barack Hussein Obama's Cairo speech, when I was afraid he would call my bluff and go all the way with his Muslim friends.
"I understand that if I keep wasting my time distributing macho pictures to the media, even Glenn Beck, if he is elected president of the United States, will not be able to ensure that the State of Israel does not become a pariah state like apartheid South Africa. And so I have to toss the ball into the Palestinian court.
"Despite the political price I will pay for this, and the rebuke I'll get from my father, I will reveal to you today for the first time things that were unknown until now: I told Obama I was willing to withdraw from 95 percent of the West Bank and to conduct negotiations over exchanges of territory. But don't get too excited, since I conditioned this revolutionary proposal on two things: First, the Palestinians' express agreement that the negotiations will result in a peace treaty between the state of the Palestinian people and the nation state of the Jewish people; and second, a pre-understanding that the agreement on the establishment of a Palestinian state will constitute the end of the conflict without hearing any more about the return of refugees. From my perspective, these are iron-clad conditions.
"I know that from the point of view of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, accepting these conditions is like suicide. No Palestinian leader can allow himself to give up at the outset on the right of return and alienate himself from Israel's Palestinian citizens, particularly at a time when we are settling Jews in all parts of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The truth is that this is the reason I invented these conditions. It is clear to me that among the Arabs, just like with us, politicians are prepared to kill and be killed on the altar of their country. See you at Masada."

<title>NGO bill aims to create a democracy for Jews only</title>
<date>Mon Nov 21 03:25:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
The NGO culture is part of globalization: Money flows from financial centers to all kinds of corners, in a mixture of philanthropy and business, idealism and cynicism. The left is being destroyed by this culture, which dictates a rupture between the community in whose name it acts and its coterie of professional activists, whose funding comes from abroad.
The separation between the professional activists and the grass-roots kind and the need to show donors a "return" on their money have given rise to all kinds of fake activity - demonstrations whose participants are activists in or employees of "neighboring" nongovernmental organizations, or, alternatively, free-of-charge "mass" Internet petitions, which no one reads except the signatories  (in place of the old-fashioned method - signing people on a petition to the newspaper that involved real communication and raising money from the signatories; in short, genuine political activity ).
The culture of "Europe will pay" has also intensified a kind of nihilism on the left. For instance, from time to time, the Zochrot organization used to put out a journal, Sedek, which was extremely extravagant in its use of color plates. Aside from its political material, it consisted mainly of colorful  (and apolitical ) plastic art, thanks to "generous funding," in the journal's words, from a Danish organization for... eradicating hunger.
This is also the background to the rise of the executive director, who is chosen via a "human rights" tender. Today, it's refusing to serve in the army; tomorrow, it's torture; but it's all part of the same status quo. That is equally true of the "campaign managers," aka "media experts" - which means they have a lot of numbers in their cell phone's memory.
But the epitome is the use of journalists in place of grass-roots activity in the streets. Success is measured by being "mentioned on television" - a reflection of the world of advertising.
Peace Now provides an excellent example of this transformation from a mass political movement into an NGO focused on monitoring: Instead of grass-roots activity, it monitors settlement expansion  (though this is important ). This is one of the reasons for the right's success. The government does as it pleases, while opposition from the left is becoming commercialized, because the left has too many NGOs  (to obtain more and more donations ). It has a lot of generals and very few soldiers.
Why nevertheless is the government attending to these NGOs? Because the most important of them represent the Palestinian people in the cellars of the military dictatorship.
B'Tselem is the most noteworthy of these NGOs. It tries to represent the occupied population, which has been without representation during almost 45 years of occupation, against the jackboots. Other NGOs try to find breaches in the law, and, in addition to mobilizing public opinion, take them to the High Court of Justice  (which has proven to be a broken reed as far as the territories are concerned ). This is the only representation the Palestinians have in Israeli politics, in which, ostensibly, all are represented, since it is democratic.
This is also the context in which one must view the so-called NGO Bill: It isn't necessarily an attempt to suppress the left, but rather an attempt to eliminate representation for residents of the territories. And that is why bills to change the composition of the High Court have flowed in the wake of this legislation: Because the destroyers of the constitutional court aren't concerned over its ethnic make-up, but over the manner in which, on rare occasions, it defends the Palestinians, thanks to B'Tselem, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Yesh Din or the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel. It's a kind of broken telephone amid the lawlessness that the Palestinians inhabit, in the absence of the rule of law.
Nor does the work of destruction stop there. In the current fight over various bills relating to the High Court, both sides have tended to forget the most important fact of all: Israel has no constitution that would impede the tyranny of the majority.
It has no constitution because the state continues to deny its Arab citizens equality before the law. They, unlike residents of the territories, can expect help from the High Court from time to time. Yet, ever since the 1995 Katzir ruling, which for the first time told this state without a constitution that communities for Jews only are unconstitutional - or in other words, that apartheid is illegal - the war on this ruling has gathered speed, first in academia, then in the cabinet and Knesset.
Therefore, we must not dismiss the NGO Bill, even if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly come to his senses and opposed it. This bill truly intends to create a democracy for Jews only. If it were passed, no Arab - whether resident of the territories or Israeli citizen - would have access to the law.
And, therefore, we also shouldn't make light of the drowning of Begin-style liberalism in the Likud. The goalposts of the right-wing torrent will continue to move. Its horizon also includes annexing the territories; it even has a vision of denying Arab citizens the right to vote in Israel. And at the entrance to this hell - if not beneath it - Meir Kahane and Avigdor Lieberman are waiting.

<title>Obama is letting Netanyahu off the hook</title>
<date>Mon May 30 02:45:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Who said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hasn't changed? Who would have believed that the dear son of that combative family would utter indecent words like "Palestinian state" without spitting immediately after? Who would have dreamt that the prince of the right would even hint at the possibility that settlements would be evacuated? A veritable revolution. Instead of brandishing a thorn-filled club, Netanyahu is waving a fresh olive branch; he has learned that there is no better way to perpetuate the frozen peace process, expand settlements and increase his political longevity.
The prime minister is no longer the man Ehud Barak designated "Mr. No." We are now dealing with a new leader, a much more sophisticated and dangerous one. Meet "Bibi I'll Have It Both Ways."
This Netanyahu is in favor of a stable and prosperous Palestinian state and against a two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders with an agreed exchange of territory. He is concerned about the Jewish and democratic character of the State of Israel, and is also busy turning it into a binational state  (or an apartheid state ), through his doomed and unprecedented demand that the Palestinians declare that Israel is a state for the Jewish people. He supports having Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas represent the population of Gaza in negotiations, and is opposed to the unity agreement between the Fatah government in the West Bank and the Hamas government in Gaza.
The "both ways" doctrine of the right is not new. Twenty years ago, U.S. President George H.W. Bush asked Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to choose between expanding settlements and securing financial guarantees to help Israel take in new immigrants. The Likud leader, who was essentially dragged to the Madrid peace conference, sought to prove that it is possible to build settlements in the midst of peace talks as well as receive special assistance for the absorption of immigrants.
With the help of Jewish American political activists, Shamir rallied congressional support in his campaign against the administration. He believed that Israel's friends would bring the president to his knees. But instead of getting everything he wanted, Shamir ended up getting none of it, ending up without guarantees and out of government.
Even though he was in the midst of the struggle for his second term in office, Bush refused to abandon the fragile peace process and risk U.S. interests in the Middle East. The president defeated Congress, and Israeli voters defeated the right at the polls. When there is a leader in the White House who is willing to take political risks and makes it clear that there is a cost to trying to have it both ways, Israelis know to distinguish between the good and the bad.
But Obama enabled Netanyahu to return home from Washington without paying any political price for trying to have it both ways. Moreover, he allowed the prime minister to laugh all the way to Jerusalem over the statement that the 1967 borders, with agreed territorial exchange, should serve as the basis for negotiations. Netanyahu knows that statements that are not accompanied by political action, and which come with no bill for time lost, are worth about as much as the pledge in the 2003 road map to freeze all settlements and dismantle the outposts.
The PLO Central Committee has already decided to accept the parameters set out by Obama in his latest speeches as the basis for negotiations toward a permanent agreement, demonstrating its commitment that the reconciliation deal with Hamas does not alter its political positions. Abbas made it clear recently that negotiations on the basis of the 1967 lines and a three-month freeze in settlement construction would lead the Palestinians to abandon their effort to win support for an independent state at the United Nations in September. He also said: "In my calendar there is no October."
In other words, if serious negotiations about borders do not begin by September, in October the Palestinians will no longer agree to cooperate with Israel on either political or security matters. There will no longer be a semblance of a peace process even as Palestinian lands are stolen in broad daylight.
Obama said last week that a true friend must tell Israel the truth. A true friend has not fulfilled his obligation if all he did was describe the abyss to which Netanyahu is leading us. A true friend does everything in his power to prevent the mad rush to the abyss. The time has come to show that the emperor has no clothes, to strip the garments off the King of Having It Both Ways - before it is too late.

<title>One doesn't boycott the only free society in the Mideast </title>
<date>Fri Jan 28 03:10:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Since it is necessary to spell things out, let’s do so.
Obviously, I have never, directly or indirectly, pressured anyone to cancel a meeting in support of the partisans of the boycott of Israel, with Palestinian Leila Shahid, Frenchman Stephane Hessel and others scheduled to appear, at the Ecole normale superieure in Paris.
This would have been all the more absurd because, by nature and by conviction, I believe in the power of ideas and, even more, in that of the truth. In such circumstances, I am always in favor of debate, the clash of opinions, even the confrontation of convictions − hence, not of censure.
And the fact is that, in this particular circumstance, that is to say in the matter of the BDS ‏campaign that was to be the main subject of the Ecole normale meeting, I would have been more than happy to be able to present those who speak sincerely with facts and, basically, evidence that seems to have escaped them: namely, that we are faced here with a skillfully orchestrated but calumnious, bellicose, anti-democratic and, in a word, despicable campaign.
Why?
First, because one boycotts totalitarian regimes, not democracies. One can boycott Sudan, guilty of the extermination of part of the population of Darfur. One can boycott China, guilty of massive violations of human rights in Tibet and elsewhere. One can and should boycott the Iran that is oppressing Sakineh and Jafar Panahi − a country whose leaders have become deaf to the language of common sense and compromise. One can even imagine, as we once did with regard to the fascist generals’ Argentina or Brezhnev’s USSR, boycotting those Arab regimes whose citizens’ freedom of expression is forbidden, and punished, if necessary, with blood.
One does not boycott the only society in the Middle East where Arabs read a free press, demonstrate when they wish to do so, send representatives to parliament, and enjoy their rights as citizens. Regardless of what one thinks of the policies of its government, one does not boycott the only country in the region and, beyond the region, one of the unfortunately limited number of countries in the world where voters have the power to sanction, modify and reverse the position of said government. To such an extent that finding, like Mr. Hessel, in his recent best-selling book, the source of his “main indignation” in the workings of a democracy that, like all democracies, is by definition imperfect but perfectible ‏(yet, on the contrary, having nothing to say about the millions of victims of Africa’s forgotten wars, about the persecution of Christians in the Middle East, or about the massacre of Bosnia’s Muslims‏) is at best profoundly stupid and at worst, disgraceful.
And then, because, in any event, this boycott campaign is in reality indifferent to the stance of Mr. X or Mrs. Y. on their government. It is unaware of, nor does it care to know, what Israeli citizens themselves think, for example, of the resumption of settlement construction in the West Bank. It doesn’t give a hoot about demands, parameters, actual conditions of peace between the citizens in question and their Palestinian neighbors. Of the latter, their aspirations, their interests, their possible hopes and the way the Hamas regime has smashed those hopes in Gaza, it doesn’t give a tinker’s damn and never says anything, either.
No. Regardless of what its promoters and its useful idiots say, the only real, accepted, hackneyed goal of this boycott campaign is to delegitimize Israel as such. That is what the comparison with the South Africa of apartheid implicitly expresses. That is what the anti-Zionist rhetoric that serves as the common denominator of all the groups constituting the BDS movement explicitly says, and, if words have any meaning, what signifies their intent to undermine the very idea that today, like it or not, binds the Israeli nation. And that is why this campaign, in fact, contravenes the customs, rules and laws of international and, in this case, French or American national law.
And then, lastly, there are those at the heart and, sometimes, at the origin of this campaign whose inspiration is, to say the least, not that of de Gaulle’s Free French nor of those who penned the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, nor of those in favor of a just peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.
I submit, to whomever wishes, the declarations of Omar Barghouti, one of the founders of the Palestinian BDS campaign, affirming that his goal is not two states but two Palestines. And those of Ali Abunimah, co-founder of Electronic Intifada and also opposed to the two-state solution, who does not hesitate to compare Israel to Nazi Germany and this or that of its philosophers to the columnists of Der Stuermer. And the declarations of the leaders of Sabeel, that group of Palestinian Christians firmly implanted in North America, who, anxious to lend the idea of “responsible investment” a “theological” basis, do not hesitate to subtly but surely reactivate the stereotype of the Christ-killing Jew. Not to mention some rather shady initiatives whose purpose is to mark Jewish − sorry, Israeli − merchandise with supposedly derogatory stickers intended for the attention of the vigilant French consumer.
All that is deplorable and, once again, indisputable. Presenting the promoters of this discourse of hatred as victims speaks volumes of the current state of confusion − intellectual and moral − of a Western world one would have hoped had been cured of its worst criminal past.
Philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy is the author, most recently ‏(together with Michel Houellebecq‏), of “Public Enemies: Dueling Writers Take On Each Other and the World” ‏(Random House‏).

<title>Open Rabin's grave </title>
<date>Fri Jul 08 01:57:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Yitzhak Rabin was murdered, and his philosophy along with him. Nobody has had so many presumed heirs: Who hasn't donned his mantle only to remove it at the first opportunity and toss it by the wayside? Who hasn't remained loyal to him only to betray that loyalty out of fear and self interest?
Murdered and buried, at least six feet under. Even a criminal gunned down in an underworld vendetta merits a more serious investigation. Although the gunman was tried and imprisoned, those who supported him are walking around free and self-satisfied among us, and are continuing to cause harm as they did in the past. Having replaced Rabin, they are being fruitful and multiplying and inheriting the land.
Now rabbis are being summoned for futile interrogations. Back then they were not interrogated properly. Nobody ever found out what was said in talks between them and the murderer - what they allowed the scoundrel to do in the name of the Torah.
And what was the lethal influence of politicians, who walked behind his casket when he was still alive; who heard the voice of the people in their enthusiasm, tearing him to shreds in the city square, in SS uniform. They all joined forces at the time to bring an end to the events of 1994-1995, to consign them to oblivion, and even the Shin Bet security services and the police poured dirt over the ground to cover his blood. Rabin is today the deadest of dead men - his memory forgotten.
In late 1998 the subcommittee on intelligence and security services received a report about "the rabbis' activity in connection with Rabin's murder." That is how it appeared on the agenda, at my request. The committee was told, among other things, that already in January, 1995 rabbis from the committee of rabbis of Judea, Samaria and Gaza wrote to 30 of the leading rabbis in Israel and the United States and asked them: Does the law of "rodef" and "moser"  (a Jew who betrays and endangers other Jews ) apply to the prime minister? The Shin Bet stammered and couldn't say whether replies were received and what their contents were. No contact was made at the time with the questioners and the respondents, in order to deter them from this sick preoccupation with dangerous halakhic decisions calling for murderers.
Rabin's assassin Yigal Amir met with additional rabbis - times and names were placed on the committee's desk - but the files were actually empty and closed. No real investigations began before the murder, nor afterwards. The Shin Bet did not fail in its role - it betrayed it. To this day, more is hidden than known.
The time has come to investigate. Most of those involved have resumed their evil ways - if they ever abandoned them - and sin lies at their doorstep. If we had a spirit of national conciliation now, as in post-apartheid South Africa, it would have been possible to continue licking our wounds without opening them. But an ill wind is blowing, which must be eliminated before it sweeps up everything in its path and leaves behind a wasteland.
If the late Prime Minister Menachem Begin decided to investigate the murder of Chaim Arlosoroff after 40 years to settle past accounts, then the murder of Rabin must be investigated after only 16 years because of future accounts. And if the ship Altalena is now being dredged up from the depths, then the three- bullet pistol also has to be brought up from the depths. Can not only a cannon but a pistol become sacred?
Recently the remains of Chile's late elected President Salvador Allende were exhumed, in order to examine them: Did he commit suicide 38 years ago, as was officially claimed, or did Augusto Pinochet's soldiers murder him on the general's orders? The circumstances of the death of poet Pablo Neruda will also be investigated there once again: Was he poisoned or did he die of cancer? Chile wants to know. Does Israel?
We should open Rabin's grave, where the conspiracy woven against him by his internal enemies was buried. He didn't die in his bed from an illness, nor did he commit suicide. The country was very sick, and hasn't been able to recover since then - its fever is only rising, it is bleeding. And any attempt to make peace in its name is like an act of suicide.

<title>Palestinian unity is a chance for Mideast peace between equals</title>
<date>Fri May 06 01:46:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Meretz met its demise on January 10, 2009, at the end of the second week of Operation Cast Lead in Gaza. Only then did the chief supporter of a peace agreement with the Palestinians urge its members to publicly oppose the war, after supporting it because it was a war "against Hamas." At the funeral, its spokesmen at the demonstration stood opposite the Defense Ministry and, instead of speaking against the war, they went into contortions to justify it - and themselves.
Then came the elections, and the voters went to Kadima. If the rationale was "negotiations with the Palestinian Authority and war against Hamas," why not Kadima chairwoman MK Tzipi Livni?
This wasn't the first time a peace movement evaporated during a war. One upon a time, there was an organization called Courage to Refuse, born to great yuppie fanfare. But it disappeared with its support for the Second Lebanon War - the first war to cross the officers' paths after they had finished being interviewed everywhere about their courage to refuse. Courage was something they didn't have, not even the courage to say: "This isn't our war."
Granted, there's a herd instinct at work here, and this instinct can be found everywhere - on the right and on the left, in the East and in the West. Just look at the citizens of the greatest power in the world capering as though they had won some tournament.
But this explanation does not suffice. Every manifestation of the herd instinct has a call-up code, and apparently the Israeli herd's code is not only sad songs on the radio. Another element of this herd consciousness has its source in military thinking: The Palestinians are partners only when they are submissive.
The Oslo agreements were signed when the Palestine Liberation Organization was on the brink of economic and political bankruptcy. Thus the agreement's supporters perceived it as an organization that would come crawling and would even import its forces from Tunis to serve as collaborators and control the "locals." As a result, there was an increase in support for Hamas - which, to put it mildly, is not a likable organization.
The collective wail over the agreement just signed between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority is the code the herd will use when the next uprising erupts. Alas and alack, they are refusing to dance to our tune. Yet the truth is that the Palestinians are refusing to crawl mainly because by crawling, they achieved nothing: They bought their legitimization, at least among certain segments of Israel, at the price of total surrender and relinquishing nearly everything.
The rightist lie to the effect that the Palestinians "only take" and "don't give" is logical according to the school of thought that believes if you repeat a lie enough times, it will eventually come true. Nevertheless, the Palestinians have not received anything. On the contrary: Ever since they began the peace process with Israel, their situation has become much worse - ghettoization, poverty and military oppression without any law restraining their Israeli overlords.
When our leaders, especially those who advocate surrender as a condition for peace - President Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Ehud Barak - say it is impossible to reach an agreement with Hamas, they are not only being cynical  (as though they had reached an agreement with the PA ), they are also using the tattered slogans of the 1980s. Yet the fact remains: One doesn't make peace either with friends or with slaves. Moreover, the greater the oppression, the more appalling the opponents of that oppression will be, to match the oppression.
Anyone who doesn't understand that the agreement between Fatah and Hamas reflects a will to live - a preference for Egypt, a relinquishment of reliance on Syria, a search for power - is refusing to understand that the conflict will not end without an agreement between equals. The long adventure of incorporating the occupied territories as downtrodden apartheid zones must end, out of recognition that we, too, are weak.
With Egypt, the establishment wanted an agreement from a position of power. The terrible price tag is written in the military graveyards. Colonialism is dead. And wherever it is maintained, traffic jams clog the roads to the memorial ceremonies.

<title>Philosopher for hire </title>
<date>Fri Sep 09 05:25:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
There is a popular belief that a philosopher's aim is to seek universal truth in a world of competing narratives. As early as the time of Socrates, Western culture viewed the figure of the Sophist, a "philosopher for hire," as contrary to that of the genuine philosopher: While the latter searches for the truth, the former uses his talents to promote interest groups. When Nietzsche taught us that behind every philosophy is a philosopher with his own particularity, he undermined the concept of universal truth and assigned a different purpose to philosophy. After that, many philosophers could only try to reconstruct and deconstruct the shards of truth that remained.
A number of genuine philosophers tried to  rehabilitate the term "universal truth" from the debris, but at the same time, mass culture invented the philosopher of mass communications. This new model cynically exploits the public's trust in the "philosopher" - and its belief that that figure seeks truth - in order to serve the centers of power.
In the same way that the Israel Defense Forces conducted itself when it had the philosopher Asa Kasher create his immoral "ethical code," thus Nicolas Sarkozy and the Ehud Olmert government allowed Bernard-Henri Levy to stamp as "kosher" some of the most unethical codes in Western liberalism.
Last May, Levy published an article in defense of Dominique Strauss-Kahn in Haaretz Hebrew Edition  (it appeared in English in The Huffington Post ). The article contained a repetition of the words "I am angry," along the lines of "J'accuse." Here is my own "I am angry":
I accept the Bernard-Henri Levy who figuratively marched in solidarity with the armed rebels in order to free the Libyan people from the tyrannical rule of Muammar Gadhafi. But I am angry that he chose to march with the Israeli army of occupation when it invaded Gaza during Operation Cast Lead. I'm angry that, instead of joining the flotilla to Gaza, he accosted the unarmed activists who sailed as a solidarity coalition to free the Palestinians from the rule of the violent and prolonged occupation.
I applaud the Bernard-Henri Levy who, in his writings, condemned the dictatorship in Tehran, but I'm angry that he denies the fact that Neda Agha-Soltan, the young woman who was shot to death there by the dictatorship in 2009, and Bassem Abu Rahmeh, who was shot to death by Israeli soldiers in Bil'in that same year, are both victims of a similar oppression.
I applaud the Bernard-Henri Levy who  eloquently described the face of Gilad Shalit - his glance, his fragility and humanity - as it appears in the heartbreaking video from captivity, but I'm angry that, at the same time, he erased the faces of thousands of Palestinian prisoners who have been humiliated for decades in the prisons of the occupation.
I agree with the way in which Bernard-Henri Levy, in an attempt to help his friend Strauss-Kahn, attacked the legal system and media in the United States, claiming that they embody a kind of cannibalism that sacrifices the individual on behalf of slogans and stereotypes of justice. But I'm angry about his thunderous silence when, in an odd, rapid judicial procedure, his friend - a man whose trustworthiness is no less in doubt than that of the woman who accused him - was released without restrictions.
Furthermore, I'm angry that he invented a false theory about the priority given to the victim  (the migrant, the black, the woman ) in the American system - merely to defend his aggressive compatriot. In that way, he collaborated in wiping out the daily injustices done by the American capitalist judicial system to millions of poor, blacks and migrants who are jailed or deported from the country.
I'm angry that, on behalf of a friend, Levy took it upon himself to undermine the credibility of  another woman, Tristane Banon, who filed a  criminal complaint against Strauss-Kahn for alleged attempted rape and who courageously dared to go to the media. In this way, he set the struggle for rape victims' rights back a full generation.
These are the reasons why, in the eyes of many people, Bernard-Henri Levy is perceived not as a philosopher who fights for universal truth, nor as a journalist who seeks justice, but rather as a Jewish soldier in the European foreign legion. He is the servant of two masters who are actually one and the same: the colonial liberal ideology and the Zionist ideology.
Therefore, I call on Bernard-Henri Levy: Kindly be a human being always and everywhere. March with us in September to free Palestine from the occupation and Israel from Zionism. I am not, heaven forbid, asking Sarkozy to send his forces to Israel as he did to fight Gadhafi in Libya; I'm merely proposing that the West stop selling arms to the Israeli army, and that Israel's soldiers refrain from using their weapons when we march to bring down the walls of apartheid.
The Middle East is looking for a new space where there is freedom for all. Bernard-Henri Levy, you said that dictatorships do not remain forever. Therefore, we too shall not stop until, between the Jordan River and the sea, there is justice and equality for every human being.

<title>Protests in Israel are not only legitimate, they're vital</title>
<date>Sun Jul 10 01:32:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Really, why? It's noisy, sometimes dirty, it may even, God help us, cause traffic jams. Tires may even be burned, and in extreme cases, things even get a little violent. It disturbs the peace and wrecks the public order, polluting the air and souring the atmosphere. So why do we need protest, anyway?
The common perception of protests in Israel is that of an irritating public nuisance - superfluous, party-wrecking, wrong and illegal. Only rarely can Israel stomach a demonstration, provided it's a properly organized popular rally, a cultural gathering on a square, obviously with a license from the police. We hear Israeli songs on the PA system, a message from the president at the podium, and only after the end of Shabbat, in good weather.
The protests should be on issues everyone can agree on; either Gilad Shalit or the Rabin assassination, an excellent subject for Israeli protests. Only these two can you demonstrate about and still hope for popular support. This is our civil society and this is the degree of its involvement.
Governments don't like protests, and this is only natural. In Israel, the public doesn't like protests either, which is seriously disconcerting. Any protest here is met with a hostile reaction from the decent public. Protest? Yuck. Whether it's right or wrong, we're better off without it. So any protest at all, minus Shalit and Rabin, is met immediately with a violent reaction from the authorities, who enjoy the backing of much of the media and public.
A rabbi wouldn't come to a police questioning? Get him! A young man throws stones at the police and doesn't hurt anyone? Eight months behind bars  (unless of course he's a settler ). A women's rights activist "interrupts traffic"? Suspended sentence. And of course, a bunch of activists trying to demonstrate in Gaza or the West Bank prompts a hysterical deployment of forces. Anything but protests, thank you very much. We're Israelis and we don't know what democracy is about.
Protests are not only legitimate - they're vital. They're unpleasant and not nice, and they're not always perfectly legal. They can't be any of these things, after all; they're meant to disrupt, not preserve, the existing order. That's what they're for. It's almost embarrassing to write things like this that should be obvious.
A true protest stems from an outpouring of rage, something that hardly ever occurs at protests here. The test of a protest is its righteousness, not its means. Rabbi Dov Lior shouldn't be put on trial for conducting his own sort of protest and refusing to show up for questioning; the rabbi should only be judged for preaching about the killing of Gentile children, not his failure to arrive at a police station - but the important and the marginal have been reversed in this affair.
Virtually the only question that should be asked is: In the name of what? Does Lior protest in favor of killing children? The protest should be condemned. Do draft objectors protest against the killing of children? Their protest is commendable. Do settlers protest in support of a landgrab? Their protest is criminal. Do women break the law in their fight against the imprisonment of a neighboring nation? Their protest is commendable, and to hell with the means they use. The law cannot be above everything if it discriminates and does wrong.
A boycott is also a legitimate instrument, as long as it's for a worthy cause. Even Israel admits it: It boycotts Hamas, Turkey, even overpriced cottage cheese. But boycotting fruits and vegetables from the settlements? This is already illegal, as of this week. History is full of protesters and lawbreakers who became icons. The protests of the blacks against apartheid in South Africa and of their brothers against racial discrimination in the United State were not law-abiding protests. We bow our heads to them in deep appreciation.
One day, Israelis may yet bow their heads to the few protesters, boycotters and lawbreakers here, when they understand that their weapons were legitimate and their cause was right, even when they made noise in the quiet hours between 2 and 4 P.M.

<title>Siege of Gaza has become a moral blockade of Israel</title>
<date>Tue Jul 05 03:13:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
 
Israel is indeed connected to the centers of power in the world. The predictions of a tsunami at present seem to be exaggerated, but nevertheless, before the victory ball, it is worth remembering - the Israeli occupation is the longest military occupation of modern times. The subjects of the occupation in its two forms - the West Bank and the Gaza Strip - live under a brutal regime that few other occupations allowed themselves, without any law - the blockade and the morbidity rate among children, the roadblocks and the arbitrariness of the soldiers, breaking in to people's homes  (imagine your children being awakened at night by the shouting of armed men, breaking down doors and blinding them with flashlights; imagine living without any protection ), the prolonged occupation, a disaster for us and for the Palestinians - because Israel enjoys the support of the West.
The settlements have turned the occupation into something insolvable, at least in the next few decades, so that the occupation will not merely raise another generation of Israeli troopers, egged on by the rabbis of the rabble, but also a third and fourth generation of Palestinians without another kind of life.
The fact that the Gaza Strip has become an international symbol of cruelty is yet further proof of the stupidity of our leaders. Operation Cast Lead and the blockade of Gaza - both of them with broad national consensus - have turned Gaza into a symbol that no longer needs coordination on the part of the Palestinians. Israeli democracy appears as it actually is: In the name of the majority  (six million Jews ) it is permitted to do to the minority  (five million, in Israel and the territories ) almost anything.
The national minority in Israel has the right to vote but it does not have television of its own ; it has health insurance but also heavy unemployment and infant mortality rates that are much higher than among the Jews  (8.3 compared with 3.7 for every 1000 births ). Tel Aviv, which sells itself to the world as a liberal city, is the only metropolis in the West that does not have a Muslim population. Its "coolness" is racist - the 20 percent minority does not appear at all in the life of the city. And it is advisable for propagandists not to point to Jaffa as proof of diversity - Jaffa with its yuppie immigration is a perfect example of apartheid carried out by "secular" and "liberal" Tel Aviv.
Official propaganda, too, will not help. The more pressure Israel brings to bear on centers in the West - countries and media giants - the more the wave against it grows, because the hatred of the occupation and of Israeli racism springs from the knowledge that what Israel does is funded by the West, gets assistance from the West, and from connections with the focuses of power - as a living memorial to colonialism. There is nothing better than the way in which the Greeks thwarted the Gaza aid flotilla's departure to reinforce this. It was not just Greece that thwarted it.
The coalitions that are being organized against Israel in the West include members of the left. There are also many others and not all of them are humanistic. They are not always Jew-lovers. These coalitions will continue to grow as long as the western political community presents itself as "helpless" in the face of Israeli obduracy. Of course it is not helpless, and when it has actual interests, it is capable of behaving in typically western barbaric fashion, as it is doing now in Libya and in Iraq.
The loathing of Israel fits in with the growing anti-establishment wrath, within the context of politics where there is no difference between the parties. The protests in Greece are an example of lack of faith of this kind, which does not spring from the Israeli occupation but from the powerlessness of the masses to influence what is taking place in their countries - economics and war.
Israel is merely one subject out of several that the political - or the apolitical - complaining is busy with. Very few people join flotillas, but many more participate in sending them and even more internalize their oppression. The complaining and mumbling is part of a burgeoning anti-establishment consensus. The record of what is always known as "the hypocritical politicians" has been joined by the hypocritical attitude toward Israeli cruelty.
It is not surprising therefore that the blockade of Gaza is getting tighter in the form of a moral blockade of Israel. Slowly but surely, in a world filled with injustice and war crimes and racism toward minorities and migrants, Israel has learned, during decades of stupidity, how to become the symbol of injustice and these crimes. We are no longer the embodiment of progress, as we were trumpeted as being for a long time, but the exact opposite. And this is truly just the beginning.

<title>Silent no longer </title>
<date>Fri Jul 01 02:11:33 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
 Several weeks ago, in Prague, I participated in a meeting of young Jewish leaders from all over the world. None were part of any political party, although we all belong to a well-established organization affiliated to the World Jewish Congress, and are all committed to the well-being of Israel and Diaspora Jewry. The agenda was rich: discussions on how to fight anti-Semitism and the delegitimization of the Jewish state, and on the Iranian threat and interfaith relations - to name only a few. It was heartening to see these bright and enthusiastic young people prepared to offer the best of themselves to worthy Jewish causes. 
 Naturally, one of the issues that came up was the "unilateral" declaration of Palestinian statehood expected in September at the United Nations. Many mainstream Jewish organizations were eager for us to tackle the issue, and so it was supposed to be one of the first items on the agenda. Except that most of the participants were not enthusiastic, to put it mildly. Not that we thought that the unilateral declaration  is a good thing in itself. But we felt that what was being asked of us - because it was at the heart of the political debate in Israel as well as in the Jewish world - put at risk the cohesiveness of the whole gathering. For what was being demanded was to obey an Israeli injunction to lobby our respective national governments without debate. As if we were soldiers in a battle in which we had no say. And what's worse, soldiers in a unwinnable battle. The unease, however unspoken, was palpable. 
 And then, the most senior of us, a former high-ranking American Jewish official, and a hard-liner at that when it comes to Israel, spoke up. "Drop the issue," he said, "leave the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to the Israelis. You focus on the core, consensual issues of Jewish concern. Otherwise, we are doomed to split." A sigh of relief was perceptible. 
 What a strange phenomenon, I thought. There we were, a group of dedicated Zionist Jews, veterans of all the relevant battlegrounds of our time - Durban I and II, the Red Cross, Interpol and the UN Human Rights Council - now reluctant to embark on a campaign that had been classified by the Israeli government as its top diplomatic priority! 
 A week later, another gathering, in another European capital. Delegations from all over the EU came to Paris to mark the first anniversary of JCall, the European version of the American J Street. The hall was full of people very different from my colleagues in Prague. They included prominent intellectuals and other luminaries of Jewish civil society. The mood was bleak. 
 One after the other, the orators expressed their feeling of deep love for and commitment to the Jewish state, and at the same time, bewilderment in the face of the erratic, if not suicidal, behavior of its government. They talked about the growing isolation of Israel, the prospect of a third intifada that seemed inevitable considering the current stalemate of the so-called "peace process," the mounting wave of Arab protest - and yes, the rapidly approaching September vote. They complained about the sheep-like kowtowing of self-styled Jewish leadership in the Diaspora to the empty slogans of the current Israeli government. And they stated, once and again, what should be obvious: Being a Zionist does not necessarily mean being a Greater Israel activist. Quite the opposite, in fact, as the settlement frenzy is likely to bury the Zionist dream altogether. 
 In a way, the Paris event was the answer to the uneasiness we felt in Prague. The September unilateral declaration is not the real problem. The truth is that more and more Jews outside Israel have simply ceased to understand what on earth the government in Jerusalem stands for and where it is leading its nation, and with it, the whole Jewish people. This is not even a matter of left or right, but of plain logic: No country can "dwell alone" forever, not even North Korea. And Israel, "the only democracy in the Middle East," is not North Korea. 
 No country can survive in a hostile environment when it dooms itself to be a binational state. A binational state will eventually have to choose between equally unacceptable alternatives of apartheid or civil war. And no country can nurture a vibrant democracy at the same time that it is an occupying power. Democracy, after all, is about freedom and equality before the law. 
 Israeli brothers and sisters: Don't let yourselves be misled by the standing ovation that your prime minister enjoyed on Capitol Hill in May, for that was all about American politics. And don't get excited by the unflinching support of AIPAC, for that's all about Jewish American politics. Do listen to the mounting murmur of despair from the Diaspora, from the depths of the Jewish silent majority, which is less and less silent. 
 JCall was founded around an "appeal to reason." Isn't it about time to take heed of the voice of reason?

<title>The gap is narrowing between IDF and ultra-Orthodox customs</title>
<date>Fri Oct 28 03:49:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Never has the evil inclination been so evil and contagious. Kids turn into billy goats and heroes must struggle to overcome their urges on all fronts.
A month ago cadets left a pep rally after a female soldier-singer exposed her nakedness - with her voice. And last week, during the post-Simhat Torah celebration, hundreds of female soldiers were ordered to stay away from the celebrants and gather in a fenced-off area. The female commanders left in protest and returned to their base. It's a shame they didn't go home for good until they received an apology from the two brigadier generals who were present and didn't intervene. What's happening here all of a sudden? Have the emergency warehouses run out of baking soda to suppress our sexual urges?
The distance between the Israel Defense Forces and Mea She'arim is getting shorter. Although that ultra-Orthodox neighborhood in Jerusalem doesn't have any draftees, its spirit hovers over the ranks. In both places there is a separation between women and men, between masculine and feminine areas, while the High Court of Justice says this is forbidden. How very nice of it to do so.
And why shouldn't they expand the boundaries of separation if the gender-segregated buses continue to operate - young men in front and virgins in back - and the government subsidizes this gender-based apartheid. In New York too there was a report this week about a segregated bus line, and the mayor immediately declared: "Private people: You can have a private bus. Go rent a bus and do what you want on it."
It's clear that New York will mend its ways before Jerusalem, because the shtreimel-wearing shebab bow their heads before the authorities, and only here will they raise their heads. For from Zion shall exclusion come forth, for in Jerusalem ethnic and gender-based purification is taking place, women are disappearing from the public space, erased from ads and billboards. And the mayor fires his deputy for daring to turn to the courts to avenge the honor of her sisters.
"Don't judge someone until you've stood in his shoes," and we are trying to reach it, if not the place itself, then nearby. It's very hard to be a Jew who both guards his homeland and strictly observes the commandments; it's hard to be a brave soldier when there are so many Jewish Delilahs around.
It's hard to see 6-year-old child Liliths studying together with boys their own age; the holy community of Beit Shemesh is already working to change the situation. And it's hard to be a bagger standing behind the female cashiers at the supermarket, who stand or sit, and sometimes bend over, may God preserve them, and us.
Even religious Zionism has fallen victim to ultra-Orthodox fanaticism. More educational institutions are separating the sexes, and religious Zionism's youth movement is also trying to save young souls. It would be preferable for Bnei Akiva's girls to wrap themselves in black rags like the Taliban.
The modesty brigades go outside the walls, and now they're attacking the kibbutzim. I couldn't believe a friend who told me about Kibbutz Ashdot Ya'akov  (Ihud ), which recently held a Simhat Torah celebration in strictly Orthodox style - men in one place, women in another. Who will remove the dust from the eyes of the pioneer women who chiseled stones on the Tzemah-Tiberias road, who with the sweat of their brows cultivated the vegetable garden at the Kinneret farm? Had there not already been so many eulogies for the kibbutz movement, another one would have been added here.
Never has the status of women in Israel been so high, and never has it been so low. A woman is the president of the Supreme Court, while women head the protest movement and two political parties, with a third on the way. The day will come when they are asked to sit in the balcony of the Knesset, like in the synagogue. Male MKs won't protest their marginalization too loudly for fear that pious rabbis will attack them in their sermons.

<title>The mistake of what's left of the left </title>
<date>Tue Apr 26 01:53:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Benjamin Netanyahu's weak spot involves Israel's dependency on "world opinion," meaning the opinion of the Western establishments, and the fact that most of them do indeed disagree with Israel's conduct, which has hardly changed over the years. The deepening occupation, which is clearly becoming apartheid, despite the legal reservations about the word's definition, are the Labor Party's heritage. Some of the party's leaders are still causing damage, including Ehud Barak, under whose term as prime minister the settlements expanded the most; Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, who started building the apartheid "bypass routes" and founded the East Jerusalem settlement at Jebl Abu Gheniem, now known as Har Homa; and Shimon Peres, the ambassador who makes the occupation kosher.
The Israeli intelligentsia, a remnant of the former Israeli left, still influences the media  (why deny this? ). Its dissatisfaction annoys Netanyahu because it keeps him from appearing as the representative of all Israelis. Currently the West does not care how much he represents Israelis, because he does not represent the millions of Palestinians under Israel's boot. These people have no representation at all.
Netanyahu's weakness stems from the fact that he does not offer the West phrases with two meanings like Peres does - phrases like "when people talk, they don't shoot." The love between Peres and Western officials was forged amid idle chatter about peace, as the occupation entrenched itself. And thus, if Western governments want an agreement, or if they need the politics of peace with its champagne and shrimp, due to "the anxiety over the dreadful bloodshed in the region," Netanyahu is not providing. This is his main weakness.
Wars do not really worry the Western peace-lovers so long as oil prices are steady and their vacations are uninterrupted. The Israeli elites are much the same. They are not concerned about the Palestinians under the prolonged military dictatorship and the risk of war. The hopes that many Israelis - the remnants of the left - pin on the West stem from a false image: "We" fulfill the values of the enlightened West in our country, they say, so why does the enlightened West not act according to its/our values and do something?
After all, the occupation is morally wrong, so why not bring back forced withdrawals, say the remnants of the left as they sit in front of their televisions, which broadcast images of prospering settlers, and save us from fighting the right's main power base? Why shouldn't the West release us from the daily politics of persuading Israelis, including the settlers, that the settlements are indeed the main obstacle to peace? Well, nothing of the sort is going to happen, only assassinations, terrorist attacks, funerals, arrests, torture, roadblocks, F-16 attacks and "precise" shellings.
After 44 years, Israel and the occupation are a huge tank that cannot reverse and can only advance. Only together can the Israelis and the Palestinians can be freed from the occupation. It cannot be done through a lie about "direct negotiations," only by a popular Palestinian struggle against the occupation, with patriotic Israeli help. The Israeli slogan must be "The intifada is not against us and we are not against it," in the name of a good life. It is doubtful whether the prayer books of any other people include a daily prayer for earning a living and having a good life.

<title>The necessary elimination of Israeli democracy</title>
<date>Fri Nov 25 08:20:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Speaking in the Knesset in January 1993, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said, "Iran is in the initial stages of an effort to acquire nonconventional capability in general, and nuclear capability in particular. Our assessment is that Iran today has the appropriate manpower and sufficient resources to acquire nuclear arms within 10 years. Together with others in the international community, we are monitoring Iran's nuclear activity. They are not concealing the fact that the possibility that Iran will possess nuclear weapons is worrisome, and this is one of the reasons that we must take advantage of the window of opportunity and advance toward peace."
At that time, Israel had a strategy - which began to be implemented in the Oslo accords, put an end to the priority granted the settlement project and aimed to improve the treatment of Israel's Arab citizens.
If things had gone differently, the Iran issue might look different today. However, as it turned out, the Oslo strategy collided with another, stronger ideology: the ideology of Gush Emunim  (Bloc of the Faithful ), which since the 1970s, apart from the Oslo period and the time of the withdrawal from Gaza, has established the concrete basis for the actions of Israel's governments. Even governments that were ostensibly far removed from the Gush Emunim strategy implemented it in practice. Ehud Barak boasted that, in contrast to other prime ministers, he did not return territory to the Palestinians - and there's no need to point out once again the increase in the number of settlers during his tenure. The government of Ehud Olmert, which declared its intention to move toward a policy of hitkansut  (or "convergence," another name for what Ariel Sharon termed "disengagement" ) in Judea and Samaria, held talks with senior Palestinians on an agreement but did not stop the settlement enterprise, which conflicts with the possibility of any agreement.
The strategy that follows from the ideology of Gush Emunim is clear and simple: It perceives of the Six-Day War as the continuation of the War of Independence, both in terms of seizure of territory, and in its impact on the Palestinian population. According to this strategy, the occupation boundaries of the Six-Day War are the borders that Israel must set for itself. And with regard to the Palestinians living in that territory - those who did not flee or were not expelled - they must be subjected to a harsh regime that will encourage their flight, eventuate in their expulsion, deprive them of their rights, and bring about a situation in which those who remain will not be even second-class citizens, and their fate will be of interest to no one. They will be like the Palestinian refugees of the War of Independence; that is their desired status. As for those who are not refugees, an attempt should be made to turn them into "absentees." Unlike the Palestinians who remained in Israel after the War of Independence, the Palestinians in the territories should not receive Israeli citizenship, owing to their large number, but then this, too, should be of interest to no one.
The ideology of Gush Emunim springs from religious, not political motivations. It holds that Israel is for the Jews, and it is not only the Palestinians in the territories who are irrelevant: Israel's Palestinian citizens are also exposed to discrimination with regard to their civil rights and the revocation of their citizenship.
This is a strategy of territorial seizure and apartheid. It ignores judicial aspects of territorial ownership and shuns human rights and the guarantees of equality enshrined in Israel's Declaration of Independence. It is a strategy of unlimited patience; what is important is the unrelenting progress toward the goal. At the same time, it is a strategy that does not pass up any opportunity that comes its way, such as the composition of the present Knesset and the unclear positions of the prime minister.
The term "apartheid" refers to the undemocratic system of discriminating between the rights of the whites and the blacks, which once existed in South Africa. Even though there is a difference between the apartheid that was practiced there and what is happening in the territories, there are also some points of resemblance. There are two population groups in one region, one of which possesses all the rights and protections, while the other is deprived of rights and is ruled by the first group. This is a flagrantly undemocratic situation.
Since the Six-Day War, there has been no other group in Israel with the ideological resilience of Gush Emunim, and it is not surprising that many politicians have viewed that ideology as a means for realizing personal political ambitions. Zevulun Hammer, who identified this ideology as the way to capture the leadership of the National Religious Party, and Ariel Sharon, who identified this ideology as the way to capture the leadership of Likud, were only two of many. Now Avigdor Lieberman, too, is following this path, but there were and are others, such as the late Hanan Porat, for whom the realization of this ideology was and remains the purpose of their political activity.
This ideology views the creation of an Israeli apartheid regime as a necessary tool for its realization. It has no difficulty with illegal actions and with outright criminality, because it rests on mega-laws that it has adopted and that have no connection with the laws of the state, and because it rests on a perverted interpretation of Judaism. It has scored crucial successes. Even when actions inspired by the Gush Emunim ideology conflict with the will of the government, they still quickly win the backing of the government. The fact that the government is effectively a tool of Gush Emunim and its successors is apparent to everyone who has dealings with the settlers, creating a situation of force multiplication.
This ideology has enjoyed immense success in the United States, of all places. President George H.W. Bush was able to block financial guarantees to Israel because of the settlements established by the government of Yitzhak Shamir  (who said lying was permissible to realize the Gush Emunim ideology. Was Benjamin Netanyahu's Bar-Ilan University speech a lie of this kind? ). Now, though, candidates for the Republican Party's presidential nomination are competing among themselves over which of them supports Israel and the occupation more forcefully. Any of them who adopt the approach of the first President Bush will likely put an end to their candidacy.
Whatever the reason for this state of affairs - the large number of evangelicals affiliated with the Republican party, the problematic nature of the West's relations with Islam, or the power of the Jewish lobby, which is totally addicted to the Gush Emunim ideology - the result is clear: It is not easy, and may be impossible, for an American president to adopt an activist policy against Israeli apartheid.
Legalizing the illegal 
 
Because of its inherent illegality, at least in democratic terms, an apartheid regime cannot abide opposition or criticism. The Gush Emunim ideology is obliged to eliminate them both, and to prevent every effort to block its activity, even if that activity is illegal and even criminal, and intended to maintain apartheid. The illegal activity needs to be made legal, whether through the emendation of laws or through changing their judicial interpretation − such things have occurred before, in other places and at other times.
 
Against this background, we are now seeing the campaign of legislation against -- and the unbridled slandering of -- the Supreme Court, against human rights organizations and against the press, as well as the passage of the so-called Boycott Law, which is aimed at preventing the possibility of Israeli apartheid being dealt with in the same way as South African apartheid. It is against this same background that we have seen the advancement of legislation directed against the Arab citizens of Israel, such as the Loyalty Law and the proposal for a “Basic Law of Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People.” And it is against this background that a campaign of incitement and intimidation is being waged against the necessary and justified critique being voiced by members of academia.
 
The Supreme Court, which permitted the settlement project and effectively collaborated with the Gush Emunim ideology, has now become an obstacle that needs to be removed - in the eyes of those who still adhere to that ideology - primarily because the court refuses to recognize the possibility of settling on privately owned Palestinian land and did not overturn the government decision to evacuate the settlements in the Gaza Strip. Because the land belongs to the Jews by divine decree  and history (from this perspective, there are similarities between Gush Emunim and Hamas ), there is no choice but to elect to the Supreme Court justices who live on Palestinian land, possibly private land, and those who understand that there is no such thing as "land under private Palestinian ownership."
Similarly, this line of thinking goes, the Supreme Court's interpretation of human rights laws also requires its elimination in its present format. Judgments such as those relating to the Kaadan family  (allowing an Arab family to build a home in a Jewish community ); the selling of Jewish National Fund land to Arab citizens of Israel; the amendment to the Citizenship Law  (no ruling has yet been handed down, but there seems to be a possibility that a majority of justices will rule it illegal ); the opening of a highway to Palestinian traffic - all these rulings conflict with essential elements in Gush Emunim ideology: the discrimination between Jews and Palestinians  (in Israel and the territories ) and the deprivation of the Palestinians' rights, which transform them into second-class people, absentees or, best of all, refugees.
Does an Israel of this kind have a future? Over and beyond the question of whether Jewish morality and the Jewish experience allow such circumstances to exist, it is clear that this is a flagrantly unstable and even dangerous situation. It is a situation that will prevent Israel from fully realizing its vast potential, a situation of living by the sword - a sword that could be a third intifada, the collapse of peace with Egypt and a confrontation with a nuclear Iran. Yitzhak Rabin understood that.

<title>The right context </title>
<date>Fri Nov 25 02:03:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
The government frequently tries to justify its anti-democratic bills by comparing them to laws in democratic states.  For example, it contends that the newly proposed bills  regarding the nomination procedures for Supreme Court justices reflect the process used in the United States. When the coalition passes anti-Arab legislation like the "Nakba law," which lets the finance minister cut the budgets of publicly funded institutions that commemorate the Nakba, it argues that we have to defend Israel's values as a "Jewish and democratic" state, by citing the German legal principle of "militant democracy." The government also has made similar comparisons to justify bills that would severely limit foreign funding to local human rights organizations.
It is important for governments to compare themselves with other nations. Given the current state of affairs, it is perhaps even a good sign that the Netanyahu coalition still believes it needs international legitimacy to justify these bills. However, when a comparison does not consider the other nations' social, political and historical circumstances, it can be inaccurate and misleading. It is true that some of the worst crimes against  humanity have been committed by "Western" democracies: the Holocaust, slavery, apartheid and segregation. But today, regimes such as those in Germany, South Africa and the U.S., whatever their defects, are based on fundamental civil rights and respect for separation of powers.
The U.S. Supreme Court has a long and distinguished history of constitutional review; it has intervened in numerous laws passed by Congress and in executive political decisions. A decade ago, in Bush v. Gore, it even decided who would be president, based on a majority vote of just one justice. No political leader called for limiting the court's power in response to this decision, which was fully implemented.
While U.S. citizens elected an African-American president, in Israel the Knesset tries to disqualify the Arab minority's political parties from every election because those parties advocate full equality and inclusion, "a state for all of its citizens." When  Germans use the term "militant democracy," they are referring to defending the rights of ethnic minorities from racist politicians. And while the EU wants to promote human rights abroad, the Netanyahu government seems far less committed to these values than it does to limiting the EU's ability to promulgate them in  Israel, by its repeated attempts to restrict NGO funding.
The disingenuity of the government's international comparisons is evident when one compares politicians' rhetoric for audiences within Israel with the diplomatic discourse they employ abroad. At home, this government harshly criticizes the Supreme Court; abroad, the Foreign Ministry boasts proudly that Israel has the world's strongest high court. While officials criticize former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak's rulings regarding  Palestinian cases, the Foreign Ministry hands out a booklet at conferences abroad listing these same cases as evidence that Israel is committed to the rule of law and democratic values. While right-wing lawmakers incite daily against Arab Knesset members,  Israeli officials support their argument that Israel is not an apartheid state by raising the fact of Arab Knesset representation.
An American friend reported happily to me how he had heard an Israeli right-wing diplomat praising the NGO I lead, Adalah: The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, as an  example of Israel's commitment to its Arab citizens' rights. What my friend did not know is that at home, the foreign minister attacks Adalah and other human rights groups daily.
In the past, we human-rights litigators tended to cite progressive rulings by Western countries' national courts when we argued before Israel's Supreme Court. Lately, we have been finding that the most effective comparisons are to Western nations during their darker days. Even during segregation and apartheid, these countries' national courts sometimes succeeded in defending  human rights. For example, to challenge the new anti-boycott law, which prohibits publicly promoting boycotts of Israeli institutions and settlements, a good comparison would be to the U.S. during segregation, when the Supreme Court defended the freedom of expression of black institutions such as the NAACP when they boycotted racist white companies and state services. In making the case against the Israeli citizenship law, which banned family unification in Israel between Palestinian-Israeli citizens and their Palestinian spouses from the West Bank and Gaza, the best comparison is a landmark decision by a South African court that struck down the apartheid-era policy, which banned family unification between blacks in urban cities. During the Supreme Court  hearing on the Nakba law last month, the state argued that no country would allow some of its citizens to mark its Independence Day as a day of mourning. We responded that not only do many natives in settler countries such as the U.S., Canada,  Australia and New Zealand still perceive the national Independence Day as a tragedy, but those states have in many cases apologized and recognized their historical injustice, and even fund some of the native populations' commemorative days.
Regarding the NGO funding laws, apartheid South Africa  behaved entirely differently than Israel's government is seeking to do now: There, the regime did not prohibit the U.S. and  European countries from funding human rights organizations; rather, the human rights organizations threatened the donor states that they would stop taking funds from them if these states did not boycott the apartheid regime.
Maybe it is better, therefore, when comparing this government's legislation, to do so in the right context.

<title>The settler leader who led Israelis to disaster</title>
<date>Fri Oct 07 04:31:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
There were so many accolades and so much praise that I found myself getting confused. Was this the same Hanan Porat that I also knew? True, he was an idealist, and charismatic, and modest, and he always said what he felt in his heart. True, also, that he was the great leader of Gush Emunim. But we must not forget, and this is the tragic part of the story, that his biggest success - covering the West Bank with a carpet of Israeli settlements - was also the greatest disaster that befell the people of Israel.
My father used to say that Hanan Porat was a very dangerous man. He looked so nice, so handsome, and he always smiled a smile of pure olive oil, so that you would become confused and charmed by him and wouldn't notice that he was leading you, pied piper-style to a disaster.
His admirers pointed out this week what a gigantic contribution he had made to the settlement enterprise on the West Bank. But Porat did not make do with Judea and Samaria. He was a maximalist. He wanted everything. When Menachem Begin signed the peace treaty with Egypt, he attacked him with fury and joined MK Geula Cohen, who bolted the Likud to form the rightwing Tehiya Party. Because even in return for peace with Egypt he believed it was forbidden to return even one grain of sand in Sinai. Imagine our situation in the 32 years that have since passed without  (even a cold ) peace with Cairo. How many soldiers would have been killed, how many wars would have broken out, how many tens of billions of shekels would have been wasted?
That was also Porat's approach with regard to evacuating Gush Katif. From his point of view, even the Gaza Strip, with its 1.5 million Arabs, was ours and we should not give up even one clod of its earth, despite the fact that it was not part of the Land of Israel.
Immediately after the Yom Kippur War, Porat understood that if he could fill Judea and Samaria with dozens of settlements and hundreds of thousands of settlers, no government would be able to evacuate the territories and arrive at a peace agreement because no government would have sufficient strength and resources to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people. In that way, we would remain forever in Judea and Samaria and continue to live  (or to die ) by the sword.
Porat and Moshe Levinger, with their messianic enthusiasm, began to realize this strategy at the train station in Sebastia, in the winter of 1975, when then-Defense Minister Shimon Peres bowed to the pressures and granted permission to set up a temporary settlement at the Kadum army camp near Nablus. From that one settlement, Kedumim, 150 settlements have since sprung up and they have turned Israel into an apartheid state that is despised in the world, threatened from every direction, and left  (almost ) without a single friend. Turkey lashes out at us, Egypt expels our diplomats, the Jordanian monarch is in despair, the German chancellor reprimands us, and only American President Barack Obama is still suffering in silence. But there is one achievement - it is not possible to arrive at a peace agreement.
The continued occupation and the cruel acts in the territories - from stealing lands to burning mosques - are threatening our very existence. Because world public opinion is turning against us, and in democratic regimes public opinion, at the end of the day, determines the tune for the government. The abuse in the territories is also in total contradiction to the moral teachings of Israel's prophets - Amos, Isaiah, and Jeremiah - but Porat and his colleagues knew only the Book of Joshua.
The settlement in the territories also has an economic angle. That is because the massive and expensive construction there comes precisely at the expense of the Negev and Galilee. The construction of the settlements, the expensive infrastructures in the mountains, paving the roads, giving the settlers houses that are half free, the huge security expenses, the reductions in taxes for settlers and investors, the granting of excessive rights for education, the double budgets for the local authorities - all these tens of billions have come at the expense of the residents of Israel's outlying regions and at the expense of budgets for education, welfare and infrastructures within the Green Line. When will we comprehend that?
Indeed Porat was an honest man, and he had a vision which actually managed to change the face of reality. But all of that merely strengthens the need to argue with his opinions and deeds. In Barbara Tuchman's famous book, "The March of Folly," there are several examples of historic decisions which changed the face of reality, but led people to disaster. The settlement enterprise in the territories is another chapter in that book.

<title>Time to focus on transparency </title>
<date>Fri Jul 22 02:21:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Since the notorious NGO Forum of the 2001 Durban Conference on racism, a wide spectrum of nongovernmental organizations have implemented a coordinated isolation and demonization strategy against Israel, of which the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement is a key component. Influential and well-financed Israeli and Palestinian NGOs are very active in their use of this strategy, and in a democratic society such as ours, their claims and agendas should not be immune from criticism and debate.
However, two pieces of legislation - the newly passed "anti-boycott law" and a proposal, sponsored by MK Fania Kirshenbaum of Yisrael Beiteinu, that aimed to open an official inquiry into the funding of NGOs accused of being involved in delegitimization - are more likely to polarize Israelis, as well as Diaspora Jews, than to shed light or encourage informed criticism. The parliamentary and public debates surrounding these initiatives demonstrate their intense political nature, as both ends of the ideological spectrum ignore the complex and substantive issues that are involved.
Many on the right tend to portray NGOs that use the language of human rights as enemies of Israel, without distinction, while on the left, the tendency is to paint criticism of their actions as "McCarthyist" and as heralding the "death of Israeli democracy."
Neither of these ideological responses helps Israel combat the real threat from delegitimization - in the form of lawfare, BDS, Durban III and various other "mini-Durban" conferences held by the UN - nor do they address the root problem of foreign government funding to political advocacy NGOs. Instead, these partisan activities, which ignore broad and legitimate concerns, feed the demonization, and increase the divisions within Israeli society.
The right's tactics provide more ammunition for Israel's most ardent critics to assert that Israeli democracy is under siege, further contributing to the country's isolation. Attacking the legitimacy of Israel's parliament and judicial system are common tactics in the Durban strategy, and both new pieces of legislation provide more examples for critics to reference.
On the left of Israeli politics, the intense condemnation of the new BDS law, and the plan to challenge it in the High Court, are indicative of a strong democracy, not of its decline. Many NGOs on the left also misrepresent the new law and the BDS movement by saying that the boycotts' targets are limited to "settlements" and occupation. But, instead of engaging in substantive public debate on how foreign government funding to NGOs sustains the BDS movement, manipulates Israeli politics, supports lawfare campaigns, and amplifies rhetoric of "apartheid" and "war crimes," these NGOs divert attention through false claims.
The problematic, nontransparent nature of massive foreign government funding to political NGOs continues. It is too soon to know whether earlier legislation, based on the public's right to know, and adopted February 21, 2011, will bring an end to this secrecy. However, the litany of new Knesset legislation on NGOs and boycotts is likely to divert attention from the funding transparency issue.
While preaching democracy and good government to others, European officials blatantly violate the basic principles of funding transparency and open debate. Great secrecy hides all aspects of the processes through which the EU funds groups such as Yesh Din, Adalah - the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, as well as many Palestinian groups.
Swiss parliament members, for example, recently held an unprecedented debate on their government's funding of the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic activities of the BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and Refugee Rights. BADIL promotes BDS, rejects the U.S. roadmap for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative, and also employs demonizing language such as "Israel's colonial apartheid regime" and "systematic ethnic cleansing." BADIL awarded a prize to a crude anti-Semitic cartoon in its 2010 Al-Awda Nakba competition, and published it on its website.
In May 2011, the Swiss government reportedly froze funding for BADIL. The British government has also ended funding for some political advocacy NGOs. There are many other examples of NGO funding throughout Europe, however, that have not been addressed. Instead of initiating a flood of problematic legislation, Knesset members should raise this with their European counterparts.
Neither the anti-boycott law nor the proposed inquiry committee will change funding practices of European governments for political advocacy NGOs. Rather, a parliamentary inquiry into abuses of NGO funding would be most useful in the European context, since this is the main source of money for the BDS campaigns and other forms of demonization. But until that occurs, Israeli politicians should refrain from counterproductive legislation that encourages the delegitimization movement, instead of providing effective mechanisms to combat it.

<title>Toward a new settlement enterprise </title>
<date>Mon Mar 14 01:31:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
In a typical Pavlovian reaction, the ministerial committee on settlements has decided to build 500 housing units in response to the murder at Itamar. We are so accustomed to this conduct that we may not even realize how destructive it is, sticking Israel deeper and deeper into territories not its own, wasting public money and impeding any possible future solution.
But what are 500 housing units compared with 50,000? This is the destructive building impetus that Netanyahu has offered in his new plan, which has already earned heaps of scorn: a year and a half of accelerated permits, hasty planning, trampling of open spaces, construction of white elephants and prices that will not go down.
As the son of an historian, Netanyahu should start internalizing: The settlement enterprise is over. It is possible to insist on adding to it housing units, roads and laws against boycotts, but it is over - be this in an agreement with the Palestinians, in a war with a state they will establish unilaterally, in the waning and evaporation of the Apartheid state, or in a binational state. In any case, this is the end of settlements by the State of Israel in Judea and Samaria.
To a large extent, the settlement project in the occupied territories is the Jewish-capitalist pendulum reaction to the secular-socialist settlement project in Israel's early years - all part of the internal Jewish struggle for ownership of the state and the land. Both of these grand projects have had destructive effects on those who were not partner to them. Now the time has come for the pendulum to stabilize in the middle, in a place where it is possible to live. What needs to be built today is the next phase of the State of Israel.
The plan that should be coming out today is one for resettlement of the Jewish settlers in the territories. Not "evacuation-compensation" that gives them money and then forgets about them, but rather a call to rise up and walk within the boundaries of the state and seek their next home. A call to resettle, in their own free time, as individuals or as groups, in one of the wonderful locations the State of Israel has to offer. It is an opportunity to leverage the fact that the settlers are not residents of the overpriced and overcrowded center of the country and offer them an excellent quality of life in the Negev or the Galilee.
The committees that should be formed are regional committees, which in consultation with the heads of the local authorities, existing planning bodies (which should be supplemented with professional manpower ) and representatives of government offices will meet with the re-settlers and offer them apartments, homes and neighborhoods suited to the way of life they seek, as well as a package of incentives to give them the best possible start when making their move. Perhaps it is even possible to think about a new role for the kibbutzim in this context.
Of course, the hardcore ideological third of the settlers will not agree to meet with any committee. But two-thirds of the 330,000 people now living outside the borders of the state will be glad to have the opportunity for a good life without the risk of evacuation. Such a plan would bring excellent people to communities hungering for people like them, it would provide an opportunity to upgrade social services in communities they join, and it would enable good, good, yet gradual, development for all concerned.
When Israel wants to do things like this, it knows how: Just witness the relocation of the Israel Defense Forces to the south, to the metropolis of Be'er Sheva. The army is evacuating land in the center of the country, receiving new and upgraded infrastructures and bringing excellent people and worthwhile employment opportunities to areas where they are welcomed them with open arms.
Instead of throwing away hundreds of millions on 500 destructive housing units, the same money could be used to construct cultural, educational and health facilities in Mitzpeh Ramon, Carmiel, Dimona and Tiberias for the benefit of the inhabitants there and those who will join them. Such a plan could be carried out today even without committing to a future agreement with the Palestinians, just by looking inwards, at the state of Israel, at its needs and at what will advance it in the future. And no emergency plan.
Enough with emergencies. Israel needs space to breathe, reasonable planning and a gradual transition. Not a disengagement and not staking claims to bits of land in the dark of night. It needs a phase of sanity.

<title>Why should anyone believe Netanyahu?</title>
<date>Mon Nov 14 02:39:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
If the law enabled putting leaders on trial for serial defrauding of the public and obtaining support through deception, Prime Minister Benjamin   Netanyahu would be keeping company with Moshe Katsav in prison. The former president has been convicted of raping women who were his subordinates and misuse of his authority. Netanyahu is having his nefarious way with Israeli democracy and using his status in order to lead Israeli society astray, all the way to diplomatic and economic isolation. From there it is but a short way to regional war and apartheid - the only question is which will come first. Yet nevertheless, a whole country is continuing to give in willingly to a liar who does not cease to harass and endanger it.
Have I exaggerated? How many politicians, media people and ordinary citizens believe Netanyahu is sincerely interested in reaching a peace agreement with the Palestinians? The reference, of course, is not to an agreement that will include Israeli control over the Jordan Valley for 40 years, as Netanyahu proposed recently to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
During the course of a condolence visit to one of the Jewish settlements at the end of the 1990s, Netanyahu bragged that he had succeeded in deceiving the Clinton administration during his first term as prime minister, in order to destroy the Oslo Accords. Believing the microphones and cameras had been turned off, Netanyahu related how he had extorted from the Clinton administration, in exchange for the Hebron agreement, a promise that Israel would be the sole entity entitled to define what the "military sites" are that will remain under its control. With a sly smile spread across his face, Bibi added: "I said that as far as I am concerned the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military site," and explained: "Why is this important? Because from that moment I stopped the Oslo Accords."
Yitzhak Shamir, Netanyahu's predecessor in the Likud leadership, put this in simple words: "For the Land of Israel it is permissible to lie." Netanyahu, a student of conservative American media advisor Arthur Finkelstein, has a more sophisticated formulation. In a lecture at a Likud conference in Eilat in July 2001, Bibi instructed the activists: "It doesn't matter if justice is on your side. You have to depict your position as just."
Eventually he gave this procedure the broadest possible interpretation. Though in all likelihood he had not forgotten when he came into this world  (October 21, 1949 ), he was able to recount a formative encounter with British soldiers near his childhood home, even though the Mandate had ended well before his birth.
The things French President Nicolas Sarkozy told United States President Barack Obama sum up the reputation he has acquired abroad. The microphone that had been left open by mistake pulled away the diplomatic mask and revealed the two important leaders' opinion of the prime minister of Israel. This was preceded by a meeting between Sarkozy and President Shimon Peres at the beginning of 2010 at the Elysee Palace, during the course of which the French president said: "I don't understand where Netanyahu is going and what he wants."
An equally important European leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, also joined the club of people affected by Netanyahu's lies. Her opinion of the prime minister's peace declarations did not make its way to the microphones, but according to a report by Barak Ravid in Haaretz in February, Merkel told Netanyahu in a phone conversation: "You have disappointed us. You have not taken a single step to advance peace."
On the eve of the most recent meeting between Netanyahu and Obama in New York, it was leaked to The New York Times that Obama had told his advisors he didn't believe Netanyahu would ever be prepared to carry out compromises leading to a peace agreement. Prior to that Steven Simon, Senior Director for Middle East and North Africa at the White House, revealed in a conference call with Jewish community leaders in the United States that the Palestinians had agreed to renew the negotiations on the basis of Obama's outline  (the 1967 lines and agreed exchanges of territories ) and that the ball was now in Netanyahu's court.
As is known, Bibi depicts President Abbas as refusing to enter negotiations. With a trove of lies like this, is Bibi expecting "the world" to believe he intends to attack Iran's nuclear installations and tighten the sanctions on Iran? Why shouldn't they suspect that maybe all the ruckus about the bomb is intended only to distance the threat of peace, and therefore not lift a finger against the Iranian threat?

<title>World looks at Israel as it looked at Apartheid-era South Africa</title>
<date>Wed Mar 09 00:50:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Whether or not Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu uses "a supertanker against the bureaucracy," as he calls it, to alleviate the housing shortage, a no-fly zone for supertankers already exists. It exists whether his idea crashes in the Knesset debates on housing reforms, or flies high above the railway line that's supposed to be extended to Irbid in Jordan - in the East, where there are no procedures or bureaucracy.
Here is its description, from an article in these pages earlier this ("Gilad Farm has been sacrificed," Karni Eldad, March 6 ): "At age 15, they expelled Elisaf Orbach from his home in Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip. He was paid a small amount of compensation and went to Samaria, to build a small, 90-square-meter house to meet his needs until he gets married and has children." Despite the sad continuation - "With his hands bound, on the way to the police van, Orbach heard a tractor destroying his house, five years after his house in the Gaza Strip had been leveled" - I clicked "Like."
The concepts and the division of labor did that to me: expulsion and settling. A small house and a comfortable future, and even a twist in the plot: The forces of evil (police, army, Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak ) gang up on Elisaf and his friends and destroy all that good. And the Palestinians? In this story there are no Palestinians. Go see another movie.
Stealing land and illegal construction, evacuating a few buildings and rebuilding them, the state's report to the High Court of Justice that by the end of the year it would evacuate all outposts built on private Palestinian land - all this is not new. These events repeat themselves like the periodic table. And yet, who would have believed that Netanyahu would get stuck in his second term in the construction business, of all things: freezing construction in the territories, the real-estate bubble, the housing shortage and the sky-rocketing prices. And who would have believed that the housing shortage, of all things, would threaten his coalition?
A few days ago he was still acknowledging that the U.S. veto at the United Nations showed that Israel's status was in trouble. So to reduce political pressure, he sent up a trial balloon by talking to the media about a second Bar-Ilan speech on the peace process. The trial had not yet begun, Shas was already threatening to join in a no-confidence motion, and along came another trial balloon: the National Housing Commissions. Give that man a supertanker and he'll leap the bureaucratic hurdles.
If the Hebrew children's book "The Story of Five Balloons" had been written about Benjamin, the number of his balloons and their colors would have doubled, if not tripled, over the years. And that's how many would have burst. Netanyahu, to his credit or discredit, is still able to create news from a non-item and extricate himself from crises. But another day is waiting. The sun will rise from the region where supertankers do not fly - the territories. The occupation.
On the day this week when the BBC released a survey ranking Israel at the bottom of a list of countries by popularity, Britain announced that it had upgraded the Palestinian delegation's status in London. With this came, apparently coincidently, interviews with our ambassador to Britain, Ron Prosor, who is on his way to the United Nations. "After the fall of apartheid and the the Communist bloc in Europe," he told radio and television journalist Yaron Dekel, "Israel is meeting the need of the British, the Spanish and the Scandinavians to be against."
Here's the problem: The world is not interested in Israel's housing and bureaucratic problems, or in the achievements of its students in mathematics. The world is looking at how the only democracy in the Middle East conducts itself in the occupied territories. It's looking at events in Bil'in and Sheikh Jarrah, at the olive trees that are uprooted, and at the checkpoints. It's looking at the settlers who are shooting and setting fires, and at their leaders, MK Michael Ben-Ari, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Baruch Marzel, bullying their way through Jaffa and Umm al-Fahm.
The world is looking at Israel as it looked at South Africa during apartheid. And the world that doesn't know what Bar-Ilan 2 is will eventually find out. That's not unpleasant, it's terrible.

<title>You and I will piss on the world </title>

<content>
The raven doesn't always wait for the starling to come to him; sometimes he invites him over. So here they are, two men in a lordly pose.
"You and I will piss on the world. Soon the microphones will be removed and we'll be able to exchange jokes about that woman, who has developed a bad habit - she sticks her nose everywhere and has something to say about every country. She thinks Israel resembles Iran, and that Russia holds fraudulent elections. We'll show her from where the beluga secretes its caviar.
"It's true we get the money and weapons we need from that presumptuous woman and her Obama, whereas you, Comrade Vladimir Vladimirovich, help Iran and Syria as much as you can. But we can't let ourselves be confused by unfortunate facts. We, the Israelis, distinguish between those who pretend to be friends and a true friend like you. Please, continue to see me as your representative in Jerusalem. We are brothers, heirs to the KGB tradition - let's raise a glass of Stolichnaya to your life and the life of your 25 years in power, at least."
Despotic regimes and illegitimate entities are experts at deceit, and collaborators will always be found for them. Welcome to Theresienstadt - with your own eyes you will see the lovely art exhibition, with your own ears you will hear the excellent orchestra.
The junta in Argentina also used to invite in guests for quick visits - people who see no flaws. Once Gen. Jorge Videla opened the prison gates to a well-connected Israeli journalist. She spoke with the tortured prisoners and returned full of impressions: Things aren't so terrible and the victims aren't innocent.
And South Africa, during apartheid, purified its sins through others: You are permitted to walk around our country without interference, said the ambassador. You can even meet with members of the opposition in your free time, before or after the visit to the safari. Just don't arrive with prejudice. I decided not to accept the invitation.
And the country of the settlers is also full of guests. Why not visit and enjoy our vineyards and oil presses - they're all so small and pleasant. People sit under their vines and olive trees, in the heart of the pastoral landscape. Only 10 days ago I was invited again, but as a private citizen I no longer cross the Green Line.
Without prejudice, three MKs went to Russia as inspectors - two from Yisrael Beiteinu and one from Kadima. It's true that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has doubts about the legitimacy of the elections - former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev is calling for new elections, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reports "manipulations" and "meddling with the ballot boxes."
But Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and his envoys are not impressed by the gossip about disqualified parties, and about activists and bloggers who were threatened and banned from the media, their websites sabotaged and telephone lines cut. They were urgently summoned to the police and the courts, and were even imprisoned for a few days of cooling-off and reeducation.
After all, Yisrael Beiteinu MKs Faina Kirshenbaum and Robert Ilatov are familiar with those shouting people back home, who have learned as well as they to put subversive and unpatriotic nonprofit organizations in their place. The Russian election committee did a good job choosing the most transparent observers. It's no coincidence that these starlings, of all people, were invited - to learn, but to teach as well.
Lieberman is farsighted; he's laying the foundations for a joint Russian-Israeli future. Just as the defects you attribute to others are those you yourself possess, when you give approval you do so in your own way, in the spirit of the Kremlin and Lieberman's headquarters when he was Likud director general. Perhaps foreign observers will be needed for the coming elections here too, and Vladimir Putin will be have to send his own Kirshenbaums and Ilatovs if he isn't defeated first, like every corrupt tyrant whose time has come.

<title>Abashed by Bush </title>

WASHINGTON - Among the hundreds of anecdotes about U.S. deliberation on whether to support the partition plan for Palestine, on the eve of the 1947 United Nations vote, there are some that reveal more about the president than about the supporters of the emerging state. Harry S Truman wavered during those days between his basic sympathy for the vision of the Jewish state and his anger at the incessant pressure exerted upon him. Even after he had announced his decision to support partition, it was actually a letter of appreciation that he received from Claude Pepper, then a U.S. senator from Florida, that managed to rankle him: "While this matter was pending, I received about 35,000 pieces of mail and propaganda from the Jews in this country," a vexed Truman wrote in response to Pepper. "I put it all in a pile and struck a match to it."  
Robert J. Donovan, in his 1977 book "Conflict and Crisis," on Truman's first term in office, doubts the veracity of this story. He interviewed several members of the president's staff and they all agreed that the bonfire was only in Truman's imagination. In the end, Truman contained his anger, and the following spring, after Israel declared its statehood, he agreed to recognize it. A somewhat anti-Semitic comment here and there, and Truman's refusal to more actively support Israel after its establishment, did not make much difference. Among "the Jews," he had already taken his place in the golden book of chronicles.  
Among the presidents who succeeded him, there were ups and downs - both in their support for Israel and in the fondness of American Jewry for them. Professor Kenneth W. Stein, who resigned from the Jimmy Carter Center after the recent publication of the former president's book, "Palestine: Peace not Apartheid," noted in an article in the current issue of the Middle East Quarterly that the meager support Carter received from Jews in the 1980 elections was a consequence of Carter's "increased pressure on Jerusalem." Since 1920, there had been no Democratic candidate who received so few of their votes, Stein notes in a section of the article entitled "The Roots of Carter's Anger."  
The roots of most of American Jewry's anger toward the current president, George W. Bush, cannot be traced to Israel. They did not vote for him in the first place. His ongoing support for Israel may be recognized and appreciated by the establishment, Israeli and Jewish, but it does not receive due credit among a wide Jewish-American public that is liberal, Democratic, dovish and very angry at Bush for significant and various reasons.  
Much has been written in recent weeks about the decline in interest in Israel among American Jews, but the writers made scant mention, if they mentioned it at all, of American politics. They should have - because Bush, strange as it may sound, is one of the factors behind the widening of the gap between Jews in America and Israel.  
This is one of those bizarre anomalies that characterize the period: The Jews of Israel comprise perhaps the most sympathetic group toward Bush in the entire world. They are certainly more supportive than the general American public and may very well be more sympathetic than any particular group of Americans. On the other hand, American Jews constitute one of the least sympathetic groups. A vast majority of them oppose Bush. Indeed, many really loathe him.  
In a survey conducted by Professor Camil Fuchs for Haaretz last November, it turned out that the overwhelming majority of Jewish Israelis do not agree with the statement that Bush is "dangerous for the world" - as the majority of people in Western countries hold (not to speak of public opinion toward Bush in the Middle East). In a Haaretz survey taken before the presidential election two years ago, Bush was clearly preferred by Jewish Israelis over his rival, John Kerry. But the Jews of America voted en masse for Kerry.  
Some American Jews have a hard time digesting a reality in which an Israeli prime minister can stand at Bush's side and describe the war in Iraq as an achievement. In fact, it could be said that the Israelis' fondness for Bush actually serves to alienate these American Jews from Israel. It is a sort of purist self-indulgence that does not tolerate contradictions: Jews from Israel. If this is the type of leader Israelis respect, and this is the type of leader who is a fan of Israel, how, these Jews wonder, can they identify with Israel?  
And here as well develops a line of revisionist denial of the reality that nearly every average Israeli accepts: Bush is actually "bad for Israel," and only its short-sighted citizenry and leaders fail to realize this. It is ostensibly a positive line, because those who choose it are looking for a way to continue to support Israel. Actually, however, it is patronizing and dangerous, as it is basically an arrogant attempt to deny Israel an independent assessment of the correct path for itself.  
Here's the catch. Bill Clinton, the friendliest president until Bush, and Lyndon Johnson, the friendliest until Clinton, did not put the Jews to this type of test. These two presidents received their votes and advocated policies vis-a-vis Israel that were acceptable to most American Jews. In any case, Bush is also the first president for whose support Israel is paying a price, even if it is a hidden price, among other important supporters, the Jews of America. He is making it difficult for a certain Jewish public to understand Israel and is making it easier for them to distance themselves from Israel. Of course, it's not he who is the guilty party. In this test, it is only the Jews who are failing.

<title>A believer in the grand gesture </title>
<date>Fri Jun 01 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Forty years ago, a prisoner in solitary confinement on South Africa's Robben Island had unusual insights into the Middle East: He warned against "humiliation" of the Arabs and urged that Israel "wash the enemies' wounds." A "grand gesture," he said, was needed for peace.  
Imagine how different our lives would be today if his advice had been heeded! And what dramatic change could be achieved if put into practice even now.  
The prisoner was Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe: He led the Pan-Africanist Congress, whose protests against apartheid on March 21, 1960, led to the Sharpeville massacre, in which police killed 68 demonstrators. Sobukwe was jailed for three years for incitement. As his imprisonment neared its end, a special law was rushed through parliament giving the government the power to continue his detention on a year-by-year basis, without trial. He was kept on his own, seeing few visitors, on Robben Island.  
Sobukwe was allowed to receive newspapers and followed world events closely. We wrote to each other - with great difficulty, because the prison censors delayed our letters for many weeks or simply confiscated them.  
After the end of the 1967 war in the Middle East, he wrote that "vicarious Israeli heroes are individually and severally telling us what lessons are to be drawn from the conflict. Unfortunately, the lessons are merely a rationalization of prejudices.  
"I would have felt happier if Levi Eshkol didn't have a [Moshe] Dayan to put up with. As one correspondent has said, Dayan is no Churchill. I am afraid he is allowing the ululations of the vicarious heroes to go to his head.  
"And yet the touch that is needed is the toning down of the humiliation under which the Arabs smart. Somebody has said a man will forgive you, after some time, for defrauding him or even taking his wife away from him but no man will forget or forgive a humiliation. Eshkol has the personality and the ability, I think, to wash his enemies' wounds."  
Sobukwe went on: "In the American Civil War it is recorded that Grant treated Lee when he came to surrender, as though he were his superior officer. When he left the hall, Grant and his men saluted. Quite recently, in a boxing championship in Britain, the Scottish champion McGowan was forced to retire because of a badly cut eye. The defending champion, an Asian, who was defeating McGowan for the second time, went to McGowan's corner - and they say McGowan was in tears - and knelt before him. The grand gesture.  
"A further illustration. Moshoeshoe I [19th century king of the Basotho nation, today Lesotho], when attacked by the Zulus, inflicted a crushing defeat on them at Thaba Bosiu and, as they retreated, sent a large herd of cattle to 'his brothers.' The Zulus never again attacked him. He cut the English forces to ribbons in 1852, and while Cathcart, the British Commander, was in a state of bewilderment and humiliation, sued for peace!  
"I am not saying Israel should be 'magnanimous.' If I were Nasser I would want no magnanimity from the Jews. All I am saying is that it is Eshkol and not Nasser who can afford a diplomatic rebuff, it is 'adulations' that might go to Dayan's head, 'not ululations.'"  
In another letter, tensions in the Middle East caused him to write that if I had any influence with Dayan I should give him a warning. I did not know Dayan so could not pass on the message: "He'll be seeking to talk genuine peace when Arab humiliation has rendered such a prospect impossible." On the other hand, Sobukwe thought a newspaper article by Dayan's daughter, Yael, "very well balanced - with none of the arrogance that characterises her father's references to Arabs.  
"I say it once more: Nobody is going to be 'taught a lesson' by anybody. The days for that type of mentality are over: between nations and between individuals. Our own children demand that we justify our 'right' to teach them a lesson."  
Nor did he approve of Shimon Peres, then secretary-general of Rafi, whom I interviewed when he visited Johannesburg after the Six-Day War. I sent Sobukwe the text published in my newspaper, the Rand Daily Mail. Sobukwe responded: "Throughout his interview Peres says: 'We told them...' Just imagine [King] Hussein in Peres' place, with the roles reversed, saying 'We told the Jews' and taste it in your mouth."  
Sobukwe did not live to put his thinking into practice. The government held him on Robben Island for six years and continued to fear him for his commitment to freedom. He was banished to the town of Kimberley with severe restrictions on his liberty. He died there of cancer nine years later, in February 1978.  
These details are extracted from "How Can Man Die Better: The Life of Robert  Sobukwe," by Benjamin Pogrund, now reissued in paperback by Jonathan Ball Publishers, Johannesburg.

<title>A boycott by any other name ...</title>
<date>Fri Apr 13 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
In the late 19th century, changes in Ottoman law created a new class of large landholders, including the Sursuq family from Beirut, which acquired large tracts in northern Palestine. A similar situation had long existed in Ireland, where most land was controlled by absentee landlords, many of whom lived in Britain. 
The 1880s, however, initiated dynamics that led the two lands in different directions. In 1882, the first Zionist immigrants arrived in Palestine, starting a process that subsequently led to the eviction of indigenous tenant farmers, when magnates like the Sursuqs pulled the land from under their feet, selling it to the Jewish National Fund. 
In contrast, in 1880, Irish tenant farmers started a process that turned them into owner-occupiers. A former British army officer played a role in this drama, which introduced his name as a new word into many languages. 
Western Ireland was again suffering near-famine conditions. The potato crop had failed for the third successive year. Captain Charles Cunningham Boycott, agent for Lord Erne, the absentee landlord of an estate in County Mayo, refused the request of tenants for a rent reduction and, instead, in September 1880, obtained eviction notices against 11 of them for failure to pay their rent. 
Thirty years earlier, evictions had expelled huge numbers of Irish to North America. But times were changing: A nationwide tenants' rights movement, the Land League, had recently been formed, under the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell, a scion of the landlord class, whose pro-tenant sympathies were inherited from his American mother, a woman whose grandfather had been one of George Washington's bodyguards. Speaking on September 19, 1880, Parnell outlined the strategy of the league: 
"When a man takes a farm from which another has been evicted, you must shun him on the roadside when you meet him, you must shun him in the streets of the town, you must shun him at the shop-counter, you must shun him at the fair and at the market-place and even in the house of worship, by leaving him severely alone, by putting him into a sort of moral Coventry, by isolating him from the rest of his kind, as if he were a leper of old, you must show him your detestation." 
Three days later, court officials attempted to serve Boycott's eviction notices on the tenants, and the Land League policy went into effect. Within two months, Boycott's name had become a synonym for ostracism, he had left the estate, and both landlords and government had discovered the power of ordinary people. Within a year, legislation at Westminster provided government finance for tenants wishing to purchase their farms. 
For too long, Israel has been taking land from which Palestinians have been evicted, and detestation is spreading around the world. In Ireland, photos of Israeli bulldozers are placed beside those of landlords' battering rams. Even a former U.S. president has recognized hafrada ("separation" in Hebrew) as apartheid. Disgust has reached such a level that even highly conservative institutions that normally try to avoid politics are driven to express concern. 
One such body is Aosdana, the Irish state-sponsored academy of artists. Its annual general assembly on March 28 passed a resolution whose full text is: "Mindful of the August 4, 2006 call from Palestinian filmmakers, artists and cultural workers to end all cooperation with state-sponsored Israeli cultural events and institutions, Aosdana wishes to encourage Irish artists and cultural institutions to reflect deeply before engaging in any such cooperation, always bearing in mind the undeniable courage of those Israeli artists, writers and intellectuals who oppose their own government's illegal policies towards the Palestinians." 
Although on the surface, this is a mild resolution, it is a boycott call in all but name. Its significance was not lost on Dr. Zion Evrony, the Israeli ambassador in Dublin. The very same day, he issued a press release that was replete with cliches that might have worked several decades ago, when Irish people were still unaware of the horrors that Israel has inflicted on the Palestinians. 
Possibly, the alacrity of Dr. Evrony's response was due to the fact that the strength of feeling among Irish artists had been rehearsed in the Irish press. Indeed, the proposer of the motion, playwright Margaretta D'Arcy, who is Jewish, had written in The Irish Times on February 16 that, "I was reluctant to advocate a cultural boycott of Israel until I visited the country for the first time last November ... I became convinced that a cultural boycott was necessary, if only as an act of solidarity with those in Israel who seek to remove the inequality, discrimination and segregation of their society." 
Continuing, she quoted from "Land Grab," by Yehezkel Lein, published by B'Tselem - the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories: "The settlement enterprise in the occupied territories has created a system of legally sanctioned separation based on discrimination that has, perhaps, no parallel anywhere in the world since the apartheid regime in South Africa." 
Ms. D'arcy finished by saying: "My uncle went to live in the Holy Land in the 1920s to help set up the utopian dream of peace, justice and equality between Jew and Arab. It was only when I arrived there that I realized how mistaken he was. He would have done better to have stayed in the East End of London to struggle for peace, justice and equality in England." 
Parnell finished his call to action by saying that "there will be no man so full of avarice, so lost to shame, as to dare the public opinion of all right-thinking men." 
They were both right.

<title>Academic boycotts are not enough </title>
<date>Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
The academic boycott of apartheid South Africa is often cited as a model for the current boycott of Israeli academic institutions. The reality is that they could not be more different except in one aspect: Such boycotts alone are ineffective.
In South Africa, the academic boycott employed a series of international embargoes on institutions and scholars during the apartheid era. But it was backed up by economic, social and sporting sanctions aimed at isolating what had become a pariah state.  
As early as 1964, 496 British professors from some 34 universities signed a declaration protesting South African policies of exclusion and separation. Proponents of the boycott believed that scholars should not be immune from the political and social ills of apartheid.  
South African universities - government institutions reliant on state funding - were obliged to follow the law of the land and impose segregation policies along racial lines. Universities and other institutions of higher learning thus became institutions mostly for white South Africans. And as white nationalism grew during the period, numerous Afrikaans-speaking universities sprang up and gained popularity. Such institutions were intended exclusively for white Afrikaners. Students of other races and language groups were excluded or discouraged from enrolling.  
At the time, anti-apartheid cleric Desmond Tutu encouraged the sanctions, but said there should be no blanket boycott on institutions, but rather a case-by-case embargo. Tutu nevertheless felt the boycott served to remind so-called liberal universities that they were not doing enough to champion the end of segregation in institutions of higher learning.  
By 1980, the momentum of the anti-apartheid movement had grown to such an extent that the United Nations called for "academic and cultural institutions to cut links with South Africa." But there was opposition to the boycott. Opponents from within the anti-apartheid movement felt that the lack of interaction and free flow of ideas were stifling the development of the very people the boycott aimed to help.  
In reality the academic boycott was more of a symbolic gesture then a concrete strategy for ending apartheid. On the contrary, it encouraged the growth of ideas and the development of homegrown technology. Academia thrives on exchanging and debating ideas. Being cut off encouraged South African institutions to resort to more rigorous internal exchanges as well as inter- university exchanges.  
Furthermore, in some cases academics were able to maneuver around blockades. Often a third party would be used to exchange ideas and research. Many scholars simply ignored the boycott, especially in the field of science. Others imposed their own restrictions on themselves, not bothering to apply or submit work to international bodies.  
A survey conducted in 1991 by the University of Illinois found that the academic boycott of South African universities was more of "an irritation then a true obstacle to academic development." The survey concluded that aside from its significance as a symbolic gesture, the academic boycott had very little true impact in isolating South African institutions of higher education.  
It is even less likely that an academic boycott of Israel will succeed. Unlike in South Africa, where the international community, eventually including the United States, endorsed boycotting the racial policies of the apartheid state, there is less cohesion with respect to Israel.  
Universities in the U.S. have not backed their British counterparts, and Israel has not suffered widespread condemnation, in contrast to the case of South Africa. The international Jewish lobby - considerably more effective than the pro-apartheid lobby ever was - has been quick to overturn any attempt at punitive sanctions. Israel's strong historic and economic links with the United States make it practically untouchable.  
An academic boycott of Israel in isolation is never going to achieve its goal. Even the hope of a symbolic gesture of defiance is unlikely to do more than draw unwelcome comparisons with academic boycotts in Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Any academic boycott will be ineffective if it is applied in isolation: It needs to be backed up with economic and social sanctions.

<title>A dramatic shift </title>
<date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, announced last week that it is considering proposing a new state constitution calling for a supranational regime in all of "historic Palestine." Although its statement makes no direct reference to the issue of borders, the proposal essentially undermines the principle of the two-state solution and promotes the idea of one binational state for Jews and Palestinians. Adalah's proposal signifies a change in the organization's position, and may mark an emerging trend among Israeli Arabs.  
Last year, Adalah published its draft of a "Democratic Constitution," one of several papers issued by Israeli Arab organizations that have come to be known as the Vision Documents. Taken collectively, these statements openly challenged the Jewish character of the State of Israel while accepting the framework of the two-state solution. The Vision Documents' stated goal was to spark public discourse concerning the future of Israeli Arabs. The Jewish population in Israel, however, has remained largely indifferent to the documents, while the reaction of Jewish politicians and commentators was negative at best.  
The fact that no concrete dialogue has ensued between the two camps, however, only partially explains the dramatic shift in Adalah's position. What really alarmed the organization was the recent renewal of political talks between Israel and the Palestinians, especially as subjects for discussion have included issues relating to Israel's Arab citizens, such as the idea of swapping populated lands, and the claim by senior Israeli officials that a future Palestinian state would solve Israeli Arabs' national demands. Moreover, the Israeli demand of the Palestine Liberation Organization that it recognize Israel's Jewish identity has been fiercely rejected by most of the Israeli Arab leadership and, as surveys show, public too. All these developments have contributed to a collective sense of unease among Israeli Arabs, and a concern that their destiny is being negotiated without their participation.  
Whereas the Vision Documents were largely intended to engage Israel's Jewish public, the new Adalah proposal is directed primarily at two different  audiences. First, considering that in the past year, Israeli Arab organizations have become more active in expressing their views regarding the "outstanding issues" between Israel and the Palestinians (such as Jerusalem and refugees), the latest statement may be intended to constrain the PLO's ability to maneuver in the political process. In fact, Adalah's proposal contradicts the PLO's official position, which calls for negotiations with Israel on the basis of the two-state solution.  
Adalah may be signaling to Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, therefore, not only that Israeli Arabs may not necessarily accept an agreement signed by Israel and the PLO, but also that a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders will not fulfill their demands for self-determination, and that the political fight will continue.  
Adalah's second message is geared toward the international community, which has become more critical in recent years of Israel's policies vis-a-vis its Arab citizens; it is that only a one-state solution, based on "one man, one vote," is moral, just and achievable. Furthermore, because leading international figures consider Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad to be the Palestinian "dream team" for negotiations, if they fail, it is  implied, this may raise doubts regarding the very viability of the two-state solution.  
In recent years, Israeli Arab organizations have frequently compared Israel's policies toward its Arab minority and the Palestinians to the South-African apartheid regime. Adalah's promotion of a one-state solution takes this comparison a step further: The organization publicly aligns its constitution with the African National Congress' 1956 Freedom Charter, which demanded the transformation of South Africa into a state for all its citizens, and was incorporated into the South African constitution in 1996.  
Therefore, Adalah's statement may confront Israel with a political conundrum: If it reaches an agreement with the PLO, the deal's legitimacy would be questioned by Israeli Arabs challenging the PLO's status. However, if negotiations fail, the until-now accepted framework of a political process based on a two-state solution will be challenged, bringing the one-state alternative to the fore.  
Israel needs to formulate guiding principles regarding its relations with Israeli Arabs and the future Palestinian state. First and foremost, Israel should consider the spectrum of diplomatic, legal and political relations it wishes to allow between these parties. Israeli positions in the current round of negotiations would set the degree of these associations, on matters such as dual passports, the right to vote and to be elected to the Palestinian parliament and the issue of family reunification.  
On the domestic level, Israeli Arabs' demands of the state have both legal- nationalist and socioeconomic dimensions. The legal-nationalist aspect, as it appears in the Vision Documents, threatens the Jewish character of Israel and therefore is too high a price to meet. Nonetheless, this does not relieve Israel of the need to seek a dialogue with the Israeli Arab leadership in order to find a formula enabling the integration of the Israeli Arab and Jewish communities. Finally, Israel should strive to bridge the socioeconomic gaps between the communities, in order to meet the socioeconomic demands of Israeli Arabs and quell at least some of the causes of unrest among them.

<title>A halt, not  a suspension </title>
<date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
When Ehud Olmert warns that the world could impose a "South African solution" on Israel if two states are not created, side by side, he is tacitly admitting that expansion of the settlements is making Israel look increasingly like an apartheid regime.  
The agreement to withdraw, or to make "painful concessions," as it is sanctimoniously called, is therefore less painful than any other alternative. The only question is whether another Yitzhak Rabin can be found, who is capable of really halting, not just suspending, the construction of settlements, to leave the Palestinians some territory in which to establish Palestine.  
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit declared that the Arab states will respond favorably if Israel suspends construction in the settlements. This shows the extent to which the continued building damages Israel's relations with its near and distant neighbors. Israelis have become used to accepting lies about "natural growth" in the settlements. They never question why settlers could not build high-rise apartments, but must spread widely across the land. And, of course, settlers' children could never move to Netanya or Mitzpeh Ramon, so for every rise in the population they need to grab more territory.  
This brings to mind Ariel Sharon's statement to Bush at the 2003 Aqaba summit: "What do you expect me to do - to ask the settlers' wives to have abortions?" As though there were no housing options for those children but in the West Bank.  
As long as the settlement blocs that Israel intends to annex have not been anchored in an agreement, as long as the route of the separation fence has not become an agreed border, as long as there is a will for genuine negotiations, as opposed to unilateral withdrawal, Ehud Olmert's government must act like Rabin's government in the Oslo period.  
The state must compensate private contractors who bought land for new neighborhoods, as it did in 1992-1995, to enable revoking contracts even on active building sites. "Settlement blocs" is an empty term until their size is determined by agreement with the Palestinians. Every expansion, every new neighborhood, every outpost left standing generates more access roads, more public infrastructure, more kindergartens. It adds up to robbing more and more land from what little is left on which to build a Palestinian state. It is settlements that prevent Israel from defining a border with the Palestinians, and this is the central issue it deliberately evades. The same goes for Jerusalem, as more and more construction continues to march eastward.  
Some 10,000 babies are born in the settlements every year. Israel has no moral or other obligation to make sure they have housing in the West Bank. In April 2004 the government promised the Americans that there would be no more construction "beyond the outside line" of each settlement. That outside line has never been set. Annapolis will not lead Israel to any solution with the Palestinians unless Israel stops cheating and learns to restrain its expansion eastward.

<title>A lesson for  the doomsayers </title>
<date>Thu Mar 29 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
The historic meeting this week between Ian Paisley and Gerry Adams in Belfast, was a slap in the face to all the doomsayers, professional skeptics, perpetual pessimists and people who believe that what was is what will always be. 
Here was the 80-year-old minister, as if from a distant era - the preacher who became a national leader - sitting comfortably with his sworn enemy, the Irish Republican Army leader, whom he once called "Satan," "the embodiment of evil" and "mass murderer." The pair sat in one of the halls of Stormont Castle, a symbol of absolute Protestant rule - a rule which Paisley vowed never to surrender. The man who preached in the streets and churches for 50 years, "if you compromise, God will curse you," "surrender is worse than death," "traitors and bridges are all the same - they both go to the other side," announced power-sharing with those who seek to eradicate Northern Ireland as a political entity and annex it to the Republic of Ireland.  
It's no wonder that surprised onlookers compared that meeting to others that shook the world: Nixon and Mao in 1972, Mandela and de Klerk in 1990 and Rabin and Arafat in 1993.  
Like those meetings, this meeting too holds great promise; fulfilling that promise though will require great effort. Like those other meetings, it also hides paradoxes: The event symbolizing a historic peace deal could only occur because, since the beginning of the peace process a decade ago, both the Catholic and Protestant communities have radicalized their political views and opted for less compromising parties.  
Paisley, who excelled at expressing Protestant fears of loss of their standing and anger at their representatives' weakness, found himself at the head of the largest party; this automatically made him the lone candidate for prime minister. Adams, whose party defeated more moderate Catholic parties, agreed to all of Paisley's conditions: primarily, full support of Northern Ireland's law enforcement. If Adams hadn't agreed to all that, he would have been accused of torpedoing the establishment of the power-sharing government and undermining the accomplishments of the truce, which had been good for the Catholics.  
Citizens of Northern Ireland watched the historic meeting from their mono-ethnic enclaves. The segregation lines - known as peace lines - have in Belfast increased since the peace process began and segregation has expanded so greatly, it is now known as "voluntary apartheid."  
The contradictions between the micro-ethnic positions, which cause introversion, and the macro-national openness can possibly be attributed to the complete change in British-Irish relations and the prosperity of the common market. The importance of the border between Northern Ireland and its south has decreased, while in contrast the importance of the internal, community segregation lines, has sharpened.  
The need to be differentiated from the "other" - once reliant on loyalty to the British crown, as opposed to loyalty to the Irish republic - is expressed differently today, as long as there is rational justification for the primeval need for the sense of "otherness."  
The two communities' power-sharing accords are based on the agreement that any change in Northern Ireland's sovereignty will be democratic, so as long as there is a Protestant majority, there will be no change. This raises the Northern Ireland version of "demographic danger," in all its severity. It is true, the percentage of Protestants is dropping and a Catholic majority is visible in the not-too-distant future. But everyone hopes that when it happens, there will no longer be any significance to distinction between the northern and southern parts of the island.  
And what about the famous comparison between Northern Ireland and Israel/Palestine? Once people were furious by the very comparison. Today we say: In our dreams, and the doomsayers, this writer included, should learn a lesson.

<title>A look outside the local pond </title>
<date>Wed Jun 06 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Many Israelis returning from even a short trip overseas share this feeling: The joy of homecoming is accompanied by a sense that home is not a normal place, in the bad sense of the expression.  
The encounter with foreign countries, at least those that are not part of the Third World, is like a blow to the consciousness: In many states, people go about their daily life without Qassam or Katyusha rockets or terror attacks. There are places in the world where civilians are not exposed to news about the security situation from morning to night. There are nations that do not live with the constant moral unease deriving from the occupation of another nation. There are societies that are not surrounded by incessant violence. Public life in most developed states is not suffused with feverish preoccupation with fateful questions about their national survival.  
Israel's insane lifestyle really hits those returning home. This is not just because, as tourists, they only superficially experience daily life abroad; it is because leaving Israel frees them from the local pond for a moment. When a society stews in its own juices, it cannot observe itself with a foreigner's eyes. On the contrary, it develops self-pity and self-righteousness and projects its own version of events onto reality.  
Thus Israel sees itself as a victim of Arab violence, and all its violent acts are intended solely to defend itself, so that it can realize its right to self-determination. These include the checkpoints and the abuse of innocent, helpless Palestinians by brutal soldiers and policemen. They include preventive arrests in the territories, as well as blockades and closures that destroy the lives of women, old people and children. They include the assassinations and the separation fence, which arbitrarily expropriates the private property of poor farmers, as well as the Air Force bombardments, the demolition of houses and the uprooting of orchards. The feeling of constant threat with which Israelis live dulls their sight and their ability to distinguish between good and evil.  
The growing view of Israel among a considerable part of the international community was recently reflected in an Amnesty International report and the British initiative for an academic boycott of Israel. Granted, local actors were behind both developments; international politics were also involved; and perhaps both show traces of anti-Israeliness per se, or even anti-Semitism. But curling up like a snail in a shell of self-righteousness is not the way to deal with them. Like the boycott initiative, the Amnesty report is another alarm bell. Israel's international standing is disintegrating; its moral image has been eroded; its military actions are indefensible.  
The basic picture is simple. The world sees Israel as an occupier, and its increasingly sullied image in the conflict with the Palestinians is a result of this. But the Israeli sees himself a victim of Arab aggression. He is fighting for his life, and his enemies keep plotting to take it away. The world is against him and is trying to stop him from defending himself.  
In his sallies abroad, the Israeli tastes the intoxicating flavor of an environment that exists without a bloody conflict and learns how he is seen by others. The Israel portrayed by the decisions of the British University and College Union is, as the UCU put it, an "apartheid state, engaging in crimes against humanity in the occupied territories." The Israel reflected in the Amnesty report for 2006, which focused on the Second Lebanon War, is a state that carried out "indiscriminate, disproportionate attacks on a large scale" and left about a million cluster bombs, as well as new minefields, behind in Lebanon.  
The foreign and education ministers can raise a hue and cry about substantive inaccuracies, one-sidedness and cynicism on the part of both Amnesty and the UCU. But their main duty is to exert their influence as senior cabinet members to bring about a change in Israel's basic situation.

<title>Battle for Britain </title>
<date>Sun May 27 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Britain has become in recent years the battlefield in Israel's fight for its existence as a Jewish state.  
The number of British organizations calling for the boycott of Israel, their public campaigns, and their constant comparisons between Israel and the apartheid regime of South Africa have made the battle for British public opinion particularly significant.  
On Wednesday, representatives of the new British University and College Union (UCU) will be meeting in Bournemouth. On the agenda is another proposal to boycott Israel's academic institutions. These proposals have become as regular and as predictable as Qassam attacks on Sderot. The fact that studies at the Sapir Academic College in Sderot are not taking place because of the constant rocket fire from Gaza, even though the college is not in occupied territory and Gaza is no longer occupied, apparently does not bother British academia. The fact that Hamas, which controls the Palestinian Authority, does not recognize even pre-1967 Israel, and commits acts of terror against civilians, does not matter either. These nuances did not stop one boycott initiator from saying last week that justice in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is entirely on one side.  
In the face of boycott proposals by Britain's National Union of Journalists, by a group of British doctors and a group of architects, and in the wake of the Anglican Church's decision to divest from companies cooperating with Israel, even the Israeli left - which opposes the occupation and has been working against it for years - has no choice but to fight back. Taking off the gloves in this debate involves knowingly foregoing the kudos that British academia lavishes on all who are willing to express anti-Israel stands. The UCU has even had the termerity to proclaim that Israeli lecturers who disown the policies of the Israeli government will not be boycotted. It is British academics who should lose sleep over this McCarthyistic demand. Academic freedom means first of all an open exchange of opinions, without coercion, and not shutting people's mouths. Moreover, the British boycott is directed at Israel's academic institutions that in any case are a bastion of opposition to the occupation.  
On the 40th anniversary of the Six-Day War, British academia should look realistically at peace efforts in the Middle East: Over the past decade, Israel has elected governments that have expressed the desire of a majority of Israelis for a bilateral solution of two states for two peoples and a withdrawal from most of the settlements. The withdrawal from Gaza was to have been the first stage. The victory of Hamas, which refuses to recognize Israel, cut off the process.  
The anti-Zionist winds blowing in Europe, mainly in academia and in Britain, strengthen the position that the very birth of the Jewish state was a mistake. The European hard left regards the Law of Return as the root of all evil; however, without acknowledging the Jewish character of the State of Israel, there is not even a basis for dialogue. British academia is in fact demanding that Israel democratically cease to exist as a Zionist entity, and that it be swallowed up in the non-democratic region in order to pander to the latest trend.

<title>Boycotting the boycotters </title>
<date>Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
The Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign's (IPSC) recent success in persuading Ireland's official arts association, Aosd'na, to pass a resolution urging Irish artists to "reflect deeply" before engaging in any cooperation with state-sponsored Israeli cultural events and institutions is, without doubt, a regrettable development. Aosd'na is Ireland's most prestigious cultural body and its decision to issue what the IPSC chairman described in Haaretz (April 13) as "a boycott call in all but name" will carry weight in the Irish arts world.  
In fact, this is not the first time that the IPSC has successfully targeted Israeli culture. Last summer it launched campaigns against Israeli government sponsorship for a series of Dublin-based events, which it argued would "align the Irish cultural sector with the oppression and racism" of an "ethnocratic rogue state." While official funding remained in place for events featuring poet Amir Or and A.B. Yehoshua, despite vociferous IPSC protests, sponsorship for both a screening of Eytan Fox's "Walk on Water" and a performance by the Toy Vivo Duo was canceled by the organizers.  
However, the media coverage of these IPSC successes risks investing them with a significance they scarcely deserve. For in reality, the great majority of its boycott campaigns have resoundingly failed. For instance, its ongoing efforts to persuade Irish companies such as CRH to divest from Israel and its "National Boycott Days" of Israeli produce have failed to make any impression; Irish-Israeli trade has increased exponentially in recent years and is now worth about $700 million a year. The IPSC's attempt to orchestrate boycotts of the Ireland-Israel World Cup qualifying games in 2005 proved another toe-curling shambles: 3,000 Irish fans traveled to Ramat Gan to watch Ireland's away game, while 34,000 attended the rematch in Dublin. And last September's well-publicized academic boycott campaign quickly crashed and burned after being denounced by both the Irish government and the European Commission.  
The IPSC's general lack of success may appear unusual in a country where the great majority energetically sympathizes with the Palestinians, perceiving them as a dispossessed nation, denied their right to self-determination by Zionism's neocolonial adventure. Consequently, there has been overwhelming public support for Dublin's staunchly pro-Palestinian positions on issues from the legitimacy of Yasser Arafat to the illegality of the security fence, while its trenchant attacks on Israel's use of "reckless and disproportionate force" in Lebanon last summer were also widely applauded. Yet the IPSC remains a marginal force where one might almost expect to find a mass movement.  
Why? Because the Irish mainstream is deterred by the IPSC's extremist approach to the issues. Its recent dismissal of Meretz-Yahad as a "phony" peace party "eager to preserve a mildly adjusted version of the status quo" has raised questions about the shape of the settlement the IPSC itself advocates, while its perceived ambivalence on Palestinian terrorism is another problematical factor. Suicide bombings have been condemned, but other attacks have been categorized as "lawful resistance" or "forceful defense," while the characterization as terrorists of the killers of 13 Israeli reservists in Jenin in April 2002 was described as "robbing the word 'terrorist' of all meaning" (unsurprising, perhaps, given that the IPSC's Belfast branch was until recently chaired by a convicted IRA bomber).  
The Irish mainstream has been further alienated by the stridency of the IPSC's anti-Israel rhetoric, which often verges on demonization. While the still-commonplace equation of Zionism and Nazism is now being discouraged, the drawing of analogies between Israel and apartheid-era South Africa is present IPSC policy and its chairman is currently promoting the Hebrew term hafrada (separation) as an Israel-specific alternative to the original Afrikaans term. Meanwhile, the IPSC's most prominent national spokesman implicitly compared "people who genuinely support Israel" with "people who genuinely support pedophilia" in a recent online debate on the Aosd?na issue.  
The IPSC's tendency, despite its frequent denunciations of anti-Semitism, to inadvertently stray close to the line has been an additional cause of disquiet. For instance, while it deplored the post-Qana pinning of children's shoes to an Irish synagogue gate, it previously accused Israel of "implementing barbaric racist policies in the name of Judaism," and its official charity Christmas cards have, by juxtaposing images of Israel's security detail with traditional nativity iconography, evoked religious anti-Semitic themes.  
An IPSC Web site's campaign to expose the "Zionist propaganda machine" by effectively highlighting the Jewishness of writers and journalists also caused controversy; Gil Troy, writing in The Forward, described it as "the internet version of the Nazi yellow star." And just last month, prominent IPSC members themselves began quarrelling over the extent of anti-Semitism in the organization with one internationally renowned activist arguing that they could "no longer claim naivete" on the issue, given that their current Israeli Blood Diamond campaign "uses a Jewish stereotype [i.e. 'diamond-dealing Jews'] to promote its agenda."  
While Irish anti-Israel agitation remains in the hands of such extremists, the Aosdna resolution will prove the exception rather than the rule.  
Sean Gannon is a freelance writer and researcher on Irish-Israeli issues and is chairman of the Irish Friends of Israel. He is currently writing a book on relations between the two countries.

<title>Democracy is more than going to the polls </title>
<date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
"The protest wave has calmed down," some Israeli journalists said Friday of the Burmese military junta's success in driving thousands of demonstrators off the streets, using excessive violence.  
Despite the natural sympathy for the uprisers, several editors chose the word "calm," which embodies the rulers' point of view: The norm is "calm," even if it means constant government violence. The mass protest against the oppression is a disruption of order and calm.  
The word "calm" was an automatic reflection of how most Israeli Jews and their media see the constant, 40-year Israeli oppression of the Palestinians. This is the norm one thinks of when the Palestinians disrupt the calm.  
The oppression of the Palestinian people is intended to perpetuate its banishment from its land and the infringement on its rights there. But on the other side of the regime of oppression is democracy for Jews, even those who oppose the occupation.  
Generally, Jewish dissidents are not risking their life, livelihood, freedom or rights. However, the demonstration against the separation fence does involve certain risks - a few hours in detention, soldiers' fire, tear gas, or a blow from a gun. Therefore, each protester makes his or her own courageous decision to take part in the demonstration. Assisting the Palestinian olive harvest also requires courage, because it could end in an attack by the settlers (while the government's representatives, the soldiers, stand idly by). And yet there are dozens of anti-oppression activities that do not endanger the hundreds of devoted activists (mostly women) who take part in them.  
Potentially, hundreds of thousands of Jewish Israelis could have taken part in activities against the multi-faceted Israeli oppression - the apartheid laws and orders, military attacks, hidden information, economic siege, land expropriation, expanding settlements, and more. Not a hair on their head would be touched. These are people who say they support peace, with a Palestinian state beside Israel. But apparently their interpretation of participation in democracy is going to the polls once every few years, and faint protest in their living room.  
However, democracy also is displaying civic responsibility, by constantly supervising the political decisions and acts between elections, thus ensuring that democracy's essence has not been eroded. Those who say they support a two-state solution are ignoring the other facet of the democracy-for-Jews - the military regime that it imposes on the Palestinians. This regime creates faits accomplis all the time, foiling the last chance for a solution (i.e. full withdrawal with slight changes to the June 4, 1967 lines and establishing a Palestinian state).  
The Jewish citizens who enjoy their democracy are not personally harmed by its other facet. On the contrary, they gain from it - cheap land and quality housing, additional water sources, a cadre of security professionals in demand worldwide, and thriving defense industries. This is the "calm" that even self-defined peace supporters refrain from disrupting.  
In the Soviet empire and racist South Africa - like in today's Burma (Myanmar) - objecting to oppression involved a high personal price. Therefore, one could understand the objectors who chose not to act. In Israel, because it is a democracy for Jews, all those who sit idle, ignoring what is being done in their name, bear a heavy responsibility.  
Chiefs of staff, prime ministers, ministers and generals are not the only ones responsible. Anyone who theoretically objects to oppression, discrimination and expulsion, but does not actively take part in the struggle and in creating a constant popular resistance to topple the apartheid regime we have created here, is responsible.

<title>Did someone say racism? </title>
<date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
BERN - Swiss voters went to the polls last month to elect a new National Council, the country's parliament. The election's results elicited a great deal of hand-wringing among the international media. The focus of the spotlight was the Swiss People's Party, which received 29 percent of the vote, taking 62 seats in the 200-seat National Council, an increase of seven. In a parliament that has delegates from 13 different parties, such a performance constitutes a near-landslide.  
Many people, both inside and outside of Switzerland, view the People's Party as racist, even anti-Semitic. The party has indeed called for dropping a code in Swiss criminal law that prohibits racist speech. Party leaders claim that the law could be interpreted by courts in a very broad manner and therefore risks severely impairing free speech. At the same time, the party is intent on retaining a clause that prohibits public denial of the Holocaust.  
During the recent campaign, the party took a lot of heat for a poster with a cartoon depicting a white sheep kicking a black sheep off Swiss territory. Party officials insisted that no racial connotation was intended, explaining that it simply reflected a plank in their platform that calls for alien residents who commit crimes to be deported after they finish serving their sentences. The campaign appeared to tap into the Swiss people's anxiety about violent crime, in which aliens, who made up more than 20 percent of the country's population in 2005 (the highest proportion in Europe), frequently figure. Federal police statistics published by the party suggest that that same year, foreigners accounted for more than 50 percent of violent acts and murders, and 85 percent of rapes.  
The poster, insisted party leaders, was just about criminals - that is, society's black sheep. This explanation, however, did not convince the UN's Special Rapporteur on racism, Doudou Diene, of Senegal, who called on the party to drop the poster. The New York Times went further, publishing a caricature of a man attempting to transform the white cross of the Swiss flag into a swastika. Singled out for special censure was Christoph Blocher, the leader of the People's Party and Swiss minister of justice in the most recent seven-member Federal Council, the country's cabinet. Blocher has been likened to Mussolini by fellow politicians, and to Hitler by Al Jazeera.  
What did the international media fail to consider when they likened a key player in Swiss politics to the worst dictators in modern history? The People's Party has had great success with its use of the so-called public initiative, a tool of direct democracy whereby any interest group obtaining the signature of 100,000 voters can force a national referendum on a proposed law, as long as it does not violate the state constitution. The sheep campaign was part of the party's efforts to pass a law that would allow the deportation of convicted criminals.  
The party works within the system, and within the law, and despite its alleged xenophobia, it has been rewarded with good results across the Swiss Confederation, in which four different languages are spoken. Do its initiatives seem populistic? They won't become law unless a majority supports them in a national poll. Such are the workings of direct democracy.  
And Switzerland remains a democracy. Even if the People's Party, with the help of the country's peasants, won 62 seats in the National Council, this still leaves the Swiss political system very balanced, with two centrist parties of 31 seats each (the Free Democrats and the Christian Democrats), as well as two parties on the political left (the Green Party and the Social Democrats), with 20 and 43 seats, respectively. So, when The Independent, in Britain, asks: "Is Switzerland Europe's heart of darkness?" - the answer is surely no.  
Switzerland is not the first democracy that has been tarred with the brush of racism and labeled a sponsor of apartheid by the international media. Israel is used to it. And while we are on this subject, considering the comparisons to Hitler and the Third Reich, should Israel be worried about its own relations with Switzerland and its biggest legislative faction, the People's Party?  
Certainly, the party is tough on terrorism. Ulrich Schluer, a member of parliament from the party, has proposed the addition of a new protocol to the Geneva Conventions, of which Switzerland is the depositary state, with the goal of holding states legally responsible for the actions of terrorists operating from their territory. He also wants to prosecute those who distribute footage of executions of hostages to the media with the goal of terrorizing the civilian population.  
And which party came to Israel's defense during last year's conflict with Hezbollah, while the Swiss foreign ministry was condemning only Israel's actions? Yes, the People's Party, whose leader, Justice Minister Blocher, is said to have been the one who convinced the cabinet at the time to push the ministry's statements back on a more neutral track.  
That ministry is headed by Micheline Calmy-Rey, a Social Democrat, one of the People's Party's most vocal opponents. The two parties strongly disagree over the definition of the country's historic neutrality. The People's Party wants no explicit Swiss interference in other states' affairs that do not directly affect the small Alpine country, while Calmy-Rey has put a variety of international affairs on her agenda. It was she who invited Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Switzerland. The Social Democrats lost nine seats in October's vote, and now have only 43 seats in the National Council. Interestingly, one member who lost her seat was the president of the Switzerland-Israel Association, Vreni Mueller-Hemmi. The leader of Swiss Jewry's umbrella organization, Alfred Donath, hinted at the possibility that her party's voters were punishing her for her commitment to Israel.  
A member of parliament who did get reelected was Daniel Vischer, the president of the Switzerland-Palestine Association and a member of the Green Party. Vischer recently announced his intention to host a Switzerland visit by senior Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh. He is certainly walking a thin line between neutrality and appeasement.  
It pays to take a closer look at political parties before believing all the hype.  People (and the media) have a habit of  accusing each other of anti-Semitism and racism while only few seem to have the ability to deal with Israel on normal terms.

<title>Disrupting the separation policy </title>
<date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
A woman chatting idly in Ramallah on Sunday said dismissively: "The High Court of Justice's decision to move the separation fence in Bil'in proves nothing about the effectiveness of the popular Palestinian-Israeli struggle. Israel needs it to portray itself as a democracy."  
Her frustration is understandable. The lives of tens of thousands of Palestinians are disrupted by a fence whose route elsewhere is no less "disproportionate" than it was in Bil'in. After two and a half years of weekly demonstrations by Palestinians, left-wing Israelis and foreign activists - demonstrations that were brutally dispersed, with numerous protesters being injured or arrested - the fence was moved a mere 1.7 kilometers. And the same High Court that moved the fence also legitimized the Jewish neighborhood that had already been built on Bil'in's private land.  
The gap between the huge effort and the meager results is characteristic of the activities of all Israeli groups that work against the occupation. Last Friday morning, the eve of Yom Kippur, Machsom Watch activists had to spend hours making frantic telephone calls and using their connections with high-ranking officials to enable three sick people to traverse the Qalandiyah checkpoint and reach Jerusalem for urgent treatment. Media reports had promised that despite the hermetic closure, humanitarian cases would be allowed through the checkpoints, but by noon, most of those cases had given up and returned home.  
In other cases, Machsom Watch's female volunteers try to alert commanders when soldiers are harassing people passing through the checkpoints. Months of correspondence and requests, reports in Haaretz and monitoring by B'Tselem resulted in two commanders being removed from the Taysir checkpoint. This did not stop a soldier from harassing people at that checkpoint a few months later, nor did it prevent similar abusive conduct at other checkpoints. Needless to say, the checkpoint and roadblock policy continues, despite the reek of apartheid it emits.  
But those frustrated by the limited impact of Israeli anti-occupation activity are ignoring two of its salient characteristics. First, by helping to return one dunam of land to one individual, enabling farmers to complete an olive harvest without harassment and attacks by settlers, shortening the waiting time at a checkpoint or releasing a patient or a minor from detention without trial, life is made a bit less difficult for particular individuals at a given moment. This results from the activity of people who, by exploiting their immunity as Jewish Israelis, challenge the occupation bureaucracy.  
Moreover, this immediate personal relief is interwoven into a more fundamental, longer-term Israeli-Palestinian struggle against the occupation. Since the 1990s, Israel has endeavored to separate the two peoples. It has restricted opportunities to meet and get to know one another outside the master-serf framework, VIP meetings or luxurious overseas peace showcases from which the term "occupation" is completely absent.   
Because of this separation, the Palestinians know only settlers and soldiers - in other words, only those whose conduct and roles in the system justify the Palestinians' conclusion that it is impossible to reach a just agreement and peace with Israel. This separation also reinforces Israelis' racist - or at best, patronizing - attitudes toward the Palestinians.  
The anarchists, Machsom Watch, Yesh Din, Rabbis for Human Rights, the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions, Physicians for Human Rights and other activist groups - few as their members may be - disrupt the separation policy and its ills. They remind the Palestinians that there are other Israelis, so perhaps there is still hope. And in their immediate environment, they expose Israelis to facts and experiences that make it difficult for them to keep wallowing in their voluntary ignorance and disregarding the dangers that our oppressive regime poses over the Palestinians.

<title>Don't miss  this opportunity </title>
<date>Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
After seven bad years - years of terror, a diplomatic freeze, Hamas' victory in the Palestinian parliamentary elections and its takeover of Gaza - empty words about a "diplomatic horizon" and barren meetings between representatives of the parties are giving way to genuine diplomatic processes and practical plans for solving the conflict.  
At the end of the first meeting between an Israeli prime minister and a Palestinian leader ever held in the West Bank, Ehud Olmert announced that he and Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas were determined to quickly craft a "framework" that would pave the way for establishing a Palestinian state. As Haaretz reported yesterday, Olmert, basing himself on a proposal by President Shimon Peres, welcomed the key principle of the Arab peace initiative, which guarantees that negotiations over the borders of the Palestinian state will be based on the June 4, 1967, lines.  
The Peres document proposes that Israel and the Palestinians draft a document of principles, with an upfront guarantee that Israel will provide the Palestinian state with territory equal to 100 percent of the West Bank and Gaza Stirp. A prior agreement on this central issue, along with a binding timetable, would enable negotiations to be held on the details of the agreement. Such a discussion would focus, among other issues, on what compensation the Palestinians would receive for the designated settlement blocs, which must not interfere with the West Bank's territorial contiguity. The Peres outline also proposes practical and balanced solutions for the issues of Jerusalem and the refugees' return to places other than Israel's sovereign territory.  
Neither Israel nor the Zionist movement has any more important or more urgent interest than ending the occupation of the territories. There is a stable majority among the public and in the government and Knesset that prefers a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders, along with territorial exchanges, to the other solutions: a binational state, or an apartheid regime.  
Moreover, time is not on the side of pragmatic forces in the Middle East. Israel's failed war in Lebanon, and the failure of American policy in Iraq, have raised the status of Shi'ite fanatics like Hassan Nasrallah, who receive support from Iran. The combination of hasty "democratization" and an atmosphere of violence is attracting extremist terrorist elements such as Al-Qaida to the region, and strengthening rejectionist organizations in the territories. Without a substantive change in the situation in the territories, Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip is liable to turn out to be the first step in a takeover of the entire territories by Islamic fanatics.  
These enemies have created a rare common incentive for Israel, the Arab League, and the Quartet - headed by the United States - to strengthen the circle of Middle East moderates, which is aware of the importance of a peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, before Tehran completes its nuclear program. If this opportunity is missed, it is liable to be one miss too many.

<title>Heading to December</title>
<date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Haim Ramon has been going around for some time with a proposal for power sharing in Jerusalem, and the sky has not fallen. Ostensibly this is quite an amazing phenomenon; there was a time when the vice premier's idea was heard only among the radical left, somewhere between Yesh Gvul and Gush Shalom. This seems to be a turning point of historic proportions.  
The great debate over the future of the territories occupied in the Six-Day War always has been based on agreement that Jerusalem should not be divided. "The city that is compact together" has served the religious-national myth considered to be one of the foundation stones of Zionist existence. Ehud Barak broke the sacred taboo when he secretly agreed to power sharing in Jerusalem, but at the last minute lost his nerve and did not dare give the Palestinians sovereignty over the Temple Mount. A vice premier calling openly for the division of the city - this has never happened.  
And it was as if he had not spoken. No one quit the cabinet, the coalition did not even crack, no one went out to demonstrate, nary a bumper sticker was printed. That phenomenon requires an explanation.  
Israeli rule in East Jerusalem is visible mainly in a wave of construction for Jews, not in the granting of equal rights to the Arab inhabitants, not in providing equal services to the two parts of the city. Former mayor Ehud Olmert initiated the physical division of the city using a giant concrete wall that leaves some 50,000 Arabs on the other side.  
Ramon is quite the cynic. But in the saga of Israelis' attitude on Jerusalem, he deserves at least a footnote: It is not important what political calculation he is making - speaking as vice premier he legitimizes the fact that recognition of the fiction called "the unification of Jerusalem" is not worth it and should disappear into the history books, just like apartheid in South Africa, the bloody conflict in Ireland and the Berlin Wall.  
The indifference that greeted Ramon's proposal may stem from the fact that in the 30 years he has been in politics, he has not attained the reputation of a statesman leaving his stamp on Jewish history. He will not be the one to determine Jerusalem's future. Of course, Ramon could be doing for Olmert what Olmert did for Ariel Sharon when he spoke about the withdrawal from Gaza as if it were his idea. Either way, how nice it would be if it were possible to know for certain that the Israeli public had learned to relate to East Jerusalem as it related to the settlements in the Gaza Strip.  
Unfortunately, the vice premier's proposal most likely passed without a scandal because most Israelis do not believe the Olmert government can make history. Summer passed, then the holidays, and Ramon spoke. So what. There may be nothing that illustrates more the public's disengagement from the government than the apathy with which his proposal was greeted.  
This is also the case regarding the apathy surrounding the talks with Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas. Ahead of the 60th anniversary of the United Nations Partition Plan they are theoretically working on the end of the conflict; this is a great thing. But the president of the Palestinians appears to be only a courteous collaborator. Everyone knows that the agreement must be made with Hamas in Gaza. The current move seems like a false display by three lame ducks: George W. Bush, Abbas and Olmert.  
Olmert needs the November summit because after November comes December. According to a report not officially confirmed, the Winograd Committee has overcome all legal obstacles and is getting ready to publish its report in December. Real life will begin again, and we will recall what a wonderful summer we had.

<title>Holding on tight  to the frequencies </title>
<date>Thu May 31 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
The air is one escape route from the roadblocks and the separation regime that Israel imposes on the Palestinians. But Israel catches up with them even in the air. Israel does not allocate cellular frequencies to the Palestinians that answer their modern technological, economic, social and personal needs. More precisely, Israel refuses to coordinate with the Palestinians so they can use the cellcom frequencies they should have according to the International Telecommunications Union.  
The Communications Ministry claims there is no coordination because we are not speaking to the Hamas government. A convenient excuse, but flawed, because even before the Hamas government arose, Palestinian requests to coordinate additional frequencies went unanswered. The Palestinian cellphone company Jawwal received the frequencies it should have had only in 1999, two years after it was founded. In March this year, Jawwal got a competitor: Al-Wataniya. The Kuwaiti company Wataniya International won the Palestinian Authority tender at the end of 2006. Ownership is to be shared between the international company, the Palestinian Investment Fund (PIF) and the public. A professional British management team was appointed, 500 jobs were promised, but no frequencies were allocated.  
The importance of the air is reflected in the following data: Jawwal has about 800,000 subscribers, about 60 percent of the Palestinian cellphone market. Economists estimate that Israeli companies have about a 40-percent share of the market. The approximately 4 million Palestinians have more than 1.3 million cellphones. Some people have two - a Palestinian one and an Israeli one. The Palestinians come in third in the Arab world in the number of people connected to the fast data transmission system ADSL. They are also frequent users of video-conferencing services at their parliament - the Palestinian Legislative Council - at government ministries and at private businesses.  
That is how they overcome the severing of Gaza from the West Bank and the roadblocks between Jenin and Ramallah. Families who live a few dozen kilometers apart and who have not seen each other for five years or more have learned how to make do with phones, Skype, and e-mails. No wonder Paltel (the Palestinian telecoms company, of which Jawwal is a subsidiary) is the most profitable Palestinian firm.  
Dozens of requests for operating permits for Internet and information technology companies lie on the desk of the deputy Palestinian communications minister, Suleiman Zuhairi, who has been working at the ministry since its establishment in 1994. He cannot approve them because of the lack of frequencies.  
The geopolitical reality of the multiplied "borders" between the Palestinian enclaves, on the one hand, and area C (of full Israeli control) and the settlements - which comprise 60 percent of the West Bank - requires maximum coordination between Israel and the PA. As long as Israel does not agree to coordinate the distribution and use of frequencies, it will be impossible to install proper equipment in C areas. That is the reason that even the development of landline infrastructure is limited. No private company will risk installing equipment in C areas lest the Civil Administration's supervisors and the Israel Defense Forces bulldozers pounce on it and destroy it.  
Although the Israeli Communications Ministry denies any connection with this matter, the non-allocation of frequencies to Palestinians serves the Israeli companies that compete with Jawwal on terms favorable to them. (They do not pay taxes to the PA, although the cellular phones are being used in the Palestinian territories.)  
The non-allocation of frequencies is another front in the economic war Israel is waging against the Palestinians. It means a direct loss of income, of jobs, and the blocking of the desire to develop economic niches, which by making use of the air, could overcome the earthen roadblocks and apartheid roads.

<title>Implement which law? </title>
<date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Amid cabinet members' expressions of shock in response to a female settler seen abusing a Hebron family came this comment by Ephraim Sneh: "The laws of the state are not being implemented in the city with due haste, particularly regarding Israeli citizens." The deputy defense minister's words were meant as criticism of how the security forces impose law and order in Hebron, but they contained the idea that the problem lies not in the "laws of the state," but only in their "implementation."  
To which laws and which state was the deputy minister referring? After all, Hebron has not been annexed to Israel, and ostensibly is subject to military rule. But in the 40th year of the occupation, a deputy minister can disregard such legal nuances and refer to Hebron as if it were annexed territory - just like any Israeli community, Israeli vehicle or Jew in the territories can be referred to as Israel's.  
The education minister's directive to restore the Green Line to textbook maps stirred much response, showing that many of those who support the move believe there is an essential difference between the two sides of the Green Line: With the exception of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, Israel did not impose its laws on the territories on the other side.  
Nothing could be more mistaken. The difference is solely in how the annexation is accomplished. Unlike the declared, comprehensive annexations of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, where the principle was set first and applied later, here the opposite method has been taken: annexation in a piecemeal, selective fashion until, after a few decades, the sum of the parts amount to full annexation despite the facade of "non-imposition of the law."  
This fiction is convenient for all concerned. The left can keep on deluding itself that the Green Line marks open possibilities, and that rule in the territories is "military" and therefore temporary. The right can emphatically insist upon a "declarative implementation" of the law and meanwhile enjoy selective annexation, which applies only to Jews - wherein lies its cleverness.  
The annexation for Jews alone has created a dual system under which rule of law is determined based on an individual's or a community's national identity. The "local" population is subject to only the original law, as amended in thousands of military injunctions. The right to choose is reserved for Jews. When it's convenient, they are Israeli citizens in every way. When it's less convenient, like when it comes to matters of higher education and especially infrastructure planning, they are subject to the local law. The latter lags behind the Israeli law, and therefore allows for manipulations.  
The confrontation between the female settler and the Palestinian woman from Hebron was a clash between two parallel worlds: The Jewish woman possesses all the rights of a citizen of a free country, who is entitled to the protection of its security forces. On the other side is a woman from an occupied people, who is also entitled to protection. However, the army of the occupation forgot long ago that under international law, its role is to protect the "protected population." The army has become the settlers' militia and views the local people as hostile elements.  
It's easy to condemn the vulgarity of the settler from Hebron, and it's easy to dismiss the Jewish enclave there as a gang of violent thugs. But they are only weeds that sprout from the rotten ground of the cruel regime that prevails beyond the Green Line. It's a regime based on ethnic discrimination and separation, double standards and an absence of the rule of law.  
Just which law does the deputy minister wish to see applied with "all due haste"? That of the settler woman or of the Palestinian woman? In a place where laws differ and discriminate based on national and personal identities, no law prevails. What do we expect of soldiers and police officers? Not to be influenced by orders that instruct them to act in a discriminatory and selective fashion?  
The outrage over the woman's crude tirade is just a distraction from the reality that prevails beyond the Green Line, where life is ostensibly normal. It won't be long before it's the liberals who are seeking to have the Green Line erased from the maps, once it has been permanently transformed from a symbol of the aspiration for peace to a line delineating the realms of apartheid.

<title>Is Bishara the 'Palestinian Herzl'? </title>
<date>Mon Apr 16 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
The recent affair concerning the criminal investigation of MK Azmi Bishara, the Israeli Arab Balad party chairman who has left the country, has spawned a multitude of journalistic reports and commentaries. Palestinian political commentator Hassan al-Batal went as far as to write that the lawmaker "could have become the Palestinian Herzl," referring to the founder of Zionism.  
The Arab media as a whole have applauded him. A journalist from the Saudi daily Asharq Al-Awsat interviewed a young woman from southern Lebanon, who predicted that Bishara would one day become president of the Palestinian state. He reminded her that Bishara was a member of the Israeli Knesset, and that he belonged to the Palestinian Christian minority. She was unfazed, insisting that he was the best choice precisely because of his intimate knowledge of "Zionist fascism."  
The Nazareth-based newspaper Hadith Al-Nas ran an article predicting that Bishara would not become another Mahmoud Darwish, the Arab-Israeli poet who left Israel in the 1970s. The article did not seek to slight Bishara; it just suggested that he would not leave the country as he himself said in one of his interviews.  
The comparison to Darwish was not incidental. Darwish was born in 1942 in the village of Al-Birwah near Acre, which was demolished during Israel's War of Independence. He grew up in a nearby village and worked for the communist newspaper Al-Ittihad until he left Israel in 1971. He became a prominent activist for the Palestine Liberation Organization and has been for many years one of the Arab world's most notable poets. His work achieved renown following the 1967 Six-Day War, owing in part to an editorial by the renowned Syrian poet Nizar Kabbani in a Lebanese literary magazine.  
Kabbani addressed the "poets of the occupied lands" with an apologetic tone. While he and his colleagues wrote of sunshine and love, he wrote, they had failed to heed the plight of the Arab poets who were under the yolk of the Israeli occupation. This was how the Arab media and literary world learned of Arab artists in Israel, such as Samih al-Kassem, Emil Habibi, Tawfiq Ziad and Salem Jubran - all of them communists like Darwish.  
Darwish was beyond a doubt the first to break through the siege surrounding the relatively small and isolated Arab minority in Israel. Others followed - and not only figures from the literary world. One of them is Sheikh Ra'ad Salah, who won international support for his recent struggle against the excavations near the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem, as well as for his efforts regarding the Al-Aqsa Mosque.  
MKs Ahmed Tibi and Mohammed Barakeh are well-known figures in the Arab world, due to their frequent appearances in Arab foreign media outlets. However, keen observers might have noticed that while they have been presented as lawmakers, Bishara is considered to be a thinker, an Arab nationalist.  
These details assume special importance in light of the possibility that the Arab-Israeli minority could in the future become a key factor in the regional dispute. The map is simple enough to decipher: If Israel and the Palestinian Authority fail to reach an agreement based on a two-state solution, the only alternative would be a single-state solution. There is no other prospect.  
This single state would not be a "secular democratic nation," as the PLO advocated in the past, nor would it be a state of all its citizens, which is the cause Bishara has set out to realize. The strong Jewish majority would not allow that. The only option remaining would be an apartheid state, whose first signs - and possibly more than just that - are already visible in the West Bank and in Gaza.  
In this case, the struggle in store for the Arabs of the occupied territories would be directed to achieving equal rights and equality within the State of Israel. This would include establishing full unity between them and the Arab Israeli minority - a unity that does not exist today. If that happens, then who knows what will occur: Azmi Bishara could very well go down in history as the "Palestinian Herzl."

<title>Just an optical illusion </title>
<date>Fri Apr 27 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Although there are no official statistics, more Israelis apparently waved their national flag this past Independence Day. Perhaps this was out of a longing for a more innocent period, when the corrupt at least felt ashamed of their deeds, or perhaps the reason was that Bank Hapoalim distributed free flags. However, there was another phenomenon, unparalleled in any other nation: The Stars and Stripes were flown alongside the national flag. This is essentially a declaration that Israelis cannot celebrate their own independence day without remembering that their country's existence is wholly dependent on American backing.  
This backing has several aspects. One of them is the military and economic aid that Israel receives annually from Uncle Sam. In this regard, there will soon be a change, in five months' time. October 1 will mark the last time Israel will receive economic aid (totaling $120 million) from the United States. This will be the closing chord of the economic aid Israel has received since the mid-1980s. After October 1, Israel will receive military aid only: $2.4 billion yearly.  
The process of gradually reducing the economic assistance began in 1996, with a festive speech by then prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to both houses of the U.S. Congress. In that address, he passionately declared that Israel had emerged from its childhood and was now mature enough to stand on its own two feet and achieve economic independence. Thus, he announced, Israel was waiving the economic aid that it had received until then from America. Members of Congress, who were moved by this gesture, gave Netanyahu a standing ovation, out of respect for someone willing to give up several hundred million dollars a year.  
However, the truth is that this was not a freely given concession; it was a response to American pressure.  
Today, 11 years after that festive "concession speech" and after Israel's celebration of its 59th year of independence, has Israel achieved the economic independence that Netanyahu promised? And is it politically independent?  
There are those who argue that Israel has already achieved economic independence: For the first time in Israeli history, there was a respectable surplus in our balance of payments, with exports exceeding imports by $0.9 billion and with a large surplus ($6.8 billion) in the current account. If we also factor in a rapid growth rate of five percent for the fourth consecutive year, a negligible inflation rate, the strengthening of the shekel vis-a-vis the dollar, a lower interest rate than in the U.S., and a decrease in unemployment, it is clear why many people believe that Israel has achieved economic independence.  
However, this is just an optical illusion. It is a sort of mirage, mere virtual reality - nothing more.  
If any American president were to give a small cough and say, in a half-whisper, "hmm, I am considering my steps concerning Israel," our country's excellent economic situation would immediately turn topsy-turvy. Israel's international credit line would instantly freeze, the dollar would soar, and so would our inflation rate. Our balance of payments surplus would become a deficit and foreign investment would flee Israel many times faster than it came. After all, the world knows that without American backing, tiny Israel would quickly revert to its natural proportions.  
Therefore, it really does not matter whether or not the economic aid ends in October. What is important is that Israel continue to enjoy the political support of the most powerful nation on earth. After all, were it not for America's veto in the United Nations Security Council, economic sanctions, a la South Africa during its apartheid regime, would have been imposed on Israel long ago. Without that veto, Israel would never have been able to continue fighting the Second Lebanon War when every other country in the world wanted it stopped as soon as it began.  
Anyone who needs further evidence of the sad fact that Israel is very far from independence - either economic or political - should know that Israel recently submitted another request for an increase in American military aid. Israel is now asking for a $50 million annual increment in the military grant, so that, in another 10 years' time, it would amount to $2.9 billion.  
In the current tense relationship between a Republican administration and a Democratic Congress, where there are sharp disagreements about every conceivable topic, there is only one subject on which President George Bush and Congress see eye-to-eye: unqualified support for Israel. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Israel will soon receive that additional $50 million annually.  
And when the money arrives, Israelis will have yet another reason to lift the American flag high next Independence Day. On Israeli Independence Day, that is.

Part of world literature
Regarding "The Holocaust is ours," by Israel Gutman, June 4Reading your article, I was surprised that you are using statements from Mr. Sandauer's books, especially since, after the war, he was not a particular friend of Ella Schulz (Bruno Schulz's niece and my mother).
There were quite a few people (not only Jews) who tried to help Bruno Schulz escape the Drohobycz ghetto. 
Unfortunately, however, it took him too long to make the right decision (he was provided with the documents). Would those documents have saved his life? No one can know.Contrary to Mr. Gutman's statement that "the book manuscript [Cinnamon Shops] lay in a drawer for several years" and was published only thanks to Zofia Nalkowska, the book was actually published by Roj in 1934, after his brother Izydor Schulz (my grandfather) paid for it.
Your statement that the Holocaust is yours is correct, but at the same time, as an executor to Bruno Schulz's estate, I maintain that Bruno Schulz is still mine. This fact is honored by most cultural organizations, and I am dealing with those breaking the law through my agents and lawyers.Your statement that Bruno Schulz is not a bestseller is also correct - his work is not Mrs. Rowling's "Harry Potter." But Bruno Schulz has been translated into 39 languages and is still of interest to educated people, who are researching his work and trying to find something newer and deeper in his art.
I would also like to point out that Bruno Schulz wrote in Polish because this was his mother tongue. He could also have written in German, which he knew perfectly. As to the argument to whom Bruno Schulz belongs, I say: Bruno Schulz is simply part of world literature. This is a statement that I, his grand-nephew, the only survivor of both my parents' families, strongly support.

Redirecting the British boycott momentum
I take issue with the manner in which British unions and academia are contriving a global boycott of Israel as they rightfully did of South Africa's apartheid regime in 1962. Before one can dare to compare, one must be more cognizant of the South African enactment of apartheid legislation from 1949 to 1970, which included: the prohibition of mixed marriages and mixed sexual acts; no black vote; segregated and minimal education; segregated water fountains and restrooms, public transport and hospitals; and employment discrimination. These British unions and their academia would do well to focus their boycotting energies on all the terrorist Islamic regimes that advocate the destruction of a friendly UN state: Israel and its people.
The Arabs have emphasized their rejection and hatred of Israel with wave after wave of terrorist attacks, even before 1967 and the so-called "Israeli occupation," which was intended to create a buffer zone between the surrounding powerful Arab armies and Israel.
British academia and unions should be asking: "What kind of society do we wish to support or boycott: one that uses its youth as canon fodder and weaponry to promulgate its political/religious ideology, or one that intellectually speaking is among the most advanced nations of the world, with more per capita Nobel Prizes than any other, and which uses this knowledge to advance society?"
Since the days of the Six-Day War, the West Bank and Gaza have enjoyed better conditions, including a higher standard of living, educational institutions and medical facilities, all provided by Israel. Is this a sign of apartheid? 
As the Islamist influences from anti-Zionist, anti-democratic nations wormed their way into the Palestinian populace to create a hotbed of insurgency, the lives of the Palestinians deteriorated exponentially as they fomented terror. What caused the academia and unions of Britain to become so flagrantly anti-Israel and pro-Islamist? Instead of provoking more hatred, they should go forth and teach these Islamic nihilists how to invest in their future. 
Teach them how to use the greenhouses Israel left them in Gaza instead of destroying them, to build computers instead of Qassams, to invest in biotech and not in bombs and to teach their children about science and not about hatred or how to wear explosive belts.

<title>Let the settlers stay where they are </title>
<date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
 It's taken me all these years to finally realize that the settlers were right.  
At last, it all fell into logical place - the hardships, stumbling blocks and failures of the peace process, the dismal consequences of the disengagement from Gaza, the commandment to settle all of the Land of Israel, the rabbinical prohibitions against giving back one grain of soil, the settlers' success in battling the peace process and their alienation from the government.  
The answer is simple. The settlers are right. They should stay right where they are. No matter what. Even if there is an eventual peace. Even if the land they live on is part of a Palestinian state.  
For decades, the leaders of the settlement movement have told us that they will not leave their homes for the sake of a decision of the sovereign government of the State of Israel. They vow to make any future substantial evacuation of settlers from the West Bank so gut-wrenchingly difficult as to be functionally impossible.  
It is time we took the settlers at their word. They are not out there holding out for monetary compensation. They are out there in the primacy of their faith that a Jewish presence on the land of the Hebrew Bible is a commandment and a sacrament. The settlement movement is firm in its view that no elected government of Israel has the right to uproot the Jewish residents of Judea, Samaria and the neighborhoods of Jerusalem captured in the 1967 Six Day War.  
It is true that the vast majority of settlers reject the idea of soldiers refusing military orders. But it is also true that over the Green Line, Israeli defiance of Israeli law is by no means limited to a radical settler fringe. From its inception, the governing operational principle of the settlement movement has been to take action that is either questionably legal or clearly illegal, and then to force, finesse or sleaze the way to retroactive ratification.  
The disingenuous mantra of the settler movement, "We're here because the government of Israel sent us here," is thus doubly dishonest. These people were not expelled to the West Bank, evacuated to the West Bank, banished to the West Bank, ordered to the West Bank.  
Every Jewish Israeli living beyond the Green Line is a settler by choice. Many of them went there in defiance of the government. Many went to make it impossible for the government to change the status of the land under a peace agreement with the Palestinians. Every single one of them went there knowing that there was a chance that they'd be uprooted one day under a government decision.  
They went there by choice. Not the government's choice. Their choice. Does anyone seriously think that if the government decided against their being there, they would just go ahead and move because the government sent them back?  
In fact, now that several generations of Israelis have been born on the West Bank, it could be said that Israel has no right at this point to order them back.  
Let us, then, take the settlers at their word. If settling the land captured in 1967 is of paramount importance to the Jewish people, settling the land should also take precedence over making sure that land belongs to the Jewish state.  
And while we're at it, let us take the Palestinians at theirs. If they are so concerned about the evils of apartheid, then they must accept the idea of Jews living in their midst.  
On the scale of racist evils, surely a government - like Saudi Arabia for example, or a potential Palestine - that forbids religious, ethnic or national groups from entering or living within its borders, has much to answer for.  
Under a future peace agreement, it is reasonable to expect that settlers from across the West Bank will be invited to resettle in Green Line settlement blocs to be annexed to Israel in a territorial exchange with the Palestinians.   
But who could blame settlers in outlying enclaves for refusing to budge, given the government's abysmal track record in resettling fewer than 10,000 uprooted families since the 2005 disengagement?  
Let them stay. Let them stay right where they are. Let them have the courage of their beliefs. It's a test. For the settlers and, especially, for the Palestinians.  
And if the Palestinians counter that Israel must allow an equal number of Palestinian refugees into Israel proper, say 200,000 of them, so be it.  
We made this mess in the West Bank. We'll have to be creative about how we set it right.

While MKs from all the parties crowded into the Knesset cafeteria to watch the television broadcasts from Annapolis, Strategic Affairs Minister Avigdor Lieberman pushed aside the sign that bans smoking in the sitting room at the end of the main auditorium. It was clear he did not care a bit about the controversy over the joint declaration's content. Nor did the decision to begin accelerated talks about a final-status agreement arouse much excitement in right-wing circles, inside and outside the coalition.  
On the other hand, the decisions at Annapolis tie the Labor Party to Ehud Olmert's government and shield the cabinet ministers from the final Winograd report. Even Meretz is deliberating about how to treat a rightist who sounds like Uri Avnery.  
How will we know who is right? Those who stay at Olmert's side because they believe/hope Annapolis will end up like innumerable previous conferences and agreements, or those who stick with the government because they assume/hope that this time things will be different? Have the decision makers learned their lessons from the failed attempts to achieve an agreement, or are they leading (mistakenly or deliberately) to an apartheid state, as the prime minister put it, in the worst case, or to another round of violence, in the equally bad case? Here are three tests that can help solve the riddle.  
The test of opening positions: Before beginning talks about a final-status agreement, the government must outline its opening positions on each of the core issues. If it adopts the approach that the Palestinians must make do with the security fence as a political border, agree to Israeli sovereignty on the Temple Mount and erase the right of return entirely, we can spare the Peace Administration's budget.  
The Palestinian leadership under President Mahmoud Abbas, which has emerged from Annapolis to negotiations over a final-status agreement, is far weaker than the delegation headed by Yasser Arafat at Camp David in July 2000. Seven years of "no partner," the destruction of the central government's infrastructure, the Hamas victory and the loss of Gaza have reduced the margins of any Fatah concessions, which are narrow in any case.  
Abu Mazen (Abbas) cannot permit himself to give up one centimeter more than Arafat - the June 1967 lines, with mutual and equal border adjustments. Concerning an agreement in Jerusalem and a solution to the refugee problem, there is no point in offering the Palestinians less than what the Clinton plan offered in December 2000.  
The fabric of life test: The Annapolis guideline returns the sides to the Rabin formula: conducting the negotiations as though there were no terror and fighting terror as though there were no negotiations. However, the experience of the Oslo process teaches that there is no value to a diplomatic channel unaccompanied by an improved situation for the population under Israeli occupation. The limitations on movement, the expropriation of land for the fence and settlers, assassinations and mass arrests erode public support for the leadership and shrink the little room it has for maneuver. Dismantling outposts, a total freeze on construction in the settlements, without playing games (such as "natural increase" and "expansions"), and a complete implementation of the Sasson report on illegal outposts have always tested Israeli governments' intentions.  
The test of the team leader: Many generals sit on the General Staff who have not relinquished the philosophy of "searing the awareness" espoused by defense officials Shaul Mofaz and Moshe Ya'alon. In the planning and intelligence divisions as well as the defense minister's diplomatic-security liaison office, they are saying and writing that if the Israel Defense Forces were to leave the West Bank, we will be forced to secure the homes in Kfar Sava against rockets.  
Were it up to them, the IDF would return to Gaza. They have no empathy for the Palestinian side and they do not believe that generous gestures or even a final-status agreement will turn the Palestinian Authority's security services into a suitable substitute for IDF forces in the territories. Although the prime minister says he is not impressed by the defense officials' horror scenarios, he is considering placing a former member of the defense establishment at the head of the Peace Administration, someone who for years was among those who got used to seeing the Arabs through gunsights.  
Lieberman is not a sucker. After Annapolis, as before, he is in no hurry to leave the government. As long as he calmly smokes his cigars, his friends in the West Bank settlement Nokdim can relax.

<title>Living the lives of others </title>
<date>Mon Jun 04 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Forty years ago today was the last day the citizens of Israel were a free people in their own land. It was the last day we lived here without living other people's lives. After that day, we started paying the price for living the lives of others.  
German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck recently explored that price in his acclaimed movie "The Lives of Others" on the modus operandi of the Stasi - communist East Germany's secret police.  
The threat that hovered over Israel on June 4, 1967, pertained to its actual survival. It erased from our consciousness the knowledge that our lives here used to be different. Four decades of creeping annexation and 20 years of violent confrontation contributed to this amnesia.  
And so, our victory on the battlefield - which was meant to make our lives better and safer - is making both our lives and the lives of others miserable. The year 1966 saw an important chapter in Israel's short existence. It was also an important point in the Jewish recovery from the feeling of siege. In early December, Levi Eshkol's cabinet canceled the military rule that was practiced in Israel, based on the British Mandate's regulations.  
In doing so, the government lifted the main hurdle that prevented Israel's Arab population from leading normal lives. Six months later, the government proceeded to make the Green Line indistinct, blurring the distinction between Israel proper and the recently conquered territories.  
Subsequently, many Jews began regarding the Arabs of towns such as Baka al-Garbiyeh on the Israeli side of the Green Line much the same as the Arabs of Baka al-Sharkiyeh, which used to be on the Jordanian side. Recently healed wounds were reopened, and an incipient sense of identity began to fragment.  
The need to exert authority over the large and alien population of the territories forced the government to recreate the military rule it had just abolished, and to employ it in the territories - tactics and methods included.  
Professor Yeshayahu Leibowitz did not need 40 years to realize that this would transform Israel to a secret-police state, and the Israel Defense Forces into an "occupation army." As early as spring 1968, he warned against the occupation's effects on education, freedom of speech and thought, and on the democratic nature of the government.  
Leibowitz predicted that the corruption that is characteristic of any colonialist regime would not spare Israel. He also warned against the collapse of social structures and the corruption of man - Arab and Jew alike.  
But even the Jerusalemite prophet of apocalypse did not predict the scale of corruption and the corruption of values that the settlement enterprise generated, and the extent of the apartheid regulations that would allow and encourage the theft of lands.  
No one could have foreseen the extent to which this enterprise damaged Israel's internal cohesion, nor could anyone have predicted the degree to which it compromised Israel's standing in the eyes of the free world.  
In June 1967, tiny Jerusalem accommodated 13 foreign embassies. Following the passing in 1980 of  the Basic Law on Jerusalem the Capital of Israel, the city was orphaned of all its embassies.  
It has been suggested that the Palestinian territories expanded the security margins that "tiny" Israel had. Few recall that in the mid-1960s, several months before the war broke out, the government saw fit to reduce mandatory military service for men by two months. Very few soldiers benefited from this because the security challenges of the occupation forced the government to increase service by 14 months - putting it at three years.  
But that's not all. During the Second Lebanon War, the citizens of Israel proper, within the Green Line, paid a steep price for the deterioration of the IDF's abilities. This was a result of its employment as a police force in the territories that Israel conquered in June 1967. This involved guarding the property of Jewish land robbers.  
As the years progressed, short-sighted Israeli politicians and Jewish religious leaders transformed "the fight for home" into "the fight for other people's home."  
It is true that there were times when the other side was unwilling to discuss anything, not even the borders of June 4, 1967. But nowadays, the 22 member states of the Arab league declare that they view this border as a basis for peace - an accomplishment no one would have dreamed of 40 years ago.  
And so, Israel is missing the opportunity to transform its military victory into its biggest achievement ever. It is losing the war of independence from controlling the lives of others.

<title>Netanyahu and Meshal forever </title>
<date>Sun Mar 11 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
A great surprise: The overwhelming majority of Israelis support a one-state solution. After years in which the binational solution was anathema, it has suddenly become apparent that this is the preferred solution. You don't believe it? Look at the opinion polls. Benjamin Netanyahu is again leading them. You don't believe Netanyahu advocates this solution? Listen to his words. Once again, Netanyahu "does not find" a Palestinian partner. The conclusion: Wait and do nothing.  
Netanyahu is not alone. Judging by their inaction, the prime minister and the foreign minister are also unable to find a partner; it is furthermore doubtful whether the Labor Party will find one. There are heaps and heaps of preconditions - one time it is the democratization of the Palestinians and another time it is their recognition of Israel; one time it is a halt to terror and another time it is a revision of their covenant; one time it is "no" to Arafat, then "no" to Mahmoud Abbas (the "fledgling") and now it is "no" to the unity government.   
And the result is plain to see. One state, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, is coalescing before our very eyes. Because what are Netanyahu and his ilk offering? To sit and do nothing, which simply translates into a binational state. Most Israelis declare that they are in favor of two states? This is a hollow statement - after all, they prefer Netanyahu.  
In fact, this is the real "big bang": The political map of Israel has been upended. There is no longer right and left, no more hawks and doves. The center, the right and the margins of the left are united. From now on, one should say: Israel is divided between supporters of one state, the overwhelming majority, and supporters of two states, a negligible minority.   
Whoever does not work immediately for the formation of two states is pushing for one state. There is no other solution, no third way. Anyone who supports the settlement enterprise is a devotee of the greater Land of Israel.   
"Tibi or Bibi?" It is more correct to say: "Netanyahu and Khaled Meshal forever." Both are proponents of a one-state solution and their dispute is only over the nature of this state - one favors an apartheid state and the other an Islamic state. Only the extreme left advocates a single democratic state.  
All of the talk about the questions concerning the future of Israel is misleading. While Netanyahu is running on his favorite ticket, the danger of a holocaust emanating from Iran, a more acute question mark hovers over the declared character of Israel: Has it not already become a binational state? It will soon be divided into two equal halves, and later there will be an Arab majority. What is Israel if not a binational state? And what are 3.5 million Palestinians, who have already lived under Israeli occupation for 40 years, if not subjects of a state that has existed with the occupation for twice as many years as it has existed without it?   
No, the occupation is not temporary, nor is the current nature of the state.  
Enough empty talk about "a Jewish state." There is no such thing. The fact that the Palestinians live under unequal conditions does not make them subjects of another entity. On the contrary, the state's control of their lives is immeasurably greater than its control over its Jewish citizens.  
"What good will it do - the time that is slipping like sand between the fingers, without taking any action," Netanyahu asked in an interview with Haaretz, published on Friday, in which he was described as someone who has "shifted to the center." But of course the "moderate" Netanyahu was referring to Iran, defiantly  ignoring the really crucial hourglass. In another moment, the Palestinians will be a majority here, and then what? A minority that continues to abuse a majority? Non-citizens forever? South Africa has already taught us how this culminates.  
This grown child must now be called by its name - Netanyahu, Yisrael Beiteinu, the National Religious Party, the settlers, Kadima and all those who reject negotiation should now be called "fans of the binational state." If it becomes a just state, perhaps this is good news. But is this really what the majority wants?

<title>Nothing to sell the Palestinians </title>
<date>Mon Jul 16 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Abu Mazen's struggle against the Hamas government is mainly political-legal in nature. He established an "emergency government" in the West Bank that has now become a "transition government." The name is not important. What counts is that from a legal point of view this government does not have to, and of course cannot, receive the approval of the parliament, whose work has been paralyzed. A large majority of the MPs are representatives of Hamas, and a large percentage of them (residents of the West Bank and East Jerusalem) are sitting in Israeli prisons - which is how Abu Mazen can attempt to transfer more powers to Palestine Liberation Organization institutions. These institutions are considered representative of all the members of the Palestinian nation, in all its diasporas, and therefore they are (at least formally) above the institutions of the PA, which represent only the residents of the West Bank and Gaza, and thus constitute about half the nation.  
In light of this, Abu Mazen wanted to convene the central council of the PLO this week in Ramallah, and to invite important VIPs such as Naif Hawatmeh, the founder and leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), who is considered a senior partner in the historical leadership of the Palestinian nationalist movement. By means of such political and legal maneuvers, Abu Mazen and his followers are trying to unite all the nationalist factions, that is, Fatah and the leftist movements, against Hamas.  
In spite of the fact that Abu Mazen's effort enjoys broad international and Arab support, the chances that it will succeed are slim. The reason is well known: Abu Mazen and Fatah have nothing to sell the Palestinian public. The vision of the independent state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital, gradually dissipated during the years of the Oslo process. What finally destroyed it were the continuing violence and terror, the number of settlers, which doubled (from about 100,000 in 1990 to about 200,000 in 2000), and the new Jewish neighborhoods in Jerusalem and its environs. Instead of reconciliation and coexistence, is the feeling, we got an intifada, murderous attacks, separation walls, settlement blocs and an apartheid state. The Palestinian public knows that it is impossible to turn back the clock. It was not corruption and an absence of leadership that brought down the Fatah movement, and neither are they not what is causing it to fail now - but rather the fact that the political path of Abu Mazen and his friends has reached a dead end, and cannot be resurrected.  
Where is all this leading? Any Israeli who has occasion these days to meet often with Arabs from the West Bank, or speak by phone with Gaza residents, can increasingly hear comments such as: We can't take it any more, we're sick and tired of it. And the continuation: If only the days of full Israeli occupation would return. Occasionally one could think that these words are being said out of a desire to find favor with the Israeli listener. But the truth is that they are being said out of despair. When the hope of establishing a state within the territories, with Jerusalem as its capital, is lost, one can undertake to fight Israel to the finish, as Hamas proposes, or give up and say, under these circumstances, let there be occupation. In other words, make the State of Israel take full responsibility for the territories.  
Sooner or later Hamas will fail in its war against Israel. But that does mean that there will then be a return to the days of Oslo and the two-state vision, which has withered and died since September 2000. Rather, there will be increasingly strong demands by Palestinian Arabs, who constitute almost half the inhabitants of this land, who will say: Under the present conditions we cannot establish a state of our own, and what remains for us is to demand civil rights in the country that is our homeland. They will adopt the slogans of the struggle of the Arabs who are Israeli citizens, who demand equality and the definition of Israel as a state of all its citizens. That won't happen tomorrow morning, but there doesn't seem to be any option to its happening eventually. If there aren't two states for the two nations, in the end there will be one state.

<title>Sharon's dream </title>
<date>Mon Jun 18 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>

If Ariel Sharon were able to hear the news from the Gaza Strip and West Bank, he would call his loyal aide, Dov Weissglas, and say with a big laugh: "We did it, Dubi." Sharon is in a coma, but his plan is alive and kicking. Everyone is now talking about the state of Hamastan. In his house, they called it a bantustan, after the South African protectorates designed to perpetuate apartheid.  
Just as in the Palestinian territories, blacks and colored people in South Africa were given limited autonomy in the country's least fertile areas. Those who remained outside these isolated enclaves, which were disconnected from each other, received the status of foreign workers, without civil rights. A few years ago, Italian Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema told Israeli friends that shortly before he was elected prime minister, Sharon told him that the bantustan plan was the most suitable solution to our conflict.  
The right and the settlers feared that the disengagement from the entire Gaza Strip was no more than a down payment on a withdrawal from most of the West Bank. The left and the international community similarly believed that if the evacuation of Israeli soldiers and civilians from Gaza went well, the way would be paved for a two-state solution; but there were also some who feared that Sharon did not intend merely to sever Gaza from Israel, thereby erasing 1.4 million Arabs from the demographic balance, but also to drive a wedge between Gaza and the West Bank.  
Exactly two years ago, in June 2005, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit warned Shimon Peres during a visit to Israel that if the disengagement were not accompanied by progress toward a solution in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip "would explode," in his words. The then vice premier told his guest that he agreed with every word, but took care to point out that his statements did not necessarily reflect the views of prime minister Sharon.  
Israel's violation of the Agreement on Movement and Access, which was signed by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, strengthened suspicions that Sharon was plotting to sever Gaza from the West Bank. The order that the dogs could bark, but the caravans would not move between the Palestinian Authority's two sections had already been quietly issued by the end of 2005. That was a few months before Hamas' victory in the PA parliamentary elections provided the winning excuse for sealing off Gaza. Following the political upset in the territories, the severance policy became official. Israel imposed a sweeping ban on Gaza residents entering the West Bank, which even applied to students with no record of security offenses. Even as it was protesting the Hamas government's refusal to commit itself to previous agreements, Israel was disavowing the interim agreement (Oslo II) that it signed in Washington in September 1995, under which the West Bank and Gaza constitute a "single territorial unit."  
Alongside the severance of Gaza from the West Bank, a policy now called "isolation," the Sharon-Peres government and the Olmert-Peres government that succeeded it carried out the bantustan program in the West Bank. The Jordan Valley was separated from the rest of the West Bank; the south was severed from the north; and all three areas were severed from East Jerusalem. The "two states for two peoples" plan gave way to a "five states for two peoples" plan: one contiguous state, surrounded by settlement blocs, for Israel, and four isolated enclaves for the Palestinians. This plan was implemented on the ground via the intrusive route of the separation fence, a network of roadblocks deep inside the West Bank, settlement expansion and arbitrary orders by military commanders. The cantonized map that these dictated left no chance for the road map or the "gestures" that Israel promised to PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas and the Americans.  
But the hope that Hamas' thugs and Fatah's good-for-nothings will finish the work of that well-known righteous man, Sharon, and his flunkies in the government and army is no more than a warped delusion. Eight years of rioting and terror ended in the liquidation of South Africa's bantustans and their inclusion in a unified state governed by the black majority. This dream of Palestinian protectorates - Hamastan in Gaza and the Fatahland enclaves in the West Bank - is similarly the end of any solution based on dividing the land: Israel in agreed-upon borders based on the Green Line and Palestine on the other side. If we do not quickly wake up from this dream and rescue what remains of the two-state vision, we will truly be left with a choice between the plague - an apartheid regime - and the cholera: the Jewish state's replacement with a binational state between the Jordan River and the sea. Including the Gaza Strip.

<title>The anti-Israel lobby </title>
<date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
This week saw the launching of the Independent Jewish Voices initiative by a group of prominent left-of-center Jews in the U.K. The initiative intends, according to its founding statement, to "promote the expression of alternative Jewish voices." Its sponsors believe that "individuals and groups within all communities should feel free to express their views on any issue of public concern without incurring accusations of disloyalty." The signatories wish to contend that voices critical of Israel are receiving insufficient attention in British discussions of the Middle East. The claim is a strange one.  
Do opponents of Israeli government policy in the U.K., Jewish or non-Jewish, truly feel that their arguments are not being heard? Is it really their contention that the British Jewish leadership is setting up "unwritten laws," which establish the boundaries of what may or may not be discussed? If the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the main U.K. Jewish communal body, is indeed attempting to create unwritten laws and to foster anxiety to silence opponents of Israeli policy, it is doing a remarkably poor job. The public debate on Israel in the U.K. affords willing space to the most extreme of anti-Israel positions.  
If we take, as an example, contributors to the Guardian, which published the IJV's founding statement, Jews who have successfully found the courage to resist the Board of Deputies and its anxiety-inducing unwritten laws include Daphna Baram, who wrote in a recent op-ed that Israel is an "apartheid state"; Jacqueline Rose, whose book, as her Guardian interviewer reminded us, "draws tentative analogies between Israel's treatment of Palestinians and Nazi Germany's treatment of Jews," and Ilan Pappe, the Israeli academic who recently wrote in support of a boycott of Israeli academia.  
These opinions fit comfortably into parts of the British debate, in which denial of the right of Israel to exist and allegations of conspiracy theory are accepted within the parameters of polite discussion. British-born Jew Tony Judt, for example, was able to promote his thesis advocating the dismantling of the Jewish state in the London Review of Books.  
If one expands the search for a moment to include non-Jewish opponents of Israel, it may be recalled that Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer found a home at the same title for their claim that the Jewish lobby controls U.S. foreign policy. The supposedly objective BBC Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, considers Israel exclusively to blame for Palestinian internecine violence, according to a recent leaked memo. This is not to mention those open supporters of Palestinian suicide bombings who are regular fixtures in the British Middle East debate - such as Dr. Azzam Tamimi.  
The U.K. has seen a number of public initiatives toward the delegitimization of the Jewish state in recent years. These have included the attempted lecturers' boycott in 2005, a subsequent attempt at a similar boycott by architects and the demonstrations during last summer's war in Lebanon, featuring support for a Shi'ite Islamist organization with the slogan "We are all Hezbollah now." A number of Jewish organizations openly hostile to Israeli government policy already exist - such as Jews for Justice for the Palestinians, and the Jewish Forum for Justice and Human Rights. Such is the climate of debate in the U.K. on Israel.  
In the midst of all this, the initiators of Independent Jewish Voices believe that "an oppressive and unhealthy atmosphere" has emerged, as a result of the Board of Deputies stifling anti-Israel opinions.  
The Board of Deputies represents mainstream Anglo-Jewish opinion regarding Israel. Britain's Jews, like Jewish communities throughout the world, are strongly pro-Israel. The large attendance at pro-Israel rallies held on two occasions in the last years is testament to this fact.  
It is generally held in mainstream Jewish opinion that the Jewish state is currently passing through a moment of some danger. An aggressive, Islamist regime in Tehran is spreading Holocaust denial and openly calling for the destruction of Israel. This regime is currently seeking a nuclear capacity. It is also sponsoring proxy organizations such as Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which are engaged in murderous violence against Israelis.  
A climate of opinion has emerged, in which a shocking increase in anti-Semitic violence in the U.K. in the last year receives less than the attention it deserves, because the perpetrators are mainly emerging from within Britain's Muslim communities.  
In such a situation, unsurprisingly, individuals such as the Independent Jewish Voices initiators, who ignore these realities or who are in some cases sympathetic to the perpetrators, may find themselves treated in mainstream Jewish circles with less than the exquisite courtesy, which is undoubtedly their due.  
But as we have seen, mainstream outlets in the U.K. welcoming the contributions of Jews (and non-Jews) hostile to Israel are proliferating. There are broad swathes of contemporary British opinion in which a breezy dismissal of all Israeli and Jewish concerns is very much the bon ton. There have, indeed, rarely been better days to be a Jewish opponent of Israel in Britain.

<title>The Carter trap </title>
<date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
WASHINGTON - "If you ever have any questions or advice for me, just put Jimmy Carter, Plains, Georgia on the envelope," the then-presidential candidate told audiences in the 1970s. "I open every letter myself, and read them all." That claim, of course, was completely false, as the cover story of The Atlantic Monthly, which dealt with lies told by presidents, pointed out this week.  
It is impossible to know whether Carter personally opened the letter he received last Thursday. The Carter Center sent a measured, noncommittal response to its contents, but the authors gained the attention they had sought. The press quoted from the letter and television networks discussed it. Its 14 signatories, members of the Carter Center's Board of Councilors, informed Carter that they had decided to resign - publicly and with great fanfare, albeit "with sadness" - due to publication of his book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid."  
This book has featured for weeks on the bestseller lists, and has also provoked a huge outcry. It is no small matter when a former American president accuses Israel of an "apartheid" policy in the territories, and also holds it largely responsible for the ongoing bloodshed. "Your book," wrote the resigning board members, "has confused opinion with fact, subjectivity with objectivity."  
At almost the same time, a group of Reform rabbis announced that they had decided to cancel a planned visit to the Carter Center in March. In their announcement, they urged Carter to resume working to promote "peace, not prejudice."  
Accusations have been leveled at Carter's book since the day it was published. Those well-versed in the details of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, such as the Clinton administration's peace envoy, Dennis Ross, have found in it a plethora of falsehoods, fabrications and half-truths. "Mr. Carter's presentation badly misrepresents the Middle East proposals advanced by President Bill Clinton in 2000," Ross wrote.  
The resigning board members' letter cites several other lies Carter is trying to disseminate. For instance, his assertion in the book that UN Security Council Resolution 242 states that "Israel must withdraw from territories" - to which the letter responded: "But you know the word 'must' in fact is not in the resolution." Kenneth W. Stein, who was the Carter Center's first executive director, and resigned from his position as a fellow several weeks ago because of the book, told Haaretz that it contains "intentional falsehoods" and accused Carter of "irresponsible remarks."  
These "irresponsible remarks," to use Stein's term, were the straws that broke the backs of many people who had admired Carter, even if they did not always agree with him. Two of the most prominent such remarks were Carter's claim, in the book, that "Palestinian groups" had promised to stop suicide bombings the moment Israel accepted the principles of "international law" and the "ultimate goals of the road map for peace;" and various statements that appear to allege a Jewish conspiracy aimed at silencing critics of Israel, such as a sentence that appeared in an article he wrote for the Los Angeles Times: "Book reviews in the mainstream media have been written mostly by representatives of Jewish organizations." The 14 resigning board members said in their letter that they view the former statement as "condoning violence against Israelis." The latter statement elicited a harsh letter from Abe Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, who told Carter that such statements are "dangerous stuff." Martin Peretz, editor-in-chief of the weekly The New Republic, wrote that the former president "will go down in history as a Jew hater."  
It seems that the well-publicized resignation by the Carter Center board members and the Reform rabbis' letter, both developments of the past few days, have tipped the scales against Carter and his book. After all, neither the resigners nor the boycotters can be suspected of being enemies of the peace process. They are lily-white, proven doves for whom Carter simply went too far. A clear line has been drawn here, with Carter's help: a consensus that defines the boundaries of what cannot be said about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even in the eyes of fierce critics of Israeli policy.  
Nevertheless, one problem remains: The critics, as Carter justly claims, are almost all Jews. That is the only card left in his hand, but it is a strong one, which embodies a trap from which there is no escape.  
On one hand, this problem, too, could be solved: All it needs is one well-known, well-respected, non-Jewish critic to come out publicly against Carter. If such a person does emerge, it will be possible to completely undermine the legitimacy of this miserable book. But on the other hand, what lies behind the assumption that such a critic is needed? Is this not a disturbing admission that even in America, when it comes to Israel, the word of Jews is still not, and may never be, completely sufficient?

<title>The consensus trap </title>
<date>Fri Jul 20 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
For the past 40 years, the term "consensus" has been the axis of Israeli politics. This key concept refers to national agreement on operative plans that are meant to shape the future of Israeli society. From the Six-Day War until today, however, these nationally agreed upon schemes have had one thing in common: They are nothing short of self-delusion.  
Indeed, no political program that has enjoyed the overwhelming support of the Israeli public has ever materialized. The first of these plans that won national consensus was the one in force from the Six-Day War until the mid-1980s. The three main principles were (a) there is no Palestinian people and there will never be a Palestinian state; (b) the West Bank will be divided between Israel and Jordan, and large parts of it will be annexed for defense purposes and territorial expansion; (c) the 1967 borders are Auschwitz borders and Yasser Arafat is Hitler II.  
The ruling elite did not yet understand that the world had changed: In order to get this new reality into its skull, Israel needed the military fiasco of the first war in Lebanon, which did not achieve a single one of its objectives, and the shock of the intifada at the end of the 1980s.  
In the wake of the Oslo Accords, a second consensus came into being, according to which temporary meant permanent: It was roundly agreed and accepted that there was no immediate solution to the conflict, and one could only be reached gradually, in a process stretching out over many years. The end of the process was invariably shrouded in mist, and who knew what would happen in the meantime. In this way, the need to rethink the settlement enterprise could be ignored, and the flow of money and people into the territories could continue unabated.  
Only in the days of Ehud Barak did the idea of two states for two peoples begin to take shape. However - and this was Barak's great failure - the idea was not backed up with an order to stop building the settlements. The Palestinians were also very much responsible for the collapse of this plan, imprisoned in their dream of return and hopes of wearing Israel down.  
Today, the two-state solution is the dream of most Israelis. The problem is that yet again times have changed: It is doubtful that this third consensus can be implemented in its original form anymore. It has become nothing but a smoke screen, symbolized in the flesh by the president of Israel, Shimon Peres. Peres is the ultimate Israeli politician, the one who is always at the heart of consensus, the one who is never guilty of anything, the one who understands everything - only 20 years too late.  
A Palestinian state, which will free Israel from the yoke of occupation, is a precondition for saving traditional Zionism. Those who want a country with a Jewish majority that is neither an apartheid regime nor a bi-national state where Jews will become a minority by mid-century, must realize that unless some dramatic change takes place right away, Israeli society's existential problems will never be resolved.  
The irony of history is now revealing itself: Settlement beyond the Green Line was supposed to strengthen Zionism, or as the settlers see it, save Zionism from losing its way. In practice, however, it has created a situation whose destructiveness is already visible, although the next generation is the one that will bear the brunt of it. If Israeli society resigns itself to the fact that it lacks the political power and emotional strength needed to uproot the settlements, the question it will have to ask itself is "what next?"  
If Israel does not intend to evict the Arab population in the West Bank, the only solution is to give the Palestinian Authority territories in the south in exchange for the settlements. You can't hold the stick by both ends, as they say. Considering the danger to the future of the state being caused by the settlements, this is not too steep a price.  
Moreover, if we are already dreaming dreams, as the new president would like us to, maybe he should set an example by trying to get the United States and Europe involved in a joint effort, padded by the promise of billions of euros, to persuade Egypt to become the Palestinians' savior. Maybe if the Egyptians conceded some territory between the Rafah Salient and El-Arish for the sake of a Palestinian state, it could have a dramatic effect. This plan has no consensus, but who knows? Maybe it could work.

<title>The greatest settler </title>
<date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Among the many obituary notices published by various groups after the death of Teddy Kollek, one group's notice was conspicuous in its absence: the Yesha Council of Jewish Settlements. It is a bit difficult to comprehend this ingratitude by the settlers toward the person who brought approximately 200,000 Jews to the occupied territories - perhaps more than any other person. The settlement enterprise owes a great historic debt to Kollek. Neither Rabbi Moshe Levinger nor Hanan Porat nor Aharon Domb nor Ze'ev "Zambish" Hever are responsible for settling so many Israelis beyond the Green Line as Kollek, the enlightened Viennese liberal.  
The fact that most of the eulogies for the former Jerusalem mayor left out this detail and that Yesha did not embrace the mega-settler Kollek is no coincidence. Israeli society has adopted sundry and strange codes to whitewash the settlement enterprise. The settlement of the occupied territories in Jerusalem has never been considered hitnahalut (the term used for Jewish settlement in the territories). And the gargantuan neighborhoods of the capital, which were built during Teddy's term and span extensive Palestinian territory, have never been considered a controversial issue.  
The fact that almost no one in the world recognizes this enterprise and the new borders it charts does not change a thing: In our eyes, but only in our eyes, not every settlement is the same and each settlement has its own moral code. But this is a game we play with ourselves. Every home built beyond the Green Line - in Yitzhar or Itamar in the West Bank, in Nov in the Golan, or in French Hill in Jerusalem - is built on occupied land and all construction on occupied land is in violation of international law. Occupation is occupation. Not everything is legal, even if it is anchored in Israeli law, as in the case of the Golan Heights and Jerusalem.  
The Israelis invent patents for themselves, but this sophisticated semantic laundering will not meet the legal and ethical test. The Ramot neighborhood is a settlement. There is no difference between the "neighborhood" of Pisgat Ze'ev and the "settlement" of Givat Ze'ev. This artificial distinction does not end with the Jerusalem region. In the West Bank, distinctions are also made between settlements and "illegal outposts," another virtuoso but groundless exercise in semantics with regard to an enterprise that is entirely illegal. There are also no settlements (hitnahaluyot) in the occupied Jordan Valley, but rather yishuvim, a generic word for settlements, unrelated to the 1967 borders. An ethical blemish has never been attached to the residents of these Jordan Valley settlements. Why? Because this is the way it was determined by Labor governments at the time, when they established moshavim and kibbutzim in the Jordan Valley - not "settlements."  
Does this make any difference from the perspective of international law? Certainly not. Were the moshavim in the Jordan Valley not built on the land of residents who were disinherited? Have they not crushed the surrounding residents?  
With regard to the Golan Heights, we went up another level in the word game we play with ourselves. There are no hitnahaluyot there at all. Why? Because we decided so. There are towns, kibbutzim and moshavim, just like in the Jezreel Valley. But no word game or Knesset legislation can alter the unequivocal fact that the Golan Heights is occupied Syrian land and all of its residents are settlers and that international law regards them as criminals.  
This phenomenon reached its peak in Jerusalem, which will celebrate 40 years of its "unification" this year. This act of unification was an act of occupation and the fact that a charming and charismatic figure like Kollek presided over it does not change a thing. Kollek demolished a neighborhood in the Old City and built the new neighborhoods on Palestinian land for Jews only - apartheid at its worst - and this should also be remembered in the balance of his considerable achievements.  
The Jerusalem mayor Kollek left behind is a divided and wounded city, despite and because of its enormous development, replete with explosives that will yet explode in our faces. In fact, it was never unified. Like any colonialist city, there is a dark backyard for the natives. To this day, most Israelis do not set foot in Palestinian neighborhoods and the Palestinians avoid Jewish neighborhoods. The city remains divided, despite all of the lofty words about its unification for eternity. Regarding equality, there is nothing to say of course. It is sufficient to travel to the Shuafat camp or even to Sheikh Jarrah to note the outrageous disparity between the services in the eastern and western parts of the city.   
Societal neglect, piles of garbage, no playgrounds or community centers, no sidewalk and no streetlights. Gaza in Jerusalem, all on the basis of abominable ethnic discrimination. This did not begin with Ehud Olmert nor with Uri Lupolianski. This began with the wily Kollek. A city whose rule in the Palestinian section is conducted through the strength of arms, with surprise checkpoints and hundreds of violent Border Policemen routinely patrolling the streets, and whose residents are subject to prohibitions that violate their fundamental liberties, is not a "unified" city. Teddy is responsible for this.  
The history of the occupation, which has already lasted more than twice the amount of time than the years the state existed without it, is full of "men of peace" from the "left" who are responsible for this injustice. What would the settlement enterprise be without Yigal Allon and Moshe Dayan, Golda Meir and Yisrael Galili and, of course, Shimon Peres? Kollek must now be added to them, belatedly. He brought the wide world to Jerusalem but only to its Jewish part. He loved his city very much, and built and developed it in an impressive way, but on the downtrodden back of half of its residents. Moshe Amirav wrote in his article on Thursday ("Division, where unification failed") that Kollek said to him in his waning years: "We failed to unify the city. Tell Ehud Barak that I support dividing it." Better late than never, but why did we not hear a word about this in the lofty eulogies?

<title>The High Court of Justice is in no hurry </title>
<date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Had Defense Minister Amir Peretz wanted to prove in his actions that he views racism as despicable and dangerous - as it was possible to understand from his remarks on Monday to his colleague, Minister of Strategic Affairs Avigdor Lieberman - he would have used his authority to cancel in a timely manner an instruction issued by GOC Central Command Yair Naveh that will go into effect on Friday. He has not, however, done so, and starting on January 19, 2007, Israelis and foreigners will be prohibited from taking Palestinians as passengers in their cars throughout the West Bank.  
Had Education Minister Yuli Tamir truly wanted to change patterns that have become fixed in the education system during the course of 40 years of occupation, she would have already used her exalted position to raise an uproar in the Knesset and the government against the GOC's instruction, which undermines the right of Palestinians and Israelis to develop relationships on a friendly, familial and ideological basis. She has had sufficient time for this: The instruction was signed on November 19, 2006.   
Had Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh, who is shocked, shocked, by the situation in Hebron, and has come to the conclusion that the law does not operate effectively there, been interested - he could have blocked the instruction that adds another building-block to the rule of the Jewish settlers in the West Bank: Naveh's instruction allows only Israeli employers (mainly settlers and people who live inside Israel proper) to drive their Palestinian workers. That is, it makes explicit a perception whereby the only possible natural relationship between a Palestinian and an Israeli and Jew is that of employee and employer.  
Had members of the Israeli media, who were appalled by the sight of the young Jewish settler woman cursing her Palestinian "neighbors" in Hebron, in master-like gestures, been interested in being effective as well - they would have organized in time to express their shock at Major General Naveh's instruction, which will make a criminal of every Israeli who gives a ride in the West Bank to a Palestinian friend or a family member who is not a first-degree relative. But the media as a whole, and the Journalists Association and jurists who specialize in media law, have left the fight to the human rights organizations and a few lone journalists. Had the media not forgotten the innumerable reports that it itself has published about the doings of the settlers in Hebron and the military government there - it would have concluded that the demographic separation that Naveh's new instruction imposes is the offspring of the same mode of thinking and action that has brought about ethnic cleansing in the old city of Hebron.  
Had the chorus of shock at a single filmed settler woman not been a matter of "ratings," but rather the expression of a moral stance accepted by society, the High Court of Justice would have issued an interim order to delay implementation of Naveh's instruction. But it has not issued any such interim order, even though eight human rights organizations, represented by attorney Michael Sfard, have given it the opportunity to do so. Nor did the High Court's Justice Edmond Levy feel any urgency about the matter, and he postponed the hearing on the petition until February 12.  
The Court has been in no hurry because Naveh's instruction is logical and very obvious, and the road to it has been carefully and gradually paved in recent years, in a series of orders, instructions and laws, as well as the policy of separate roads and the route of the separation barrier. Always with the approval of the High Court.  
The instruction concords with other prohibitions on movement that Israel has imposed on Palestinians of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in the very same territory where Jews have unimpeded movement, and residential, economic and trade rights.   
For years now, these prohibitions on movement have been preventing thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank from visiting family and friends in Gaza. They are responsible for thousands of sagas about people who are not permitted to live with their families in their own homes or to care for their parents on their deathbeds. They prevent students from pursuing the studies of their choice at decent institutions of learning. They keep sick people away from clinics, women about to give birth from maternity wards, children from schools and workers from their workplaces.   
These prohibitions have transformed about one-third of the area of the West Bank - the Jordan Valley - into a region that is empty of Palestinians, apart from about 50,000 whose official address, as it appears in their identity cards, is in the valley.   
The instruction under discussion complements and completes one that was issued in October 2000 - and which under the well-known excuse of security prohibited Israelis from entering Areas A in the West Bank.   
The new instruction is particularly efficient because it mainly endangers the Palestinians who may disobey it: For various legal reasons, it will be difficult to bring the Israelis to trial in a civilian court. The Palestinian "criminals," however, will be shunted in and out of military courts, be blacklisted and pursued by the Shin Bet security service, and find themselves facing prison terms of up to five years. This fact will deter Israelis from choosing to practice non-violent civil disobedience, as taught by Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr., by disobeying this flagrantly illegal command. The founders of apartheid in South Africa would have been proud.

<title>To fortify the Supreme Court </title>
<date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
"All persons are entitled to the protection of their life, body and dignity," states the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Freedom. But when the Supreme Court reviewed the government's decision to fortify the schools in Sderot and stated that the steps taken do not provide the necessary protection and that, according to the government's own decision, measures must be taken to provide protection, the justice minister viewed this as a process that will bring about a situation "in which the judicial branch embodies within itself also... the executive branch."  
According to Daniel Friedmann, the enemy of the Israeli society and the enemy of the children of Sderot is not the Qassam rockets or the government's impotence in protecting the children against them, but the Supreme Court. The same person who in the 1970s suggested passing conditional death sentences on terrorists - a proposal that would have outraged even Israel's supporters - finds it difficult to grasp the tremendous service that the Supreme Court is rendering the State of Israel, and those who act in its name, under conditions of a continuing confrontation with the Palestinians.  
There are some who believe that the only way the occupation will end is if those who make the decisions in Israel and those who implement them - the Israel Defense Forces commanders and soldiers, for example - will be reluctant to visit other countries for fear they will be subjected there to judicial procedures arising from their decisions and actions in their security posts. But anyone who is concerned about this possibility, which if realized will seriously hamper Israel's ability to act, must want Israel to have an independent Supreme Court that is not afraid to review government actions and Knesset legislation.  
Sharp criticism was leveled in this space at the Supreme Court decision to leave intact the amendment to the Citizenship Law enacted by the Knesset that prevents unification between Israeli and Palestinian families. But it must be clear to both the proponents and the opponents of the Supreme Court decision that the procedure of judicial review that Knesset legislation undergoes greatly facilitates Israel's case in rebuffing allegations that it is tainted with elements of an apartheid state.  
This is not the only reason, but it is an important one, why the government, and in particular the justice minister, need to bolster the status of the Supreme Court in the eyes of the public, the country and the world.  
The import of that status is autonomy and independence, leeway to act and an attitude of support and respect. Indeed, the government's Basic Guidelines state: "The ultimate standing of the Israeli legal system, headed by the Supreme Court, will be ensured. The Government will preserve the high standing, as well as the range of functions and authorities of the Supreme Court, and will object to any change which may harm its standing, or to the way judges are appointed in the legal system."  
It is difficult to understand what prompted the prime minister, who heads a government with these Basic Guidelines, to appoint Friedmann minister of justice.   
As a newspaper commentator, Friedmann did much to undermine the court's status in the eyes of the public, calling for its range of activity to be decreased and for a change in the way judges are chosen.  
The man who appointed Friedmann knew exactly what he would get. Was this a cynical or frivolous decision by Ehud Olmert, or perhaps made due to an extraneous interest, or did it reflect the prime minister's dissociation from his government's Basic Guidelines? We are not likely ever to know. What was disappointing at the time was the Labor Party's acceptance of the appointment.  
The decision this week by Labor's Knesset faction to veto the proposed Basic Law on the powers of the court, which Friedmann wants to enact, shows that the party has shed its apathy and understands what it is up against, and also that there is in the government a responsible element that grasps the state's interest in - and the importance of - the continued existence of the Supreme Court as it developed in Israeli democracy as an instrument to fortify and enhance that democracy - in our eyes and in the eyes of the world.

<title>Violating the norms of democracy </title>
<date>Tue Jul 31 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
People born in this country before the state was established, whether Jews or Arabs, had experienced the British colonial administration in Palestine, hardly a model of democracy. As a matter of fact, it was only the small community of "Anglo-Saxons," those that arrived in Israel from the English-speaking world, who had had experience living in a democracy and brought that tradition with them to Israel.  
So it's been "one man, one vote," whether Jew or Arab, since 1948 in Israel. Certainly not Apartheid, as is so frequently charged by Israel's enemies, and even some of its friends. After all, the fight against Apartheid in South Africa focused on that simple demand - one man, one vote - that was denied to the black population there.  
But equality in the polling booth is not the only element of democratic government. It may be the most important one, but it is not the only one. Equality of rights and obligations for all citizens is also required. And don't forget equality of opportunity. It is surprising how easy it seems to be to forget or neglect to apply these "equalities" to all of Israel's citizens.  
Let's start with universal military service - the obligation to defend our country. By all accepted standards of democratic government, that should most certainly be applied to all. As if we needed a reminder, the latest Israel Defense Forces statistics show that a very large number of ultra-Orthodox Jewish youth do not fulfill this obligation. This has been true ever since 1948, and the number seems to be growing exponentially. Now along come our Knesset members, and instead of rectifying this matter, they renew the infamous Tal Law, which legitimizes this injustice, for another five years.  
The ultra-Orthodox Jewish youth are not the only ones to benefit from this inequality. If you are an Israeli citizen of the Islamic or Christian persuasion, you also are not required to defend your country. That is unless you are a Circassian, who even though Muslim, is subject to compulsory military service. Poor Circassians!  
Last week the Knesset passed in preliminary reading a law that would require the Jewish National Fund (JNF) to allocate land that it owns only to Jews. Presumably this means that Jews who are not citizens of Israel would qualify, but Israel's Arab citizens would be barred from access to land owned by the JNF. A blatant violation of the norms of democracy.  
But wait a minute, you might say, was not the Jewish National Fund founded in 1901 so the Land of Israel could be redeemed and come under Jewish ownership? Yes, of course, but something else happened in the meantime. In May 1948, the State of Israel was established, guaranteeing equality to all its citizens. The ultimate purpose of the Zionist Congress that decided on the establishment of the JNF - the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine - has been achieved. In a democratic state one cannot condone laws that discriminate between citizens on ethnic grounds. That was certainly not part of Herzl's vision of the Jewish State.  
So what about the Law of Return? Does it not provide a special privilege - the right to immigrate to Israel - for Jews only? Yes, but that is the foundation stone of the State of Israel - to provide a haven for any Jew in the world in need of a haven; so that what happened in the years before the Holocaust and during the Holocaust would never happen again. That is the mission of the State of Israel. A most humane mission by any reckoning. In fulfillment of this mission the Holocaust survivors from Europe, the Jewish communities from the Arab world and Iran, Soviet Jewry and the Ethiopian Jews were absorbed in Israel. Maybe even some of Israel's non-Jewish citizens can identify with this mission, and those who cannot must recognize that this is the reason the State of Israel was established.  
The proposed JNF law has nothing to do with this mission. Hopefully, it will not go beyond the preliminary reading in the Knesset.

<title>Weapon of the weak </title>
<date>Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
In conflicts, boycotts are the weapons of the weak. Their chief importance lies in their ability to raise public awareness and arouse disapproval. Yet, going by the paranoid reaction to the academic boycott of Israel, it might as well have been a declaration of nuclear war. No peaceable action in recent times has provoked so much anger and hostility as this British-based boycott.  
In the wake of the British University and College Union's vote at its annual general meeting on May 30 to initiate a national debate on a boycott of Israeli academic institutions, a wave of hysteria engulfed Israel and its friends. Articles appeared, before and after the vote, denouncing the UCU resolution and its initiators, and heated correspondence is still ongoing. Threats were made against members of the boycott group by pro-Israel organizations and individuals, and campaigns were mounted to defeat the boycott. Costly one-page advertisements appeared in The Times and The Guardian, carrying the names of scores of eminent signatories opposing the boycott.  
Photographs of the boycott's "ringleaders," like those of wanted criminals, appeared on the front page of the major British Jewish weekly, The Jewish Chronicle, which also carried a distressed article by Britain's chief rabbi condemning the boycott as an anti-Semitic "witch hunt." The Daily Mail's Jewish columnist Melanie Phillips declared "the age of reason" over. The Jewish-American lawyer and fierce warrior for Israel Alan Dershowitz has teamed up with his British counterpart, Anthony Julius, to take legal action against British supporters of the boycott. While this would not be valid in British law, its aim is clearly to intimidate.  
The fuss has not abated yet, and more battles lie ahead this autumn as pressure is exerted upon the UCU to ballot its members individually, in the hope that they will reject the motion passed by the conference.  
Two major misconceptions lie at the base of this response, both deliberately fostered. The first misconception is that the boycott is aimed against individual Israeli academics, and the second, and more important, is that it is anti-Semitic.  
With regard to the first misconception, the boycott in fact calls for a ban on dealings with Israeli academic institutions, for example, for not participating in joint research, conferences or other collaborative activity. In a malicious misrepresentation of this position, opponents claim that the boycott will end the free exchange of ideas with individual Israelis and encourage discrimination against them within British academia. By suppressing "free speech," goes the argument, this would end any hope of change in Israel's policies that academics could have brought about. This is an erroneous argument, and it has galvanized opposition to the boycott in Britain .  
The charge of anti-Semitism follows closely on this. The allegation is that the real reason for the boycott is hatred of Jews, a new outbreak of an old gentile affliction. Nothing is more designed to provoke and mislead than this charge, which, its authors know, antagonizes all Jews and many non-Jews.  
In fact, of course, the imputation of anti-Semitism is a red herring, as so often is the case when Israel is criticized, and its aim, as always, is to deflect criticism. In the case of the British boycott committee, it is particularly inapt, since most of the members are Jewish. The campaign started in 2004 with a letter that two British scholars, Hilary and Steven Rose, published in The Guardian, calling for a boycott of Israeli academic and cultural institutions, in support of a similar call by Palestinian civil society organizations. These, representing a majority of Palestinian academics and other professionals, had united to form a campaign for boycotting Israel because of its repressive policies against them.  
The letter in The Guardian spearheaded a growing demand for Israel to be called to account for its policies, which was soon joined by many academics in Europe and beyond. Support was particularly strong in South Africa, which had lived through a similar boycott during the apartheid era, and was especially sympathetic to the boycott's rationale and aims. Since that time, the boycott and divestment campaign against Israel has grown, resulting in the Association of University Teachers' Union voting for a boycott against two Israeli universities at its meeting in 2005. Thanks to a vigorous pro-Israel campaign against it, the decision was overturned within a month. But the issue did not go away, and resulted in the vote for the boycott two years later by the newly formed UCU, which had absorbed the AUT.  
Academic boycotts are not new to Britain. In 1965, a boycott campaign against apartheid South Africa was initiated by 34 universities in response to a call for solidarity by the African National Congress. After a prolonged British campaign, the boycott was adopted as policy by the AUT in 1988 and remained in place until the end of apartheid.  
The academic boycott against Israel is no different. Israel's well-documented repression of Palestinian academic life and victimization of Palestinian teachers and students is a scandal to be denounced by all those who claim to care about academic freedom. Rather than rushing to Israel's defense in a situation so perverse and immoral, all efforts should be directed toward boycotting all Israeli institutions. Only when Israel is made a pariah state, as happened with South Africa, will its people understand tha they cannot trample on another people's rights without penalty.

<title>Where are Labor and Meretz? </title>
<date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
On the eve of the trip to the Annapolis summit, a penetrating debate was held at the Muqata on the question of whether Mahmoud Abbas should participate in the George W. Bush and Ehud Olmert show. At the last moment the Palestinians discovered that the Israeli prime minister had retracted his promise that the conference document would address at least one of the core issues specifically, and in a binding manner. The opponents said that they were tired of the Israelis' empty promises to dismantle roadblocks, evacuate outposts and be more generous about freeing prisoners. They warned that another fruitless peace gathering would be a disappointment that the Palestinian public would not be able to tolerate, and spoke about how Hamas would celebrate the farce in Annapolis. The argument that tipped the balance in the end was that without the conference in Maryland, there would be no donors conference in Paris. Economic distress overcame political distress.  
Olmert cited political constraints as his excuse for refusing to mention the June 4, 1967 borders in the Annapolis declaration, and for refusing to commit to a time frame for concluding the negotiations. He explained that Avigdor Lieberman had threatened to take his party Yisrael Beitenu out of the government and to bring about early elections.  
Ehud Barak could have said to Olmert something like: "With all due respect to Lieberman, I am your main coalition partner. If you are planning to miss this opportunity - we are out." Barak, as we know, did not open his mouth. In any case he does not believe in the power of Abbas and his colleagues in the Fatah leadership to achieve a final-status agreement.  
Nor did the dovish wing of the Labor leadership protest the participation of their chair in the Annapolis show. Yuli Tamir, who came to politics from Peace Now, was busy with the teachers' strike and Ami Ayalon, who came from the Ayalon-Nusseibeh peace agreement, was busy preaching in favor of a military operation in Gaza. The opposition members Yossi Beilin and Haim Oron, who experienced the pre-Annapolis contacts between Olmert and Abbas at first hand, swallowed their tongues. The Meretz leadership (with the exception of Zehava Gal-On) gave the prime minister the support of the Zionist left at a bargain price. It made do with a general promise that the core issues that had been filtered out of the summation document of the Annapolis conference would be discussed in the negotiations that are supposed to begin in its wake.  
It turns out that the Zionist left finds it easier to fulfill its mission when it is confronting leaders who are loyal to the platform of the right, than when it is confronting right-wing prime ministers who are willing to mention the word "occupation." It was easier to attack Yitzhak Shamir and Benjamin Netanyahu for building "permitted" settlements than to demand that Ariel Sharon stop destroying the Palestinian Authority and to demand that Olmert dismantle "forbidden" outposts. Why make an issue of these "petty" matters when the former Likud members were evacuating Gaza and becoming friendly with Mahmoud Abbas?  
We should not, of course, ignore the fact that Olmert had to go a long distance from his Revisionist background in order to warn that a continuation of the occupation would lead to apartheid and to the end of the Jewish state. Words said by a leader are of significance. But the Israeli peace camp should have learned from its experience in the Barak government that talk about peace, without actions of peace, can end up with an intifada. The people behind the Oslo accords in the Labor Party turned a blind eye to Barak's many mistakes when conducting relations with the Palestinians: from the preference for the Syrian channel to the defective preparations for Camp David. The Meretz ministers gave him a big break when it came to the policy of the settlements and human rights in the territories.  
Has anyone heard that Labor and Meretz are demanding that the prime minister fulfill his commitment to the Americans to evacuate outposts? Why do they believe that a prime minister who violates official promises that his government made to the U.S. president will keep his word to conduct accelerated negotiations over Jerusalem? Why can Lieberman, the representative of the right, threaten Olmert that if the negotiations on the core issues reach an advanced stage, he will be forced to part from him, while a representative of the left cannot make a similar threat, conditioning its participation on progress in the peace process?  
The ultimate excuse, the doomsday weapon, "What do you want, Bibi [Netanyahu]?" cannot serve forever as the fig leaf of the Zionist left. Even if they provide Olmert with a refuge, a failure in the negotiations with what remains of the Palestinian peace camp (and/or the results of the Winograd report) will bring Netanyahu back to power. Sooner or later.

<title>Where is the occupation? </title>
<date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
The occupied territories and the Palestinians living there are slowly becoming virtual realities, distant from the eye and the heart. Palestinian workers have disappeared from our streets. Israelis no longer enter Palestinian towns for shopping. There is a new generation on each side that does not know the other. Even the settlers no longer meet Palestinians because of the different road systems that distinguish between the two populations; one is free and mobile, the other stuck at the roadblocks.  
While the politicians argue over dividing the land between two peoples, the public is apathetic. The people feel that the division has already taken place. The disengagement from the Gaza Strip, the evacuation of Gush Katif, the construction of a separation barrier - the problem is solved to our satisfaction. The settlers are conducting a settlement policy of their own, taking over new areas, expanding settlements, anything to prevent a permanent solution. They are also satisfied with the status quo that relies on the Shin Bet security service and the Israel Defense Forces.  
The de facto separation is today more similar to political apartheid than an occupation regime because of its constancy. One side - determined by national, not geographic association - includes people who have the right to choose and the freedom to move, and a growing economy. On the other side are people closed behind the walls surrounding their community, who have no right to vote, lack freedom of movement, and have no chance to plan their future. The economic gap is only getting wider and the Palestinians are wistfully watching as Israel imports laborers from China and Romania. Fear of terrorist attacks has transformed the Palestinian laborer into an undesirable.  
There have recently been reports of a further "upgrading" of the occupation. Sixteen crossing points between the West Bank and Israel are now being controlled by civilians instead of soldiers. On the face of it, this is an act of normalization, similar to the situation at international border crossings. But in this case a country exists only on one side. In the absence of an agreed border, there is only a security border that Israel has unilaterally established. The frustrated and frightened soldiers checking every Palestinian have now been replaced by contractors hired by the Defense Ministry.  
Their job is to check people holding permits; in other words, people the civil administration, under the Shin Bet's guidance, has allowed to enter Israel. The checks are being carried out by sophisticated means, almost without human contact, in reinforced, blast-proof structures. The new method has removed a burden from IDF soldiers but has created a distancing. The contact between the soldiers and the Palestinians at the crossings, precisely because it is so traumatic, has driven  the Israelis and Palestinians to seek a political solution. The stories the soldiers brought home fueled public debate. Now the soldiers are stationed only at roadblocks in the West Bank, and there is less friction. So the discourse is also minimized.  
Can this situation continue indefinitely? The more Israelis see less of the occupation, the easier it becomes to ignore. In September, 33 Palestinians and one soldier were killed in operations against terror and Qassam rockets. Only in the next intifada, or after missiles are fired at Israel from the West Bank, will we once again be reminded of the occupation.

<title>Who really cares about this Carter guy? </title>

Undoubtedly, the former president of the United States, Jimmy Carter, is an honest man. That is why it behooves him to transfer some of the royalties from his book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid" to Jewish organizations in the U.S. Were it not for their attacks, it is doubtful the book would have soared to the top of the bestseller list.  
The book prompted countless articles and commentaries in the American media; when a former U.S. president clashes with irate Jews, no media outlet can ignore the story. Jews are also compulsive book buyers, and a book everyone is talking about must at the very least lie on the living room coffee table. It would be excessive to describe Carter as an anti-Semite (although he was accused of being one), and his role in the peace treaty with Egypt should be recalled. But a big Zionist he is not. However, it seems it is not the content of the book that has agitated most of the Jewish organizations.  
Carter does indeed side with the Palestinians, and describes Israeli behavior in the territories in a way that does not add to the country's dignity. But the media depicts all of that daily, in harsher language. Carter's book does not reveal anything new to the average Israeli or American interested in the Middle East.  
The anti-Israel triangle 
More infuriating and painful is the fact that the book creates a sort of triangle: the denunciations and defamations of Arab and pro-Arab sources have recently been joined by powerful Jews protesting against the occupation and Israel's behavior in the territories, speaking in the name of Jewish values. And now they are joined by the former U.S. president, a symbol of liberalism, righteousness and American support for the weak and persecuted all over the world. His words are a kind of seal of approval for the denunciations of Israel by the "Do-Gooders" Israelis once considered themselves part of.  
And above all stands the title. The word "Apartheid" associates the Israeli occupation in the territories with the racist white minority government in South Africa. As Carter later acknowledged, he should have thought twice about the title. And if he didn't think, it's not hard to suspect him of envisioning the public relations value of such a provocative title.  
However, in his numerous press and electronic media appearances, and at various academic speaking engagements, Carter defended the claim that Israeli behavior is indeed a form of "apartheid." And with the same intensity, Jewish spokesmen from Abe Foxman, the head of the Anti Defamation League, to Prof. Alan Dershowitz, of Harvard University, denounced Carter's errors.  
Of particular note was the reaction by Prof. Deborah Lipstadt, who received much publicity for her court appearances against Holocaust denier David Irving, published in the Washington Post. She says Carter's primary sin is that he completely ignores the Holocaust, and the connection between it and the establishment of a Jewish state. Lipstadt wrote of Carter: "Now, facing a storm of criticism, he has relied on anti-Semitic stereotypes in defense."  
While Carter is exceptionally sensitive to Palestinian suffering, continues Lipstadt, his book "ignores a legacy of mistreatment, expulsion and murder committed against Jews. One cannot ignore the Holocaust's impact on Jewish identity and the history of the Middle East conflict. When an Ahmadinejad or Hamas threatens to destroy Israel, Jews have historical precedent to believe them. Jimmy Carter either does not understand this or considers it irrelevant.  
"His book, which dwells on the Palestinian refugee experience, makes two fleeting references to the Holocaust ... Remarkably, there is nothing listed between 1939 and 1947 ... However, this event sealed in the minds of almost all the world's people then the need for the Jewish people to have a Jewish state in their ancestral homeland. Carter never discusses the Jewish refugees who were prevented from entering Palestine before and after the war.  
"Carter's minimization of the Holocaust is compounded by his recent behavior," says Lipstadt. "Carter has repeatedly fallen back - possibly unconsciously - on traditional anti-Semitic canards. In the Los Angeles Times last month, he declared it 'political suicide' for a [U.S.] politician to advocate a 'balanced position' on the crisis. On Al Jazeera TV, he dismissed the critique of his book by declaring that 'most of the condemnations of my book came from Jewish-American organizations.' ... Perhaps unused to being criticized, Carter reflexively fell back on this kind of innuendo about Jewish control of the media and government."  
An unfortunate achievement 
The Jewish organizations and their spokesmen therefore had, ostensibly, a considerable accomplishment: Leading American public figures questioned the objectivity and credibility of the former president with regard to anything connected to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But it is hard to shake the feeling that this is a success we would be better off without: The book has become a bestseller in the U.S. IDF soldiers' actions in the territories are again in the headlines.  
The best thing from Israel's perspective would have been for the American media to ignore the book. Israel may have had to distance itself from its charges. And it is not as if the Jewish organizations did not have precedents to learn from. The case of the article by the professors John Marsheimer and Steven Walt about the power of the Israel lobby in the U.S. was already on its way to becoming a big scandal, because of claims that Jewish organizations blocked a New York auditorium from being used for a public debate on the article.  
It was an ideal combination: both proof of the influence of Jewish power (and perhaps also Jewish money), and a debate over freedom of speech versus censorship. Fortunately, the fire subsided rather quickly, and the smoke lingered in intellectual journals and within academic institutions. Perhaps in those days, there were other things that drew more public attention. Perhaps Marsheimer and Walt were not important enough. But ignoring them certainly helped to drop the subject from the agenda.  
The matters of Carter's book, and Marsheimer and Walt's article, were not the first. Before that there was Mel Gibson's film, "The Passion of Christ." That was a full-fledged rehashing of the old anti-Semitic denunciations, whereby the Sanhedrin and the Jewish establishment forced the Romans to kill Jesus. This slander was responsible for 2,000 years for church incitement and pogroms across Europe. It is reasonable to think that in the 21st century, the film would be screened in Christian fundamentalist churches, and then quickly disappear. But the noisy attacks transformed it into a huge box office success, which earned Gibson and his partners millions of dollars in profits.  
It is worthwhile learning from these cases because criticism of the Israeli occupation and anti-Semitism are both on the rise. The former spurs anti-Semitism, and the latter reinforces hostility toward Israel. In its political struggle, the State of Israel needs the support of American Jews. In their struggle against anti-Semitism, they need wiser Israeli behavior in the conflict with the Palestinians. American Jews need to remember this reciprocal relation no less than the leaders of Israel.

<title>Words instead of actions </title>

Every few weeks some international body issues a report directly linking the policy of restricted movement imposed by Israel on the occupied territories and the state of economic deterioration there. The report is often accompanied by a warning that the situation cannot persist. Last week it was the turn of the World Bank to issue a cautionary report, entitled "Movement and Access Restrictions in the West Bank: Uncertainty and Inefficiency in the Palestinian Economy."  
Dozens of international researchers and economic attaches are busy researching the Palestinians' economic deterioration, and many more similar reports will yet be written, as long as the countries that finance them settle for words and do not take steps to halt the policy of social and economic destruction that Israel is imposing on the Palestinians. The newest report is comprehensive, but there is nothing new in it and it stresses what has been written and said for years: Israel is inflicting enormous damage on the Palestinian economy and on its private sector.  
In 2002, following the release of a report on the impact of Israel's closure policy, the previous World Bank representative in the occupied territories, Nigel Roberts, praised the Palestinian society's endurance and suggested that any Western society would have collapsed had it undergone an economic disaster similar to that experienced in the territories. Today, five years after that report's warnings and pleas, Palestinian society's collapse is more worrying than ever - primarily in the Gaza Strip and Nablus, which not coincidentally are the areas facing the harshest Israeli siege.  
And why should Israel take into consideration the warnings of the World Bank when they have no teeth? It is not enough to mention the apartheid roads in connection with the expansion of the settlements, or the fact that around 50 percent of West Bank territory is not accessible to Palestinians. It is not enough to count the trucks at the Karni crossing that do not enter and exit, or to calculate the small number of days when the Rafah terminal is open. It is not enough to adorn the reports with scholarly charts presenting the Palestinian territories as a perpetual disaster area.  
The United States and Europe knew very well how to punish the Palestinians when democratic, free elections gave rise to a Hamas government: with a political boycott and a freeze on financial aid earmarked for development and for encouraging independent production and rebuilding. True, the donor countries, primarily Arab nations, nearly tripled in 2006 the funds they donated to the Palestinians ($900 million, compared to $349 million in 2005), but these were provided mostly in the form of nonproductive grants to an impoverished population, as detailed in the paper prepared by economist Karim Nashashibi, a former International Monetary Fund official, for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).  
The generous donations quell some of the humanitarian fires set by Israeli policy, but at the same time they subsidize it. They encourage Israel to continue to rob the tax and customs monies that make up approximately two-thirds of the Palestinian treasury's revenues. Non-transfer of the funds, of course, creates a chain reaction of economic and social regressions in the private and public sector.  
The countries issuing the warnings continue to purchase Israeli manufactured arms and other security-related products. They host military officers who are directly responsible for the killing of hundreds of Palestinian citizens and fervently implement the siege policy. They invite Israeli ministers who are responsible for the economic and social de-development of a whole people. Their representatives also meet with ministers whose remarks and actions negate the rights of the Palestinian people with no less determination than those of Hamas ministers, who refuse to declare their recognition of Israel's right to exist. The Western countries chose to punish the occupied with very concrete means - but not the occupier, which it sees as part of their Enlightened Civilization. They thus signal to Israel that it may adhere to the same policies whose impact the reports are warning against.

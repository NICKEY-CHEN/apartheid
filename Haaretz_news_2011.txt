 Sha'ar Shivayon  (Equalizer ),  
 by Alon Liel. Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 220 pages, NIS 84 
 A year later, the question remains open: Was the soccer World Cup in South Africa last summer really only a cosmetic make-over? Did that magnificent event serve to cover up a bloody countenance? Did the hundreds of thousands of tourists who came mainly in order to enjoy life, but at the same time to take pleasure in the way a human society can surpass itself and become more equal - observe the reality that exists even when there is no World Cup, or were they witness to a colorful disguise donned by a body that has yet to recover from the serious illness that it harbored for decades? 
 Take, for example, the Soccer City Stadium, in Johannesburg - the site that hosted the opening ceremony and and the final, championship game of the event. "Soccer City" has a cosmetic sound to it. So, what's being covered up? For one, the funeral of Chris Hani, one of the most popular leaders of the battle against apartheid, second only to Nelson Mandela. In 1993, 100,000 people came to the FNB  (First National Bank ) stadium, as Soccer City was then known and is known again today, and almost caused its walls to collapse. Outside another 100,000 waited. Hani had been murdered nine days earlier by a white assassin. Those events put at risk the delicate web of arrangements that was beginning to be woven at the time between the apartheid regime and those rebelling against it. 
 Not only Hani's funeral lurks behind the name "Soccer City." The funeral of Oliver Tambo, Mandela's deputy during the 27 years of his imprisonment, also took place there. The central pre-election rally of the African National Congress - the group that in effect led the struggle against apartheid - also took place in the stadium, preceding the 1994 elections that were the culmination of the democratic revolution. Etched beneath today's luxurious and sophisticated stadium are many scars and much plastic surgery. Here is a possible description of the revolution: The site that served as a central platform for stormy political events in the struggle against apartheid today contains some 90,000 spacious seats, including luxurious VIP facilities in the upper part of the bleachers. 
 That is only one possible description, and its accuracy is in question. The issue of a cosmetic cover-up is more complex: Soccer City is situated outside Soweto, an urban area on the outskirts of Johannesburg. The name "Soweto" is an acronym for "Southwestern Townships," the neighborhood built in the second half of the 20th century that was designated for blacks only. The apartheid regime confiscated the property of blacks who lived in "white" areas and expelled them to Soweto. 
 In 1976, riots broke out there after a government decision to replace English with Afrikaans as the language of instruction in the schools. The latter is the language of the Afrikaners, aka the Boers, the descendants of 17th-century white settlers who came mainly from the Netherlands and who developed the ideas of the apartheid regime. Twenty-six people were killed in the riots, including two whites. 
 Now, tens of thousands of people from all over the world can stretch out in the new seats and enjoy a soccer game. They look around them and see black and white fans. They see them cheering and blowing vuvuzelas. They see equality and innovation. They say to themselves: Yes, the illness is gone, the scars have healed. Yet if they leave the stadium and travel for five minutes in the direction of Johannesburg's Central Business District (CBD), they will be exposed to a somewhat different situation. 
 On the way there they will pass John Vorster Square, the site of the old police headquarters, which during the period of apartheid occasionally issued the laconic report, "fell from the window of the detention room." Behind this report lay the torture of hundreds of anti-apartheid activists. Those who couldn't endure the torture and committed suicide had the privilege of falling from "the window of the detention room." 
 Next comes the CBD. In the 1990s this was the site of all the important business events, including those of the Jewish community. Today it is a "no go" area. Why is there no entry? Because this is the "wild south" - aside from hundreds of thousands of blacks, the old city houses millions of "illegals," mainly from Zimbabwe, but also from Mozambique, Nigeria and Sudan. Everything has been taken over by "illegal" squatters: office buildings, the Carlton Hotel, the Chelsea Hotel, the Summit Club. There are policemen on the streets, all of them black, but there is no enforcement. Nor is there a World Cup. 
 So what is Soccer City? On the one hand VIP rooms, on the other Soweto, on the third, the CBD. What exactly is South Africa? The answer to that question is not clear and certainly not unequivocal. That is also what makes Alon Liel's book "Sha'ar Shivayon" fascinating, for the most part. Liel, who was the Israeli ambassador to South Africa from 1992 to 1994, does not force a preconception on the reality, but allows the reality to force itself on him. He doesn't hide the desire he felt to see exciting images of democracy and equality during the World Cup games, but he met with enough people, in enough places, to get a somewhat more complex picture than that seen by the average tourist who cheered in Soccer City. 
 Liel's book is composed of well-written reports that describe splinters of reality and look at various parts of South Africa from many angles of observation. His knowledge is impressive, as is his personal acquaintance with several of the key figures in politics and in everyday life in the country. The fact that his term as ambassador coincided with the period when the country underwent its most significant democratization processes prepared him to return and do a good job of carrying out the declared mission of his book: "to delve into the physical and emotional scars of apartheid ... to examine whether it is an illness from which it is possible to be cured." 
 As for soccer, Liel claims already at the outset that it was only "an excellent excuse" for him. And in fact, the more one gets into the book, the less important it becomes. At a certain point it almost disappears. In a sense, Liel does answer the key question, indirectly: In a place where the scars are so deep and the blood hasn't dried yet, even the most beautiful cosmetic cover-up - the World Cup - is doomed to melt in the sun.

<title>Bridging the Palestinian-Israeli divide, one U.K. campus at a time</title>
<date>Sat Aug 13 16:57:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
A group of U.K. university students has come together to improve pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel relations, but with rampant anti-Israel sentiments throughout the country, it is still an uphill climb.
London, as Howard Jacobson recently explored in his 2010 Man Booker Prize winning Novel 'The Finkler Question', is becoming an increasingly uncomfortable city for supporters of the state of Israel, with 'Boycott Israeli Apartheid' stickers found posted in public places throughout the city.
Some of the most fervent anti-Israel sentiments come from London universities' Palestine societies. It would be unfair to say these attitudes are unprovoked, with groups like 'Stand with Us' intent on denying any Palestinian suffering at the hands of Israel,  however, the disparity between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel groups has the potential to become politically dangerous.
With campus activists butting heads about whether Israel is the "only democracy in the Middle East" or an Apartheid state, a group of students (myself included) decided to launch an initiative to temper these polarized approaches to the conflict.
The project began a few years ago when an Israeli student, Alexander Siedes, at Warwick University formed the Israeli Palestinian Forum (IPF), a group conceived in a bid to achieve mutual understanding and respect.
Warwick students began staging debates on topical Middle East issues, with pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian activists playing reverse roles in an attempt to bring about a paradigm shift or at least acknowledgement of the legitimacy of opposing views.
Today, Warwick IPF is a resounding success with a mixed Arab-Jewish committee and events often attended by over 100 people.
The IPF initiative has spread to other campuses throughout the U.K., with its importance and utility further highlighted by university groups’ invitations to speakers toting both anti-Israel and anti-Palestinians agendas.
At the London School of Economics last academic year, the Palestine society invited Abdel Bari Atwan, editor of the Al-Quds Al-Arabi newspaper, to speak about the "Zionist control of U.S. and U.K. foreign policy".
Bari Atwan used the terms "Zionist" and "Jewish" interchangeably, and accused the Jewish students attending the lecture of being responsible for bombing Gaza. The rabble-rousing address sparked anti-Semitic sentiments in the audience, with one of the attendees describing the Jews as Nazis.
The Israel society staged a provocation of its own, inviting Dr. Solon Solomon who attempted to deconstruct the international consensus that the area captured by Israel during the Six Day War is territory illegally occupied by Israel. This enraged both Palestinians and political moderates alike.
These types of events and the ideas they promoted prompted three Kings College students (one of them being myself) to start their own branch of IPF. The group’s aim is to break down hostile relations  between students caused by the polarized nature of campus debate on the Israeli-Arab conflict. We hope to achieve this through education, dialogue and eventually activism.
The first IPF event at Kings was a lecture delivered by Professor Raimond Gaita, editor of ‘Gaza: Morality, Law and Politics', which is a collection of essays that provide varying opinions on the legality and justification (or lack thereof) of Operation Cast Lead in the winter of 2008-2009.
The room was filled to capacity as the professor discussed Israel’s history and its existential legitimacy. He then held a Q&A session in which participants from all points of the political spectrum respectfully asked the academic about his stance on the military operation in the Gaza Strip.
The second IPF event hosted representatives from One Voice Israel and One Voice Palestine who came to present their personal opinions on why the two-state solution is the only desirable outcome for both peoples and a goal that must be actively pursued.The speakers were passionate and genuine in their wish to end the conflict, and the event was thoroughly enjoyable for those who attended.
The final event of the 2010-2011 academic year entitled “The Unilateral Declaration of a Palestinian State: Consequences for Regional Peace" was a huge success. It was a debate between speakers holding divergent opinions and included former PLO negotiator and Kings College Professor Yezid Sayigh, London Israeli Embassy Counselor Ran Gidor, human rights activist and founder of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign Peter Tatchell and Kings College conflict expert Simon Waldman.
All four speakers provided invaluable insight into one of the most pertinent questions of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict today - what will happen in September when the Palestinians plan to approach the United Nations to receive recognition?
IPF is still in its infant stage, and the prospect of effecting a true change of heart on either side of the conflict is lofty at best. However, our hope is that after a promising start, we will be able to engage an increasing number of students and start the initiative on other London campuses in the coming academic year.
We have formed a national IPF committee with Warwick and Manchester in the hopes that through our joint efforts we can continue to promote dialogue in college campuses throughout the U.K.
Although IPF participants may be set in their political opinions, it is our hope that by seeing the conflict through another lens, students will be more open to the legitimacy of other narratives and be able to create sustainable partnerships toward a viable Palestinian-Israeli peace.

<title>Court dismisses Jewish students’ lawsuit against U.S university</title>
<date>Tue Dec 27 09:42:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
A lawsuit filed by two Jewish students against a California university, alleging that the university did not protect them from anti-Semitic attacks, has been dismissed.
The plaintiffs said that they and other Jews were harassed during the annual Apartheid Week event at the University of California, Berkeley, held by Muslim student groups to protest Israeli policies.
U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg ruled late last week that there was no evidence that university officials violated the Jewish students’ rights, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

<title>Interview / Writer without borders </title>
<date>Thu Feb 17 18:22:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
 
PARIS - Jean-Christophe Rufin makes sure to explain right at the start of our interview that, although he is French - in other words, tightly wound - many years outside his homeland have taught him not to place too much importance on manners. That was a genuinely important gesture for me, since the man has so many titles it's hard to know how to address him: "Dr. Rufin," "Honorable Member of the Academy," "Mr. Ambassador"? Rufin is satisfied with the minimalist "Sir."
"Today I'm 'only' myself," he says modestly - himself being of France's most successful writers over the past decade, who has already won the prestigious Goncourt Prize twice, for his historical novels "The Abyssinian"  (1997 ) and "Brazil Red" (2001), both of which have also appeared in English. He is probably referring to the fact that, as of a few months ago, he is no longer serving as his country's ambassador to Senegal, and that he is no longer at the helm of an important humanitarian organization - neither the Nobel prize-winning Medicins Sans Frontieres  (Doctors Without Borders, which he started with his colleague Bernard Kouchner ), nor Action Against Hunger  (which he also helped establish ).
Rufin, who is actually a psychiatrist by profession, has now decided to devote himself entirely to his writing. His recently published novel, "Katiba"  (in French; Flammarion Books ), a geopolitical thriller whose title refers to the name of a terror base in the Mauritanian Sahara, sold 30,000 copies in its first week. And in a few weeks, a collection of seven short stories  (his first crack at the format ) will be out.
Rufin (who appears on Thursday evening at the book fair's  Literary Cafe) is a writer-adventurer in the best tradition of Ernest Hemingway, and in reading him, it is clear that these are first of all the authentic experiences of someone who knows what he's talking about. And on top of offering realistic descriptions of countries the world over, his books contain tools for understanding the important conflicts of our time.
"Today, nonfiction books bore me somewhat," Rufin admits. "I plan from now on to devote myself to writing novels only." That is a surprising declaration from the man who began his literary career in 1986 with a nonfiction essay that became a classic, "L'aventure humanitaire," which directed a uniquely critical glance at the West, accusing it of flooding needy third-world nations in a manner that leaves their economies dependent and crushed.
Back to Paris 
Rufin is returning to Paris after three years as French ambassador to Senegal, an experience he describes as "intense." He responded to the call from Kouchner, then France's foreign minister, who sought to open the ranks of his ministry to non-diplomats who possess special familiarity with a specific region or issue.
Rufin, who avoids a declared affiliation with any particular political party, decided to take the job - although his description of those years seems to imply he has some regrets about having done so. There is no question that through the heroine of "Katiba," Jasmine - a Frenchwoman of Algerian origin who tries to make her way up the ranks of French diplomacy - he conveys the empty ceremony that characterizes much of diplomats' lives. One of the more entertaining scenes in the book  (which is not blessed with abundant humor ) describes Jasmine's many mistakes in seating dignitaries at an official ceremony: How can she seat the minister's wife next to a mere attache?
Harder to understand than Rufin's readiness to leave the foreign service is his willingness to forfeit any connection to the medical profession with which he was involved for so many years. He entered the field out of "a true calling," he says: "My grandfather was a doctor."  (In fact, Rufin's grandfather saved the lives of members of the resistance during World War II - and for that the Germans sent him to Buchenwald for two years. )
But the profession that he originally entered no longer exists, he says. "Medicine has developed in a direction that conflicts with my literary, humanist nature. Today it's a scientific profession, and increasingly distant from human beings .... I wanted a more open career that would express my desire to be politically and socially involved, and organizations like Medicins Sans Frontieres allowed me to experience the profession much more broadly. I began to write so I could understand and describe what I had experienced."
Although he served as an adviser in several governments on human rights issues and humanitarian assistance, Rufin never assumed an establishment position. "I've always kept my distance from politics," he explains. "Political issues are at the top of my agenda, but I find French politics at the moment quite boring and I really don't feel like defending principles that are far removed from mine."
Despite his exalted status and the fact that he is almost 60, Rufin is trying to return to the antiestablishment rebelliousness that characterized the start of his career. In that case, I ask him why he accepted the invitation to join the French Academy - which more than anything else symbolizes conservatism and conformism.
"Wait, wait, you haven't seen me in uniform yet!" he says, after bursting out laughing.  (Members of the academy, founded in 1635, wear festive uniforms, including a sword and a helmet, to their meetings. )
"France is now at a historical crossroads," he continues, replying in all seriousness. "It is undergoing a profound transformation of identity, and today, more than anything else, we are in need of traditional milestones, which come from the past. I'm sitting in the chair of the late Henri Troyat, a chair that has been occupied by intellectuals since the 17th century. That is important historical continuity, even if we feel like criticizing or improving it."
Witness to Operation Moses 
Rufin, whose connection to Africa began during military service as a doctor in the former French colony of Tunisia, is surprised to hear that in Israel there is minimal interest in neighboring Africa, and that eyes are turned exclusively to the United States and Europe. "But how can that be? After all, you have the Falashas," he says, using a term for Ethiopian Jews that has long been out of fashion. "I was in Ethiopia during Operation Moses [which brought thousands of Ethiopian Jews to Israel in 1984]. I wasn't particularly attracted to the country until I met my wife, Azeb, the mother of my two daughters.
"You should know that the Falasha always had inferior status; they were involved in a limited number of trades. My wife told me about the many prejudices toward them. For example, if a Falasha looks at someone while he is eating, it brings him bad luck. The Jews of Ethiopia may regard the lost homeland with nostalgia, but I remember how then, in 1984, their situation was terrible. They were considered foreigners.
"During Operation Moses, I saw all the Israelis who prepared the journey. It makes no difference what the deep ideological motives were, it was in my opinion extremely fortunate for them. That operation laid the groundwork for the immigration of the rest of the Jews later on.
"I admit that I didn't imagine that the difficulties in Israel would include theological obstacles that the rabbis would place before them  (when they asked them to convert and so on )... There's no question that I also see things through my wife's eyes; she's an Ethiopian, but of Coptic origin. She is shocked by the situation of the Falashas in Israel."
Rufin, who was raised as a Catholic but today is nonpracticing, has visited Israel before, but insists he is not very familiar with the Middle East. He is, however, quite familiar with the situation of the Jews in France. In 2004, the interior minister commissioned him to research the nature of anti-Semitism and racism in France, and how to fight these blights. Rufin submitted a report in which he concluded that the radical anti-Zionist viewpoints in France amount to a kind of camouflaged anti-Semitism.
The report was met with indignation and cataloged as "pro-Israeli." And its recommended sanctions for journalists and other opinion makers who label the Israeli regime as apartheid, Nazi or racist were never implemented.
In "Katiba," Rufin once again analyzes an explosive issue. Although he claims to be very far removed from various types of religious fundamentalism, and from any religious belief himself, his book offers an analysis of the mechanism that leads young people to carry out suicide attacks.
"My heroes were forced to carry out the attacks," he explains. "Such attacks are not part of any tradition in that region of Africa, which belongs to Sunni Islam. I think the suicide bombers are imitating Shi'ite behavior. Many of the young Muslims in France have prejudicial opinions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and they actually repeat word for word what they hear on the main French news channel and on Al Jazeera. This is a process that is possible because they lack any independent culture - most of them come from families that did not pass on their own history to them. They therefore have a kind of culture that is basically an imitation.
"In my book, the two young people who do that are actually petty criminals, 'troublemakers,' who are influenced by others. They are between two cultures and they totally lack backbone," he says.
When asked how he sees the phenomenon as a psychiatrist, Rufin seems amused, saying he doesn't want to reduce a political phenomenon to a type of psychiatric syndrome. "But there is no question that there is a certain type of personality here who tends toward that [behavior]," he says. "And they are the ones who attracted me as a writer, [creating] a novel that is totally fictional. In my eyes these are first of all people without a culture. Not only in Africa, in France too.
"I situated the plot and the heroes in Mauritania for a reason," Rufin continues. "This is a country in the desert, these are Arabs who are isolated from everyone. Today it's an Islamic country that is not extreme, on the face of it, but there, of all places, one can find lots of candidates for this type of terrorism. They explained to me that they have always felt lost and cut off from others. They are a product of being severed from the original culture. They feel 'insufficient' - 'insufficiently Muslim,' 'insufficiently Arab,' 'insufficiently active,' and the like. They felt like orphans who wanted to find a family at any cost, and they are doing it in the most extreme manner possible."

<title>Israeli Apartheid Week scores condemnation from Canadian officials</title>
<date>Sun Apr 03 09:50:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
The annual Israeli Apartheid Week held last month by university students in 11 Canadian cities brought condemnation from Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who called the controversial event a clear act of anti-Semitism.
“We must be relentless, relentless and uncompromising in exposing this anti-Semitism for what it is,” the prime minister told participants at a Toronto Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee conference, after the week of workshops, demonstrations, and performances to mark the seventh annual international event.
“The new anti-Semitism is a global threat,” Harper warned the sold-out crowd at the Royal Conservatory of Music. “It targets the Jewish people by targeting Israel, which it depicts as a source of injustice and conflict in the world perversely using a language of human rights to do so.”
Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff also spoke out against the annual event, saying while one may criticize the state of Israel, “it is impermissible to compare it to South Africa.”
Ignatieff had earlier released an official statement calling Israeli Apartheid Week a “dangerous cocktail” of ignorance and intolerance. “By portraying the Jewish state as criminal, by demonizing Israel and its supporters, and by targeting Jewish and Israeli students for abuse on our university campuses, the organizers and supporters of Israeli Apartheid Week tarnish our freedom of speech.”
According to its website, Israeli Apartheid Week aims to support Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against “Apartheid Israel.” Organizers claim that their goal is to promote “full equality for Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, an end to the occupation and colonization of all Arab lands- including the Golan Heights, the Occupied West Bank with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip” and “the protection of Palestinian refugees’ right to return to their homes and properties.”
This year’s IAW events, which ran from March 7-26th , included lectures, performances, film screenings, and demonstrations on university campuses. Although the campaign started in 2005 at the University of Toronto, it has now spread to 55 cities across the globe, including Paris, Mexico City and Haifa.
In Canada, a popular IAW workshop described the Jewish National Fund as “the perfect example of Zionist racism and ethnic cleansing.”
The Canadian IAW program also featured “Won't Stop Til the Wall Drops,” an Israeli Apartheid Week hip-hop show, and a program called “Yoga for Resistance.”
Jason Kenney, Canada’s Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, urged students not to participate in IAW events, which he says are often accompanied by anti-Semitic harassment, intimidation, and bullying.” He adds that IAW activities can cultivate an atmosphere that is antithetical to the “free exchange of ideas and the development of the mind with the aid of facts and logic.”
Kenney argues that while criticism of Israel is not itself necessarily anti-Semitic, the selective condemnation of the only Jewish State and its right to exist can create a hateful environment.
“Such scapegoating becomes yet another symptom of a worrying new acceptance of the vilification of Israel and of Jews around the world,” he warned.

<title>The importance of national repentance </title>
<date>Wed Sep 28 11:33:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
	My student years were a lot of fun. As young idealists. we marched, rallied and campaigned for numerous causes, but one of the major issues that stood at the heart of our radical consciousness was the South African apartheid.
	It took time, but the results were astonishing and apartheid was replaced with democracy.
	Last summer, when I visited South Africa for the first time, I marveled at the collapse of the mighty apartheid regime and the outstanding efforts of the new South Africa to integrate its rainbow of nations.
	On Yom Kippur, we read the curious tale of Jonah and the big fish that swallowed him. At the end of the story, Jonah recants and travels to Nineveh, where he preaches powerful sermons warning of the city's imminent destruction.
	His message is heard by the people who proclaim a fast day, don sackcloth and ashes and repent for their misdeeds. When the King of Nineveh hears what has happened, he joins the penitential frenzy, ordering a mass fast which includes not only people, but animals as well.
	The response from Nineveh is immediate, dramatic and extreme. It is high on passion, but low on maturity. When bizarrely, the people force their animals to fast and dress in sackcloth, Jonah is unimpressed.
	But God is more tolerant, conceding that although the people "do not yet know their right from their left", their actions are sincere, they are His beloved creations, and so He forgives them.
	In South Africa, I saw signs of it nationwide-repentance everywhere. The old "whites only" benches have been consigned to museums; black and white people sit together in parks, universities and the judiciary.
	A revolution has occurred. Human rights activists like Judge Albie Sachs who were once hunted and persecuted by the apartheid regime are now national heroes, making extraordinary contributions to the New South Africa.
	A nation can repent.
	The South African revolution remains young and in some senses immature. Violence is a continuous threat and AIDS is still rampant. In Durban, all of the road names were changed overnight, replacing the old "white names" with new black ones. The results are chaotic as drivers and pedestrians have no idea which streets they are traversing.
	Yet, there is something thrilling and uplifting about a nation which repents. England too, is going through a process of national introspection as it tries to understand the violent riots which recently erupted on its streets. And the Arab spring has elements of penitence as nations rise up against unjust, authoritarian regimes.
	On Yom Kippur, God judges not only every individual, but every nation too. (Rambam Laws of Penitence 3: 2) One of the most radical, exciting and enticing ideas at the heart of religious Zionism is the concept that the Jewish people must strive to build the most moral, ethical society in the world. 	We are all very proud of Israel and its extraordinary achievements. Against all the odds, we have built an outstanding democracy and performed miracles in technology, Torah study, integration of different peoples and ethnic groups and so much more.
	Nevertheless, as Yom Kippur approaches, we are not exempt from national stock-taking.
	The more religiously observant we are, the more concerned we should be about the moral level of our nation. We must never lose sight of our national mission to be the most righteous of the nations. If others see imperfections in our state, we should listen carefully before dismissing their criticism.
	Smugness is the enemy of true piety. Introspection, repentance and striving for improvement are the hallmarks of our identity and the fuel of Jewish moral achievement.
	So as Yom Kippur approaches, let us be open to criticism, regardless of its source. Let us be sure to ask searching questions about how we treat "the strangers who dwell amongst us", the poor and the vulnerable. Let us investigate the flaws in our society and correct them.
	We may not achieve perfect penitence, but every effort that we make is recognized by God and brings us closer to fulfilling the mission of the Jewish people – because a nation can repent.

<title>There is a Jewish-Arab left </title>
<date>Mon Aug 01 01:41:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
I am sure that Salman Masalha's article  ("You call this a left?," July 27 ) was flattering to Jewish readers and affirmed their prejudice, already pervasive, that most Arab citizens are nationalistic and that the affliction has even spread to Hadash and the Israeli Communist Party  (Maki ). There is nothing more convenient for an oppressor than to receive assurances of his righteousness against the oppressed. My friend Masalha produced, as is his wont, a cogent article in which few could discern the barren moral and ideological landscape.
Masalha claims that "the left is supposed to bridge the gap and the national tension by positing a civic agenda..." From a few remarks of Maki's secretary general Mohammed Nafa, he concludes that such a left wing "does not exist."
Nafa was mistaken when he appeared to be supportive of the murderous tyrannical regime in Syria, but he was right when he said: "We will never surrender to the Israeli prostitution that is trying to portray Israel as a victim."
Nafa's priorities are certainly logical. Arab citizens cannot change the situation in North Korea, Iran or even in Syria. Their task is to fight here to free their people in Palestine and for full equal rights in Israel. Since the government of Israel and the United States have been collaborating for more than 40 years to preserve the oppression, Nafa sees the struggle against then as the most important thing of all.
The task of the left is not to bridge gaps by means of a civic agenda. That is the traditional task of the conservative-liberal bourgeousie. The left is supposed to fight for justice and equality, against oppression and the hegemony of force in the international arena. The national struggle of an oppressed people is the raison d'etre of the left; the nationalism of the fundamentalists in the United States and Israel, whose purpose is to perpetuate discrimination and repression, is unacceptable.
The Cuban revolutionaries believed that national emotions in Latin America were fuel for the anti-imperialist struggle. That was true then and it is true now.
There is therefore no symmetry between the nationalism of a settler in Kedumim and that of a resident of Gaza. Terror against civilians is unacceptable, but the intent of national unity in Gaza is to liberate the Palestinians from occupation and siege; the intent of national unity in the name of "Zionism" is to perpetuate the occupation and create an apartheid state here.
The uniqueness of Hadash is in the fact that the Arab citizens who support the movement identify with the national aspirations of their people; however, they reject not only terror but also the negation of the rights of the Jews here. Masalha also knows, and concedes halfheartedly, that Hadash educates toward Jewish-Arab brotherhood not only in Bat Yam or Tel Aviv, but in Sakhnin, Nazareth and Taibeh.
Nafa, as quoted by Masalha, does not say that he supports the evil regimes in Syria, Iran or North Korea  (and they are evil, make no mistake ). He only asserts that the Jewish-Arab left in Hadash must "be more involved" in the struggle against the Israeli and the American occupation. That is the opinion of everyone who is part of the socialist left.
North Korea is an abomination, but it must not serve good Israeli radicals as an excuse to vote for Meretz - which comes out against all wars after they are over - instead of Hadash, which blends a social and a political line that should engender widespread support.
Nafa must see to it that his positions are not perceived as supporting Syria and the wicked regime there. But when Masalha ignores the role of Israel and the United States in the regional and global arena, it helps the enemies of the left and the enemies of peace.

<title>U.S. judge dismisses claims of anti-Semitism at UC Berkeley</title>
<date>Tue Dec 27 22:36:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit against the University of California, Berkeley filed by two Jewish students who claimed the school fostered an atmosphere of anti-Semitism by not doing enough to curb alleged harassment during pro-Palestinian protests that included mock checkpoints.
Plaintiff Jessica Felber claimed in the lawsuit that a leader of a campus pro-Palestinian group rammed her with a shopping cart as she staged a counter-protest to "Apartheid Week," an annual event that compares Israel's policies to the institutionalized racism of South Africa's former white government.
Felber, who graduated last year, and current undergraduate Brian Maissy sued in March to demand the university enact rules to curb what they called ongoing harassment that they said amounted to a violation of their First Amendment rights to freedom of religion and speech.
Much of the alleged harassment, even if true, constituted protected political speech, San Francisco U.S.District Judge Richard Seeborg wrote in dismissing the case Thursday.Seeborg found that the university itself did not violate the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.
Furthermore, he said UC Berkeley did not have a legal obligation to intervene in any dispute in which a private individual was allegedly interfering with those rights.
"The incident in which Felber was assaulted with a shopping cart, for example, did not occur in the context of her educational pursuits," Seeborg wrote.
"Rather, that event occurred when she, as one person attempting to exercise free speech rights in a public forum was allegedly attacked by another person who likewise was participating in a public protest in a public forum."
Joel Siegal, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told the San Francisco Chronicle his clients were reviewing their options and that the suit had stimulated dialogue about acceptable conduct at the university.
In the Apartheid Week protests as described in the lawsuit, students dressed as soldiers carry fake assault weapons and demand to know whether passing students are Jewish.
Felber said she required medical attention as a result of the shopping cart incident and obtained a permanent restraining order against the alleged assailant.
The plaintiffs cited what they said was a long history of harassment of Jewish students by Muslim and pro-Palestinian student groups on UC campuses.
Among those is a high-profile case in Orange County, where 10 Muslim students were convicted of misdemeanors for disrupting a speech given by an Israeli ambassador last year at UC Irvine. The students appealed, arguing that the law used to convict them was vague and unconstitutional.
In dismissing the UC Berkeley case, Seeborg observed that many of the incidents of alleged harassment occurred before the plaintiffs were enrolled or did not happen at UC Berkeley. He also said the incidents as described showed that campus police intervened to arrest disruptive protesters and that the university has worked to mediate conflicts between opposing student groups.
Tensions between Jewish and Muslim student groups have often run high on UC campuses over the issue of Israel's policies toward Palestinians.
In March, the U.S.¬ Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights notified UC Santa Cruz it was investigating a faculty member's complaint that a series of pro-Palestinian events had created a hostile environment for Jewish students.
Hebrew lecturer Tammi Rossman-Benjamin said administrators repeatedly failed to address her and students' concerns about film screenings and appearances by "viciously anti-Israel" speakers sponsored with campus funds. The university said Rossman-Benjamin's complaints were unfounded.

<title>Yes Mr. Lieberman, I'm a proud Jewish terrorist </title>
<date>Tue Jul 19 03:08:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
In 1942, as a young boy, a high school student in Tel Aviv, I joined the Haganah  (the main pre-state underground Jewish militia ). The British Mandatory government considered me, and others who did as I did, to be members of an illegal organization. Two years later I enlisted in the Palmach, the elite strike force of the Haganah, and during my period of activity in the framework of the Jewish resistance movement the British government considered me a "terrorist." Afterwards I fought in the War of Independence and spent another 32 years in the Israel Defense Forces as a career soldier.
Today I consider the continuation of our occupation rule in Judea and Samaria an existential danger. As I see it, this situation is threatening the main achievement to which I contributed 70 years ago: the establishment of a sovereign and democratic Jewish state. If we don't separate as soon as possible from the Palestinian population on the ground, Jewish and democratic Israel will be unable to survive.
A few years ago I became a member of the public council of Yesh Din - Volunteers for Human Rights. I can't influence Israel's diplomatic decisions, but I saw it as my duty to contribute to upholding the law in the occupied under our control. I believe that the Israeli government, the Knesset and the vast majority of the people want the law to be enforced in the area east of the Green Line, just as they want it to be enforced to the west of it. But in the present situation, unfortunately, there is no equal treatment for Jews and Arabs when it comes to law enforcement. The legal system that enforces the law in a discriminatory way on the basis of national identity, is actually maintaining an apartheid regime. And I wanted to prevent that with my activity and contribution as a member of the council of Yesh Din.
The Palestinian resident in the occupied territory is unable in most cases to stand up for his rights and to find his way in the State of Israel's civil and military bureaucratic maze. The group of researchers and volunteers  (mainly female ) of Yesh Din serve as his mouthpiece. We do not presume to decide who is right in each and every instance. Our job is only to learn about all the details of the complaint and to bring it to the authorities.
The Israeli administration in the area, the IDF and the Israel Police, don't like our activity. They feel uncomfortable dealing with the complaints that we place before them. But none of them claims that our activity is unnecessary, unacceptable or subversive.
Yesterday something shocking happened. A respectable minister in the Israeli government, the foreign minister, the man who heads the Yisrael Beitenu party, called the organization of whose public council I am a member, Yesh Din, a terrorist organization - 69 years after the British Mandatory government defined me as a terrorist.
At the time I considered the epithet attached to me by the Mandatory government a badge of honor. Today I see the same title, which this time was attached to me by Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, as a new badge of honor. I believe that the activity of Yesh Din deserves a medal. I see our activity as a crucial attempt to save the State of Israel from becoming an apartheid regime.
The foreign minister should have been the first to understand that. Doesn't he understand that a person who condemns the activity of Yesh Din is in effect announcing a deliberate intention to maintain a miscarriage of justice, a deliberate intention to maintain separate systems of law and justice for Jews and Arabs? Under these circumstances, Mr. Lieberman, I'm proud to be called a "terrorist" by you.

<title>A clash of narratives as Abbas and Netanyahu duel it out at the UN</title>
<date>Fri Sep 23 23:38:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
NEW YORK – There was little room for optimism at the end of what some may describe as a historic day in which Palestine asked for UN recognition while its leader Mahmoud Abbas went head to head with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the entire world to see.
Both Abbas and Netanyahu spoke well, from their own point of view, but each spoke past each other and to completely different audiences. Theirs was a dialogue of the deaf, a clash of divergent narratives; proof, if one was needed, that Israelis and Palestinians reside in parallel universes, and never the twain shall meet, if nothing dramatic occurs.
Abbas was courting the Palestinians, first and foremost, and his target audiences were the Arab and Third Worlds. His speech was peppered with the kind of harsh anti-Israeli catchphrases that are the staple of the UN’s “automatic majority” at forums like Durban and the Human Rights Council, including “apartheid”, “colonialism”, “racism” and “ethnic cleansing”. Fresh off the heels of the stinging rebuke he sustained in U.S. President Barack Obama’s UN speech this week, Abbas was obviously in no mood to please Americans or Israelis, opting instead for a no-holds-barred presentation of the Palestinian narrative that grated on the ears of most Israelis but fueled the enthusiasm of his many supporters in the General Assembly building.
Netanyahu, for his part, addressed those parts of the world that Abbas chose to ignore. In a well-executed though rather long-winded presentation - which drew most of its applause from the Israeli delegation and an imported crowd of cheerleaders -  Netanyahu cast himself as a Daniel in the hyenas’ den of the UN’s anti-Israeli bloc,  appointed himself a spokesman for “100 generations of Jews”, rebuffed Abbas’ more incendiary allegations and saved a little something for each of his favorite groups:  the Lubavitcher Rebbe for religious Jews,  a citation from the Bible for evangelical Christians,  the memory of 9/11 for his American audience and the invitation to Abbas to “talk dugri”, the Israeli equivalent of  the American “talk turkey”, for his Israeli voters at home.
But though they pledged their supposed allegiance to a negotiated two-state solution, Abbas and Netanyahu made no effort to hide their deep mistrust of each other’s true intentions and their mutual underlying assumption that they both lack a credible partner for peace. Nonetheless - in the only bit of good news for those who insist on maintaining a slight glimmer of hope despite all the proof to the contrary – in the wake of the Quartet’s call Friday, Washington is sure to seek an early resumption of peace talks, if only to rid the United States of the political hot potato that Abbas dumped on its lap when he decided to press ahead with his big UN offensive.

<title>ADL chief to Abbas: Stop demonizing Israel, resume direct peace talks</title>
<date>Thu Oct 06 13:34:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
The Palestinian Authority must stop demonizing Israel in the international stage, the Anti-Defamation league said in an open letter to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday, urging the PA leader to return to the negotiations table.
In an open letter released on Wednesday, ADL director Abraham H. Foxman criticized Abbas for his recent address in front of the United Nations General Assembly, urging the PA president to return to peace talks and halt the Palestinian campaign to delegitimize Israel.
"You say you will not come to negotiate until Mr. Netanyahu says in advance that Israel will concede all the territories and stop all settlements," Foxman wrote, citing Abbas' self-proclaimed inability to trust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
"Trust is a two-way street," the ADL chief said, adding: "Let's stop this demonizing.  Let's move forward.  If you sit down to talk, you may learn that you have far greater reason to trust Prime Minister Netanyahu than you thought."
The ADL: director urged Abbas to quell Israeli concerns over the sincerity of the Palestinians' wish to end the Mideast conflict, saying that the only way to do so was not through smearing Israel's name in the international community by but "coming back to the table, by negotiating in good faith and by reaching an agreement that finally ends the conflict and provides for a Palestinian state and a Jewish state living side-by-side in peace and security."
In his letter, Foxman criticized the Palestinian president for attacking Israel in his UN speech, saying that while Abbas "claimed that the initiative to get the U.N. to accept Palestine as a member state was not intended to isolate or delegitimize Israel," he nonetheless "used the very language that was employed against apartheid South Africa to achieve that very purpose."
"You used all the code words and phrases that provoke Israel’s isolation from the world community: racist, colonialist, annexationist, brutal, ethnic cleanser, aggressive," Foxman added, saying: "You miscast Israel’s understandable desire to be recognized as a Jewish state, a recognition which should not be a big matter if the goal is two states living side-by-side in peace and security."
Foxman's missive came following a Palestinian bid for statehood at the UN late last month, a move which Israel and the U.S. have criticized as "unproductive" to continued direct peace talks.
In a statement following the Palestinian bid, the Quartet - the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia -- said it wanted to see comprehensive proposals within three months on territory and security, and substantial progress within six months.

<title>A page out of Bibi's playbook </title>
<date>Fri Sep 23 03:00:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Nu? Are we isolated yet? Have the tidal waves of September's diplomatic tsunami crashed over Israel? Is the Jewish state hurtling down the steep slope of pariahdom? Even before Barack Obama's surprisingly pro-Israel speech at the United Nations and the sudden shift in the Quartet's policy, to applying pressure almost exclusively on the Palestinians, I would have argued that the specter of an Israel isolated in the world, facing boycotts, sanctions and a relentless campaign of delegitimization was a false one. The facts on the ground just don't support it.
Take the last couple of years as a test case. Israel is being governed by one of its most right-wing governments ever, the Knesset is passing anti-democratic laws and Israeli society seems more insular and xenophobic than ever. Has the country become an outcast among nations? No, it has become a member of one of the most exclusive clubs, the OECD. Has Israel's trade relations suffered? In a period of global financial turmoil, all the economic indicators are up.
The clash of personalities and ideologies between the American president and the Israeli prime minister could hardly be more strident, but has this harmed the strategic ties with the United States? Not at all. In addition to the annual $ 3 billion dollars in aid, Israel will now be getting $ 205 million dollars to build more Iron Dome missile-defense batteries and there are more joint exercises between Israeli and American armed forces than ever. The last month in which Israeli diplomats were expelled from Turkey and the embassy in Cairo was sacked may have seemed a bad one, but at the same time, Standard and Poor upgraded Israel's credit rating to A + and Israel became the first non-European nation to become an associate member of the European nuclear research agency, CERN.
So what is happening here? Is Binyamin Netanyahu really a magician? "Don't worry," he has been saying to Israelis for the last two and a half years, "don't listen to all the noise and nuisance around you, Israel is strong, Israel is just, we will persevere and prosper." So far, he seems to pulling it off.
Yes, we all know that the situation around us, in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and Turkey has not been this unstable for decades, but all the more reason - so Bibi tells us - to hunker down, not make any changes and weather the storm. The west will soon realize it has only Israel to rely on in the region. Is this all short-termism? How long can Netanyahu and the right wing get away with thumbing their noses at the world? From their perspective at least, it could carry on indefinitely. If Obama has just raised the white flag, what other American president will ever pressure Israel again? Certainly not any of the prospective Republicans who may be sitting in the White House in fifteen months.
What about the European Union - could they finally get together long enough to pursue a coherent Mideast policy? It wouldn't seem so, not with the looming meltdown of the Eurozone. They won't have the time or the energy. So who else is there? Russia? China? India? When did these countries ever pursue a foreign policy not based on narrow financial interests? So what else? Western public opinion? Civil acitivism? NGOs? If they had the power to change Israel's policy, it would have happened long ago.
For some years now, there have been those on the left who have been trying to peddle the Israeli apartheid line, in the hope that it would generate a widespread movement of boycotts against Israel. It hasn't worked for any numbers of reasons. For a start, the comparison between Israel and racist South Africa is so evidently an immoral and lazy one, that it simply doesn't wash - especially among those left-wing Jewish Zionists who actually know Israel. They are fully aware of Israel's many faults and don't need anyone else to characterize them in such an erroneous fashion. So the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra gets heckled in London, a few academic organizations and trade unions pass motions boycotting Israel, some shops selling Dead Sea cosmetics get picketed - who feels isolated by that? Certainly not the majority of Israelis who are only going to see this as an affirmation of the "anti-Semitic world is out to get us" trope.
Of course, in the long run, this is not sustainable. Israel's current prosperity is due to its dynamism and entrepreneurship. But such a state would have been impossible if the country still had to channel huge financial and human resources into facing a mortal enemy in the south  (Egypt, not Hamas ) and if everyday life was constantly disrupted by terror attacks in cities. The peace with Egypt - which looks increasingly precarious - may have been cold throughout its entire existence, but it still served as the impetus for the economic miracle. That miracle could hardly be sustained without the current level of security cooperation with the Palestinian Authority, which ensures calm on Israel's streets. Even if the international community doesn't get off its haunches and impose a diplomatic solution, Netanyahu's refusal - or political inability - to embark on a credible peace initiative will ultimately reap a storm. And in the meantime, Israel will become even more polarized in the process, riven into a network of fighting tribes, failing to build a national ethos.
Where does this leave those who love Israel yet are convinced it is going down a disastrous path, for its own society and sense of Jewish justice first and foremost? Maybe the time has come to play to Israel's strengths. It is, for all its faults, a democracy and an open society. The attempts of various NGOs and foundations to quietly fund "civil society" movements have not had much effect, as they have only fed into right-wing suspicion and created a backlash. A more open and broader approach is needed. Why not take a page out of Netanyahu's playbook?
Bibi has proved that he can rely on the strategic relationship with the United States while playing off the Republican Party against the Obama administration. That should be the strategy of all those who care about Israel's future. Opposing Israel's isolation and the boycott movement does not have to mean embracing Likud paralysis and Liebermanesque xenophobia. And it doesn't mean going underground as wanna-be dissidents either.
As of Wednesday night, Israel has two mainstream opposition leaders with a clear agenda for a two-state solution. Foreign politicians and Jewish community leaders should make it clear that they can do business with Bibi as long as he is the elected prime minister, but it is not his version of Israel they choose.

<title>British orchestra suspends 4 over call to boycott Israel </title>
<date>Sun Sep 18 00:32:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
The London Philharmonic Orchestra has suspended four of its musicians for nine months after they called for a boycott of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra earlier this month, in what cultural commentator Norman Lebrecht called, in his blog, "the most severe public penalty inflicted on London orchestral musicians in memory."
Cellist Sue Sutherley and violinists Tom Eisner, Nancy Elan and Sarah Streatfeild were among the 21 signatories to a letter that was sent to BBC Proms concert series director Roger Wright and published in The Independent on August 30. The signatories, headed by the Irish composer Raymond Deane, called for the cancelation of the IPO's appearance at the popular festival, held at the Albert Hall on September 1. The four LPO members who were later suspended, and a few of the other signatories, indicated the ensembles to which they belonged next to their signatures.
The letter noted that Wright "was asked to cancel the concert in accordance with the call from the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott" of Israel, but refused. It cited the IPO's "deep involvement with the Israeli state - not least its self-proclaimed 'partnership' with the Israeli Defence Forces" - "the same state and army that impedes in every way it can the development of Palestinian culture, including the prevention of Palestinian musicians from travelling abroad to perform." The letter called the orchestra "perhaps Israel's prime asset" in its "campaign" to hide "denials of human rights and violations of international law ... behind a cultural smokescreen."
"Israel's policy towards the Palestinians fits the UN definition of apartheid. We call on the BBC to cancel this concert," the letter concluded.
The September 1 concert was not canceled, but disturbances by audience members and protesters in the auditorium led the BBC to halt its direct broadcast of the performance.
Several demonstrators in the venue shouted as Zubin Mehta stood to conduct Bruch's Violin Concerto, while other audience members booed in response to the protest.
Britain's main weekend newspapers and prominent blogs are filled with invective against the LPO for suspending the musicians. Norman Jeras, a music critic who is a fierce opponent of the campaign to boycott Israel culturally, asked "whether a nine-month suspension from one's job for writing a letter to a newspaper isn't rather excessive."
According to The Guardian, London Philharmonic Orchestra chief executive Tim Walker and chairman Martin Hohmann released a statement regarding the suspensions, which they said were meant to send a "strong and clear message that their actions will not be tolerated." The statement said that while the orchestra would never restrict the right of its players to express themselves freely, such expression has to be independent of the LPO itself. The orchestra has no desire to "end the careers" of the musicians, the statement said. Nevertheless, it continued, "for the LPO, music and politics do not mix."

<title>Fear and no clean clothing: Amira Hass preparing to sail for Gaza </title>
<date>Sun Jun 26 02:37:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Social activist Stephan Corriveau warned all of us due to set sail on the Canadian ship dubbed the Tahrir - one of the boats participating in the upcoming Gaza flotilla - that we would have no opportunity to bathe during the three-day journey to Gaza but would have drinking water. There was no point in bringing a change of clothes, the Montreal-based Corriveau noted, because there would be nowhere to change, encouraging us to take as little as possible. In the best case scenario, we will make it to Gaza and can buy some clothing there, he said.
There are about 50 of us, men and women, due to sail on the Tahrir, whose name is a reference to the Cairo square where protests earlier this year led to the downfall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's regime. Several hundred other activists, from about 20 countries, and several dozen journalists are currently preparing to set sail for Gaza.
At several Mediterranean ports, ships await their participants for the upcoming flotilla. The vessels were acquired in a transatlantic fund-raising effort which began about a year ago, immediately after the Israeli Navy killed nine partcipants aboard a Gaza-bound flotilla ship, the Mavi Marmara, last May. The new flotilla has been organized by a coalition of organizations, all of which refuse to accept the Israeli argument that the Gaza Strip is no longer besieged and that if there is a siege, it is only because of the arms Hamas has been smuggling into the territory. The activists' participation is designed to apply popular pressure on their own governments to stop cooperating with the Israeli policy.
Canadian activists raised about $350,000 over the past year for the operation, setting up an account in the name of a group called Turtle Island Humanitarian Aid. The Canadian government has announced it does not support the flotilla, viewing it as a provocation against Israel. Other governments have had a similar reaction to the effort in response to the participation of their nationals. Only the Irish government has called on Israel to refrain from violence in response to the flotilla.
Last Thursday, the Greek port authority announced it had received a  claim contending that the the Amercian boat,  whose delegates are mostly from the U.S. but some are Israelis, was not seaworthy and the ship's departure would be delayed until the claim was investigated.  Flotilla organizers say they believe the claim to be politically motivated. Their lawyer is currently negotiating with authorities over the issue but the plan is to set sail with the rest of the flotilla.
Although the Tahrir has been generally referred to  as Canadian, it was purchased for about $500,000 with contributions that also came from Australia, Denmark and Belgium; nationals of all of these countries will be on board when it joins the flotilla. The donations came primarily from individuals and non-governmental organizations, said David Heap, a Canadian professor of linguistics and French who has a history of activism against apartheid in South Africa and on behalf of native peoples in North America.
Heap said he was not surprised by the Canadian government's opposition to the flotilla, and claimed Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper had been a founder of a think tank that supported South Africa during the apartheid regime and that opposed sanctions against the regime and the release of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela.
In advance of the departure of our ship, we - the particpants - sat in a Greek hotel, getting to know one another and rehearsing the prospect that the Israeli Navy would take control of the ships in the flotilla. In simulation drills over several hours, about 50 civilians - ranging in age from 20 to 69 - attempted to imagine themselves facing Israeli warships and M16 rifles with fighter helicopters hovering overhead, along with water cannon, tear gas and Taser stun guns. The participants also imagined verbal abuse along with physical blows, dogs, and masked commandos.
The activists concluded from the exercise that they should acknowledge their fears and learn as a group of people, mutually responsible for one anther, how to confront their fears.

<title>Full transcript of Abbas speech at UN General Assembly</title>
<date>Fri Sep 23 20:22:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Mr. President of the General Assembly of the United Nations,
Mr. Secretary-General of the United Nations,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the outset, I wish to extend my congratulations to H.E. Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the Presidency of the Assembly for this session, and wish him all success.
I reaffirm today my sincere congratulations, on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian people, to the government and people of South Sudan for its deserved admission as a full member of the United Nations, wishing them progress and prosperity.
I also congratulate the Secretary-General, H.E. Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his election for a new term at the helm of the United Nations.  This renewal of confidence reflects the world’s appreciation for his efforts, which have strengthened the role of the United Nations.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Question Palestine is intricately linked with the United Nations via the resolutions adopted by its various organs and agencies and via the essential and lauded role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East - UNRWA - which embodies the international responsibility towards the plight of Palestine refugees, who are the victims of Al-Nakba (Catastrophe) that occurred in 1948. We aspire for and seek a greater and more effective role for the United Nations in working to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in our region that ensures the inalienable, legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people as defined by the resolutions of international legitimacy of the United Nations.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
A year ago, at this same time, distinguished leaders in this hall addressed the stalled peace efforts in our region. Everyone had high hopes for a new round of final status negotiations, which had begun in early September in Washington under the direct auspices of President Barack Obama and with participation of the Quartet, and with Egyptian and Jordanian participation, to reach a peace agreement within one year. We entered those negotiations with open hearts and attentive ears and sincere intentions, and we were ready with our documents, papers and proposals.  But the negotiations broke down just weeks after their launch.
After this, we did not give up and did not cease our efforts for initiatives and contacts.  Over the past year we did not leave a door to be knocked or channel to be tested or path to be taken and we did not ignore any formal or informal party of influence and stature to be addressed. We positively considered the various ideas and proposals and initiatives presented from many countries and parties. But all of these sincere efforts and endeavors undertaken by international parties were repeatedly wrecked by the positions of the Israeli government, which quickly dashed the hopes raised by the launch of negotiations last September.
The core issue here is that the Israeli government refuses to commit to terms of reference for the negotiations that are based on international law and United Nations resolutions, and that it frantically continues to intensify building of settlements on the territory of the State of Palestine.
Settlement activities embody the core of the policy of colonial military occupation of the land of the Palestinian people and all of the brutality of aggression and racial discrimination against our people that this policy entails.  This policy, which constitutes a breach of international humanitarian law and United Nations resolutions, is the primary cause for the failure of the peace process, the collapse of dozens of opportunities, and the burial of the great hopes that arose from the signing of the Declaration of Principles in 1993 between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel to achieve a just peace that would begin a new era for our region.
The reports of United Nations missions as well as by several Israeli institutions and civil societies convey a horrific picture about the size of the settlement campaign, which the Israeli government does not hesitate to boast about and which it continues to execute through the systematic confiscation of the Palestinian lands and the construction of thousands of new settlement units in various areas of the West Bank, particularly in East Jerusalem, and accelerated construction of the annexation Wall that is eating up large tracts of our land, dividing it into separate and isolated islands and cantons, destroying family life and communities and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of families.  The occupying Power also continues to refuse permits for our people to build in Occupied East Jerusalem, at the same time that it intensifies its decades-long campaign of demolition and confiscation of homes, displacing Palestinian owners and residents under a multi-pronged policy of ethnic cleansing aimed at pushing them away from their ancestral homeland.  In addition, orders have been issued to deport elected representatives from the city of Jerusalem.  The occupying Power also continues to undertake excavations that threaten our holy places, and its military checkpoints prevent our citizens from getting access to their mosques and churches, and it continues to besiege the Holy City with a ring of settlements imposed to separate the Holy City from the rest of the Palestinian cities.
The occupation is racing against time to redraw the borders on our land according to what it wants and to impose a fait accompli on the ground that changes the realities and that is undermining the realistic potential for the existence of the State of Palestine.
At the same time, the occupying Power continues to impose its blockade on the Gaza Strip and to target Palestinian civilians by assassinations, air strikes and artillery shelling, persisting with its war of aggression of three years ago on Gaza, which resulted in massive destruction of homes, schools, hospitals, and mosques, and the thousands of martyrs and wounded.
The occupying Power also continues its incursions in areas of the Palestinian National Authority through raids, arrests and killings at the checkpoints.  In recent years, the criminal actions of armed settler militias, who enjoy the special protection of the occupation army, has intensified with the perpetration of frequent attacks against our people, targeting their homes, schools, universities, mosques, fields, crops and trees. Despite our repeated warnings, the occupying Power has not acted to curb these attacks and we hold them fully responsible for the crimes of the settlers.
These are just a few examples of the policy of the Israeli colonial settlement occupation, and this policy is responsible for the continued failure of the successive international attempts to salvage the peace process.
This policy will destroy the chances of achieving a two-State solution upon which there is an international consensus, and here I caution aloud: This settlement policy threatens to also undermine the structure of the Palestinian National Authority and even end its existence.
In addition, we now face the imposition new conditions not previously raised, conditions that will transform the raging conflict in our inflamed region into a religious conflict and a threat to the future of a million and a half Christian and Muslim Palestinians, citizens of Israel, a matter which we reject and which is impossible for us to accept being dragged into.
All of these actions taken by Israel in our country are unilateral actions and are not based on any earlier agreements.  Indeed, what we witness is a selective application of the agreements aimed at perpetuating the occupation.  Israel reoccupied the cities of the West Bank by a unilateral action, and reestablished the civil and military occupation by a unilateral action, and it is the one that determines whether or not a Palestinian citizen has the right to reside in any part of the Palestinian Territory.  And it is confiscating our land and our water and obstructing our movement as well as the movement of goods.  And it is the one obstructing our whole destiny. All of this is unilateral.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
In 1974, our deceased leader Yasser Arafat came to this hall and assured the Members of the General Assembly of our affirmative pursuit for peace, urging the United Nations to realize the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people, stating: “Do not let the olive branch fall from my hand”.
In 1988, President Arafat again addressed the General Assembly, which convened in Geneva to hear him, where he submitted the Palestinian peace program adopted by the Palestine National Council at its session held that year in Algeria.
When we adopted this program, we were taking a painful and very difficult step for all of us, especially those, including myself, who were forced to leave their homes and their towns and villages, carrying only some of our belongings and our grief and our memories and the keys of our homes to the camps of exile and the Diaspora in the 1948 Al-Nakba, one of the worst operations of uprooting, destruction and removal of a vibrant and cohesive society that had been contributing in a pioneering and leading way in the cultural, educational and economic renaissance of the Arab Middle East.
Yet, because we believe in peace and because of our conviction in international legitimacy, and because we had the courage to make difficult decisions for our people, and in the absence of absolute justice, we decided to adopt the path of relative justice - justice that is possible and could correct part of the grave historical injustice committed against our people. Thus, we agreed to establish the State of Palestine on only 22% of the territory of historical Palestine - on all the Palestinian Territory occupied by Israel in 1967.
We, by taking that historic step, which was welcomed by the States of the world, made a major concession in order to achieve a historic compromise that would allow peace to be made in the land of peace.
In the years that followed - from the Madrid Conference and the Washington negotiations leading to the Oslo agreement, which was signed 18 years ago in the garden of the White House and was linked with the letters of mutual recognition between the PLO and Israel, we persevered and dealt positively and responsibly with all efforts aimed at the achievement of a lasting peace agreement.  Yet, as we said earlier, every initiative and every conference and every new round of negotiations and every movement was shattered on the rock of the Israeli settlement expansion project.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I confirm, on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, which will remain so until the end of the conflict in all its aspects and until the resolution of all final status issues, the following:
1. The goal of the Palestinian people is the realization of their inalienable national rights in their independent State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, on all the land of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip,  which Israel occupied in the June 1967 war, in conformity with the resolutions of international legitimacy and with the achievement of a just and agreed upon solution to the Palestine refugee issue in accordance with resolution 194, as stipulated in the Arab Peace Initiative which presented the consensus Arab vision to resolve the core the Arab-Israeli conflict and to achieve a just and comprehensive peace.  To this we adhere and this is what we are working to achieve.  Achieving this desired peace also requires the release of political prisoners and detainees in Israeli prisons without delay.
2. The PLO and the Palestinian people adhere to the renouncement of violence and rejection and condemning of terrorism in all its forms, especially State terrorism, and adhere to all agreements signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel.
3. We adhere to the option of negotiating a lasting solution to the conflict in accordance with resolutions of international legitimacy.  Here, I declare that the Palestine Liberation Organization is ready to return immediately to the negotiating table on the basis of the adopted terms of reference based on international legitimacy and a complete cessation of settlement activities.
4. Our people will continue their popular peaceful resistance to the Israeli occupation and its settlement and apartheid policies and its construction of the racist annexation Wall, and they receive support for their resistance, which is consistent with international humanitarian law and international conventions and has the support of peace activists from Israel and around the world, reflecting an impressive, inspiring and courageous example of the strength of this defenseless people, armed only with their dreams, courage, hope and slogans in the face of bullets, tanks, tear gas and bulldozers.
5. When we bring our plight and our case to this international podium, it is a confirmation of our reliance on the political and diplomatic option and is a confirmation that we do not undertake unilateral steps.  Our efforts are not aimed at isolating Israel or de-legitimizing it; rather we want to gain legitimacy for the cause of the people of Palestine. We only aim to de-legitimize the settlement activities and the occupation and apartheid and the logic of ruthless force, and we believe that all the countries of the world stand with us in this regard.
I am here to say on behalf of the Palestinian people and the Palestine Liberation Organization: We extend our hands to the Israeli government and the Israeli people for peace-making.  I say to them: Let us urgently build together a future for our children where they can enjoy freedom, security and prosperity.  Let us build the bridges of dialogue instead of checkpoints and walls of separation, and build cooperative relations based on parity and equity between two neighboring States - Palestine and Israel - instead of policies of occupation, settlement, war and eliminating the other.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Despite the unquestionable right of our people to self-determination and to the independence of our State as stipulated in international resolutions, we have accepted in the past few years to engage in what appeared to be a test of our worthiness, entitlement and eligibility. During the last two years our national authority has implemented a program to build our State institutions.  Despite the extraordinary situation and the Israeli obstacles imposed, a serious extensive project was launched that has included the implementation of plans to enhance and advance the judiciary and the apparatus for maintenance of order and security, to develop the administrative, financial, and oversight systems, to upgrade the performance of institutions, and to enhance self-reliance to reduce the need for foreign aid.  With the thankful support of Arab countries and donors from friendly countries, a number of large infrastructure projects have been implemented, focused on various aspects of service, with special attention to rural and marginalized areas.
In the midst of this massive national project, we have been strengthening what we seeking to be the features of our State: from the preservation of security for the citizen and public order; to the promotion of judicial authority and rule of law; to strengthening the role of women via legislation, laws and participation; to ensuring the protection of public freedoms and strengthening the role of civil society institutions; to institutionalizing rules and regulations for ensuring accountability and transparency in the work of our Ministries and departments; to entrenching the pillars of democracy as the basis for the Palestinian political life.
When division struck the unity of our homeland, people and institutions, we were determined to adopt dialogue for restoration of our unity.  We succeeded months ago in achieving national reconciliation and we hope that its implementation will be accelerated in the coming weeks.  The core pillar of this reconciliation was to turn to the people through legislative and presidential elections within a year, because the State we want will be a State characterized by the rule of law, democratic exercise and protection of the freedoms and equality of all citizens without any discrimination and the transfer of power through the ballot box.
The reports issued recently by the United Nations, the World Bank, the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) and the International Monetary Fund confirm and laud what has been accomplished, considering it a remarkable and unprecedented model.  The consensus conclusion by the AHLC a few days ago here described what has been accomplished as a “remarkable international success story” and confirmed the readiness of the Palestinian people and their institutions for the immediate independence of the State of Palestine.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is no longer possible to redress the issue of the blockage of the horizon of the peace talks with the same means and methods that have been repeatedly tried and proven unsuccessful over the past years.  The crisis is far too deep to be neglected, and what is more dangerous are attempts to simply circumvent it or postpone its explosion.
It is neither possible, nor practical, nor acceptable to return to conducting business as usual, as if everything is fine.  It is futile to go into negotiations without clear parameters and in the absence of credibility and a specific timetable.  Negotiations will be meaningless as long as the occupation army on the ground continues to entrench its occupation, instead of rolling it back, and continues to change the demography of our country in order to create a new basis on which to alter the borders.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a moment of truth and my people are waiting to hear the answer of the world.  Will it allow Israel to continue its occupation, the only occupation in the world?  Will it allow Israel to remain a State above the law and accountability?  Will it allow Israel to continue rejecting the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations and the International Court of Justice and the positions of the overwhelming majority of countries in the world?
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I come before you today from the Holy Land, the land of Palestine, the land of divine messages, ascension of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the birthplace of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him), to speak on behalf of the Palestinian people in the homeland and in the the Diaspora, to say, after 63 years of suffering of the ongoing Nakba: Enough. It is time for the Palestinian people to gain their freedom and independence.
The time has come to end the suffering and the plight of millions of Palestine refugees in the homeland and the Diaspora, to end their displacement and to realize their rights, some of them forced to take refuge more than once in different places of the world.
At a time when the Arab peoples affirm their quest for democracy - the Arab Spring - the time is now for the Palestinian Spring, the time for independence.
The time has come for our men, women and children to live normal lives, for them to be able to sleep without waiting for the worst that the next day will bring; for mothers to be assured that their children will return home without fear of suffering killing, arrest or humiliation; for students to be able to go to their schools and universities without checkpoints obstructing them.  The time has come for sick people to be able to reach hospitals normally, and for our farmers to be able to take care of their good land without fear of the occupation seizing the land and its water, which the wall prevents access to, or fear of the settlers, for whom settlements are being built on our land and who are uprooting and burning the olive trees that have existed for hundreds of years.  The time has come for the thousands of prisoners to be released from the prisons to return to their families and their children to become a part of building their homeland, for the freedom of which they have sacrificed.
My people desire to exercise their right to enjoy a normal life like the rest of humanity. They believe what the great poet Mahmoud Darwish said: Standing here, staying here, permanent here, eternal here, and we have one goal, one, one: to be.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We profoundly appreciate and value the positions of all States that have supported our struggle and our rights and recognized the State of Palestine following the Declaration of Independence in 1988, as well as the countries that have recently recognized the State of Palestine and those that have upgraded the level of Palestine’s representation in their capitals.  I also salute the Secretary-General, who said a few days ago that the Palestinian State should have been established years ago.
Be assured that this support for our people is more valuable to them than you can imagine, for it makes them feel that someone is listening to their narrative and that their tragedy and the horrors of Al-Nakba and the occupation, from which they have so suffered, are not being ignored.  And, it reinforces their hope that stems from the belief that justice is possible in this in this world. The loss of hope is the most ferocious enemy of peace and despair is the strongest ally of extremism.
I say: The time has come for my courageous and proud people, after decades of displacement and colonial occupation and ceaseless suffering, to live like other peoples of the earth, free in a sovereign and independent homeland.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I would like to inform you that, before delivering this statement, I submitted, in my capacity as the President of the State of Palestine and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, to H.E. Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, an application for the admission of Palestine on the basis of the 4 June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, as a full member of the United Nations.
I call upon Mr. Secretary-General to expedite transmittal of our request to the Security Council, and I call upon the distinguished members of the Security Council to vote in favor of our full membership. I also call upon the States that did not recognized the State of Palestine as yet to do so.
Excellencies,Ladies and Gentlemen,
The support of the countries of the world for our endeavor is a victory for truth,freedom, justice, law and international legitimacy, and it provides tremendous support for the peace option and enhances the chances of success of the negotiations.
Excellencies,Ladies and Gentlemen,
Your support for the establishment of the State of Palestine and for its admission to the United Nations as a full member is the greatest contribution to peacemaking in the Holy Land.
I thank you.

<title>Gaza-bound / From Aborigine to Palestinian rights </title>
<date>Wed Jun 29 02:59:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
GREECE - This is not the first time that Sylvia Hale, 69, has been asked why she is so active for the Palestinian cause. What about the discrimination against the Aborigines in her own country, Australia, for example?
Hale, a former Green Party parliamentarian who is still active in the party, immediately responded: "Undoubtedly, Australia has a very racist history. Aborigines were give the right to vote only in 1967. But whoever asks us 'what about the Aborigines,' are not the ones who are interested in their rights, and not the ones fighting for those rights. They are using this as a diversionary tactic for evading the debate over Israel's policy, or to delegitimize criticism of Israel."
And yes, for anyone who is interested: She was and remains involved in other struggles. She has rallied against the initiative to limit the rights of the Aborigines, fought the discriminatory attitude toward refugees in Australia and opposed the policy of stopping boat refugees.
Prior to entering parliament, she hid two refugees in her home so that they would not be arrested.
This week Hale and three of her compatriots will climb on board the Tahrir, the Canadian ship that is participating in the flotilla to the Gaza Strip. She and her Australian colleagues traveled the greatest distance of all the participants. Their flight lasted 48 hours, including the stops in various airports.
Hale and her friend, Vivienne Porzsolt, also 69, give the impression of being typical Western tourists, middle class, middle aged, staying at the hotel where the passengers of the Tahrir have gathered.
In Greece there is a general strike, demonstrations and tear gas in Athens, but the tourists are oblivious: They walk around and catch the rays. Perhaps the tourists wonder who these people are, as they go from one meeting to another, from the dining room to the lobby, and then to the corner where the Internet is available. These tourists have not caught any sunshine during the past five days.
Porzsolt has also been involved in social struggles in New Zealand, where she was born, and in Australia, where she now lives. In her CV of activism she includes protesting against the war in Vietnam, and apartheid in South Africa, and involvement in the feminist movement.
Activism against Israel's occupation is a given for Porzsolt, as it is for Hale. From this point of view they are characteristic of most of the voyagers on the Tahrir, and especially those aged 40 and up. Social and political activists for many years, for whom this sort of activity is as natural as going to work or establishing a family. For the two of them, activism for Palestinian rights is part of a general outlook they hold as Western citizens, with the privileges that this gives them.
But Porzsolt's involvement also stems directly from being Jewish, she says. "My activism against the Israeli occupation is linked to my Jewish-secular background, the values of equality and morality in the home of my parents [who were] natives of Prague who managed to escape from it immediately following the Nazi occupation in March, 1939. During the 1990s the Jewish element in my life became stronger and I became more interested in the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Because Israel considers itself the country that represents all the Jews of the world, my participation in this voyage is my way of declaring that Israel is not acting on my behalf."
"There are situations a person cannot avoid being aware of and cannot pretend they do not exist. And this is the case of the situation in Gaza," Hale says.
She visited the Gaza Strip with a delegation of Australian unions. The pictures of the children at the hospital at Khan Yunis, full of bombings and tanks, continue to haunt her and remind her of her granddaughter.
"We went to see the tunnels and the airport. It had already been completely destroyed. I saw people with carts with donkeys, going through the rubble to find construction materials. The next day I read that the army had fired into that area. What is especially shocking in this situation is that lack of proportionality in the means Israel is utilizing, and the collective punishment that it regularly applies."
Porzsolt visited the Gaza Strip more than a decade ago. She visited Israel and the West Bank several times, and participated in demonstrations at Sheikh Jarrah  (in East Jerusalem )and Bili'in  (in the West Bank ). "In my visit to Israel I discovered that the Israeli and Palestinian movements against the occupation are weak and need outside support,' she said.
What troubled her most is the extreme situation in Gaza, "an enormous prison under the sky. The strong sense that there is something wrong in every sense of the word."
During the past year they worked to raise $50,000 for the purchase of Tahrir and to fund the flotilla. The fund raising in Australia was a good way to raise awareness of the blockade on Gaza, they say.
But they are not deluding themselves about the speed with which changes occur. The struggle against "White Australia," the policy which limited the immigration of non-Whites to the continent, and which lasted some 70 years before being canceled in 1973.

<title>Gaza flotilla activists: Queers welcome aboard aid ships </title>
<date>Thu Jun 30 15:59:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
John Greyson, a Canadian film director and Gaza flotilla activist told Haaretz in an interview that homosexuality is not a barrier to participating in the upcoming voyage, and in fact he and other flotilla participants have created an “unofficial queer caucus” on board the ship.
Greyson’s remarks come in light of a recent YouTube video in which a man related to viewers that Gaza flotilla organizers told him that he could not take part in the mission because he is a homosexual.
The video, nearly three minutes long, featured a young man who called himself Marc and claimed to be a gay and human rights activist. The man recounted a story in which he asked the organizers of the upcoming Gaza flotilla to join their mission, and claimed that his request was allegedly denied on the grounds that participation of the gay and lesbian group with which he was affiliated would not serve the flotilla’s “interests”.
Greyson, a 51-year-old Canadian who is gay and has directed many films about queer life, said he was shocked when he heard about the video. “At first I laughed, then I got mad, and then laughed again,” Greyson told Haaretz on board the “Tahrir” ship on Tuesday.
The Canadian director related how not only is he part of what he calls an “unofficial queer caucus” aboard the Tahrir, but every boat participating in the upcoming flotilla has queers.“This is common sense and human nature,” Greyson said, adding “who knows, maybe when we get back there will be more queers.”
“One of the hats that I wear on this boat is 'queers against Israeli apartheid,'" the Canadian director said. He continued, saying that they have also work with Palestinian homosexuals who have not yet come out entirely.
When asked about the possible validity of the YouTube video, which reports have revealed to be linked to the Prime Minister’s office, a report that it has neither confirmed nor denied, Greyson told Haaretz that it “is another ridiculously transparent attempt to vilify the flotilla.”
Greyson, teaches film at York University in Toronto. In 2009 he canceled a screening of his documentary “Covered” at the Toronto International Film Festival as a protest against the screening of a series of movies about Tel Aviv marking the city’s centennial.

<title>Goldstone: Israel is not an 'apartheid state'</title>
<date>Tue Nov 01 13:04:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Judge Richard Goldstone, who led the UN investigative commission into Israel and Hamas’ conduct during Israel’s Operation Cast Lead, defended Israel against charges of being an “apartheid state” in a New York Times op-ed published Tuesday.
Goldstone, who was harshly criticized for his scathing report which determined that Israel and Hamas committed war crimes during the 2008 operation, states that the apartheid designation is used to describe the situation of pre-1994 South Africa, in which blacks could not vote, hold political office, use “white” toilets or beaches, marry whites, live in whites-only areas or even be there without a “pass.” Applying such the term to Israel is “unfair and inaccurate slander”, and is used to “retard rather than advance peace negotiations.”
The piece also states that nothing in Israel “comes close to the definition of apartheid” according to the 1998 Rome Statute, which defines apartheid as “Inhumane acts ... committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime.” According to Goldstone, Israeli Arabs have the right to vote, have representation in the Knesset, and are subject to equal treatment in hospitals.
Goldstone also stated that the situation of Palestinians in the West Bank is “more complex”, yet rejected the claim that the separation barrier was built to “stop unrelenting terrorist attacks” rather than with an intention to discriminate, and that road blocks in the West Bank “get more intrusive after violent attacks and are ameliorated when the threat is reduced.”

<title>Goldstone rebuffs claims of 'Israeli apartheid' </title>
<date>Wed Nov 02 00:51:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Accusations that Israel is an apartheid state are false, malicious and do not promote peace, in the view of Richard Goldstone, a retired South African and international judge and author of a report into Israel's 2008-09 operation in the Gaza Strip.
"While 'apartheid' can have broader meaning, its use is meant to evoke the situation in pre-1994 South Africa. It is an unfair and inaccurate slander against Israel, calculated to retard rather than advance peace negotiations," Goldstone wrote in an opinion piece published in Tuesday's New York Times.
Goldstone, who served as a judge in apartheid-era South Africa and whose fact-finding report on the Gaza fighting accused Israel and Hamas of committing war crimes, wrote that although there was de-facto separation between Jews and Arabs in Israel, "it is not apartheid, which consciously enshrines separation as an ideal."
He said that while the situation in the occupied West Bank was "more complex," there was "no intent to maintain an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group."

<title>'Goldstone retraction affected by misuse of Gaza report findings'</title>
<date>Wed Apr 20 04:42:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
	A New York Times article Tuesday claimed Richard Goldstone's apparent retraction of at least some of the war crime allegations leveled against Israel came as a result of his realization that his Gaza war report was used not to advance peace but to attack Israel on the international stage.
	Speaking with several of the South African former jurist's friends, and citing some of his recent remarks, the article contends that the Washington Post op-ed, in which Goldstone said claims that Israel intentionally targeted civilians during Operation Cast Lead should be reconsidered, was the result of an ongoing process.
	Maurice Ostroff, a retired South African engineer and resident of Israel, told the New York times Goldstone was "upset by the misuse of those who accused Israel of being an apartheid state,” adding that "mostly, as new information came out, he shifted his thinking.”
	The new information Ostroff may have referred to was the product of several internal Israel Defense Forces investigations that came in the wake of both the Gaza war and the Goldstone report, information which led the former South African jurist to reconsider some of the war-crime claims he had leveled against Israel.
	Writing in the Washington Post article published earlier this month, Goldstone wrote: "We know a lot more today about what happened in the Gaza war of 2008-09 than we did when I chaired the fact-finding mission appointed by the UN Human Rights Council that produced what has come to be known as the Goldstone Report."
	He then continued, saying "if I had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report would have been a different document."
	Goldstone was also reportedly affected by both Israel's scathing response to the report, as well as the fact that the report's findings that were used by anti-Israel groups worldwide, the New York Times articles said.
	Speaking with the New York Times, Aryeh Neier, president of the Open Society Foundation and a long-time acquaintance of Goldstone, said the South African jurist was "extremely hurt by the reaction to the report."
	"I think he was extremely uncomfortable in providing some fodder to people who were looking for anything they could use against Israel," he added.
	The article also claimed that at least part of Goldstone's reconsideration of his Gaza war report was the result of his original intentions, which were, according to those who know him, not to damn Israel but to allow it an opportunity to explain itself on the international stage, and perhaps even work toward reconciliation in the region.
	However, that intention did not translate into the outcome Goldstone anticipated, the article stated, seen by both Israel's shunning of the report and the fact-finding mission who authored it, leading to the report's lopsided findings.

<title>Hamas distances itself from Palestinian statehood bid at UN</title>
<date>Mon Sep 12 19:39:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
The Palestinian Authority's push to achieve recognition of an independent Palestinian state in the United Nations has nothing to do with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, Hamas officials said on Monday, adding that the campaign was launched without consulting Hamas leaders.
Speaking to the Palestinian Ma'an news agency on Monday, the leaders of several Palestinian factions voiced differing opinions on the Palestinian statehood bid at the UN, with both Hamas and Islamic Jihad representatives distancing themselves from the planned vote.
Hamas Gaza strongman Mahmoud Zahar told the Palestinian news agency that the UN push did not represent the Hamas-ruled Strip, saying that no one "asked the people in Gaza to take to the streets showing solidarity with the so-called September bid."
"If the Palestinian Authority calls for that, we will oppose it because they detain people in the West Bank. How can I give them the right to demonstrate in Gaza, while they do not give us that right in the West Bank?" Zahar asked.
Another Hamas official, Mushir al-Masri, called the bid that an "individual step taken by [Palestinian] President [Mahmoud] Abbas without consulting any faction."
Last month, senior Fatah officials claimed that Abbas had chosen to cool off his recently signed unity deal with Hamas, citing Western opposition to the surprise turn in the factions' long-standing feud.
"President Abbas was surprised by the international opposition to the reconciliation with Hamas, so he decided to slow down at least until September," the Palestinian official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss official policy.
"Now, with all efforts focused on September, we want all voices to be with us," he said. "We are not giving the Americans or anyone else a reason to shun us because of the reconciliation or anything else."
The unity deal was struck in May after Palestinian youth, inspired by the revolts against entrenched Arab autocracies, took to the streets calling for unification of the dueling governments in the West Bank and Gaza.
Another dissenting voice to the PA's campaign speaking with Ma'an on Monday came from Islamic Jihad spokesman Dawood Shihab, who said the "move needs to be studied to make sure it will not ignore major issues such as the right of return, and the future of the Palestine Liberation Organization as a umbrella for the whole Palestinian people."
However, other Palestinian factions, such as The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and The Palestinian National Initiative, supported the PA-led move, saying it was the last chance for Palestinians to reach statehood with the failure of peace talks with Israel.
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine has announced its support for the UN campaign.
"We support the Palestinian leadership's plan to go to the UN because that is a natural right of the Palestinians and part of the political battle against Israeli occupation," Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine strongman Kayid al-Ghoul told Ma'an.
Al-Ghoul also said that he felt the UN statehood bid would mark the end of peace talks with Israel, instead urging the formation of an international Mideast peace process conference.
"Regardless of the outcome, this step should be part of the political battle we fight against occupation. It will also be an opportunity to enlarge the circle of solidarity with the Palestinian people's rights, and to expose Israel's policies and the supportive US policy,” al-Ghoul told Ma'an.
Mustafa Barghouti, leader of The Palestinian National Initiative called the UN push "the last option for two states," adding that the"time has come for an alternative. There is no space or place for talks."
"We won't be slaves to apartheid for the rest of our lives," Barghouti added, saying,  "If South Sudan could get statehood in 48 hours, then Palestinians should get it."

<title>Helen Thomas to address anti-Israel protests during Netanyahu's visit to U.S.</title>
<date>Sun Apr 17 00:50:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
WASHINGTON - A series of protests against Israeli policy and its support by AIPAC are planned in May to coincide with the AIPAC conference in the U.S. capital and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech there. The protests, under the heading "Move over AIPAC," will include demonstrations opposite the building where Netanyahu will speak and Congress, and a series of lectures and meetings with critics of Israel, including veteran journalist Helen Thomas who lost her place in the White House press room after saying Jews should leave Palestine and go back to Poland, Germany and the United States. Thomas will give the keynote address at the Move Over AIPAC conference, and will receive an award from the women's pacifist organization Code Pink, one of the hundred left-wing American organizations behind the conference.
On Friday night, a favorite cafe among progressives, Busboys and Poets, gathered letters to Gazans; the next aid flotilla in May will deliver the messages to the Gaza residents. A separate room in the cafe hosted a meeting of around 250 activists with Omar Barghouti, founder of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign. Barghouti, who recently released a book on BDS, was winding up a book tour that included Columbia, Harvard, Brandeis and other universities.
The evening began with a moment of silence for actor Juliano Mer-Khamis, murdered earlier this month in Jenin, and Italian journalist Vittorio Arrigoni, murdered in recent days in Gaza. Barghouti then quoted U.S. President Barack Obama's justification for the NATO attacks on Muammar Gadhafi's forces in Libya.
"Innocent people were targeted for killing. Hospitals and ambulances were attacked. Supplies of food and fuel were choked off. Water for hundreds of thousands of people was shut off. Cities and towns were shelled, mosques were destroyed and apartment buildings reduced to rubble," Barghouti said, reading out a statement.
"This is about Libya, but you would say the same logic should be applied to Gaza. Unfortunately, it is not. Revolutions are shaking the Middle East, and one big loser is Israel. As Arab governments become more democratic they will reflect peoples' opinions, which are very much opposed to the Israeli apartheid."
"Some people say BDS is not fair and not effective - Israel is a democracy. On almost every level, Israel is only a democracy for one ethnic group. The Palestinian-led BDS movement is calling Israel an apartheid state, and the main refutation of this is that Israel allows Palestinians to vote," Barghouti said.
"Apartheid is not defined according to whims of this or that scholar. Apartheid is when the discrimination is legalized. Now there are commissions to accept new residents into communities. Imagine an Irish white guy saying: 'We don't accept this Latino guy, his food smells funny, he doesn't fit.' But in Israel now it's legal."
"I think calling Israel a fascist state is an exaggeration, but there are fascist tendencies. When they get mad, Liberal Zionists tend to exaggerate," he added. "Israel is losing the battle for hearts and minds at the grassroots level. It maintains connections with the elite, but competes with Iran and North Korea as the most hated countries in the world."
Barghouti said it was impossible to predict what the Israelis would do in response to the next flotilla, saying they continue to shoot themselves in the foot, but highlighting Israel's reactions only helps raise awareness of the siege on Gaza. After the event, Barghouti recommended everyone, including Zionists, to read his book, but declined to be interviewed by Haaretz. "We're being very careful about giving interviews to the Israeli media," he said.

<title>Hollywood stars visit Israel and PA to learn about Mideast conflict</title>
<date>Thu Nov 17 01:25:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Two delegations from Hollywood are visiting Israel to learn about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one comprised of actors and another mainly featuring directors.
Today, both groups will meet with President Shimon Peres. The actors' delegation is also slated to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the coming days, after having met with Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad on Tuesday.
Both groups are here as guests of the Jewish Federation's Tel Aviv/Los Angeles Partnership, The Creative Coalition and the AIPAC-affiliated American Israel Education Foundation.
The actors' delegation, headed by Tim Daley, has 21 members, including Emmy award winner Joe Pantoliano  ("The Sopranos" ), Andrea Bowen  ("Desperate Housewives" ), Steven Weber  ("Brothers and Sisters" ) and Giancarlo Esposito  ("Once Upon a Time" ). The directors' delegation also includes scriptwriters and senior studio executives, inter alia, Marta Kauffman, one of the creators of "Friends," and Nina Tassler, who heads the CBS television network's entertainment division.
Last night, the actors held a press conference at the Dan Hotel in Tel Aviv in which they detailed their itinerary, which includes visits to Sderot and Ramallah, a tour of the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum and a visit to an absorption center for Ethiopian immigrants. Actress Patricia Arquette  ("Medium" ) said the goal of the trip was to learn about the "nuances" of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Actor Richard Schiff  ("The West Wing" ) added that when they return to the United States, they plan to share what they have learned with their friends and others.
Actor Rob Morrow  ("Northern Exposure" ) related that Fayyad had spoken of peace and reconciliation with Israel, but shortly after they left the meeting, they heard that Fatah and Hamas had agreed to form a unity government. That, he said, made them realize how fluid the situation here is.
Delegation members also said they were surprised to see how short a distance separates Jerusalem and Ramallah and likewise Sderot and the Gaza Strip.
CCH Pounder  ("Avatar" ) was the only member of the group who said she encountered opposition to her visit here - in her case, from South African friends. Schiff, for his part, was upset upon leaving the hotel to encounter a small group of demonstrators holding signs telling the actors they should be ashamed of themselves and denouncing Israel's "apartheid" policies.

<title>Israel can no longer pretend there's no Mideast conflict</title>
<date>Sun Mar 13 02:11:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
The murder of the Fogel family brought to an end the lull Israel has enjoyed over the past two years. Palestinian terrorism struck again, in the most sensitive spot of the West Bank: the mother of all isolated settlements, on a ridge over Nablus, its radical inhabitants infamous for their violent relations with their Palestinian neighbors. No spot is more emblematic of the conflict and friction in the territories than Itamar.
Whoever planned and carried out the attack sought to shake up the status quo, which has been working for Israel. The quiet allowed Israelis on both sides of the Green Line to live prosperously and pretend there simply was no conflict. The Palestinians and the settlers were perceived by Israelis as public-relations issues, nuisances in the relations with the United States and Europe, not key problems that needed to be taken care of. All this has changed.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  on Saturday tried using the murders as leverage to ease international  pressure on Israel. He accused the Palestinian Authority of incitement and the international community of hypocrisy, but his comments got nearly zero attention in a world consumed by the tsunami in Japan, the civil war in Libya and the skyrocketing oil prices.
Netanyahu seeks to isolate the attack and prevent it from igniting a third intifada, but his mission looks impossible. He is facing strong forces striving toward conflict. In many countries in the West, activists are holding Israel Apartheid Week, while calls are spreading on Facebook for mass protests in the territories and in front of Israeli embassies across the world this Tuesday. The organizers are trying to imitate the uprisings in the Arab world in recent months, and if they succeed, they are likely to encounter a much stronger Israeli response than they expect.
An attack on a settlement, especially Itamar, always invokes the fear of revenge attacks by settlers against Palestinians. The Israel Defense Forces would need to redouble its efforts to keep these sides apart.
But settlers and their supporters in government also have political goals. They will try to use the murders to minimize the stature of Defense Minister Ehud Barak, to force Netanyahu to renew construction in the bigger settlements, and to prevent the planned evacuation of illegal outposts. A degree of restraint by the settlers and the forgoing of blatant "price tag" attacks would help the government back their demands. Netanyahu has asked them to come down, but such requests come at a price.
The security coordination between Israel and the PA, which contributed much to the relative calm of recent years, is now in a crisis. Netanyahu accused the PA of incitement to the murder, while Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas refrained from condemning the attack as strongly as Netanyahu wanted him to.
In an atmosphere of mistrust and accusations at the top, the forces in the field will find it hard to trust each other. All these forces are pushing for a return to the violent conflict in the territories, with the international community busy elsewhere and indisposed to calm the situation down.

<title>Israel given one week to reply to petition against segregation at ultra-Orthodox schools</title>
<date>Fri Dec 09 01:40:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
The High Court of Justice Thursday instructed Education Minister Gideon Sa'ar, the Education Ministry and mayors of Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, Modi'in Ilit and Betar Ilit to reply in a week to a petition demanding an end to quotas restricting Sephardi girls' admission to state-funded ultra-Orthodox girls high schools.
The petitioners, Noar Kahalacha organization and social activist Yoav Laloum, sought to stop the "apartheid-like" ethnic segregation at ultra-Orthodox girls high schools. They also asked the court to issue an interim injunction forbidding the schools to start registration for the next school year until the court hears the petition.
The petitioners, who headed the fight against ethnic segregation at the Beit Yaakov school in the West Bank settlement Immanuel in 2008, are also demanding to revoke the licenses and state funding of all the schools that discriminate against Sephardi girls.
Justice Edna Arbel said in her ruling yesterday the court will hear the petition soon.
MK Chaim Amsellem  (Shas ) commended the petition. "The Education Ministry is collaborating with the schools' principals and Haredi parties to silence the problem and perpetuate the discrimination. Shas, which was formed to uproot this problem, does nothing...its leaders are afraid their children will be taken out of the Ashkenazi schools," he said.
Shas chairman MK Eli Yishai said "Shas acted and is acting to establish more high schools and other schools. Only this week the Knesset held a debate we initiated on a proposal to prevent discrimination in schools."
"The main problem is not the state funding but the moral turpitude this discriminative policy brands our society with," said prominent educator and public figure Rabbi Shai Piron, Director-General of Hakol Hinuch, the Movement for the Advancement of Education in Israel.

<title>Israeli students fly to South Africa to improve their country's image </title>
<date>Tue Jul 12 02:34:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
One of Israel's most serious image problems is how it is perceived on campuses around the world. Now, a group of 27 Israeli students are planning to tackle the issue head-on, funding their own trips to South African universities.
As part of the project, 150 students will be sent abroad in five delegations over the next six months.
The students receive no governmental aid, and are paying for the trip on their own and through contributions. As part of their fund-raising efforts, they will be holding a party in Tel Aviv next week.
On the first trip, scheduled to depart August 11, the participants will spend 10 days visiting universities in Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town and try to convince students there that Israel is not an apartheid state.
Pro-Palestinian activities are held almost daily on these campuses. The University of Johannesburg, a major focus of the trip, launched an academic boycott of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev a few months ago.
The trips are a private initiative by the students, said Roy Wolff, one of the organizers of the group, called What Is REAL. "We all agreed that we were willing to spend $1,000 each, the cost of travel, and hoped we could raise money to cover expenses."
Why take part in such a delegation?
"I can stay home and cry about Israel's lack of [positive] publicity, or I can get out of my chair, take my money and do something. If within six months we manage to send 150 people on five delegations, we can influence 5,000 students. In two months we have trained 27 students for the educational missions. There is no doubt that this is just a drop in the ocean. However, we could manage to influence a student who goes on to become Britain's prime minister."
The participants do not share an ideology. Its members include Wolff, a parliamentary aide to MK Arieh Eldad  (National Union ); and Lior Finkel, aide to MK Ilan Gilon  (Meretz ).
"We all agree that Israel is a Jewish and democratic state, and we all agree that Israel is not an apartheid state. This is what we want to show the students on campus," Wolff said.
Finkel said, "To me, [the trip] will be a success if I can sit with people and explain Israel's side, and if they are willing to listen to me. The delegation will create the most basic kind of human interaction: I meet people my age, who are exactly like me, and who don't always feel like hearing about Israel."
How important are the group's activities?
"Most people on campus don't really care," Wolff says. "But the fact that they hear slogans about Israel being an apartheid state every day means that this is the only thing they know about Israel. We have to create some doubt in their minds."
Talia Dekel, another group member, explains that the organizers prefer not to take government money so that they cannot be cast as official representatives.

<title>Israel Prize laureates join academic boycott of settlement university</title>
<date>Sun Jan 09 00:38:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Some 155 university and college faculty members have signed a petition calling for an academic boycott of the Ariel University Center.
In the petition, the lecturers state their "unwillingness to take part in any type of academic activity taking place in the college operating in the settlement of Ariel." Furthermore, the petition states that "Ariel is not part of the sovereign state of Israel, and therefore it is impossible to require us to appear there."
Among the signatories are three Israel Prize laureates - professors Yehoshua Kolodny of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Benjamin Isaac of Tel Aviv University and Itamar Procaccia of the Weizmann Institute of Science.
"We, academics from a variety of fields and from all the institutions of higher learning in Israel, herein express publicly our opposition to the continued occupation and the establishment of settlements," the petition states. "Ariel was built on occupied land. Only a few kilometers away from flourishing Ariel, Palestinians live in villages and refugee camps under unbearably harsh conditions and without basic human rights. Not only do they not have access to higher education, some do not even have running water. These are two different realities that create a policy of apartheid," the petition also says.
The signatories state that Ariel was an illegal settlement whose existence contravened international law and the Geneva Convention. "It was established for the sole purpose of preventing the Palestinians from creating an independent state and thus preventing us, citizens of Israel, from having the chance to ever live in peace in this region."
The petition was initiated and organized by Nir Gov of the Weizmann Institute's Department of Chemical Physics. Unlike other such initiatives, over a third of the list's signatories are from the natural and exact sciences.
Gov, who started organizing the petition a few weeks ago, said it was important to show that not only people known from other petitions support a boycott of Ariel, and therefore this petition has among its signatories many scholars who are not from the social sciences and the humanities.
"Israeli academia must differentiate itself from the 'settlement' academia," said Gov. "Only significant differentiation can help our supporters abroad who are working against an academic boycott of Israel. This assistance is important, but all in all it is secondary to the principled stand that the goal of the establishment of the college at Ariel was not teaching and academic research, but political. It may be too late, but we felt a need to state in the clearest language that Israeli academia must not be involved in the settlement project," Gov also said.
Gov said he encountered some colleagues who agreed with the message of the petition but were afraid to sign. He said such fear, "in the current atmosphere, is understandable, tangible. Even if there is no official action against the signatories, we may pay some sort of price."
About three weeks ago, the Council For Higher Education issued a public statement against calls by Israeli academics for an academic boycott of Israel. The council, which is headed by Education Minister Gideon Sa'ar, said such calls "undermine the foundations of the higher education system."
However, Gov said there is no contradiction between the council's statement and the petition. "The council says rightly that there is a danger of delegitimization of the academic system in Israel. We say the source of this danger is Ariel and the settlements."
Yigal Cohen-Orgad, chairman of the Ariel college's executive committee, said: "A tiny and bizarre minority of some 150 lecturers is behind the petition, out of 7,000 faculty members. The cooperation between the Ariel University Center and many hundreds of scholars from universities in Israel and many hundreds more from 40 universities abroad, is the response to this petition. We know the heads of the universities oppose the call for a boycott and all it entails. I am sure that academia will continue to cooperate with us."

<title>Israel UN envoy slams Falk over accusation of 'ethnic cleansing' </title>
<date>Mon Mar 21 22:46:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Israel's United Nations Envoy Aharon Leshno Yaar called Richard Falk an "embarrassment to the United Nations," after the academic charged Israel with ethnic cleansing on Monday.
Falk, who is also an investigator for the UN, said earlier in the day that Israel's expansion of settlements in East Jerusalem and eviction of Palestinians from their homes is a form of ethnic cleansing.
Speaking to Haaretz, Leshno Yaar said Falk is the man who "claims that it is unclear who stands behind the terror attacks of 9/11 and calls IDF soldiers Nazis."
Falk has been admonished in the past by UN Secretary General Ben Ki-moon for comments that he made about the 9/11 terror attacks.
"Israel doesn’t participate with Falk," Leshno Yaar said, adding that he leaves the room when he speaks.
Falk made the comments while speaking to the UN Human Rights Council as it prepared to pass resolutions condemning settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
The "continued pattern of settlement expansion in East Jerusalem combined with the forcible eviction of long-residing Palestinians are creating an intolerable situation" in the part of the city previously controlled by Jordan, he said.
This situation "can only be described in its cumulative impact as a form of ethnic cleansing," Falk declared.
In his speech, Falk said he would like the Human Rights Council to ask the International Court of Justice to look at Israeli behavior in the occupied territories.
This should focus on whether the prolonged occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem had elements of "colonialism, apartheid and ethnic cleansing inconsistent with international humanitarian law," the investigator declared.

<title>Jerusalem & Babylon / The new ally from within</title>
<date>Fri May 13 01:45:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Israel’s new ambassador to the United Kingdom − should Avigdor Lieberman ever get round to appointing one − will face an interesting dilemma after settling down in Thackeray’s old study in the elegant house on Palace Green. What is to be done about Yachad? It’s the British “Pro Israel, Pro Peace” organization that was officially launched yesterday.
It can be described as the British version of J Street, three-year-old American political lobby operating under the double-pro banner; J Street calls on both the American administration and the Israeli government to act more decisively for a two-state solution and encourages American Jews not to instinctively support the right-wing policies of the Israeli government.
And thus incurs the wrath of much of the local Jewish establishment.
The embassy in Washington, anxious not to seem out of step with the Jewish leadership, especially as J Street was almost immediately perceived as a rival to AIPAC, described some of J Street’s actions as “worrying,” and Ambassador Michael Oren snubbed an invite to its first national conference. In December 2009, he tried to ostracize J Street further, describing it as “a unique problem in that it not only opposes one policy of one Israeli government, it opposes all policies of all Israeli governments. It’s significantly out of the mainstream.”
Eventually, Oren had no choice but to meet with J Street’s leaders and agree on “ground rules” for engagement between the organization and Israel’s government. He had no choice. J Street quickly gained influential backers, thousands of supporters among the rank and file of Jewish America and − perhaps more significantly − was endorsed by the Obama White House, which made a point of inviting J Street to briefings of Jewish leaders.
Will Ron Prossor’s successor in London draw lessons from Oren’s embarrassing retreat and not pick a fight? It depends somewhat on the new ambassador’s political masters in Jerusalem. Lieberman and his deputy, Danny Ayalon, will certainly not warm to Yachad’s message, but I doubt either of them cares much about what Britain’s Jews have to say, so it will probably be the ambassador’s call.
Yachad at its launch made one significant decision that will make it more palatable to official Israel. Unlike J Street, it will concern itself mainly with working within the Jewish community, and not act as a political lobby in parliament and government circles. The new movement will try and educate British Jews on the reality of Israel and the region and serve as an outlet for those who hold its views and have not find a voice in existing organizations. Will this be enough to evade the inevitable “fifth columnist” slurs that will be hurled from the right wing?
Yachad’s backers take comfort in last year’s survey by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research that found that 78 percent of British Jews are in favor of achieving peace through a two-state solution; 74 percent are against expanding the settlements in the West Bank; and 67 percent are in favor of trading land for peace. If that’s not enough, 52 percent are apparently for negotiating with Hamas; in terms of Israel’s political spectrum that puts them to the left of Meretz. When the survey came out, I had reservations on its methodology and I still do, but the survey lends credence to Yachad’s claim that it represents the mainstream.
However, even if its views represent the majority, it is a largely silent one. The more voluble Jewish voices still tend to adhere to the policies of the Israeli government of the day, and those who do express critical views are often died-in-the-wool activists or card-carrying pro-Palestinian people who, for most of the community, are beyond the pale.
I think it’s safe to predict that Yachad’s launch and acceptance into the Jewish landscape in Britain will be relatively smooth, without much of the strife that accompanied J Street’s trajectory. It obviously has a place, and the communal discourse there tends to be more polite than in America. Will it achieve anything?
If the IJPR survey is to be trusted, most British Jews already hold Yachad’s views, and those who don’t are firmly entrenched on either the far right or the far left. By articulating that position, Yachad may help to engage a young generation who feels estranged from the Jewish establishment. That is one of the movement’s main aims and is certainly a worthy cause. What wider effect can Yachad have? For now, Yachad is not trying to influence British foreign policy; after all, successive Labor and Tory governments have firmly supported the two-state solution. Could it influence the Israeli public? Slim chance.
As I have often observed in this column, Israelis don’t care much about what their brothers overseas have to say, especially not criticism. Six months ago, one of the most senior British Jewish leaders, Mick Davis, chairman of both the UJIA and the Jewish Leadership Council, caused an uproar in London when he said at a public gathering that if Israel continues with its current policies, it risks becoming a “de facto apartheid state.” It did not cause even a stir in Israel. The Hebrew-language press barely reported his words on its back pages, no senior politician or significant columnist thought they warranted mention. The only responses I received from various spokespeople asked: “Mick who?”
British Jews hate to face the facts; they are a second-league community. Not only the United States, but France, Canada and Russia all outrank Britain in terms of Jewish world influence. This diminished standing reflects the community’s shrinking size, but mainly Britain’s increasingly puny stature on the global stage. Britain is still a world-power in only one sphere, the media. British news networks − the BBC, Sky − and The Economist, The Guardian and the Times not only compete as equals with their American counterparts, but they take an inordinate interest in Israel and its conflicts, often leading international coverage. Here is the real minefield for Yachad. Hannah Weisfeld, Yachad’s director, and until fund-raising picks up, its sole employee, tells me that she believes the public “can absorb a more nuanced take on Israel.”
Well, maybe British Jews can, but how will she fare once the news programs begin calling?
Weisfeld and anyone else speaking under Yachad’s banner on the BBC will come under the community’s microscope and have to perform an impossible tight-rope act between self-hating Jew and “shill for Israel.” There will be many waiting for her to fall.

<title>Jordan FM: Refusal of two-state vision exposes Israel as 'apartheid' state </title>
<date>Wed Jan 12 19:25:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
	Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh said Wednesday that Israel's refusal of the two-state solution would expose it to the world as an "apartheid" country.
	"His Majesty the king (Abdullah II) has made it clear that if we fail to achieve the two-state solution, then the alternative will be that the world will have eventually to view Israel as a state that practices racial policies," Judeh said.
	The foreign minister was testifying before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the upper house of parliament on the latest developments of the deadlocked direct peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel, the official Petra news agency said.
	Judeh said that the recent recognition of the Palestinian state by Latin American countries "will put pressure on Israel and remind it that the world will not accept its unilateral actions" in Jerusalem and the West Bank.
	He expected "more states" to follow in the steps of Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay and Paraguay in recognizing a Palestinian state.
	Judeh warned that the failure to come up with a solution for the Palestine question in accordance with the Arab peace initiative "will have dire consequences in terms of escalating tension and instability."
	The Arab peace initiative offers Israel full recognition by all Arab states if it pulls out from all Arab territories it occupied during the Six-Day War in 1967, including East Jerusalem.

<title>Judge Goldstone defends role, but feels distressed </title>
<date>Mon Apr 04 00:42:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Judge Richard Goldstone told associates several months ago that ever since publication of his report on Operation Cast Lead in Gaza, he has been in great distress and under duress.
He complained that close friends kept away from him and some family members even had reservations about his cooperation with the UN Human Rights Council.
Last year, a Johannesburg synagogue initially said it would not allow him to take part in his grandson's bar mitzvah.
Goldstone told Haaretz's Akiva Eldar at the time that the bar mitzvah was an event of joy "after much aggravation," and added that he was very upset by the witch hunt and accusations against him. He was particularly offended by a Yedioth Ahronoth article about verdicts he handed down to black defendants during the apartheid era in his native South Africa.
He said at the time that despite the attacks on him in Jewish communities, he does not regret agreeing to chair the investigative committee.
"I felt that because I was Jewish, it would be hypocritical not to get involved in the Middle East," he told Eldar, explaining that he was a Zionist, but did not intend to visit Israel any time soon, for reasons of personal security. He also said he was saddened by what he saw as recent attacks on Israel's democracy, including bills banning criticism of the Israel Defense Forces.
Goldstone observed that Israel has trouble taking criticism, but said he still hopes the government will conduct an open inquiry of the events in Gaza, adding that the country has distinguished justices and reputable lawyers who can lead such an effort and put an end to the affair.

<title>Live blog: Glenn Beck's 'Restoring Courage' rally in East Jerusalem</title>
<date>Wed Aug 24 16:46:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
15:45: Welcome to the live blog of the Glenn Beck Restoring Courage: Courage to Stand. We will be bringing you minute by minute coverage of the 'renegade' commentator's final event in his supportarama roadshow in Israel. The evening's glittering guests tonight apparently include Israeli singer Dudu Fisher, MK Danny Danon and Angelina Jolie's dad.
With half an hour to go, the sun is shining and the faithful are gathering in the Old City of Jerusalem.
Overheard in the warm-up act: “Israel has the right to protect its God-given land.” Glad we've got that cleared up.
16:52: MK Danny Danon has just graced the press pen with his presence: I support democracies everywhere, in Cairo and in Libya and Iran. I hope that one day we will see more democracies in the Middle East, but unfortunately I don't see that happening soon.16:53: Seven minutes to go, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin is back. Presumably to thank the mainly Christian crowd again for loving us despite our "otherness".
16:59: A rendition of what sounds like Careless Whisper arranged by Kenny G. Is this the play-on music for the man himself?
17:00: No, it's just the Jerusalem Great Synagogue Choir.17:04: And now, please be standing for the Israeli national anthem, Hatikva. 
17:06: And now, please be standing for the mayor of Jerusalem, Mayor Nir Barkat.
17:08: Overheard: Danny Danon talking to an international news  organization: We are very proud to have such committed friends coming  from all around the world to support Israel unconditionally. Ah.
Barkat: "Our present is also our past here today in Jerusalem." Not when it comes to rent prices it isn't.
17:15: Barkat: "Jerusalem is our destiny, and  we will not derail from our vision... building united, undivided  Jerusalem, there is room in Jerusalem for everyone... for Christians,  Muslims and Jews alike." I'm not sure he ran his speech by the event  organizers.
Barkat: "Tell people what you saw, tell people what you felt." In other words: TESTIFY!
My name is Nir Barkat. You've been a great audience. Try the chicken.
17:20: And now a musical interlude.  Apparently, Jerusalem is where man first walked the earth. "We always  come back to God, and we always come back to Jerusalem."
17:23: Heeeeeeeere's Glenn. It took a minute from the cheap seats at the  back to realise that the narrator of the history of the world currently  underway, to acoustic guitar/church bells/Hollywood trailer muzak, is the man himself.
He's lost the bum-fluff beard.
There are people here from Pakistan and Qatar? Cool.
17:33: Applause, music.
17:37: And now Matt Staber from something something to present the Restoring Courage awards. No James Franco and Catwoman?
17:42: The first award is given to the Fogel family. This would be funny if it weren't so terrible.
17:47: The next award goes to Maxim, the Jewish-Arab restaurant in Haifa devastated by a suicide bombing in 2003. 
17:48: The final award goes to supermarket magnate Rami Levy for his charity.
17:51: We've done a quick rough headcount.  There are many empty seats. Glenn is still talking. "What one generation  tolerates, the next generation tolerates. The grand councils of earth  condemn Israel, while across the border Syria is slaughtering their own  people. So-called diplomats are afraid, they're cowards. They only condemn  Israel because it's convenient, not because they actually believe it."
17:55: "I stand here to tell you this today,  fear is the pathway to surrender. To overcome fear we just need one  thing: Courage. Truth and courage." Er, that's two things.
17:57: Glenn is in full throttle here. "The  plotters plot and the schemers scheme. Sadly even the Israelis I have  met, some of the most courageous people on earth are beginning to  believe the lies and doubt themselves. The only message I have for  Israel and Israelis is this: my friends, do not lose hope. You must not  lose confidence in yourselves. You must draw comfort from the knowledge  that you were led to this place from God.... God is not a stranger to  the children of Abraham."
17:58: "Israel is here because the God of Abraham keeps his covenants." What about Ben-Gurion, Truman and Balfour?
18:01: Glenn's beginning to open up about his past life as a non-believer. I think this is the bit where he cries.
18:03: Woah. In 1999, he listened to Osama  bin Laden, and knew that he would attack New York again. He also knew  the housing crash was coming. But it doesn't take a prophet to see these  things. For a minute I thought that was where he was going.
18:04: And he also knew that there would be more terror attacks on Israel, and last week, he was proved right. Lucky for him.

18:40: Wait! There's a closing prayer. "We pray for the peace of Jerusalem... we have abused our positions and show no love for others. We are here to say, Israel, the Holy Land, you are not alone...
Today  is a new day, we will not. May God bless Israel, may God bless the  Palestinian people, may God bless the United States of America. Amen."
That's all. The faithful are filing out to strains of the "Sabbath Prayer" song from Fiddler on the Roof. This is not a joke. 
Thanks for reading. You can hear more from  Glenn on his website, TV channel, radio show and newsletter, or buy his  coffee table book of his trip to Israel, already in the shops. And if  you're in South Africa or South America this week, you can also see him  live.
One last thing: Herman Cain is shaking hands with people as they leave the arena. Thank you for flying Air Beck.

<title>Macy Gray asks Facebook fans: Should I boycott Israel? </title>
<date>Wed Jan 19 22:31:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Pop star Macy Gray wrote on her official Facebook page on Wednesday that she was deliberating whether or not she should perform in February in Israel, as she had received dozens of letters urging her to boycott the country.
"I'm getting a lot of letters from activists urging/begging me to boycott by NOT performing in protest of Apartheid against the Palestinians," Macy Gray wrote on her Wall.
"What the Israeli government is doing to the Palestinians is disgusting, but I wana go. I gotta lotta fans there I dont want to cancel on and I ...don't know how my NOT going changes anything. What do you think? Stay or go?" she asked her fans.
Gray is scheduled to perform two shows in Tel Aviv this February.
The star's Faceboook comment was answered by over 1,000 comments, some of which urged her to indeed heed to the call to boycott Israel. Some people identifying themselves as Israelis told her in response that she was not welcome in the country in any event.
Gray has performed in Israel several times over the past few years and has always been greeted by enthusiastic fans.
Earlier this week, French singer Vanessa Paradi, the wife of Hollywood mega star Johnny Depp, canceled her planned performance in Israel due to what she called professional problems. However reports that she had received threats from pro-Palestinian groups suggested that she cancelled the show because she did not want to get involved and decided to terminate her visit.

<title>Netanyahu realizes he needs a welfare minister after all </title>
<date>Thu Jan 20 01:42:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Heeding the howls of protest from fighters for social equality, the press and the political sphere, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reversed his decision less than a day after announcing he would retain the welfare portfolio. He's giving it to Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon.
After advising his coalition colleagues yesterday, Netanyahu called Kahlon to seal the appointment. Outgoing welfare minister Isaac Herzog met with Kahlon yesterday.
"I am glad the prime minister decided to leave the welfare and social services portfolio in Likud hands," Kahlon commented. He said he was glad to undertake this "important mission."
The protest made it clear to Netanyahu and his people they'd made a mistake. They would have difficulty explaining how a bloated cabinet with more than 30 ministers, many without portfolio, would lack a full-time welfare minister.
Shas had wanted the portfolio, a demand Netanyahu ignored.
Kahlon is popular by virtue of his reforms lowering the prices of cellular communications.
Meanwhile, Netanyahu and his ministers met yesterday for 15 minutes to swear in the new cabinet, with the prime minister heaping praise on the members of the newborn Atzmaut, formed by ex-Labor head Ehud Barak. "[Yitzhak] Rabin used to say that sometimes an anti-nausea pill is handy," one minister quipped.
At midday Atzmaut announced that the minorities portfolio, earmarked for Matan Vilnai, would be given to Shalom Simhon, who also received the industry portfolio. Perhaps Netanyahu and his people realized that giving the minorities job to a Defense Ministry personality might taste of military rule.
Some Likud members were disappointed at being left out in the cold by Netanyahu's largesse with Atzmaut. Ayoob Kara  (deputy minister for the development of the Negev portfolio ), who embarrassed Israel by meeting with far rightists in Austria last month, boiled at not being upgraded. Kara, a Druze, has been saying the last few days that failing to give him a ministry would boost Israel's image as an apartheid state. Kara summoned about 20 Druze dignitaries to the Knesset, where they stormed Netanyahu's office yesterday, demanding the deputy minister receive a ministerial post. It worked, to a degree. Netanyahu promised that in three months he would consider a rotation, and Kara would not be left behind.
Orit Noked received the agriculture portfolio on the grounds, Netanyahu explained, that her appointment would strengthen female power in government.
New leader for Labor?
Meanwhile, over in Labor, the party that Ehud Barak suddenly abandoned this week, its eight remaining Knesset members not to choose a new chairman from among themselves to avert tensions inside the faction. The eight will choose an external candidate, to be voted on by the party central leadership. Meanwhile, the octet will function as the collective leadership of the party, they decided.
One name raised yesterday as a potential temporary chairman was Micha Harish, former Labor secretary general and MK.
Benjamin Ben-Eliezer said at the eight-way meeting that he does not want the job of acting chairman: "Relax, it won't happen," he told his colleagues. Some of them had indicated they didn't like the idea.

<title>Norway may recognize Palestinian state if peace process remains stalled</title>
<date>Thu Mar 03 02:32:00 IST 2011</date>

Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store told Haaretz Wednesday that his country would reevaluate its position on recognizing a Palestinian state if no progress is made in the peace process by September 2011.
Speaking from Jerusalem, where he is on a state visit, Gahr said Israel runs the risk of being seen internationally as a "permanent occupier" if the stalemate in the peace process continues. He said he was worried such a view would lead to a further delegitimization of Israel and would harm its security.
"I speak as a friend of Israel and Israel has many friends in Norway," Store said. "Europe is watching for results and initiatives toward a settlement of this conflict. The major challenge for Israel in this century is that it stands out as an occupier in breach of international law. This to me is a big challenge to the quality of Israel - which is to be a democracy and a player in the first division in the world. I think that in key European capitals the hope to see that change is thinner than it used to be."
In the last few months the Palestinian Authority has launched a diplomatic campaign around the world to muster support for a Palestinian state with UN recognition by September.
"Norway is recognizing facts and not visions," Store said. "I would like to be the first to recognize the state of Palestine when negotiations have been completed. I say so as long as there is a prospect for those negotiations. If it is clear to people that there is no such prospect we will have to reevaluate."
Store met yesterday with his Israeli counterpart Avigdor Lieberman and Prime Minister Netanyahu.
Disappointed by Lieberman 
He said he came out of the meeting with Lieberman very disappointed. "His message is clear: Forget it," Store said.
"His message is that GDP differences between Palestinians and Israelis is $3,000 to $30,000 so forget about peace. To me that is a message that there is no genuine wish to move forward. Because if you make this dependent on GDP ratios we are completely on a different calendar," he said, referring to Lieberman's claim that the gap between rich and poor would make peace impossible.
In his talks with Netanyahu, Store tried to convince him about the urgent need to present an Israeli diplomatic initiative. His main message was that "the occupation is the reason for the delegitimization against Israel."
"As long as there is credible progress toward a two-state solution the world would back that process," Store said. "Then, we will be in a kind of diplomatic state of emergency waiting for an agreement that would end this. If it becomes obvious even to the most optimistic that there is no prospect to this negotiations and that the two-state solution will depend on GDP somewhere down the road then the occupation will stand out in more brute terms. Then it will no longer be the image of something which is temporary, it is what Israel presents itself as the permanent occupier. That will raise discussions about the character of the one state solution with rights of minorities. This will be a nasty development."
Store said he is very carful not to use the term "apartheid state" when talking about Israel.
"I have never [used] this word," he said. "But increasingly more Israelis are doing so in the media, and politicians. I am quoting them. In such a situation you will have one state with people with different rights. You can label it however you want but in my opinion it does not correspond with the ideals of the Israeli democracy."

<title>Palestinian pride: Israel protests influenced by Arab world</title>
<date>Sat Aug 06 07:54:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Palestinian social leaders believe the social protests that have erupted throughout Israel are largely influenced by the Arab Spring, contending Israelis must realize they too are suffering due to the occupation and money spent on settlements in the West Bank.
Israelis are imitating the Arab world, and West Bank Palestinians believe this to be a good thing.  According to the Ma’an news agency, 14,032 (nearly 75%) of the 18,722 readers who responded to their online survey, believe that what is happening in Israel’s streets is influenced by and imitating the “Arab Spring”.
“Israel is inadvertantly  becoming a part of the Middle East,” said sociologist Honaida Ghanim, who researches Israeli society, adding that“this is the power of bottom-up activity, when the country’s ideologists aren’t consulted.”
Ghanim wasn’t surprised when the protests began. As an Israeli citizen, born in Marja and General Director of “MADAR” the Palestinian Forum for Israeli Studies, the sociologist is well acquainted with Israeli polarization. However, she is certain that the recent events in Egypt and Tunisia had a large impact on the Israeli protest movement.
Sufian Abu Zaida is a member of Fatah and former prisoner, who currently teaches about Israeli society in the Birzeit University and the Al-Quds Open University. He was born in Jabaliya, a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, to a family of refugees from the town Burayr (today Bror Hayil).
The Palestinian teacher promises to remind his students next year that “this might be the first thing Israelis learnt from Arabs. They have always presented themselves as the only positive ray of light in a pitch black Middle East. Suddenly there is something to learn from these retards."
Ghanim cited additional sociological factors as part of the impetus for change in Israel, saying "on the one hand, there is neo-liberalism and globalization that have resulted in an unacceptable gap between the wealth of the state and individuals and the harshness of life for the masses. On the other hand, these are similar tools – online social networks, with Facebook heading the list, which had a far-reaching effect on the media.”
Despite this, there isn’t much interest among the Palestinians in the protest occupying Israel for over three weeks. “We are a people in perpetual struggle with the government, three weeks of protest are not long enough to seriously catch our attention,” said Nariman al-Tamimi, from Nabi Salih, and Afaf Ghatasha, a feminist activist and member of the Palestinian People’s Party.
However, they are both impressed – as are other Palestinians –that the Israeli movement is geared toward improving the already high level standard of living in Israel in comparison to that of most Palestinians. Israelis are making “demands that are luxuries,” according to Ghatasha.
“I know something about the housing crisis,” said Tamimi, who was wrongfully placed under arrest for eight days a year and six months ago, for the attack of a policeman with a sharp object. She was eventually convicted of “obstructing a police officer in the performance of his duties,” during a demonstration against the appropriation of town land and a well.
Her husband Bassam was arrested four months ago and is charged with organizing the demonstrations in their town. “For us Palestinians, it isn’t a housing crisis we are facing but a housing ban. Though the Israeli government being at fault is a common denominator,” she said.
The Civil Administration issued a demolition order for her house built in Area C. The original house, built in 1963, wasn’t large enough for the entire family, and they were forced to expand their house without a permit; a permit Israel doesn’t issue.
From their home, which could be destroyed any day, the family members can see the settlement of Halamish growing. “A few days ago, my daughter saw the Israeli protests with me as I was surfing the web,” Tamimi said, when we met at the al-Bireh Popular Resistance Committees offices.
“She asked me, are they also dispersed with tear gas, are they hit? I told her they weren’t. She couldn’t understand the difference; we are also fighting for social justice, are we not?” Tamimi said.
The main element missing in the Israeli wave of protests, according to Tamimi, is the disconnect between social struggle and the Israeli occupation.
Abu Zaida is the only who seems optimistic about the protests, saying“the public will start reckoning with its government on what it is spending on the settlements and settlers. It’s about to happen. Social justice means an equal distribution of the country’s resources. Everyone knows that this isn’t the case due to political and ideological reasons.”
Ghanim, however, believes the Israeli protest movement will fail because political correctness will prevent people from seeing the natural link to the occupation, with the government continuing to make settlements the highest priority and depriving the Palestinian people of their freedom.
“The movement is headed by the middle class and many intellectuals, as a social class that generates much knowledge in the sociological sense but not in the spiritual sense, Ghanim said, adding "they will eventually make the connection to the occupation. However, strategic processes take a long time historically, while the leadership will have the short-term in mind, not treating the root of the problem. And then the movement will collapse. Netanyahu will bring the West Bank to Tel Aviv, meaning he will upgrade apartheid, and that’s all.”
Tamimi and Ghatasha believe this is an opportunity for Israelis to understand that they too are victims of the occupation. “All the tear gas grenades thrown at us in demonstrations cost money which cannot be spent on improving social conditions for Israelis,” Tamimi said. However, said she heard that one of the protest leaders spoke out against the anarchists, because they demonstrate against soldiers.
“These are the activists standing by our side in recent years,” she said, “How can you demand social justice for only one group?”
Ghatasha , who was born in the al-Fawwar refugee camp, to a family from the depopulated Palestinian town Bayt Jibrin, also found herself hard pressed to see any difference made by the protests that have swept up the country.
This May she met with Israeli leftist activists, who came to a conference for Palestinian leftist parties in Hebron. At the conference she talked about two processes hindering feminist Palestinian activities and female participation in the struggle against the occupation.
On one hand, she claimed, NGO-ation (the channeling of activities to NGOs funded by different countries), reduces the influence of women groups. On the other hand, militarization of the second intifada pushed most of the population, including women, out of the struggle’s public sphere.
“What is it that makes some Israelis get it and others not?” she mused in her party’s Hebron offices. “I’d like to understand the rationality of the Israeli people,” she added. “On one hand there’s this selfishness, of a people living off another people’s misery, with no regret. On the other hand, it is obvious that they would be better off were they to live like a normal country, not squandering their money on upholding the occupation, Ghatasha said.
Despite their misgivings, all four agree the protest will allow the Palestinians – most of whom know Israelis only in the form of settlers and soldiers – to see that “Israeli society isn’t one-dimensional, that it is complex, that it shouldn’t be flattened, that it has struggles and oppressed classes of its own,” Ghanim said.
“The protest is shattering the Palestinians image of Israel as a perfect country, where all are full, own villas and trade in their cars every year," Abu Zaida added.

<title>Palestinians embark on civil disobedience protests against 'demographic segregation' </title>
<date>Wed Nov 16 00:48:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Quite a large number of people awaited the no. 148 Egged bus that stopped in Kokhav Ya'akov junction on Tuesday afternoon. One could immediately recognize that these weren't the regular passengers from the neighboring settlements.
"You can't believe what's going on here," whispered one religious man into his cellular phone, "it's unbelievable." The man was obviously referring to the mob of journalists - with their multi-sized cameras, microphones and notepads - surrounding five men and a woman who were waiting at the station.
These were six Palestinians who decided to ride to Jerusalem on an Egged bus, that usually carries mostly settlers, without the required permits, and through the Hizmeh checkpoint, which is altogether off-limits for West Bank Palestinians.
This was the first in a series of civil disobedience actions planned to protest what the organizers call "demographic segregation," which forbids Palestinians from reaching East Jerusalem, while allowing a two-tier transportation system in the West Bank: one for Israelis and one for Palestinians. The protestors were inspired by the American Civil Rights Movement's Freedom Riders, who boarded buses fifty years ago to protest segregation in the southern states.
"We're part of the common human history of struggling for freedom," said Basel al-Araj, a pharmacist from al-Wallaja. He was arrested six times during the demonstrations against the separation barrier which disconnects his village from its lands and neighboring Palestinian towns.
It seems that the security forces had no prior information about the event. A military jeep showed up after 20 minutes, before the Border Control, police and what seemed to be a settlement security vehicle arrived.
The Palestinian Freedom Riders assumed that the settlers would be violent. Badee' Dwak, a social worker from Hebron, was the first to express his bewilderment, claiming that "the settlers here [near Ramallah] are quiet, not like ours in Hebron."
Of the six, only Fadi Qurun - one of the Palestinian March 15th movement leaders - had never been arrested, except for a detention of several hours after a Nabi Saleh demonstration. "Being arrested is an integral part of our existence as Palestinians under Israeli occupation," they said as they boarded the bus followed by an army of reporters, "We're not special."
The 15-minute ride to the Hizmeh checkpoint passed quietly. After they revealed a flag and some placards, one of the passengers swore at them. Dwak retorted, "You're religious, you should be ashamed of yourself."
A foreign reporter asked a passenger from Ofra for his opinion. He answered that Arabs could ride anywhere in the country, but Jews can't drive to Ramallah. Other journalists explained to her that the speaker was Hagai Segal, who was part of the infamous Jewish Underground in the eighties.
At Hizmeh checkpoint policemen demanded that two of the riders get off the bus, but they refused. The next effort came after the settlers exited the bus, in a parking lot. A Policeman dragged Dwak to the steps of the bus, but then left without him. Police officers, of different ranks came and went. Some of them threatened the six, and others pleaded with them.
Huwaida Arraf, a lawyer and one of the six Freedom Riders on the bus, offered the officers the "honorary passport" she received from the Palestinians for taking part in the Gaza flotilla last year. They didn't know they were arresting an Israeli and U.S. citizen.
Up until they were arrested and dragged away, the Freedom Riders insisted: "We have the right to reach Jerusalem. Why doesn't a settler need an entry permit? We do not obey apartheid rules. We're Palestinian, and this is Palestine."

<title>Palestinians ram bulldozer into contested stretch of West Bank fence</title>
<date>Fri Jun 24 17:50:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Palestinian protesters rammed a bulldozer on Friday into a contested barrier near the village of Bil'in, days after the Israeli army said it would finally comply with a court order and reposition the fence.
Israel Defense Forces soldiers fired volleys of tear gas and jets of foul-smelling liquid to force the flag-waving demonstrators away from the metal fencing that keeps locals from their land.
Bil'in, which lies about 25 km (15 miles) east of Tel Aviv, has become the focal point of protests against the controversial Israeli network of walls and fences that separates much of the occupied West Bank from Israel.
The IDF tore down a watchtower overlooking Bil'in on Wednesday and said they were ready to dismantle part of the fence, four years after the high court ruled it should be re-routed to give Palestinians greater access to farmland.
Palestinian leaders and activists descended on Bil'in on Friday to celebrate the decision, but said the protests would continue because much of the land remained inaccessible.
"What the village of Bil'in has got back because of the changing of the course of the wall represents less than half of the lands that were confiscated," Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad told Reuters television.
"This represents a backing down, and therefore this event has an important meaning ... but this can only end with the ending of the occupation along with its injustice, its settlements and walls," he said after attending midday prayers.
TEAR GAS
Israel has built a concrete wall several hundred metres back from the fence, which will take the place of the old barrier. But the original metal fence still stands and a few dozen protesters tried to tear it down using a yellow bulldozer.
The Palestinians, including one man in a wheelchair, made their way along a dirt track amidst olive trees and used a bulldozer to rip up a metal gate before being forced back by soldiers.
The cabin of the bulldozer was thick with tear gas as the driver struggled to retreat.
Israel started building its barrier, which is a mix of metal fencing, barbed wire and concrete walls, in 2002 following a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings.
The Israeli government calls it a "security fence" and says it is vital to protect Israeli lives. The Palestinians refer to it as an "apartheid wall" and say it amounts to a land grab, swallowing up swathes of ancestral farmland.
The World Court in The Hague said in 2004 that the proposed 720-km (430-mile) barrier was illegal.
At Bil'in, the barrier curves 3 km (2 miles) inside the Green Line, established by a 1949 ceasefire, which divides Israel and the West Bank. It does so to ensure nearby settlements lie on the Israeli side of the barrier.

<title>Reporter tries to place Lieberman under citizens arrest</title>
<date>Tue Feb 22 23:22:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Foreign Minster Avigdor Lieberman was challenged by a reporter during his visit to the European Council, when the man told Lieberman that he was under citizens' arrest and demanded that Lieberman accompany him to the nearest police station.
David Cronin, a freelance reporter and author of the book "Europe's Alliance with Israel: Aiding the Occupation" was tackled by security officials only seconds after he began to address Lieberman and physically escorted from the room.
As Lieberman entered a press conference, Cronin stood up and declared, "Mr. Lieberman, this is a citizens' arrest. You are charged with the crime of apartheid. Please come with me to the nearest police station." As he was dragged away, he shouted, "Free Palestine! Free Palestine! Apartheid is a crime!"
This was not the first time that Cronin has tried to carry out a citizens' arrest of a high-ranked public official. Last year he tried to single-handedly arrest former British Prime Minister Tony Blair for what he said were crimes against the people of Iraq.
A member of the Israeli delegation to the European Union said, "This was entirely uncivilized, in bad taste. But Israel, like the EU, is very supportive of free speech. It's just a shame that some people take advantage of that freedom sometimes," according to the European Union Observer.
Foreign Minister Lieberman is in Brussels for the annual meeting of the decade-old EU-Israel Association Council. Earlier on Tuesday, Hungary's foreign minister Janos Martonyi, whose country currently chairs the EU, told Lieberman that growing instability in the Middle East makes it imperative to immediately resume the stalled peace process with the Palestinians.

<title>Report: London Philharmonic suspends musicians for anti-Israel remarks </title>
<date>Sat Sep 17 16:25:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
A report in UK daily The Guardian stated that the London Philharmonic Orchestra has suspended four of its musicians for nine months for adopting its name when they called for the cancellation of an Israeli orchestra’s concert at the Royal Albert Hall.
According to the Guardian, the orchestra suspended cellist Sue Sutherley, as well as violinists Tom Eisner, Nancy Elan and Sarah Streatfeild until June 2012, after they signed a letter as members of the LPO condemning the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra as an instrument of Israeli propaganda.
The musicians’ statement claimed that “denials of human rights and violations of international law are hidden behind a cultural smokescreen. The IPO is perhaps Israel's prime asset in this campaign”, and that Israel's policy toward the Palestinians “fits the UN definition of apartheid."
The Guardian’s report states that both Orchestra chief executive Tim Walker, as well as chairman Martin Hohmann released a statement regarding the suspensions, which were meant to send a “strong and clear message that their actions will not be tolerated … the orchestra would never restrict the right of its players to express themselves freely, however such expression has to be independent of the LPO itself.”
The statement also said that the Orchestra has no desire to “end the careers” of the musicians, but that “for the LPO, music and politics to not mix.”"
The move comes after protestors interrupted a performance by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra on September 1 during an annual BBC Proms concert series.
Several demonstrators in the venue shouted as Zubin Mehta stood to conduct Bruch's Violin Concerto, while other audience members booed in response to the protest.

<title>Report: Turkey shows support for Palestinian efforts to seek UN recognition</title>
<date>Sat Apr 23 09:55:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
In a report published Saturday in the Turkish daily, Today's Zaman, the Turkish Ambassador to the UN expressed his support for Palestinian statehood, urging the international community to follow suit.
"The time has come to show solidarity with the Palestinians and help them to live in peace and dignity," said the Turkish Ambassador to the UN Ertuğrul Apakan during a UN Security Council debate on the Middle East on Thursday.
According to the report in Today's Zaman, Apakan said that if the Palestinians prove they are ready to become a full UN member, instead of maintaining their current observer status, the international community should not "turn a blind eye to their just and legitimate appeal."
“Through their state building efforts, the Palestinian Authority has proven to all the skeptics that they deserve to attain their decades-long target of internationally recognized statehood, even though they continue to suffer under occupation,” said Apakan, according to the report.
In a New York Times editorial Thursday, Turkish President Abdullah Gul spoke of the importance of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. He said that a "dignified and viable Palestine," living side by side with Israel, would fortify Israel's security.
According to the report, Gul said that the plight of the Palestinians has been a cause of unrest and conflict in the Middle East and a pretext for extremism in other parts of the world. "Israel cannot afford to be perceived as an apartheid island surrounded by an Arab sea of anger and hostility," said the Turkish president.
He added that Turkey would benefit from a peaceful Middle East and is "therefore ready to use our full capacity to facilitate constructive negotiations."
Israel's relationship with Turkey, once a key Mideast ally, has severely deteriorated since the Gaza war of the winter of 2008-2009, after which Ankara had severely criticized Jerusalem for use of excessive force in a dense civilian population. 
The ties between the once stanch allies continued to worsen following Israel's raid on a Turkish Gaza aid flotilla in May of 2010, which resulted in the deaths of nine Turkish activists. 
Turkey has repeatedly urged Israel to apologize for its boarding of the Gaza flotilla, demanding that it compensate the families of those injured and killed in the incident, demands that were rejected by Israel. 
Recently, Turkish officials indicated they rejected a request from Israel to help stop activists sailing to Gaza on the first anniversary of an Israeli raid on a Turkish ship, saying flotilla plan was not Ankara's concern.
The Free Gaza Movement, a pro-Palestinian activist umbrella group, has said that a flotilla expected in late May would comprise 15 ships with international passengers including Europeans and Americans. 
Israel's ambassador to Turkey, Gaby Levy, asked the Turkish government this month to help stop the activists, saying sending humanitarian aide to Gaza outside legal channels was a "provocation," an Israeli diplomatic official told Reuters. 
According to the report in Today's Zaman, the Turkish ambassador the UN said, "It should also be borne in mind that the phenomenon of humanitarian convoys to Gaza cannot simply be explained away as unilateral provocations.”

<title>South African Jew who hid Nelson Mandela dies in Tel Aviv at 82</title>
<date>Thu May 26 02:51:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
It was an elaborate charade: A white South African family in the comfortable brick house on the northern edge of Johannesburg, a black farm worker in the tiny servant's quarters out back.
The farm worker was Nelson Mandela, hiding out in the 1960s soon after he founded the armed wing of the African National Congress. Arthur Goldreich, key to the ruse as head of the white family, died Tuesday in Tel Aviv, Mandela's office said Wednesday. Goldreich was 82.
Goldreich and his family pretended to be the owners of a farm on the outskirts of Johannesburg that was the ANC's underground headquarters in the 1960s. They played into the stereotypes of apartheid, trying to behave as masters and servant before the neighbors, who have spoken of seeing Mandela, known on the farm as David Motsamayi, in blue workers' overalls selling produce on the street outside.
But in private, they were comrades. Mandela once spoke of numerous political discussions with Goldreich, and of recommending he be recruited into Umkhonto we Sizwe, known as MK, the ANC's armed wing. In his autobiography, Mandela describes the South African-born Goldreich as having fought in the 1940s with the military wing of the Jewish National Movement in Palestine.
Mandela described Goldreich as a "flamboyant person  (who ) gave the farm a buoyant atmosphere.
Benjamin Pogrund, a former South African journalist who met Goldreich in Israel, told the Associated Press that "Goldreich was a romantic revolutionary."
"He had a great personality and was really fun to be with," Pogrund said. "He was a great narrator and did everything with tremendous flair."
Mandela wrote of close calls at the farm. One day Mandela's son, leafing through a magazine while playing with Golreich's son on a visit to the farm, came across a photo of Mandela before he went underground. Mandela's son told Goldreich's son the man pictured was his father, and identified him by his real name.
"I had the feeling that I had remained too long in one place," Mandela wrote.
Mandela was not at the farm when it was raided in 1963. He was already in prison in a separate case, but became a defendant in the so-called Rivonia treason trial that arose from the farm raid, leading to decades in prison.
Goldreich was among those arrested.  (Ian Deitch in Jerusalem contributed to this report. )

<title>South African school cuts ties with Ben-Gurion University </title>
<date>Fri Mar 25 02:04:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
A leading South African university is severing ties with Ben-Gurion University of the Negev after hundreds of South African professors called for an academic boycott.
The University of Johannesburg's vice chancellor Adam Habib said yesterday the university is ending a 25-year relationship with BGU on April 1. He said professors can continue to work individually with Ben-Gurion University should they decide to do so and should BGU agree to such an arrangement.
BGU President, Professor Rivka Carmi, said "the South African people will be the one to lose from this decision." She said the boycott was triggered by a report submitted to UJ, blasting BGU's cooperation with the IDF on a program for flight cadets.
The two universities have been working together on cleaning algae from South African drinking water, using innovative technologies developed in BGU, university officials said.
More than 400 South Africans signed a petition calling for the boycott, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The Congress of South African Trade Unions called it a landmark moment in the campaign to boycott Israel.
Habib said the university's senate committee discussed the issue for two hours on Wednesday then held a secret vote. Sixty percent voted to sever ties, outvoting the remainder who wanted relations with both Israeli and Palestinian universities.
"This is not a boycott of Ben-Gurion University," said UJ's executive director for advancement, Kerry Swift. "The formal relationship between the institutions is in a sense an obstacle, and the feeling is that we would encourage relationships on an individual basis."
BGU began its relations with UJ when the latter was the whites-only Rand Afrikaans University during the apartheid era. South Africa's post-apartheid government has been sharply critical of Israel's policies regarding the Palestinians.
The South African Jewish Board of Deputies criticized the decision, saying that it would be detrimental to "constructive intellectual engagement in South Africa."
"The UJ senate's decision to allow the formal relationship between UJ and BGU to lapse is playing to narrow-minded political prejudice and is a severe setback for constructive intellectual engagement in South Africa," SAJBD national chairperson Zev Krengel said in a statement published in the South African press.

<title>South African school cuts ties with Ben-Gurion University in Israel</title>
<date>Thu Mar 24 12:30:00 IST 2011</date>

JOHANNESBURG - A leading South African university is severing ties with Ben-Gurion University of the Negev after hundreds of South African professors called for an academic boycott.
Vice Chancellor Adam Habib said Thursday that the University of Johannesburg is ending a 25-year relationship on April 1. He said professors can continue to work individually with Ben-Gurion, should they decide to do so and should Ben-Gurion agree to it.
More than 400 South Africans signed a petition calling for the boycott, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The Congress of South African Trade Unions called it a landmark moment  in the campaign to boycott Israel.

"This is not a boycott of Ben-Gurion," said UJ's executive director for advancement, Kerry Swift. "The formal relationship between the institutions is in a sense an obstacle, and the feeling is that we would encourage relationships on an individual basis."
Relations with Ben-Gurion University began when UJ was the whites-only Rand Afrikaans University during the apartheid era. South Africa's post-apartheid government has been a sharp critic of Israel's policies regarding the Palestinians.

"The UJ senate's decision to allow the formal relationship between UJ and BGU to lapse is playing to narrow-minded political prejudice and is a severe setback for constructive intellectual engagement in South Africa,” SAJBD national chairperson Zev Krengel said in a statement published in the South African press.
Ben-Gurion and Johannesburg universities have been working together on cleaning algae from South African drinking water, Krengel was quoted as saying.
He said the decision showed that, "rather than availing itself of a scientific co-operative project in the  water purification field that has enormous potential benefits for South  Africa, UJ has chosen instead to further the agenda of a group of  anti-Israel agitators." 
Alana Baranov of SAJBD  said South Africans "should be serving to provide a tolerant and respectful place where complex problems can be resolved and we can share resources."
"Academic boycotts are anti-freedom of speech and anti-academic," she said.
Baranov said the joint research had been done to improve the lives of average South Africans.
Those fighting to end cooperation have argued that Ben-Gurion has ties to the Israel Defense Force and is complicit in the military's treatment of Palestinians.
"Israeli universities are an intimate part of the Israeli regime, by active choice," Tutu wrote in a recent essay. "While Palestinians are not able to access universities and schools, Israeli universities produce the research, technology, arguments and leaders for maintaining the occupation."

<title>Spoken-word musical pioneer Gil Scott-Heron dies at 62</title>
<date>Sun May 29 01:19:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
NEW YORK - Musician Gil Scott-Heron - who helped lay the groundwork for rap by fusing minimalistic percussion, political expression and spoken-word poetry with songs such as "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" - died Friday at age 62.
Scott-Heron died during the afternoon at St. Luke's Hospital after becoming sick upon his return from a trip to Europe, according to his friend Doris C. Nolan, who answered the telephone listed for his Manhattan recording company.
"We're all sort of shattered," Nolan said.
Scott-Heron's influence on rap was so great that he was sometimes referred to as the "Godfather of Rap," a title he rejected.
"If there was any individual initiative that I was responsible for it might have been that there was music in certain poems of mine, with complete progression and repeating 'hooks,' which made them more like songs than just recitations with percussion," Scott-Heron wrote in the introduction to his 1990 collection of poems "Now and Then."
He referred to his signature mix of percussion, politics and performed poetry as "bluesology" or "Third World music." Later he called it simply "black music or black American music," noting, "Black Americans are now a tremendously diverse essence of all the places we've come from and the music and rhythms we brought with us." Nevertheless, Scott-Heron's influence on generations of rappers has been demonstrated through sampling of his recordings by artists such as Kanye West.
Scott-Heron recorded the song that would make him famous, "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised," which critiqued mass media, for the album "125th and Lenox" in Harlem in the 1970s. He followed up that recording with more than a dozen albums, initially collaborating with musician Brian Jackson. His most recent album was "I'm New Here," which he began recording in 2007 and which was released in 2010.
Throughout his musical career, Scott-Heron took on the political issues of his time, including the apartheid in South Africa and nuclear arms. He was largely shaped by the politics of the 1960s and black literature, especially that of the Harlem Renaissance.
Last May, Scott-Heron was scheduled to perform in Tel Aviv, Israel, but canceled following pressure from the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel.
Scott-Heron was born in Chicago on April 1, 1949. He was raised in Jackson, Tenn., and New York before attending college at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania.
Before turning to music, he became a novelist at age 19 with the publication of "The Vulture," a murder mystery.
He also was the author of "The Nigger Factory," a social satire.

A European Championship qualifier match between the Israeli and Swedish handball teams on Sunday sparked protests urging a boycott of Israel on the grounds that it is an "apartheid state."
Police say around 150 pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered outside a sports stadium in the town of Karlskrona in southern Sweden, where the match was held. One person was taking into custody three hours into the demonstration.
The rally was organized by an umbrella group called the “Network for Independence, Peace and Non-alignment,” which is comprised of various Swedish political parties. Organizers distributed a picture of a decapitated child lying between the legs of a soldier to attract protesters.
In an earlier message, protest organizers said that, “In Israel, Palestinians are denied the right to pursue sports on equal terms, just like the blacks were denied this right in South Africa during apartheid. Sports and politics are connected. The Israeli team represents the Apartheid state of Israel.”
Police spokesman Mats Trulsson said the protest had been peaceful and showed no sign of developing into the violent riots seen during a Davis Cup game between Sweden and Israel in the city of Malmo in 2009.
Trulsson also said that a pro-Israel demonstration attracted around 60 people to Karlskrona before the qualifier game for the European handball championship.
Police had been on high alert before the game, following the events in Malmo in 2009 when rock-throwing activists clashed with police and tried to storm the arena hosting the Davis Cup game.
The Simon Wiesenthal Center had earlier called for the International Handball Federation to cancel Sunday's game because of anti-Israel sentiments and preparations for the rally.

<title>Thousands of Israelis and Arabs march in Jerusalem to support Palestinian independence</title>
<date>Fri Jul 15 16:30:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Approximately 2,000 Palestinians and Israelis took part in the "March for Independence" Friday, calling for the recognition of a Palestinian state.
Although the organizers of the march issued a statement saying the march was carried out peacefully, police had to intervene and separate right-wing and left-wing activists.
The event was coordinated with the police, and organizers had pledged to prevent any violence from breaking out, despite the expected right-wing counter-protests.
Participants in the march held signs quoting South African leader and anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela saying "only free men can negotiate", while others bore slogans calling for support of Palestinian independence.
Several MKs participated in the march, including Zehava Galon of Meretz and Dov Hanin of Hadash. Other prominent public figures took part as well, such as former Speaker of the Knesset Avraham Burg and former Attorney General Michael Ben Yair.
The march took a symbolic route, following the green line that used to divide East and West Jerusalem before the Six Day War in 1967. It began at Jaffa Gate and ended at the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, the opposite route taken by right-wing activists during Jerusalem Day last month.
Avner Inbar, Solidarity movement spokesman, said that the declaration of independence in September is "an act of people who crave freedom." He added that "Palestinian independence is not only the natural right of the Palestinian people. It is the only solution that can prevent another wave of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. This march proves that a joint, Jewish-Arab struggle is the way to end the occupation."

<title>Turkey: Israel-Palestinian peace will decide fate of Arab uprisings</title>
<date>Thu Apr 21 11:21:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Turkish President Abdullah Gul said in a New York Times editorial Thursday, that the fate of the Arab world uprisings will be determined by whether there is peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
"Whether these uprisings lead to democracy and peace or to tyranny and conflict will depend on forging a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and a broader Israeli-Arab peace," Gul said in the article.
The Turkish President said that Israel, more than any country, needs to adapt to the new political climate of the region. "But it need not fear," he said, "the emergence of a democratic neighborhood around Israel is the ultimate assurance of the country’s security."
Gul said that in the coming 50 years there will be an overwhelming majority of Arabs in the combined regions of Israel and the existing Palestinian territories, comprised of a generation of pro-democratic Arabs. As such, he said, "sticking to the unsustainable status quo will only place Israel in greater danger."
The New York Times editorial said that the plight of the Palestinians has been a cause of unrest and conflict in the region and a pretext for extremism in other parts of the world. "Israel cannot afford to be perceived as an apartheid island surrounded by an Arab sea of anger and hostility," said the Turkish president.
The article added that a dignified Palestine, living side by side with Israel, will fortify Israel's security, and that Turkey will benefit from a peaceful Middle East. "We are therefore ready to use our full capacity to facilitate constructive negotiations."
Israel's relationship with Turkey, once a key Mideast ally, has severely deteriorated since the Gaza war of the winter of 2008-2009, after which Ankara had severely criticized Jerusalem for use of excessive force in a dense civilian population.
The ties between the once stanch allies continued to worsen following Israel's raid on a Turkish Gaza aid flotilla in May of 2010, which resulted in the deaths of nine Turkish activists.
Turkey has repeatedly urged Israel to apologize for its boarding of the Gaza flotilla, demanding that it compensate the families of those injured and killed in the incident, demands that were rejected by Israel.
Recently, Turkish officials indicated they rejected a request from Israel to help stop activists sailing to Gaza on the first anniversary of an Israeli raid on a Turkish ship, saying flotilla plan was not Ankara's concern.The Free Gaza Movement, a pro-Palestinian activist umbrella group, has said that a flotilla expected in late May would comprise 15 ships with international passengers including Europeans and Americans.
Israel's ambassador to Turkey, Gaby Levy, asked the Turkish government this week to help stop the activists, saying sending humanitarian aide to Gaza outside legal channels was a "provocation," an Israeli diplomatic official told Reuters.
Asked about the request, a Turkish foreign ministry official told Reuters: "We listened to the message given by the Israeli side and told them this is an initiative by civil society."

<title>UN investigator: Israel engaged in ethnic cleansing with settlement expansion</title>
<date>Mon Mar 21 18:53:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Israel's expansion of settlements in East Jerusalem and eviction of Palestinians from their homes there is a form of ethnic cleansing, a United Nations investigator said on Monday.United States academic Richard Falk was speaking to the UN Human Rights Council as it prepared to pass resolutions condemning settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.The "continued pattern of settlement expansion in East Jerusalem combined with the forcible eviction of long-residing Palestinians are creating an intolerable situation" in the part of the city previously controlled by Jordan, he said.This situation "can only be described in its cumulative impact as a form of ethnic cleansing," Falk declared.Israel declines to deal with Falk or even allow him into the country, accusing him of being biased.In a related discussion on Israeli policies towards the lands it seized in the 1967 war, Israeli and Palestinian delegates clashed over the recent killing of members of a Jewish settler family in the West Bank.
Israeli ambassador Aharon Leshno Yaar called on Palestinian leaders to condemn the March 11 murders of three children, including a baby, and their parents "without caveats or hedging" in Arabic to their own people.Almost as shocking as the killings, "in the days following the massacre many Palestinians took to the streets celebrating the deaths of this family," Leshno Yaar said.But Palestinian envoy Ibrahim Kraishi said the killings had already been condemned by the Palestinian Authority as "an act of terrorism" that was not part of his people's culture. "Rather, it is the culture of the occupying power," he added.In his speech, Falk said he would like the Human Rights Council to ask the International Court of Justice to look at Israeli behavior in the occupied territories.This should focus on whether the prolonged occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem had elements of "colonialism, apartheid and ethnic cleansing inconsistent with international humanitarian law," the investigator declared.

<title>Visiting South African artist rejects Israel boycott, opting to protest in Jerusalem instead</title>
<date>Mon Mar 07 03:32:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
South African artist William Kentridge has come to Israel for a retrospective of his work that opened at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem last Friday.
Though Kentridge, who is known for his vocal political opinions, had been pressured not to come by advocates of boycotting Israel, he decided instead to express his opposition to Israeli policy by attending the weekly demonstration in East Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. He also met with author David Grossman.
In addition, he used a press conference yesterday to condemn Israel's actions. However, he added, he does not believe cultural boycotts are the right solution.
Despite certain characteristics in common, Kentridge continued, he does not think Israel's occupation of the Palestinians should be compared to South African apartheid. Nevertheless, he said, both apartheid and the occupation revolve around the same key question: How much should we rely on the past to justify our existence, and how much should we forget in order to move forward?
'Proud to host exhibition' 
Israel Museum director James Snyder told reporters that the museum, which has been collecting Kentridge works since the late 1990s, was "proud" to host such an important exhibition. The exhibition, a joint venture between the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Norton Museum of Art, is traveling to four other cities before ending in New York's Museum of Modern Art.
Kentridge, born in Johannesburg in 1954, gained fame in the late 1980s for a series of works harshly critical of South Africa's apartheid regime.

<title>Will Jello Biafra play in Tel Aviv after all?</title>
<date>Wed Jul 13 02:26:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Despite a week spent touring the area to decide whether he was correct to cancel his much-heralded and controversial show in Tel Aviv, punk rocker Jello Biafra says he is none the wiser.
"To boycott or not to boycott is not a black-and-white issue," the former Dead Kennedy's frontman, 53, told Haaretz Thursday, shortly before heading back to the U.S. "The more you know, the more you know you don't know. I knew that was going to happen going in, but it's just gotten more intense since then."
Biafra originally resisted calls for him to cancel his July 2 Tel Aviv gig with his new band, the Gauntanamo School of Medicine, but caved a few days before the show, telling fans he doesn't support the boycott movement and the cancellation was meant to protect his bandmates.
The Colorado-born singer, whose given name is Eric Boucher, still came to Israel, saying he wanted to explore the situation for himself.
"I wish we'd have played but I think I made the right decision, for the sake of the members of my band," he said. "I had one and possibly two band members that were on the verge of cracking up, me being one of them," the San Francisco resident said about the pressure from pro-Palestinian activists. One group called Punks Against Apartheid was founded with the lone intention of harassing him into canceling, he added.
"I already put myself in the position that whatever decision I make, there will be a lot of unhappy people, including people within the band," Biafra said, wearing a wrinkled black shirt, hiking shoes and pink socks. "The toll that has taken on the fabric of the band is not good. Not to mention me now being responsible for airfares and changing plane tickets and having no idea how I'm going to pay my bills the rest of the year."
Biafra, whose Dead Kennedys hits "California Uber Alles" and "Holiday in Cambodia" were punk anthems in the 1970s and 80s, said the despair and hopelessness he witnessed in Israel and Palestinian Territories about there being no solution to the conflict were what sunk in the most.
"You can imagine the amount of emotional turmoil that's undercut my entire visit here in knowing how people felt who wanted to see us play, and how other people felt, and then experiencing the vibrant electricity of Tel Aviv, a 24-hour town with these amazing people. And then going to Ramallah and again there are great people there," he said. "It just makes me terribly sad that between the different peoples and cultures in such a special place there could be so much horrible violent conflict."
"Part of the reason this affected me so emotionally is that I've really had a good time on the surface here, but they call Tel Aviv the bubble for a reason," he added.
Biafra also had positive impressions of Jerusalem, where he went to restaurants and bars. "It's also a 24-hour town, even though people here [in Tel Aviv] told me Jerusalem is dead. No, it's not! But even Jerusalem can be a bubble when you tune out the human rights violations going on as close as the next visible hill."
The singer said he was jarred by Palestinians' hardships he witnessed in Hebron and elsewhere, and criticized Israel for not allowing cement into Gaza.
"There are these extreme petty gestures justified under the same excuse that all the Nixon, Reagan and Bush crimes were justified - national security. National security is a one-way ticket to a lot of government lawlessness."
On the other hand, Biafra said it would be wrong to only blame Israel for the perpetuation of the conflict. "People who say they do want peace and a two-state solution but are very wary of the '67 border because they worry about rocket attacks on Tel Aviv or something coming down from Golan Heights - because they say, look at what their fanatic fringe does - that view is not unfounded either," he said.
"I realize that Hamas and Hezbollah are no joke," he said. "But despite radicalism on both sides, it still seems more solvable than some of the other horrible conflicts in the world, in part because some of is just so petty, so tit-for-tat."

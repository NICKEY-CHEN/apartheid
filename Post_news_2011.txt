<title>165 Academics sign boycott against Ariel University</title>
<date>9/1/2011</date>
<content>
One hundred sixty-five Israeli academics issued a petition on Sunday in which 
they vow not to take part in academic functions at the Ariel University Center 
of Samaria, because it lies across the Green Line.The petition, which 
was initiated by Prof. Nir Gov of the Weizmann Institute of Science, says the 
educators took part because of their “discomfort in participating in any part of 
the academic activities taking place at the college which operates in the 
settlement of Ariel.”

join artists' boycott of Ariel cultural centerTel Aviv: 
Hundreds gather to support actors' Ariel boycottAccording to the petition, the settlement “is not 
part of the sovereign territory of the State of Israel, and therefore it is 
impossible to require us to work there. Our conscience and our social 
responsibility demand that we bring forth an obvious stance on the 
matter.”The petitioners also say that Ariel “was founded on occupied 
territory. Only a few kilometers from the flourishing settlement, Palestinians 
live in villages and refugee camps under difficult living conditions, and 
lacking basic human rights. Not only do they not have access to higher 
education, a number of them don’t even have access to running water.”The 
contrast between Ariel and the surrounding Palestinian areas constitute “two 
different realities that forge an apartheid state,” the petition adds.It 
was signed by three Israel Prize laureates, Prof. Yehoshua Kolodny (the 
Hebrew University/Earth Sciences 2010), Prof. Benjamin Isaac (Tel Aviv 
University/ History 2008), and Prof. Itamar Procaccia (Weizmann 
Institute/Physics 2009).Following reports of the petition on Sunday, 
Education Ministry Gideon Sa’ar issued a statement in which he criticized 
“public debates that are based on attempts to boycott and 
delegitimize.”Sa’ar called the boycott “a provocation that lacks any 
meaning” and questioned the likelihood that the academics would have been part 
of any educational proceedings at the university in the first place.The 
initiative was also criticized by Ariel Mayor Ron Nachman. He told Israel Radio 
that he would respond to boycotts with increased construction.Ben-Gurion 
University’s Prof. Rivka Carmi, president of the Committee of University Heads, 
distanced herself and her committee from the boycott, saying that those who 
signed the petition did not represent any academic institution in Israel. Carmi 
also called for academics to avoid such initiatives in the future.
The 
settlement is home to nearly 20,000 Israelis. In August, three dozen 
theater actors and workers penned a letter in which they pledged not to perform 
at the then-soon-to-be-opened Ariel Center for the Performing Arts because it is 
located across the Green Line. Days later, the artists’ boycott was joined by 
150 professors and authors who wrote a letter in which they vowed not to work at 
the facility either.

<title>500 Palestinians set for mass ‘fly-in’ to B-G Airport</title>
<date>3/6/2011</date>
<content>
In the wake of “Nakba Day,” “Naksa Day” and an anticipated Gaza-bound flotilla 
later this month, pro-Palestinian activists are planning to send hundreds of 
Palestinians living abroad on commercial flights to Ben-Gurion Airport next 
month in a dramatic display of solidarity.According to a report released 
this week by the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, an Israeli NGO, 
organizers believe the planned Gaza flotilla is too limited in scope, and 
broader action is needed to “remove the blockade from the entire land of 
Palestine.”




RELATED:'Navy prepared to board flotilla ships if they don't stop' Activists tell Israel not to interfere in June flotilla Canada warns against participation in Gaza flotilla Organizers said the “fly-in” would occur July 8, the date in 
2004 that the UN’s International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion 
that Israel’s West Bank security fence is illegal by international 
law.After holding a protest rally at the airport, the arrivals plan to 
travel to the West Bank to “express solidarity” with 
Palestinians.Organizers said 500 people have already scheduled flights 
to Israel, including Palestinian families from Europe, North and South America, 
Asia and Africa. Germany will be one of the participants’ main departure 
points.Fifteen organizations are involved in the initiative, including 
the influential International Solidarity Movement.The ISM is active in 
organizing weekly protests against the West Bank security fence at Bil’in, and 
in the Free Gaza Movement behind last May’s controversial flotilla.The 
NGO report suggests the fly-in may be the product of rivalries between 
pro-Palestinian groups, and that diverting attention from the Gaza flotilla may 
be one of the initiative’s chief objectives.“While we rightly focus on 
Gaza, we must not forget that Israeli colonial authorities are implementing 
their racist apartheid policies throughout historic Palestine,” organizers wrote 
on the website bienvenuepalestine.com. “In the West Bank (including east 
Jerusalem) and in the Negev and the Galilee, ethnic cleansing and 
killing/injuring civilians are just some of the many violations of basic human 
rights.”“Israel destroyed the only Palestinian airport, built with our 
money (European grants). As a result, we have no other option but to go 
through Israeli security, even though we don’t want to go to Israel,” organizers 
wrote. “We are pacifists, we will have nothing dangerous in our bags. We call on 
our elected representatives and our governments during the following months to 
ensure that we shall be normally and properly treated on our arrival in Ben 
Gourion [sic] airport, as are Israeli citizens when they come to our 
countries.”Meanwhile, a Hamas-linked website called on Palestinian 
refugees and their descendants to travel to Israel on commercial flights on 
Saturday and Sunday as part of events commemorating the “Naksa” of Arab defeat 
in the Six Day War.
The fly-in is touted as part of wider rallies and 
marches this weekend and early next week.

<title>Battle for Beersheba memorial to continue despite rockets</title>
<date>1/11/2011</date>
<content>
Schools in Beersheba were closed on Monday out of concerns for the safety of 
schoolchildren and their teachers given the threat of Grad and Kassam rockets 
from Gaza.But Beersheba Mayor Ruvic Danilovich seemed less perturbed 
about his own personal safety and participated in the annual ceremonies 
commemorating the October 31, 1917, Battle of Beersheba.




The battle was a 
major turning point in the discontinuation of 400 years of Ottoman rule. The 
Turks were defeated by the British and the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps 
(ANZAC) as well as Indian, Canadian and South African military units fielded by 
the British.Some one hundred people – including Australian, New 
Zealander, Turkish, German, British and Israeli diplomats and military attaches; 
members of Australian Zionist youth groups who are in Israel under the auspices 
of the Australian Zionist Youth Council (AZYC); and an Australian delegation of 
Bridges for Peace as well as MFO, UNTSO and Beersheba Municipality 
representatives gathered initially at the Park of the Australian Soldier, then 
at the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery and lastly at the Turkish obelisk in 
Mustafa Kamel Ataturk Plaza.They came to honor not only the Australian 
and New Zealander soldiers in the 4th Lighthorse Brigade who lost their lives in 
that last courageous charge by mounted troops, but also the bravery of all the 
soldiers who were caught up in the conflict of the region in the World War 
I.People from the Australian embassy, in conversation with participants, 
admitted that they did not know until Sunday whether or not the event would take 
place. It was then that they had been notified by the Home Front Command that 
the three commemorative ceremonies could go ahead as 
scheduled.Nonetheless, Beersheba Municipality director of international 
relations Ishay Avital, warned participants that in case a siren went off, they 
were to take shelter behind the walls of the Park of the Australian 
Soldier.The park, a project of the Australian-headquartered Pratt 
Foundation, was inaugurated in 2008, and according to Danilovich, has become a 
symbol for freedom, tolerance, fraternity and connections between people of all 
national, ethnic and religious backgrounds. It is primarily dedicated to 
children with special deeds.The Pratt Foundation, founded by Richard 
Pratt, has donated many millions of dollars to a variety of causes and projects 
in Israel.Pratt’s daughter Heloise Waislitz, who heads the Pratt 
Foundation, recalled the pleasure it had given her father to be present at the 
opening of the park, and said that the playground for children with special 
needs was at the heart of the foundation.Australian Ambassador Andrea 
Faulkner also related to the symbolism of the park, saying, “Nowhere are links 
between Australia and Israel more apparent than in this wonderful park,” which 
she said plays a significant role in community and is a testimony to the depth 
and breadth of the role played by the late Richard Pratt in furthering the good 
relations between the two peoples.Rabbi Raymond Apple, the former senior 
rabbi to the Australian Defense Forces, who has participated in the Battle of 
Beersheba services since making his home in Israel in 2006, said that his 
Jerusalem-born father had ended up in Australia after the World War I, but 
returned for a visit in the late 1930s.“When he told the locals that he 
was from Australia, it immediately struck a chord. The Australians were bronzed, 
handsome heroes who had served in the Middle East during the war,” he 
said.“No one could ever cut the Australians down to 
size.”Australia and Israel became firm friends in those far-off days and 
the two nations remain close, said Apple.“Other places, other people 
don’t know the Israelis and can’t find a good word for them, but there has never 
been a divide between Australia and Israel and never will be. Here you find 
evidence of Australia everywhere. All over Israel there are Australian 
eucalyptus [trees] and Australian accents,” said Apple.“It would shock 
the sourpusses to find Arabs and Jews mixing freely in the Park of the 
Australian Soldier, as they do throughout Israeli society,” he 
continued.“Anyone who accuses Israel of apartheid doesn’t know what 
apartheid is, what Israel is, what the reality of life is.”Apple also 
noted the success of Australian immigration to Israel.“Australian olim 
are a success story. Australian Zionist youth are a great chapter in the story. 
They may make aliya; they might stay in Australia. Whatever happens, their lives 
will have changed forever because of Israel, this land that is small in size but 
a giant in achievement and inspiration.”Speaking in both Maori and 
English, New Zealand’s deputy head of mission Tui Dewes reiterated what had been 
conveyed by Danilovich and Faulkner, namely that these commemoration ceremonies 
were not only in remembrance of the Australian and New Zealander soldiers but 
for those who fell on all sides. 750 fallen New Zealanders lie in what is now 
Israel and the Palestinian territories, she said.
Turkish charge 
d’affaires Dogan Ferhart Isik commended the people of Beersheba for the respect 
that they have shown to Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish Republic, by 
creating the square in his name and for organizing an event in memory of 
Turkey’s fallen soldiers. This attitude was a continuation of the centuries-old 
cooperation between Turkish and Jewish peoples, he said.

<title>Center Field: Shabbat + humous = a new Zionist vision</title>
<date>1/3/2011</date>
<content>
On Sunday night, February 27, more than 200 people, mostly “gap year” students 
who will attend North American colleges next fall, jammed into the Yad Ben-Zvi 
Institute’s headquarters in Jerusalem. In the simple hut, once the second 
president’s official greeting hall, more than a dozen speakers honored Avi 
Schaefer’s memory by “Reimagining Israel on the North American 
Campus.”Schaefer was a Brown University student from Southern California 
who survived three years of volunteering in an IDF combat unit only to be killed 
by a drunk driver last year. He championed Israel at Brown – while befriending 
Palestinians – insisting that advocacy and empathy are not 
contradictions.




When he died, the Brown campus was festooned with Israeli 
flags in his memory.For four hours Sunday evening, this extraordinary 
21-year-old’s spirit permeated that historic hut, challenging a new generation 
to find personal and Jewish fulfillment by becoming Zionist thinkers and doers, 
speaking about Israel from their hearts, in their language, through their 
networks.In truth, the conversation often was sobering. MK Einat Wilf’s 
intelligent overview put this “new mutation” of anti-Zionism into historical 
perspective.The Arab effort to destroy Israel evolved from trusting 
military force between 1948 and 1973, to economic boycotts and “international 
terrorism,” which all failed. Today’s “intellectual assault” is “no less” 
threatening than “physical danger,” Wilf warned, because “Israel was an idea 
before it was a country... If this idea of the Jewish people’s right to a 
homeland is undermined, the fundamental vision of Israel” as a Jewish state “is 
undermined.”Author Yossi Klein Halevi, from the Shalom Hartman 
Institute, analyzed how “anti-Zionism” has “restored respectability to 
anti-Semitism.”Defining anti-Semitism as “the tendency of a given 
civilization to identify the Jew with precisely what that civilization considers 
its most loathsome qualities,” he showed that making Israel, the collective Jew, 
the “arch violator of human rights... corrected the aberration of 
Nazism.”Classical anti-Semitism masqueraded as a benign force fighting 
bad Jews until Nazism’s evil destroyed that illusion. Modern anti-Zionism, 
blessed by Jewish shills, rehabilitates this historic hatred, going beyond 
legitimate debate over the outcomes of 1967, meaning Israel’s boundaries, to 
rejecting the results of 1948, treating Israel’s existence as 
criminal. Speakers proposed solutions too.The Reut Institute’s 
Daphna Kaufman recommended the Restoring Sanity petition 
(www.restoringsanity.info), which distinguishes between legitimate criticism and 
delegitimization (Full disclosure: I helped write it and we used the name before 
Jon Stewart did).FOR THOSE seeking to repudiate the upcoming anti- 
Israel week falsely peddling the apartheid libel, encouraging debate about the 
petition – and collecting signatures – are easy first steps.Aviva 
Raz-Shechter from the Foreign Ministry described how students successfully 
“delegitimized the delegitimizers” at Durban II. Ilan Wagner of the Jewish 
Agency moderated an important panel emphasizing individual students’ power to 
change campus dynamics through thoughtful, constructive, sincere activism, as 
part of a broader quest to build positive Jewish identity.This “Power of 
One” idea is the theme of Stand With Us, which cosponsored the event with the 
Avi Schaefer Foundation through the effective organization of educational 
consultant Dr. Elan Ezrachi. And Mark Regev, representing the prime minister, 
spoke movingly, endorsing Avi’s message of empathy in advocacy and true love in 
patriotism – a mature love acknowledging that “Israel isn’t perfect” while 
working to make it “better.”Summarizing the event, as the only professor 
there, I reassured the students that most North American campuses are not 
aflame. In fact, this is a golden age for Jews on campus – there have never been 
so many Jewish professors and students, so many Jewish studies programs and 
strong Hillels. That it is also a golden age for campus Israel-bashing requires 
subtlety. If students come ready to fight, they risk forgetting to learn and 
misreading their campus’s political culture. So, yes, the campus jihad 
inflames some campuses.And the academic jihad turns most Middle East 
studies courses into anti-Israel propaganda exercises, helping make Zionism 
politically incorrect on campus. But most students succumb to the careerist 
snoozefest, ignoring politics. Hysterics won’t cure these leaders of tomorrow of 
the anti-Israel poison; appropriate, tempered, democracy-loving, proactive 
strategies will.ULTIMATELY, THE evening’s message was best articulated 
by Avi Schaefer in an opening video, echoed by his twin brother, Yoav, who also 
volunteered in the IDF. He described his brother’s “deep idealism,” noting how 
Avi used his credibility as a soldier and his personal humility to inject 
humanity into a conflict that too frequently polarizes. By “listening deeply to 
others,” Avi helped change the tone at Brown. One Palestinian friend in the 
video thanked Avi for “helping me unclench my fist” – an impressive achievement 
in today’s atmosphere.Avi’s secret lay in respecting Palestinians but 
not forgetting to respect himself, his people, our story. He understood that 
Judaism is not just a religion. The Jewish people constitute a nation – and like 
other nations deserve to express our national rights in our homeland. Avi spoke 
passionately about Shabbat and about humous. He loved wandering Jerusalem, the 
Jewish people’s home base, wishing people “Shabbat shalom” and feeling normal, 
understood, accepted. And he loved the little things, including Israel’s 
national foods.Young Jews should follow Avi’s example, creating their 
own Zionist vision rooted in some of our most profound religious traditions and 
national expressions – like Shabbat – while delighting in the fun details that 
make a place feel like home. And they should build this Zionist identity not to 
score points, not to defeat anti- Semites, but to forge the kind of rich, 
fulfilling human identity, Avi’s parents Rabbi Arthur and Laurie Gross- Schaefer 
clearly gave him. In so doing, as a bonus, today’s students – tomorrow’s Zionist 
thinkers – will rise to Yoav Schaefer’s challenge and “build for Avi the world 
he would have built for us.”

<title>'Gender segregation practices are ‘apartheid‘'</title>
<date>16/11/2011</date>
<content>
MK Tzipi Hotovely, chairwoman of the Committee for the Advancement of the Status 
of Women, described on Wednesday the growing number of incidents in which women 
are excluded from the public space as “apartheid” which contradicts basic 
Israeli values.In recent months, a spate of incidents have come to 
public attention in which proponents of equal rights say women have been 
marginalized in a variety of ways.RELATED:Secular group marches against Mea Shearim segregationReform Movement: Remove gender barrier at Kotel entrance




In September, during Succot, 
separation barriers were erected in Jerusalem’s Mea She’arim neighborhood to 
prevent men and women mixing during the crowded and busy period of the 
holiday.Religious IDF soldiers also refused to listen to women singing 
at an army event because of a prohibition within Jewish law of listening to 
women sing in person.A complaint was submitted to the broadcasting 
authority about the exclusion of women on the haredi radio station Kol Berama, 
and the issue of gender-segregated buses in haredi neighborhoods has also not 
been resolved.Hotovely made her comments during the first-ever hearing 
of the Knesset Committee for the Advancement of the Status of Women into the 
issue, initiated by MK Einat Wilf (Independence).“The committee... sees 
the exclusion of women as apartheid which contradicts the values of the state of 
Israel and Jewish law,” Hotovely said. “We have to fight this phenomenon of 
radicalization that is being expressed through the exclusion of women [in public 
life], because it seriously injures [the rights] of women and society as a 
whole.”The committee will initiate legislation designed to deny public 
funds to any agencies that participate in the exclusion of women and will also 
closely watch further incidents of segregation and marginalization.“This 
phenomenon is a blatant infraction of equal rights carried out through the 
exploitation of public money which is provided by the state,” Hotovely 
added.The committee said that it would be asking that Egged and the 
Transportation Ministry provide within three months a document detailing any 
occurrences in which the ruling of the Supreme Court outlawing gender 
segregation on buses is infringed.MK Orit Zuaretz (Kadima) was also 
present at the hearing and further proposed that Egged demand that its drivers 
complete a form whenever any incident of segregation occurs.“The Supreme 
Court ruling was in January, how long does it take to draw up correct 
procedures,” she asked.The committee will consider the issue in a number 
of sittings throughout the Knesset winter session, and will discuss in 
particular the marginalization of women in the army, and in cities with large 
haredi populations such as Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh.The hearing was 
also attended by Rachel Azaria, a member of the Jerusalem City Council who was 
fired from the council coalition and stripped of her portfolios after 
petitioning the High Court against the Jerusalem Municipality to enforce the 
removal of segregation barriers during Succot.“It’s amazing that an 
alliance has been formed between extremists and the establishment,” Azaria said. 
“The haredi public realizes that it needs to be part of society, so we see 
military enlistment and participation in the workforce increasing in this 
community.But this threatens the extremists, who are burdening their 
communities with fabricated [laws] which are not halachic.
“Their goal is 
not to isolate women from the public sphere but to isolate the haredi community 
from the general community.”

<title>Group of Hollywood stars gets taste of the Holy Land</title>
<date>17/11/2011</date>
<content>
A delegation of silver screen and TV actors are taking part in a visit to Israel 
this week, during which they will meet with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu 
and President Shimon Peres.Already on their trip, the group has met with 
Palestinian Authority leaders in Ramallah.




RELATED:Alexander shows serious side, discusses peace with PeresAt a press conference in Tel 
Aviv on Thursday, the actors spoke about their impressions of Israel, including 
their visits to the rocket-battered town of Sderot, an Ethiopian absorption 
center and the Yad Vashem museum in Jerusalem. All expressed a great deal of 
enthusiasm about visiting Israel, though their excitement appeared to be 
tempered by some serious travel fatigue.The week-long trip is being led 
by the “Creative Coalition,” a politically active group made up of American 
entertainers, in collaboration with the American Israel Education Foundation, an 
organization affiliated with AIPAC.The actors on hand at the press 
conference included Patricia Arquette (True Romance and TV’s Medium); Richard 
Webb (known as “that guy from Wings”); Richard Schiff (Toby from The West Wing); 
and Rob Morrow, who played a Jewish doctor in Alaska on Northern Exposure in the 
’90s.Patricia Arquette spoke first, saying “as actors I feel that it’s 
important for us to say that the arts are for all people and we are 
nondenominational and that applies to Israel as well.”“We look forward 
to learning about the Arab side of the conflict as well and how we can as human 
beings bring art as a healing force.”Richard Schiff said that “for us 
living in the states, especially in Los Angeles, real life seems 
elusive...coming to Israel for the first time and feeling on a personal 
level the history of the nation is quite moving for me and what’s so impressive 
about this country is that there’s such a great sense of service among the 
people of Israel.”
For her part, KayCee Stroh of High School Musical said 
she expected there to be more conflict and to “see people spitting at each other 
on the street” in Israel, and was pleasantly surprised by “how respectful of how 
everybody is of each other.”
The visit wasn’t without its naysayers 
however, in the form of 5 Israeli Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions activists 
standing outside the hotel holding signs reading “Shame on you Hollywood” and 
“No culture in white-washing apartheid.”

<title>Israeli students embark on ‘hasbara’ journey to UK campuses</title>
<date>17/3/2011</date>
<content>
Twenty-four young Israelis will leave Thursday for a 10-day trip to what some would consider the lion’s den of anti-Israel propaganda and incitement – British university campuses – to combat anti-Israel messages students there are receiving from Israel Apartheid Week activities.More importantly, they hope their presence will humanize Israelis in the eyes of British students.




“We want to let people see that we don’t have horns and we don’t have pitchforks – we are ordinary people who live in a very complex area,” said Alon Kimhi, the founder of a new independent hasbara (public diplomacy) organization.While in Britain, Kimhi and his fellow Israelis, mostly students between the ages of 25 and 30, will give talks defending Israel on six campuses (the school names cannot be divulged due to security concerns).They will also be introducing British students to Israeli foods, visiting the House of Commons and speaking with British Parliament members, and meeting with Jewish communal leaders such as UK Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks.Most British university students who meet Kimhi and the other Israeli delegation members will find themselves interacting with Israelis for the first time, said Oliver Worth, chairman of the World Union of Jewish Students.Worth, who made aliya from Britain last year, put Kimhi in contact with a WUJS affiliate, the Union of Jewish Students of the UK and Ireland, which is handling the tour logistics.“This is the first time the UJS has embarked on an honest, open relationship with a group of Israeli students who are unaffiliated [with] any organization,” said Carly McKenzie, UJS campaigns director, who added that local Jewish students were eager to host the Israelis in their homes and Hillel centers.“I work all over the world, and from my experience, in terms of delegitimization of Israel and Israel Apartheid Week, Britain is the worst,” said Worth. “After their first event, word will get out and they will be met by quite a challenge. They’ve prepared well, but it will come as a surprise how hostile the atmosphere is.”Kimhi said he was not afraid, noting that “there are security measures we are taking.”The group’s preparation included a debating exercise run by Foreign 
Ministry professionals, and a weekend of training seminars held at 
Jerusalem’s Kiryat Moriah campus two weeks ago, paid for by the Jewish 
Agency for Israel.The professionals who worked with the students included Anne Herzberg, 
NGO Monitor’s legal adviser, and Yair Zivan, a former UJS campaigns 
director and cofounder of Kol Voice Seminars.Kimhi and his fellow Israeli representatives paid most of their airfares
 themselves, though the student unions at Ben- Gurion University of the 
Negev and the Weizmann Institute of Science provided some funding.“It’s a lot of money for a student, and a lot of time and preparation,” 
said Roi Wolf, the group’s spokesman. “We are spending a week and a half
 in England, but it’s not fun time because we’re going to be working.”Kimhi, 28, established the organization, which does not yet have an 
official name, three months ago after meeting with a government official
 who discussed difficulties related to overseas hasbara efforts.“I thought, ‘Why not try to build a group of students who know about 
this conflict, start the initiative and go to campuses?’” He spread the 
word via e-mails to friends and Facebook posts. Although between 50 and 
60 people expressed interest in joining, only 23 – sabras as well as 
olim from the US, Canada, Britain, New Zealand, Iran, and Kuwait – were 
accepted.“It’s a pilot [program], and I can’t take more people when I don’t know 
where I’m going,” said Kimhi, an MA student at Tel Aviv University 
writing his thesis in security studies.The Foreign Ministry and Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs Ministry 
have provided guidance, but the organization is not affiliated with the 
government and includes members with both left- and right-wing views, 
making it easier for the group to accomplish its objectives, said Wolf.“Our main positions are that Israel is not an apartheid state and that 
Israel should be a Jewish and democratic country – we’re not getting 
into whether or not we should be in Judea and Samaria,” he said.Kimhi decided the group’s inaugural mission would take place in Britain 
because it costs less for Israelis to travel to Europe than to the US, 
and because he has connections there. He said he hoped the organization 
would grow and eventually undertake missions to other countries.“Next time we’re hoping for not 24 students, but 500,” said Wolf, a 
31-year-old aide to National Union MK Arye Eldad, who recently received 
his MA in logistics from Bar-Ilan University. “We want to show young 
people in Israel that you can’t cry all the time about Israel’s image in
 the world, but you should take the initiative and do something.”Kimhi, Wolf and the other activists are focusing on combating 
anti-Israel propaganda overseas, but Israeli Apartheid Week events are 
also taking place in Israel.The Coalition of Women for Peace and Tel Aviv University campus 
organizations screened a film about the struggle to end apartheid in 
South Africa, Have You Heard From Johannesburg, and held a panel 
discussion at the Saraya Theater in Jaffa on Wednesday evening.“The main problem is coming from England, so it’s more symbolic for a 
group [of Israelis] to go to England than Jaffa, and here there are many
 pro-Israel organizations’” as opposed to abroad, said Kimhi.
The delegation members will post updates from their trip to Britain on their Facebook page, entitled “What Is RAEL.”

<title>MK Tibi to court: Overturn rejection of Nakba-deniers bill</title>
<date>21/7/2011</date>
<content>
MK Ahmed Tibi (United Arab List-Ta’al) presented a petition to the High Court of Justice Thursday against Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin’s rejection of his bill to prohibit government funding for organizations that deny the “Nakba.”“Nakba,” or catastrophe, is the name given by the Arab world to the founding of the State of Israel in 1948.




RELATED:Rivlin, deputies reject Tibi bill to commemorate 'Nakba' Tibi: 'Status quo will deepen apartheid in Israel' The petition was submitted on Tibi’s behalf by Adalah-The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel.Tibi’s bill proposed empowering the Minister of Finance to cut state funding to organizations that “deny publicly that Nakba Day was a historical, real event that constitutes a disaster for the Palestinian people.”The bill was a response to an Israel Beiteinu “Nakba Bill,” which called for cutting government funding to organizations that recognize the Nakba.Tibi dubbed the rejection of his bill “a dark day for democracy.”The High Court petition claims Tibi presented the bill to open a Knesset discussion about the Nakba, in order that he might convince MKs that the Nakba Bill was “an injustice to the Palestinian minority in Israel.”The petition also argues Israel Beiteinu’s bill denies Arab citizens their history, which it claims is inconsistent with the principle of equal citizenship.In rejecting the bill earlier this month, Rivlin explained he had voted against the legislation because it rejects the State of Israel as a Jewish state.“This bill is clearly defiant and provokes the State of Israel, and therefore, its place is not on the Knesset’s table,” Rivlin said.“This bill says the State of Israel is the reason for the Palestinian tragedy. If the Nakba is a tragedy, then the establishment of the State of Israel is a tragedy. The Palestinians experienced a catastrophe that was brought on by their leaders, but the establishment of the State of Israel is not the reason for it.”The petition also criticizes the decision of the Knesset speaker to reject Tibi’s bill on the grounds that it denies Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. The rejection of the bill was the first time in Israel’s history that a bill proposed by an Arab MK was rejected for this reason.“Indeed, MK Ahmed Tibi is opposed to the definition of the state as a Jewish state, and he espouses the idea of a ‘multinational’ state – and he has made a declaration to that effect before the court in a different case,” the petition reads.“However, the bill in question does not concern this issue. It is concerned with the historical narrative of the Arab minority in Israel.”Lawyer Hassan Jabareen, director-general of Adalah, said the Knesset’s rejection of the bill severely affects the rights of the parliamentary minority, including parliamentary freedom of expression and equality between MKs.“The debate over the Nakba already took place in the ‘Nakba Bill,’ and in that debate there were those in favor and those who opposed it,” Jabareen noted. “There was no claim then that raising the subject in the assembly raised any sort of problems that prohibited parliamentary debate.”Jabareen also said MK Tibi wanted to challenge the “Nakba Bill” on the grounds of a paragraph that he deemed to be racist.“The decision that prevented [Tibi] from raising a subject that the coalition itself already raised and debated before the committees and before the assembly is discriminatory and one that is tainted with extraneous motives and considerations,” said Jabareen.After filing the petition, Tibi admitted that had the bill not been rejected, it would not have stood a chance of approval had it been brought to the vote.“However, part of my role as an elected public official is to always raise the issue of the Nakba and the historical narrative of those who elected me,” he said. “So, challenging the dominant discourse of the majority in Israel, which denies the narrative of the Nakba, is a necessary part of the historical process for official recognition of that narrative and for promoting historic reconciliation between two peoples.”Tibi compared his efforts to have the Nakba officially recognized to those of Native Americans and Indigenous Australians to have their rights recognized after the founding of the USA and Australia.MK Alex Miller (Israel Beiteinu), who proposed the original “Nakba Bill,” forbidding state funding of Nakba Day events, spoke out against Tibi’s move.
“Unfortunately, once again we are witnessing an attempt by a member of 
Israel’s parliament, who tries again and again to cancel the State of 
Israel’s Jewish and democratic nature,” Miller said.“I believe that the High Court will not take part in Tibi’s absurdist 
theater and cancel his petition immediately, as the Knesset Speaker and 
his deputies did.”Likud MK Danny Danon said that how“just like Tibi’s bill was thrown out 
of the Knesset, so will his petition be thrown out and erased from the 
High Court.”Referring to his bill to investigate foreign funding of left wing NGOs, 
Danon called for “a thorough investigation of the sources of MK Tibi’s 
funding, including the organizations aiding him in his legal 
activities.”
Danon’s NGO probe bill was rejected in Knesset Wednesday.

<title>MK Tibi writes ‘Dvar Torah’ on Joseph</title>
<date>13/12/2011</date>
<content>
Torah Tidbits is a popular English-language newsletter on the weekly Torah 
portion – but what about “Torah Tibi?” Chakima, the Knesset’s weekly Torah 
newsletter, printed a Bible lesson by MK Ahmed Tibi (United Arab List-Ta’al) on 
Tuesday, the first by a Muslim MK.




RELATED:Tibi: 'Status quo will deepen apartheid in 
Israel'Likud MKs slam Tibi over speech at Arafat’s 
graveWriters for Chakima come from all over 
the religious spectrum – from haredi to secular – but until this week, the 
contributing politicians have all been Jewish.Chakima prints an MK’s or 
minister’s take on the weekly Torah portion every week, many of which have 
political undertones, as does Tibi’s, which features a thinly-veiled comparison 
of Jewish Israelis to Joseph’s jealous brothers.Tibi explained that he 
chose to write about this week’s Torah portion, Vayeshev from the Book of 
Genesis, because it focuses on Joseph, who is not only a pivotal figure in the 
Bible, but a “beloved prophet in Islam” who is the focus of an entire chapter 
(Sura Yussuf) in the Koran.According to the MK’s article in Chakima, 
Joseph is a “wonderful character” and the ninth prophet according to Islam. The 
Torah, however, does not describe Joseph as a prophet, but calls him one of the 
fathers of the Jewish people, a righteous man and role model.“Discussing 
the character of Joseph can lead to an argument between religions – Does Joseph 
belong to Jews or Arabs? – but Islam believes that the Bible was also written by 
God,” Tibi explained.He added that the biblical story of Joseph is seen 
as truth by Muslims, who believe that the Koran’s description enriches the 
story.Tibi said one of Joseph’s most admirable traits was his naivete, 
which could be seen when he described his dream to his brothers, and did not 
recognize their jealousy.“However, the cruel reality showed him that he 
cannot live this way,” Tibi wrote.“The lesson he learned made him 
stronger and turned him from a naive child to an important member of Pharaoh's 
court.”Tibi then quoted Palestinian national poet Mahmoud Darwish’s poem 
“I Am Yusuf, Oh My Father,” in which Joseph is a metaphor for the 
Palestinians.
The poem includes the lines “my brothers do not love me/ do 
not want me among them, father. They attack me and stone me/ and want me to die” 
and ends with “it became clear that they are jealous/ what did I do to them, 
father?” Tibi wrote that he loves Darwish’s poem, and identifies with its 
message.

<title>NGO petitions for Sephardi schoolgirls' rights</title>
<date>8/12/2011</date>
<content>
An equal-rights NGO asked the High Court of Justice on Thursday to end 
discrimination in haredi schools.Yoav Laloum, director of the Noar 
Kahalacha organization, submitted a petition requesting that an injunction be 
issued against the Education Ministry and its minister, Gideon Sa’ar.




RELATED:Sexual
 abuse case sheds light on Emmanuel's ethnic tensionsThe 
petition demands that the respondents explain why they have not “fulfilled their 
legal obligation to use all means available to them to eliminate discriminatory 
practices against Mizrahi girls wishing to enroll in haredi 
schools.”According to Laloum, data and documents collected by Noar 
Kahalacha and submitted in the petition demonstrate that a de facto 30 percent 
quota for Sephardi girls exists in many haredi high schools, particularly in the 
most prestigious schools in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, Betar Illit and Modi’in 
Illit.Speaking to the press at the Supreme Court in Jerusalem on 
Thursday, Laloum said he had talked that morning with a girl who was rejected by 
a haredi school and is currently not enrolled at all.“You would not have 
wanted to be me during this conversation,” Laloum said, visibly emotional. “The 
girl cried in front of me, and for what? What did she do? All she wants to do is 
learn.”The petition claims that there is a “clear division between 
‘blacks’ and ‘whites’ in the haredi secondary education system in 2011, a system 
licensed by the state and funded and supported by the state.There are 
ghettoes for the ‘black-Mizrachim,’ and there are institutes which insist at all 
costs that the number of Mizrachim not exceed, ‘God forbid,’ 
30%.”Relating to one data set gleaned from a Jerusalem school examined 
by Noar Kahalacha, the petition declares that “for all intents and purposes a 
form of apartheid segregation exists in this school between Ashkenazim and 
Sephardim.”Although the schools in question receive the majority of 
their funds from the state, the petition alleges the Ministry of Education and 
the local authorities do not properly supervise the registration process, 
despite being aware of the issue.Laloum denounced the ultra- Orthodox 
school administrators as “thieves and criminals,” and called on MKs Eli Yishai, 
Ariel Attias and the Shas movement as a whole to join him and help their 
community on this issue.He denied accusations that there was any 
betrayal of the haredi community by taking the issue to the High Court, which 
traditionally shuns secular courts, saying that all other avenues had been 
pursued and that he had reached out to political lobbyists, MKs and haredi 
political parties to no avail.“No one wanted to touch this hot potato, 
so now we have no choice but to submit this petition,” he said.Laloum 
also said that he had received widespread support, including rabbinical backing, 
from across the religious spectrum, including from Ashkenazim.“You have 
no idea how much the Ashkenazi community is disgusted with this corrupt behavior 
of the school administrators, which is also given the full support by the 
political representatives of the haredi community in the Knesset.”In 
2008, Laloum and Noar Kahalacha petitioned the High Court regarding the Beit 
Ya’acov primary school for girls in the settlement of Emmanuel. Hassidic parents 
at the school had established a separate track for girls from more observant 
families, which in practice meant that the overwhelming majority of girls in the 
hassidic track were Ashkenazi. The two tracks were taught in separate 
classrooms.It was claimed that the separate tracks were established 
because the Sephardi families were less stringent in their observance of Jewish 
law than the Ashkenazi parents, and so negatively influence the Ashkenazi 
girls.The High Court rejected these claims and demanded that the school 
re-integrate.Renegade Shas MK Haim Amsalem, who spoke out strongly 
against the segregated school, criticized the Ministry of Education on Thursday, 
accusing it of “working hand in hand with the school administrators and the 
haredi political parties to silence the issue and perpetuate 
discrimination.”
The Shas party, he said, was founded to uproot this kind 
of phenomenon, but does nothing apart from disseminating spin about legislation 
it is seeking to propose.

<title>NGOs: Bill is a ‘shameful moment' for Israel</title>
<date>13/11/2011</date>
<content>
Immediately after the Ministerial Committee on Legislation’s vote in favor of  two bills limiting foreign governments' donations to NGOs on Sunday, civil 
rights groups and leftwing NGOs – who stand to see a substantial cut in funding 
– were unanimous in attacking the decision.The New Israel Fund slammed 
the committee’s vote to pass the bill as a “shameful moment in the history of 
Israeli democracy” and called on Knesset members to “vote against the bill and 
remove this black stain from the face of Israel.”




RELATED:PM postpones vote on judicial selection reformLivni: Those backing 'NGO probe bill' are against IsraelIn a scathing 
statement, Hagai El-Ad, executive director of the Association for Civil Rights 
in Israel, accused the government of seeking to undermine Israel’s 
democracy.“The current government is leading an assault on the 
foundations of democracy,” said El-Ad, adding that the Ministerial Committee had 
been expected to vote on two bills on Sunday, including proposed legislation to 
change the way Supreme Court justices are elected.“The Supreme Court’s 
very independence was endangered today, as are the freedom of operations for 
human rights organizations.But even further, the government insists on 
attacking freedom of expression and the rights of Arab citizens,” El-Ad 
continued, saying that ACRI vowed “in the face of this attack to continue to 
fight for human rights.”“We are steadfast in our opposition to Knesset 
legislation aimed at derailing Israeli democracy,” he added.Sarit Michaeli, spokeswoman for human rights NGO B’Tselem, which operates in Israel 
and the Palestinian territories, also blasted the bill, accusing Prime Minister 
Binyamin Netanyahu of “degrading the international position of 
Israel.”However, Michaeli vowed that B’Tselem would “not be silenced” by 
the legislation.“B’Tselem will be silent only when Israel stops 
violating human rights in the occupied territories,” said Michaeli. “Until then, 
we will continue to expose the injustices of the occupation.Every 
country needs democratic and human rights groups, and B’Tselem’s activity 
contributes to a more just Israeli society.”Peace Now Director Yariv 
Oppenheimer attacked the Ministerial Committee’s approval of the bill as “worse 
and more dangerous than the ‘price-tag’ attacks,” referring to the acts of 
vandalism by right-wing groups and individuals against Palestinian property in 
the West Bank.“The government is trying to stifle the law and does not 
care about the position of the attorney-general, who determined that the 
proposed law is unconstitutional,” said Oppenheimer. “Israeli democracy has been 
surrendered to right-wing extremists and is in a state of 
bankruptcy.”Human rights NGO Yesh Din was similarly scathing about the 
bill’s approval.“Accepting donations from foreign countries is not 
wrong,” said the NGO’s spokeswoman, Hila Aloni, in a statement. “Human rights in 
the occupied territories is not an ‘internal Israeli matter,’ no more than 
Iran’s nuclear policy is an ‘internal Iranian matter.’” On the Right, in 
contrast, NGOs welcomed the Ministerial Committee’s approval of the 
bill.Nachi Eyal, director of legal advocacy NGO the Legal Forum for the 
Land of Israel, which describes itself as being “tasked with protecting human 
rights and ensuring sound government,” said legislation to prevent foreign 
donations would “protect Israelis and Israeli democracy from those seeking to do 
them evil.”“The involvement of foreign countries in Israel’s internal 
affairs is undermining democracy, and is a fifth column for political purposes 
and to influence the public,” said Eyal.Extra-parliamentary Zionist 
advocacy group NGO Im Tirtzu said in response to the bill that “the time has 
come for the Knesset to put a stop to foreign political donations,” while NGO 
Regavim, whose stated aim is to “preserve the lands of Israel for the Jewish 
people,” said the bill would make NGO funding “more fair and 
equal.”Professor Gerald Steinberg, president of Jerusalem-based 
organization NGO Monitor, which analyzes NGO activity, including funding, told 
the The Jerusalem Post on Sunday that the bill highlighted an important domestic 
political issue – that of Israelis’ concerns over NGO funding.“MKs, 
especially on the Right, see this as a significant issue for the Israeli 
public,” said Steinberg, who added that the problem lies with “secretive” 
European government funding to NGOs in Israel.“We’re not just talking 
about groups like Peace Now, but also other NGOs that say Israel is an apartheid 
state or that Israelis are war criminals,” said Steinberg. “If European 
governments provided transparency over their funding instead of conducting it in 
a secretive way, it would be far less of an intense issue for 
Israelis.”
However, Steinberg added that he expected there to be 
“significant legislative changes” to the bill before it passed into law. “The 
concept was approved, but not the details.”

<title>Police can't stamp out radicalism among haredim</title>
<date>28/12/2011</date>
<content>
When police are called in to deal with a problem, it usually means that 
preventative measures have not been tried to nip the developing issue in the 
bud.Nowhere is this more apparent than the eruption of extremist conduct 
by hard-line elements of the haredi population.




RELATED:Female MK to sit at front of 'mehadrin' bus Police planning crackdown on Beit Shemesh radicalsSenior police commanders

police are certainly able to apprehend a large number of suspects for verbally 
assaulting members of the public, and can challenge instances of illegal gender 
apartheid, they can never stamp the problem out, because of the deep rooted 
social and religious factors that simmer beneath the phenomenon.This 
includes the acceptance by successive governments of the notion that the haredi 
community can exist in a largely parallel world apart from the rest of society, 
with its own education system and internal justice system.This fact has 
allowed self-appointed puritanical enforcers to terrorize fellow 
haredim.It was only a matter of time before the militants spilled out of 
their own community and into the wider public sphere.Israel’s police 
force of 28,000 officers is chronically understaffed. It faces the unique 
challenge of having to fight ordinary crime as well as quelling 
nationalistic-religious unrest and taking on counter-terrorism roles.In 
addition to these vital missions, it must now also respond to offenses that stem 
from a complex social breakdown.
Only other authorities, led by the 
government, can collectively get to the roots of haredi extremism, and prevent 
tensions from posing an even greater threat to Israel’s internal cohesion.

<title>Protesters rally at US embassy in TA to slam UNSC veto</title>
<date>19/2/2011</date>
<content>
Around 50 protesters rallied outside the US Embassy in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, to protest the US veto on Friday of a UN Security Council resolution calling Israeli settlements ‘illegal’ and calling for an immediate halt in their construction.Holding signs reading “stop US-supported occupation” and “Veto settlements, vote justice” and chanting “UN, US, it’s time for B.D.S.”, (Boycott, divestment, and sanctions against Israel) the demonstrators took issue with what they said is continued American approval and compliance with controversial Israeli policies.




RELATED:PA: We'll turn to UN General Assembly to stop settlements'US warned PA on UN resolution for settlement-freeze'One protester, 68-year-old Beate Zilversmidt from Holon, held a sign reading “Obama: A real friend doesn’t let me drive drunk.”Zilversmidt said she came to demonstrate because the veto “gives Israel more time to think we can keep doing whatever we want, that it doesn’t matter what the world thinks because we have this big friend the US supporting us. Israel can’t continue in this way.”Activist Ronnie Barkan told The Jerusalem Post that the protest is part 
of “a new campaign pointing a finger at the US complicity in Israeli 
crimes.”
Barkan called the veto “just a continuation of the same 
policies of the US, which are going against the consensus of world 
opinion and civil society protests against Israeli actions. The veto 
clearly shows how utterly complicit the US is in funding and supporting 
Israeli crimes and shows again that Israeli apartheid is an 
American-Israeli project.”

<title>Thirty-eight 'Flightilla' activists deported to Europe</title>
<date>11/7/2011</date>
<content>
Thirty-eight foreign pro-Palestinian activists were deported on Sunday 
evening.They had been held in prison since they arrived at Ben-Gurion 
Airport on Friday planning to participate in a mass fly-in in support of 
Palestinian statehood.




RELATED:‘Flightilla’ activists deported, detained or allowed entryAyalon thanks European states for helping stop 'flightilla' Thirty-five of the activists were put on a 
Lufthansa flight to Germany and one was placed on a Alitalia flight on their way 
to Spain.Another two activists were sent to Belgium late on Saturday 
night and four were released after they signed papers promising not to 
participate in provocative actions against Israel while in the 
country.As of Sunday night, 82 activists were still in Israeli prisons 
awaiting deportation.The Interior Ministry said they would likely be 
sent home in the next few days.Some activists who were able to make it 
through passport control at Ben-Gurion on Friday, along with Palestinians and 
other foreigners, gathered in Bethlehem on Sunday for the start of a week of 
protests.Friday’s flights, dubbed the “Flightilla,” along with the 
protests, are part of the Welcome to Palestine initiative organized by 40 
non-governmental groups.In Bethlehem, the activists gathered around noon 
at a section of the West Bank security barrier that separates the Palestinian 
Authority-controlled city from Jerusalem.For several minutes, they 
pounded in unison on a steel gate in the barrier with their fists, asking that 
it be opened. One woman used a stick.They shouted, “Free Palestine” and 
“Shame on you!” at the soldiers in the guard tower above, who peered out from 
the windows to see what was going on.“We are here today to make sure 
that this city will remain Palestinian,” Canadian activist Riso al-Tamini, whose 
family is originally from Iraq, told her fellow protesters. “This is global 
cause, a democratic cause and a peace cause,” she said, reading from a prepared 
text on her cellphone.“It is time for the whole world to come here and 
to demand that the apartheid stop,” Tamini said.On Monday, protesters 
will gather in Nablus and Jenin. On Tuesday, they will be in Hebron, and later 
in the week they will demonstrate in Jerusalem.

<title>Thousands demonstrate to mark 35th Land Day</title>
<date>31/3/2011</date>
<content>
Thousands took part in demonstrations in the North and South on Wednesday to mark the 35th annual Land Day, an Israeli Arab protest day against land expropriations by the state.The largest demonstration was held in Arraba, where thousands marched to a demonstration in the center of town. Over a thousand protesters took part in a separate rally at the unrecognized Beduin village of Al-Araqib in the Negev, which has been demolished by the Israel Lands Authority repeatedly since last Summer.




RELATED:Fayyad: Peaceful resistance advancing Palestinian state'Burning Lieberman photos on Land Day is legitimate'‘Arab spring’ not expected to provoke mass Land Day protestLike every year, this Land Day was marked by a general strike in the Arab sector called by the Arab Higher Monitoring Committee. Head of the committee Mohammed Zidane said Wednesday that this Land Day he “sees a progression of racist laws and oppression directed at the Arab sector.”Zidane said the state is launching a series of such laws, mentioning in particular the socalled loyalty bill and Nakba Law. He said the Arab sector “does not and will not accept these laws that discriminate against us and degrade us”, and added that Israel “is changing into apartheid South Africa.”He said the Arab sector is drawing inspiration from the recent upheaval in the Arab world, where he said “the Arab people are paying a high price for their freedom.”Like Zidane, MK Taleb a-Sanaa (United Arab List) said that this year’s Land Day took place while “Lieberman’s laws are posing a threat to democracy and co-existence in Israel. There is widespread incitement against the Arab community in Israel and it is acted out through actions like home demolitions and legislation like the Nakba Law.”Sanaa said the current Knesset is carrying out “legislative terror” against Israeli Arabs and Israeli democracy, and forcing Arabs “into a position where they must either choose between being part of their Palestinian nationality or part of Israel.”He added that he has no doubt that the threats to Israel’s democracy are getting worse and said, “I believe that like in Tunisia, where greater and greater pressure exerted by the government led to an explosive situation, also here we have continued government pressure that is leading us somewhere no one can predict.”For the past 35 years, Land Day has been held to mark the anniversary of the 1976 deaths of six Galilee Arabs who perished in clashes with Israeli authorities over land confiscations.Police this week carried out their annual 
security arrangements before the protests, but Wednesday’s 
demonstrations passed without any violence.The annual commemorations of the October 2000 riots, which left 13 
Israeli Arabs dead following fighting with police and the army have 
tended to overshadowed Land Day over the past decade.In addition, this year’s Nakba Day on May 15, the civil anniversary of 
Israeli independence, is expected to be the biggest ever, following 
recently passed legislation that allows for fining local authorities who
 hold events to mark the date as a “catastrophe.”At the protest at Al-Araqib on Wednesday, MK Ahmed Tibi (United Arab 
List) said “the color of our skin is the same as the color of the Earth 
here. Still, there are those whose skin is the color of the snow in 
Moldova who are looking to expel us and dispossess us from this land,” 
an apparent reference to Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman (Israel 
Beitenu), a native of Moldova.Tibi added “this land here speaks Arabic,” and said that the “rising 
racism” demands greater Jewish-Arab cooperation on the protest front.Lieberman has been a particular target of the protests, largely because 
his party sponsored the loyalty bill, Nakba Law, and the Admission 
Committees Law. Pictures of Lieberman were burned at a protest held in 
Lod on Tuesday, which focused on the demolitions of houses belonging to 
the local Abu Eid family last December.
Another Land Day protest will be held in Jaffa on Friday, with a 
particular emphasis on the housing shortage affecting the city’s Arab 
community.

<title>U. of Johannesburg signs research agreement with BGU</title>
<date>10/7/2011</date>
<content>
Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and the University of Johannesburg have 
signed a new research agreement, nearly four months after UJ decided to cut its 
ties to BGU over what it referred to as the university’s support of the 
IDF.In a statement posted on the UJ website last Thursday, the 
university announced that an agreement had been signed between scientists from 
UJ, BGU and the University of California, Los Angeles, and Belgium’s Ghent 
University, “to pursue research collaboration on nanotechnology enhanced water 
treatment membrane materials and processes.”




Prof. Ihron Rensburg, vice 
chancellor and principal of UJ, is quoted in a separate announcement on the 
website as saying “the University of Johannesburg strongly upholds academic 
freedom and the right of its academic staff to develop relationships with 
whomsoever they wish.”Rensburg added that “the signing of this contract 
by the institutions and between the researchers, which includes academics from 
the United States and Belgium, merely reinforces UJ’s commitment to academic 
freedom.”According to UJ, the BGU professor who will take part in the 
project is Prof.Yoram Oren from the department of desalination and water 
treatment at the Zuckerberg Institute for Water Research.On Friday, BGU 
issued a statement saying, “We are confident that the combined energies and 
passions of the researchers involved will produce results that will have a 
direct impact on South Africa’s clean water supply. It will also contribute to 
the development of a world-class cohort of scientists in South 
Africa.”In March, UJ voted to allow the research ties with BGU to expire 
in April 2011, placing the future of the schools’ cooperative project on water 
purification and biotechnology in doubt.The UJ vote was supported by 60 
percent of the school’s senate. The vote did not preclude individual UJ 
academics from working with BGU counterparts, but required that such 
collaboration be done informally without institutional support.The vote 
came after the university launched a petition supported by Archbishop Desmond 
Tutu in September 2010 that called for the university to cut its ties with BGU 
over what it said is the school’s support for the IDF. The petition was 
eventually signed by more than 250 South African academics.Also in 
March, UJ published a report titled “Findings on Ben-Gurion University of the 
Negev: Institutional complicity and active collaboration with Israeli military, 
occupation and apartheid practices.” The report cited BGU’s program that awards 
scholarships to IDF reservists and IAF pilots.The UJ vote in March 
received widespread condemnation from supporters of Israel, including the 
Anti-Defamation League, whose National Director Abraham H. Foxman said “the 
decision by the University of Johannesburg to sever ties with Ben- Gurion 
University was misguided and shortsighted.”
Foxman added that “in 
demonizing and rejecting BGU solely because it is an Israeli academic 
institution, this highly political decision does nothing to promote 
Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation and understanding. Moreover, it will deprive 
all South Africans of the new technologies being developed by BGU scientists to 
purify water.”

<title>Abu Tir or Abu Tur</title>

Israel does not remain silent in the face of terror attacks: In a consultation of ministers in the Prime Minister's Office, it was decided to respond to the attack in Tel Aviv by "stripping the residency" of three Hamas members of the Palestinian parliament who reside in East Jerusalem. In simple language, this is called expulsion. The attorney general, Menachem Mazuz, was quick to certify this abomination as "kosher." In this case, he did not need time to reach a decision, despite the fact that it constitutes collective punishment - only because "Hamas leaders failed to denounce the attack" and "some even justified it." 
The fact that this not only entails the expulsion of innocent people, but also a serious violation of freedom of speech did not arouse any special interest. Several Arab MKs who met with the three candidates for expulsion were widely condemned, instead of receiving support from Jewish MKs, advocates of human rights. Because this is the essence of freedom of speech. It is measured at those very times when distasteful words are sounded, and it also applies to elected Palestinian officials. The poor policemen in Jerusalem are at their wits' end: One day they are instructed to prevent Palestinian elected officials who live in the city from traveling to the territories, and the next day they are told to expel them from the city to the territories. This is how Israel's consistent policy looks. 
But the ridiculous Israeli response of "stripping residency," which was concocted by the "moderate" and "enlightened" foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, constitutes an insult to the intelligence of even those Israelis who wish to see their government "do something" against terrorism. A much more profound question arises: What exactly do we want in Jerusalem? Do we want to annex its occupied sections and pay the heavy political and demographic price of this step, or do we plan to give to the Palestinians what belongs to the Palestinians and to the Jews what belongs to the Jews? 
Jerusalem, including its occupied sections, will either be an inseparable part of the State of Israel, and all of its residents (including those who voted for Hamas in the Palestinian Authority's democratic elections) will enjoy all of the rights accorded to the general public, or Israel will separate from the occupied part of the city and transfer it to the Palestinians. You do not want Hamas in Jerusalem? So, please separate. Even in Jerusalem, you cannot have your cake and eat it too. 
This is even truer because it has already been a rearguard battle for some time. The future of Jerusalem has been decided and any reasonable person can see that the city will indeed be divided, despite the annexation efforts of Israel, which reached a peak during Ehud Olmert's days as mayor. Every extreme nationalistic organization, every delusional NGO and every eccentric yeshiva that aspired to invade more and more Arab homes in the capital received Olmert's support, and yet the city remained clearly binational. 
Even 1,000 officers from the Jerusalem Police on duty in the soccer field of Zur Baher to prevent Hamas from staging rallies will not convince residents who support and voted for the organization to stop supporting it. Just as the repeated summoning of the Jerusalem representative in parliament, Mahmoud Abu Tir, to the police station (under suspicion of violating an order prohibiting the convening of the rally in Zur Baher) will only enhance the influence of the red-bearded man, who until recently was unknown to most Palestinians. Just as the bombastic closing of Orient House in its day did not reduce the support of most residents for Fatah. 
And what did we get after we closed Orient House? The Hamas soccer field. We can only look back longingly to Orient House now - not only because of its stylish architecture, but mainly due to the fact that inside its walls a real discussion was conducted about negotiating with Israel and achieving peace. At the soccer field in Zur Baher, other voices - much more extreme - would have been sounded had the rally been held. And perhaps these extreme voices would not have arisen had Orient House not been closed. 
A quarter of a million Palestinians live in Jerusalem, comprising about a third of the city's residents. The underlying Israeli aspiration to hold onto the occupied territory without its residents is unrealistic. The aspiration to perpetuate an apartheid regime in the city is also out of the question. Those who should have been first to call for dividing the city are the ones who yearn for "a Jewish majority" and sow fear of "the demographic danger." 
In a flash, Israel could have "rid itself" of a quarter of a million Palestinians, whose percentage of the city's population will only increase. But Israel chooses to continue the annexation of East Jerusalem, and this comes with a price. It is impossible to go "with" and to feel "without." United Jerusalem is a Jerusalem with Abu Tir as an authentic representative of the residents, and with a Hamas rally at one of its soccer fields. Ehud Olmert must finally give a truthful answer: Abu Tir or Abu Tur.

<title>A commission to investigate the occupation</title>
<date>Mon Sep 04 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
During the past two months, July and August, 251 Palestinians were killed in Gaza and the West Bank, all of them by Israel Defense Forces fire. About half of them were civilians, including women, children and the elderly. More Palestinians than Israelis were killed during the war in Lebanon, even though the Palestinians did not participate in the war and were not subjected to Katyusha fire. 
There has been a total freeze in the diplomatic process between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The road map has not been mentioned for a long time. There is no disengagement and no realignment. There are no unilateral moves, and certainly no negotiations between the two sides. Occasionally, low-level officials meet to discuss essential everyday issues. And there have apparently been indirect contacts about releasing Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. But the only area in which Israel and the Palestinians currently maintain relations is the violent conflict: raids, shootings, shellings, terror attacks, arrests, roadblocks, expropriations. Killed and wounded. 
There ought to be a state commission of inquiry about what is happening in the Palestinian territories. For all its importance, and all the shock in Israel over what happened in the Lebanon war, this war cannot be compared to what has been happening for almost 40 years in the territories occupied by Israel during the Six Day War. Whatever inquiry is conducted into the Lebanon war, it will at most find that the prime minister made a mistake one day, and that the defense minister and the chief of staff made incorrect decisions on another day, and that one general and several brigade commanders did not understand what was happening in the field on a certain night, and that food and drink did not arrive in time. There is no comparison at all between mistakes of that kind and the fateful failures of all Israeli governments since 1967 with regard to the West Bank and Gaza. These involved erroneous decisions of historic magnitude. 
The state commission of inquiry into the disasters engendered by the Israeli regime in the territories should include historians, social psychologists, sociologists and scholars of culture and religion, and not necessarily former generals and Supreme Court justices. Such a commission would probably discover that there is a strong connection between the wars in Lebanon and what occurred between us and the Palestinians during those years, and that our control over the West Bank and Gaza contributed quite a bit to the continuing deterioration in the north. 
Over time, the number of those who remember what happened in the Palestinian territories after 1967 is gradually declining. Who remembers, for example, that due to Israel's belief that Arab leaders were purposely leaving the refugees in wretched situations in the camps in order to incite them against Israel, Israeli governments decided to solve the refugee problem in Gaza through reconstruction? For a while, Israel took several steps in that direction. But they turned out to be divorced from reality, and were halted. Who remembers that the basic principle articulated by then defense minister Moshe Dayan was to allow full freedom of movement for Israelis and Palestinians from Dan to Eilat, and that for over 20 years, there was not a single checkpoint between the territories and the State of Israel? Who remembers that Dayan also gave an order to reduce the official Israeli presence in the territories to a minimum: no flags, no patrols and of course, no settlements near Arab communities? 
There were terror attacks then, too, but with no comparison to what began during the intifada years. There were years when fewer than five administrative detainees from the territories were in Israeli prisons. Today, as we know, there are thousands. 
What happened during the 20 years that have elapsed since then? During the earlier period, were the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza fond of the Israeli regime? Of course not. So how did we get to where we are now? Does the blame lie with the settlement enterprise, which created a blatant apartheid regime in the territories and led to feelings of bitterness and deprivation, a sense of being robbed? Or perhaps the decisions made about East Jerusalem were mistaken? What resulted from the mistakes in the Oslo Accords? And where is the separation fence leading? All this is far more important than what happened just now in Lebanon, and it is this situation that should be the subject of a state commission of inquiry.

<title>An endangered state</title>
<date>Sun Sep 03 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
It is hard to believe, but only 60 years after the Holocaust the Jewish people is once again in danger of being destroyed - at least in its own state, where 40 percent of the world's Jews are concentrated. Evidence of the severity of the danger can be found not only in the explicit threats by Iran's president, which are backed up by an arms program that would provide the means to carry them out. It can also be found in recent articles in the European press that discuss the possibility of Israel's 'disappearance' as a reasonable 'working assumption.' Additional evidence regarding the threat level exists in the fact that not only is Israel the only country in the world that is threatened with destruction, it is also the only state whose right to exist is the focus of international polls, with many respondents answering negatively. That is an honor that even Iran, North Korea and apartheid-era South Africa were never granted. 
The high degree of danger places before Israel a challenge no less serious than that facing the Jewish people in the 1930s. To face it, we must depart from the routines of hedonistic Western society. As a layman, I will not make recommendations in the area of security, but will instead relate to the general nature of public debate: first of all, there must be a focused agenda. The public, and in particular diplomatic and military officials, must put this threat at the top of their priorities, even at the expense of issues that during normal times would be the focus of attention. 
Personal interests must be put aside in favor of concentrating all the forces of good in Israel, the Jewish people and its supporters worldwide. One practical conclusion might be to create an emergency government in Israel, or at least to invite the opposition to participate in decisions on the Iranian issue. Another possible conclusion is that 'making heads roll,' for example in the wake of this summer's war, is a means and not an end, and should be considered a waste of energy and avoided unless absolutely necessary. In the event that it is necessary to restore public trust, which currently appears to be the case, then it must be done without hesitation. 
The same principle holds for the structure of the various committees of inquiry into the war: The goal is not to make heads roll but rather to learn lessons for the future. Thus it is preferable to create a two-stage process. In the first stage, the committee should not punish individuals, but rather make recommendations and draft an implementation schedule. In the second stage, the committee should check whether the recommendations have been carried out and only then fire those who were negligent in their implementation. 
Complete openness of thought is required, from extreme hawkishness to extreme dovishness. The threat to the very existence of Israel demands that any means to preserve it should be adopted, without giving in to ideological assumptions. If hesitating to hurt Lebanese civilians in response to attacks on us could send Iran the message that we will hesitate to hurt civilians if Iran strikes us, then we must not be deterred. If making peace with Syria, even if it entails evacuating communities, could damage the new 'eastern front,' then we should do that. Here it is worthwhile to note another step that appears even more important than peace with Syria. One of the reasons Iran can threaten to destroy Israel with impunity is Israel's image as a Jewish 'weed' combined with the tendency to ignore Israel's 1 million Arabs, who would also be affected by a nuclear attack. Israel's Jews and Arabs thus have a shared existential interest in strengthening their partnership. It is also necessary to drive home to the Arab world the fact that a leader who is neither Arab nor Sunni is willing to destroy not only millions of Jews but also hundreds of thousands of Muslim Arabs. 
Calmness is necessary: the threat level is high enough to warrant panic, but precisely because of the seriousness of the situation, various solutions should be examined with cool objectivity. For example, is it true that peace with Syria would dissolve its alliance with Iran, or would it only reinforce its militancy? 
The need to shape policy relatively quickly must not lead to hurried decisions taken without regard for consequences. The very degree and urgency of the threat reduces the room for error as well as the need for precise solutions.

<title>A ridiculous war against the gaps</title>
<date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The eyes of those sensitive to discrimination against the Arab population brightened when they saw the headlines announcing an unbelievable development: the World Zionist Congress decided to include Israeli Arabs in the development plan promoted by the Jewish Agency. Just as the Israeli government decides to extend an emergency order that harms the right of Arabs to marry whomever they want, the "Zionist parliament" says that "reducing gaps, coexistence and dialogue" are important Zionist goals. 
At the Caesarea Conference, a devastating report was revealed proving that discrimination against Arabs in education, the establishment of industrial zones, investment aid, and wage levels has led to poverty among Israeli Arabs that is three times greater than the Jewish population. And as if in response to that, the Jewish Agency now is purporting to "promote Arab welfare and education." 
It's very surprising since it's well known that the "national institutions" - the Jewish Agency and Jewish National Fund - primarily exist to enable institutional discrimination based on ethnicity while clearing the state from accusations that it deviates from universal norms common to liberal democracies. Indeed, the people most surprised were the Agency functionaries, who called the decision "illogical," because "the basic principle of the national institutions is to take care of Jews." 
For too many years, they got used to implementing discriminatory policies based on the supremacy of extra personal and collective rights granted to the Jewish community - in the name of Zionism. No Jew with an inferiority complex in the Diaspora and with leftist-liberal tendencies is going to make them serve "Arabs, Druze and Circassians." But the opposition was minor, and even unequivocally right-wing circles, for whom Zionism is a nationalist battle cry, didn't get upset. They noticed that the decision might sound pretty, but it has no practically validity. 
The decision is another one of many made in recent years to deal with the tensions among the principles of the Jewish state, Zionism and democracy. These decisions include seemingly brave positions against discrimination, but, in effect, strengthen it, because either they deal with the margins of the problem or they cannot implement the suggested solutions. The decisions mostly strengthen the illusion that painful decisions indeed were made, thereby cleaning the conscience and enabling people to feel that justice was done. 
A classic example is the High Court of Justice's decision regarding the Kada'an family, which was perceived at the time as dealing for the first time with the principle of equality, confronting the Zionist principle of "redeeming the land," and presenting a victory of democracy over the apartheid inherent to the national institutions' land distribution policies. Those institutions quickly learned how to "minimize the damage" and continue with their discriminatory policy. 
Attorney General Menachem Mazuz made another "historic decision" in early 2005, when he forbade the Jewish National Fund from issuing tenders for Jews only. And once again, a way was found to circumvent the decision through "land swaps," which only strengthened the JNF as a discriminatory institution with racist policies. 
The sharp debate that sprang up whenever there was a threat to the "Zionist" discrimination allows living at peace with discrimination in all the other areas - the economy, planning, education and more - since they do not clash with "the basic principles of Zionism." 
The fact that the World Zionist Congress' decision did not spark any debate is perhaps proof that the trick of inflating positions against discrimination, with no practical results, has exhausted itself. If indeed, liberal Jews want to contribute to the campaign against discrimination against Israeli Arabs, they would best enlist in the effort to shut down the "national institutions," whose very existence is the basis for such discrimination. The attempt to harness the Jewish Agency into a war against the gaps is ridiculous.

<title>Between immigrants and natives</title>
<date>Thu Jun 01 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
It's been less than two weeks since the High Court of Justice issued its ruling maintaining the deprivation of the rights of Palestinians to reunify their families, and we already have the decision that Palestinian MPs from Hamas, living in Jerusalem, will be expelled if they don't resign within 30 days. 
The suspicious will find a connection between the two decisions and wonder if the government is deliberately attempting to try the public and legal system's patience for evil acts bordering on racism, as preparation for even more brutal steps. According to the reactions so far, there have been no firm demands for an end to this cruelty and the government can continue on its merry way; the security excuse serves as an effective fig leaf from any domestic criticism and foreign criticism can always be rejected as forms of anti-Semitism. 
Seemingly, there is no connection between the prevention of family unification and the threat of expulsion; but the two matters touch on basic perception of the status of Palestinians in their homeland: It's no accident that both issues fall within the realm of "entry to Israel," whether preventing it or stripping it. 
The Israelis, children of immigrants, who in the best case are only separated by a generation from the status of refugees - uprooted and expelled - impose on native Palestinians the status of foreigners, of living in a country to which they do not belong, forcing them to fight for the right to live in their home, and exposing them to an expulsion decree or banning their "entrance" on the grounds that they "do not belong." 
Not many years have lapsed since the Jewish yishuv fought for its legitimacy and was forced to defend itself from the argument that it was a collection of immigrants taking over a country they did not own, until the situation was reversed; now it is the Palestinian nation that has to fight for the collective legitimacy that this is their homeland and that they are not some collection of foreigners breaking into a country that is not theirs, and nothing but a gang of terrorists. 
The Palestinians seeking family reunification and the right to live in Israel are rejected because they are aliens and their presence here "could change the face of Israeli society." The Jerusalemite MPs, like all the Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, never asked for their status as permanent residents; it was imposed on them. 
In 1967, Israel conquered East Jerusalem and sought to annex the territory without annexing the inhabitants. The legal trick invented for the purpose imposed on the 70,000 Arabs of East Jerusalem the status of "permanent resident" as if they were new immigrants who had not yet been naturalized as citizens. But in this case, it wasn't the Arabs who emigrated to Israel, but Israel that emigrated to them. Under the conditions that prevailed at the time, it was a liberal approach, even if it was a contravention of international law, since on the one hand, their status as Jordanian citizens was not stripped from them - and it was important to them since the Jordanian kingdom was their economic, administrative, family and educational centers - and on the other hand, the "permanent residency" gave them the right to enjoy the benefits of Israel's welfare system, freedom of movement and relatively broader freedom of speech than existed in the occupied territories. 
It wasn't a favor being done by the Israeli occupiers, because the alternative - granting them Israeli citizenship as happened to the Arabs of the Triangle annexed in 1949 - was worse; and leaving them without any status in Israel would contradict the pretensions of "unifying the city" and would have perpetuated the occupation in it. 
Therefore, the interior minister's bragging that he is doing a favor by paying them National Insurance Institute payments, child allotments and health insurance, is hollow and patronizing. This arrangement, after all, is 40-years-old, and enabled people like Ehud Olmert and Ronni Bar-On to take pride in the "unification of Jerusalem" and to condemn "the leftists who neglected East Jerusalem because they wanted to divide the city." 
The suspicion sneaks in that the emphasis on denying permanent residency (and the denial of the package of rights that accompany that residency) is preparing the groundwork for similar steps toward thousands among the 230,000 Palestinian residents of the city who were imprisoned on the western side of the separation wall. If the election of a person in democratic elections and according to a published platform can be an excuse to strip them of a "permanent status," meaning expulsion from their home, and if the definition of every Palestinian is as an "alien" and an "enemy subject" strips them of their right to "permanent residency" - what does that mean for all the inhabitants of East Jerusalem? 
Is this the message the government wants to send - we are capable of denying the right to live in Jerusalem - a message that means expulsion or stripping of the rights that have been granted and procedures that have existed for nearly 40 years? And then we're shocked by the rising protests overseas, condemning Israel as an apartheid state. Those who plot to expel Mohammed Abu Tir from his home justifiably earned the condemnation and disgust.

<title>Charge or release the detainees</title>
<date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
Friends told me that H. was in detention with other Palestinians in a prison near Mitzpeh Ramon. Startled, I asked why. "He was told that it's a secret file," they said. H. had been given a piece of paper saying he was under four months' administrative detention, and this was later reduced to three months. It has since been extended for another three months. 
H.'s lawyer, an Israeli, says that he has been given only generalized statements: that there is specific information about specific things and that H. "poses a danger to the security of the area." But no details or evidence. An appeal is to be heard by a military court. 
I feel I have gone back years into the past, when I was a journalist in apartheid South Africa. The Afrikaner Nationalist government used detention without trial on a huge scale as a weapon to attack opposition. Thousands were arrested, many were tortured. I was deeply involved in investigations into the plight of detainees and wrote ceaselessly against it. 
Because detention without trial was common in apartheid South Africa and is widely used in Israel today does not mean that Israel is an apartheid state. It has nothing to do with apartheid. What is the same, for Israel, South Africa and worldwide, is the questionable use and abuse of state power, and the harm done to individuals and to society by eroding the rule of law. The rule of law is a precious concept which safeguards the liberties of each one of us. If anyone has transgressed the law, then he or she must be brought to open court and charged as soon as possible. 
I know that in this era of terrorism, and especially in Israel which is under such direct attack, it can be difficult to insist on consistent adherence to basic principles of freedom. In dealing with the new terrorism, the world's democracies have enacted laws and adopted tactics which seriously detract from freedom and which would have been unthinkable only five years ago. The United States, for example, is flagrantly, and tragically, undermining its own constitutional beliefs by its treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Yet without the rule of law we are all at the mercy of faceless officials who can do as they please. We have to be vigilant. 
I watched, and reported, as South Africa slid down the slippery slope of repression. Always there was government justification for harsher laws and greater power to detain people. The authoritarian state became entrenched. 
I have known H. for more than seven years. I first met him when he was a tour guide with a Palestinian organization. I arranged tours by Israelis to Palestinian areas and H. was one of the guides. He was friendly and imparted information in a straightforward way. He lost his job soon after the intifada started. We kept in touch. We phoned each other from time to time and he visited me. He told me he was working in his village: He was the secretary of the medical clinic. He had a large family to support. 
He said the Israel Defense Forces had put up an earth barricade around the village so that no cars could enter or leave. The half-hour drive to Bethlehem now took up to two hours: Villagers had to climb over the barricade, take a taxi to the next barricade, climb over and so on. It meant about four taxi rides, including of course for the young, the old and the infirm. The barricade was removed after a few years. He repeatedly invited me to visit his village and to look at the clinic's work. I was unable to get there so could not check what he told me. 
Now H. is in prison with many hundreds of others. I asked another Palestinian friend about H. He laughed and said the village clinic was probably funded by Hamas, and that could be the link with H.'s detention. There have been many arrests in the West Bank, he said. 
I do not know whether H. is a terrorist intent on killing Israelis, or a decent man caught up in circumstances where he was trying to make a living and also help his people. I would be surprised to find that he is a would-be killer. I have always found him talking in terms of peaceful coexistence between Jews and Arabs. I remember his work as a tour guide in furthering good relations. 
His detention without trial also resonates with me in a very personal way. After the fall of apartheid, I was able to gain access to some of the South African Security Police files on me. I found reports that stated that I had attended social parties of extreme left-wing people. There were lists of these parties. In fact, I had never been to a single one. I was similarly wrongly described as having attended sundry left-wing meetings. 
I learned that on at least two occasions, a "banning" order had been considered for me. This was an administrative decree which would have severely curtailed my personal liberties. The banning decision would have been taken in secret on the basis of secret information, which I would not have known or been able to challenge. 
That is why I am concerned about H., and others held without trial, for months and even years. It is wrong, and dangerous, for all of us. The same cry that I repeatedly uttered in South Africa is relevant and needed in Israel: charge or release. 
Benjamin Pogrund was deputy editor of The Rand Daily Mail in Johannesburg. He was prosecuted for his reports exposing ill treatment of prisoners in South Africa.

Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni says that today's UN would not pass the November 29, 1947, decision that called for the partition of the Land of Israel and the establishment of the state of Israel. Livni is pointing to a genuine problem: Israel is struggling to maintain its existential legitimacy as the Jewish state. The question is what the foreign minister and her colleagues in the government are doing in the face of the danger. 
The British Guardian published two lengthy articles this week comparing Israel to the former apartheid regime in South Africa. It was not pleasant reading, a listing of Jewish Israel's sins against its Arab citizens and the Palestinians in the territories: discrimination, separation, hatred and occupation. The troubling problem is not the presentation of the facts but the unwritten message: if Zionism is the same as apartheid, than it can be deemed as worthy of eradication as apartheid. 
In 2006 an ideological alliance has emerged between liberal circles in Europe and the conservative, fire-breathing Iranian president. Both describe Zionism as a European effort to get rid of the hated Jews of the old world at the expense of the Palestinians; both accuse Israel of exploiting the European Holocaust (which Mahmoud Ahmadinejad denies ever took place) to oppress the Arabs; and both would like to see it eliminated. The only difference is that the Iranian president proposes to the Europeans that they take back the Jews, and the European liberals prefer a Jewish minority in an Arab Palestine (as "a state for all its citizens"). 
Israel usually writes off such views as expressions of anti-Semitism. But even if that is true, the problem remains just as bad: Israel is losing its grip on important, influential parts of public opinion in the West, and is being shoved into the corner with rightist, Christian groups that preach in favor of a war of civilizations with Islam. 
As a result, there is a growing gap between the Israeli interpretation of reality and the way Israel is perceived in the world. Moves that appear to Israelis as withdrawal and compromise - starting with the separation fence and the disengagement from Gaza - are interpreted overseas as exercises in perpetuating the occupation and annexation. The boycott the Olmert government has declared against the Palestinian Authority in response to the Hamas victory is presented as a defensive measure against a murderous enemy. But overseas it will be perceived as subversion of democratic elections, with the goal of avoiding negotiations and expanding settlements. The BBC will show Olmert touring the fence and promising to annex the settlement blocs and Jordan Valley, juxtaposed against Hamas leaders' proposals for a cease-fire, and images of the growing distress in the territories as a result of closed border crossings and the freeze in fund transfers. 
David Ben-Gurion said that Israel's fate is dependent on two things: its strength and justness. His heirs believed strength was enough. In the current election campaign as well as those in the past, the candidates are competing over who will annex more territory and hurt the Palestinians more. None are speaking of Israel's legitimate problems and saying what must be done to fix them. 
Olmert once warned that the occupation would turn Israel into a leper, but when he reached the leadership position he forgot and returned to the solutions of force. His rival, Benjamin Netanyahu, who spoke as finance minister of the "tsunami of the markets" that neutralize independent governments and bend them to the demands of the global economy, apparently believes that globalization doesn't apply to political life, so Israel can put up fences and settle and ignore the international community. 
Force is a necessary condition for the state's existence, but it is not a sufficient condition on its own. The time has come to change priorities, and to give some importance to Israel being just. That doesn't mean getting up and running out of all the territories. Even after such a withdrawal, there will be things that Israel will be blamed for and accused of. But the next government must place the problem of Israel's legitimacy in the forefront and invest every possible effort to improve Israel's image in the world.

<title>Israelis' feeble enlightenment </title>
<date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
In general, when controversy rages, when the newspapers are full of arguments - and every lawyer knows how many arguments it is possible to find for and against any issue - and when many (organizers, police, opponents, politicians, publicists) are involved in a decision or action, the real nature of the event gets lost in the images of how its supporters, or opponents, want to present it. Therefore, it is worth asking a few leading questions in order to understand the nature of the Gay Pride parade, and clarify what does not belong in the debate over it.  
Is the parade meant to emphasize that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel? If not, why is it specifically taking place in Jerusalem? Should the parade only go through West Jerusalem, or through the entire city? For if we are talking about united Jerusalem, why not also bring the tidings of sexual liberation to East Jerusalem, closed off within its wall, so that the march could also be seen as a parade about Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem, thereby reflecting the consensus? Incidentally, is it not also worth asking such a question about the necessity of marching through Jewish neighborhoods that see the event as not only a "parade of perverts," but also a "parade of the secular rulers?"  
And other questions should also be asked: Is it important to march in Jerusalem because there are many liberated homosexuals there, or because there are many oppressed homosexuals there? If it's because there are many oppressed homosexuals, it could very well be that it would be even better to march in Be'er Sheva, where there are apparently far more oppressed homosexuals. Or why not organize a Gay Pride parade in Yeruham or Sderot or Hatzor Haglilit? They say that it's harder to be a homosexual in those places than it is to be an ultra-Orthodox homosexual in Mea She'arim. Who says so? Among others, Haredi homosexuals, enjoy themselves quietly, without making a big fuss, in Jerusalem's gay entertainment venues. Incidentally, religious lesbians in Jerusalem also have public meeting places, and no one has ever made a big deal about it.  
It's doubtful that the parade's organizers have ever been interested in Jerusalem's human mosaic. Parades - even in the name of an "oppressed minority" - tend to ignore the human mosaic, with all its contradictions and griefs. There is no doubt that now, Haredi homosexuals have been trapped along with their community, which is under attack - because the decisive issue ever since the debate over the Gay Pride parade in Jerusalem began has not been the right to march, but the Haredim as "the enemies of enlightenment."  
It is possible to ask a few more questions in order to examine the real nature of the parade: Should its slogans be limited to equal rights for homosexuals, or should it also raise the banner of support for other oppressed minorities, such as the Arab minority in Israel or the Arab Palestinian nation? This question is meant not to detract from the homosexuals' right to march, but to argue that this parade does not have the significance that all kinds of human rights defenders have bestowed on it. This parade channeled itself from the start into the most "convenient" arena in Israel for the "unenlightened enlightened": the one in which "enlightened" means "anti-Haredi."  
For decades, the enlightened Israeli has freed himself of any obligation connected to human or civil rights - for instance, any thorough discussion of Israel's unwritten apartheid constitution - by means of a single battle cry: "The Haredim are to blame." There are two salient examples of this. It is not the religious who are responsible for the situation in which we are obligated to marry and divorce through the rabbinate. The state created this separation fence upon its inception. But it's convenient to blame the religious parties, who are the fence's subcontractors in this reactionary situation.  
An even better example is Israel's lack of a constitution. For years, Israelis have ascribed this lack to religious opposition to a written constitution. They forget that a constitution is impossible because the State of Israel, that unenlightened enlightened state, does not want to open the constitution with a declaration of full equality for all its citizens, and particularly not regarding property rights.  
None of the above absolves the religious parties, which are subcontractors that profit from the role assigned to them by the state. None of the above absolves the religious community of persecuting homosexuals. All of the above are meant only to point out that the present confrontation, which the homosexuals are hastening to celebrate as a victory over their persecutors, or as a defeat at the hands of their persecutors, is no different from the old, familiar battle over a "universal draft," in which all kinds of leftists - liberal publicists and "leftist" politicians - find themselves acting as the army's recruiting agents and Ehud Barak's soldiers.  
The homosexuals, through the Gay Pride parade, are happy to be "part of the majority" for a moment, and they thereby erase the sensitivity that they had intended to promote: sensitivity toward minorities. Minorities never all fit into the same basket. That's why they need sensitivity. The ruling elite - Ashkenazi, secular and enlightened to a limited degree - will not suddenly become fans of homosexuals as of tomorrow. The secular Ashkenazi majority, which delights in defining itself for the umpteenth time as "enlightened," will not really become enlightened through this struggle. The opposite is true. Israeli enlightenment is being built, as always, in the most primitive fashion, through incitement a la Tommy Lapid: "We are not Haredim." In other words, we have left the ghetto, and therefore we are free people - just like in Europe.

<title>Israel, South Africa and Hamas</title>
<date>Fri May 05 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki has accepted a Palestinian invitation to visit Ramallah, and wants to use it to take up an "open invitation" to visit Israel. He is eager to come because he sees himself as a peace broker in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, say sources in South Africa. But it is unlikely to work out. Mbeki will go to Ramallah to reciprocate the visit to South Africa last month of Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen). He also wants to meet Hamas leaders. 
Therein lies the problem. He will not be able to meet Hamas and also visit Israel, at least not as an official guest. That is clear from Israel's declared policy of refusing to talk to anyone who talks to Hamas. So even though Mbeki will be a mere 15-minute drive from Jerusalem, he will not be given any appointments with Israeli leaders. 
Whether he will be allowed to visit Israel privately, should he wish to do so, remains to be seen. Whether he will get to Ramallah via Ben-Gurion airport, or fly in via Amman, entering Israel through the Allenby Bridge, also remains to be seen. 
Mbeki reaffirmed South Africa's policy two months ago when he told his parliament: "We hold the firm view that the road to an independent Palestinian homeland is through the prescripts of the Oslo agreement as well as the principles contained in the road map for peace. Key among these principles is the two-state solution to the Palestine-Israeli conflict, the outcome of which must be the creation of a viable Palestinian state coexisting side by side in peace and security with an independent Israel." 
South Africa occupies a relatively influential place in the world. It still holds the moral high ground, 12 years since the victory of democracy. It is a powerful member of the African community and enjoys  considerable stature among developing nations. 
Mbeki has invested time and money in offering his mediating services for Israelis and Palestinians. He believes South Africa's experience in ending apartheid is a lesson for peace here. But thus far he has achieved little success. He began several years ago with what was called the "Spier process," named after the wine estate in the Cape Town area to which he invited Palestinian cabinet members and Israelis for several days of discussions. He invited the Palestinian ambassador, but not Israel's ambassador. He took part himself and so did members of his cabinet. 
The Israeli participants were members of left-wing opposition parties and people who had previously had some influence in Israeli politics. That was the problem: Mbeki was talking to the wrong people and his peace-making effort was viewed with derision in Israeli official circles. It was also a cause for irritation because Mbeki seemed to go out of his way to bypass the Israeli government. 
He went on in the same way to invite a group of army refuseniks. There was also an attempt to bring a delegation of South African Christian, Muslim and Jewish religious leaders to come and talk to Jews, Muslims and Christians in Israel. It failed amid astonishment that it was even tried because, inside South Africa, leaders in the Muslim religious council were refusing even to meet leaders of the Jewish Board of Deputies and the government wasn't known to be  doing anything to remedy this. 
Mbeki must have realized that he wasn't getting anywhere. Ehud Olmert, then minister of trade and industry, was a guest in 2004. It is believed that he and Mbeki got on well personally and have been in touch since then. Last year, Mbeki invited members of the Likud, who were then in government. 
Mbeki is well-intentioned. But critics say he is ill-informed. He is trying to replicate the model of what happened in South Africa during the struggle against apartheid: White leaders inside South Africa went abroad for meetings with the exiled leaders of the African National Congress. That was the start of contacts which finally led to negotiations for the end of apartheid. But the example is inappropriate: Mbeki went wrong by inviting members of the Israeli opposition. In this part of the world, Israeli and Palestinian leaders have been  meeting, however haltingly, since the early 1990s. 
The real lesson that could be offered is the basic fact of the interracial dialogue which happened both outside and inside South Africa. That example of  contact could be of immense help to Israelis and Palestinians now divided by mutual fear, hatred and mistrust. 
However, South Africa's further attempt to relate its apartheid past to conditions in today's Israel causes anger. Israel rejects any comparison and is thus skeptical about peace efforts drawing on South African  experience. 
Mbeki has also undermined his credibility as a peace broker by remaining silent about the call to "wipe out" Israel by the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It should also be noted that South Africa continues to back criticisms of Israel in international forums in instances which Israel regards as unfair. Statements condemning suicide-bomb attacks against Israelis are usually qualified by ifs and buts. 
Immediately after Hamas entered the Palestinian Authority government, South Africa extended an invitation to its leaders to come and talk. Mbeki told his parliament: "It's important to respect the will of the Palestinian people, they elected Hamas." Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said South Africa wanted to share its experiences in the transformation from apartheid to democracy with Palestinians and Israelis. Hamas leaders have apparently not yet been there. Instead, Pahad, together with the minister of intelligence, Ronnie Kasrils, was due to visit here to meet Hamas. That would not have gone down well with Israel: Kasrils, born Jewish, condemns Israel in extreme terms and urges worldwide total boycotts. 
Mbeki has, however, pushed them aside and has personally taken charge of trying to help the peace process. Pahad and Kasrils might, it is understood, come ahead of him as an advance party, but he will be the man. Pahad has said that Mbeki will come only once both the Palestinian government and the new Israeli government are formed.  The first was sorted out a month ago, and the second is likely to be in place quite soon. So a Mbeki visit could be imminent. 
What South African lessons might Mbeki read to Hamas? That they must embrace dialogue and be willing to talk to Israel? That they must follow the path of the African National Congress which, in 1961, turned to armed resistance against the white rulers, but also pursued a policy, for reasons of principle and strategy, of not killing civilians? That had a decisive effect later in persuading whites to end apartheid rule. 
If Mbeki does this, and succeeds in influencing Hamas, he could end up as a welcome guest in Jerusalem. This happy outcome does, however, seem remote. Instead, Israel and South Africa could be heading for a diplomatic impasse.

<title>It's not a tic, it's a wink</title>

In formulating the High Court of Justice's ruling on the Nationality and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order), a ruling that makes it possible to deny Arab citizens the rights that Jews have, Justice Mishael Cheshin wrote: "If someday the Knesset legislates an immigration law whose purposes include preserving the Jewish majority in the state of Israel, it is possible that the court will have to examine the demographic consideration in-depth, and the court will take up the matter and vanquish it. However, this is not the case with the matter at hand, as we have not been asked to examine this issue." 
But even this loquacious formulation cannot remove the large shadow that was cast yesterday over the Supreme Court, the shadow of Yisrael Beiteinu Chairman Avigdor Lieberman. It is very doubtful that the High Court is capable of protecting Israel's Arab minority against further racist legislation. 
"The demographic issue" reverberates through long pages of the court ruling, especially in the form of denial. This ruling must be deemed a masterpiece of denial. Although Justice Ayala Procaccia, one of the minority justices, wrote of the demographic consideration: "Even if it cannot negate the truth of the security consideration, it may affect its weight and strength" (Justice Salim Joubran also wrote in this vein), the bulk of the denial came from Supreme Court President Aharon Barak, who insisted on writing that the matter of the "Jewish majority" is not what motivated the legislator to amend the law. Why did Barak insist on integrating denial of the demographic motive into his opinion? 
Perhaps this is the Supreme Court president's contribution to rebutting possible criticism of the court by the legal community abroad. Perhaps he was trying to ensure that the ruling does not afford the legislator a legal basis for continuing to deepen the apartheid legislation. After all, ever since the state's establishment, the security justification has served as a front behind which other considerations stood. The very identification of "the state's security" with "the Jewish majority" is due to this long-standing tradition, which can be seen in the legislation on land ownership. Here, too, the words "the state's security" are camouflage for assuring extra rights for the Jewish majority. The Supreme Court can no longer boast of clean hands. Moreover, the public debate about the law, and the fervent statements in support of it that related precisely to "preserving the Jewish majority," cannot be erased with the sweep of a decision. 
Yesterday's ruling mixes the issues of "the Jewish majority" and "the state's security" and places both under the formalistic facade of "immigration policy," making disingenuous use of European legislation against immigration from Third World countries. To this end, Cheshin made use of an article written by Professor Amnon Rubinstein and Liav Orgad ("Human Rights, State Security and the Jewish Majority - The Case of Immigration for Purposes of Marriage"), which was published earlier this year in the Israeli legal journal Hapraklit. Even the article's title points to the connection between "security" and "the Jewish majority." 
Cheshin wrote: "Beyond this stands the state's right not to allow residents of an enemy country to enter its territory during time of war." However, Palestinians who live in the occupied territories are not "inhabitants of an enemy state." They are not inhabitants of any state. They have been subjects of the Israeli occupation for over a generation. Moreover, they have no other country, and Cheshin, when he suggested that the petitioners "go to Jenin" during a hearing on the petition in February, knew very well what he was decreeing for Palestinians in the territories, as well as for Arab citizens of Israel: to be squeezed into the place offered to them; to live alongside Jews who come in their tens of thousands from every country in the world; to accept the fact that among the million who came during the past 15 years, one-third are not Jewish, yet they do not endanger "the Jewish majority" - not because they are not "part of an enemy country," but because they are not part of the Palestinian people. 
No formalism can force the Palestinian question into a disingenuous formula of "immigration to a European country" or "immigration from an enemy country (we are not, after all, talking about immigration from Syria). We are talking about the life of a single community, part of which lives in a country that discriminates and the other part of which lives, defenseless, under prolonged occupation. The only comfort a fair-minded person can draw from this ruling is the wise words written by Barak: "It is not possible to maintain a sharp distinction between the status of human rights during wartime and their status during peacetime. The line between terror and calm is fine. It is thus everywhere. It cannot be maintained over time. We must take human rights seriously, both during wartime and during times of calm." And he added: "We must free ourselves from the naive belief that when the terror ends, it will be possible to turn the clock back." On the other hand, who could continue to hold this naive belief in light of this ruling?

<title>Know the boundaries</title>

Prospects for peace, already dire since the collapse of the Oslo process, are deteriorating still further. The open anti-Semites of Hamas seem likely to win a significant mandate in Palestine, and those who oppose a Palestinian state still persuade a significant proportion of Israelis. Kadima's project of unilateral disengagement, even if implemented fearlessly, is unlikely to lead to a just settlement of the conflict. We will see more terrorist attacks worldwide, and an intensification of the "war against terror." This context may accelerate the polarization of opinion in the United Kingdom between those who demonize Israel and Jews on the one side, and those who demonize Palestinians and Muslims on the other. We oppose both of these ways of thinking. 
The Palestine solidarity movement in the U.K. is dominated by campaigns to boycott Israel. These campaigns divide those who want a just peace, and they portray Israel as a racist pariah state like the old South Africa. For five weeks last year, our union, the Association of University Teachers (AUT), held Israeli academics responsible for the actions of their state in a manner in which it did not propose holding anybody else in the world responsible. 
The boycott policy was advocated by people who argue that Israel is the only "illegitimate" state in the world; that Israeli nationalism is essentially different from other nationalism; that Zionism is a form of racism, apartheid or Nazism; that Israel plays a pivotal role in global imperialism; that the Zionist lobby has huge, covert and illegitimate influence; that Israel is guilty of genocide. Some academics, who rightly wanted to do something to help Palestinians, naively went along with this campaign. The boycott campaign discriminated against Zionist Jews and relied on hate-filled generalizations about Israel and Zionism. The boycott campaign amounted to a singling out of Israeli academics, without any politically or morally relevant reason, for special punishment and particular abhorrence. 
We forced a full, informed and democratic debate in our union, and the AUT membership overturned the boycott. We will continue to oppose an academic and cultural boycott of Israel, whether the boycotters pursue it openly or covertly. We will oppose ways of thinking that risk licensing an anti-Semitic movement in the U.K. But we will not do so on the basis of a hypocritical defense of academic freedom that stays silent about the impact of the occupation on Palestinian academics and students, or by muting criticism of the wrongful actions of the Israeli state. 
One reason that the loathing of Israel is becoming respectable in British society is that the Israeli state often acts wrongly. Israel still hangs on to the West Bank, encourages Jews to build settlements there, and rules it as a colony. The Israeli government acts as though it plans to annex a significant proportion of the West Bank to Israel. Within pre-1967 Israel, there is still discrimination against Arab citizens, some of it formalized in law. Because Israel is the occupying power, and because it is vastly more powerful than Palestine, it must accept a major share of responsibility for squandering the opportunities for peace in the 1990s. 
Anti-Zionists often talk about Zionism as though it was a monolithic entity. It is portrayed as one single project from the 19th to the 21st century, and the different political traditions within Israel are air-brushed out of history. Hostility toward Israel, in any form, is thought of as nothing but a response to so-called Zionist crimes. This mirrors the way that Israel's maltreatment of Palestinians is sometimes portrayed merely as a legitimate response to those who seek to "wipe Israel off the map." 
The term, Zionist, has become a term of abuse that denotes an evil and racist ideology. It is thrown venomously at anyone who thinks Israel has the right to exist. The collapsing of Israeli and Jewish opinion into Zionism holds Israelis and Jews collectively responsible for the worst excesses of Israeli nationalists. Some people reserve particular venom for the crimes of "the Zionists" that they do not use when talking about other crimes. The genocide in Darfur is currently intensifying and is an incomparably bigger event in terms of human rights abuses than the conflict in the West Bank, but the actions of the Janjaweed do not make the blood of the average British liberal boil in the way that the crimes of "the Zionists" do. 
For many on the left in the U.K., Israel has come to symbolize global US-centered imperialism just as, for some, Jews once symbolized the evils of capitalism. Palestine is often treated as a universal victim that stands for all the victims of imperialism. In this way, actual events in the Middle East are sometimes subsumed into a symbolic struggle between good and evil in the left's imagination. 
We need a movement in the U.K. for a just peace, one that campaigns in solidarity with the Palestinian and Israeli peace camps. Such a movement has to be conscious of where the boundaries lie between reasonable criticism of Israeli and Palestinian actions on the one hand, and the demonization of Israel, Jews, Palestinians and Muslims on the other. We need to resist those who try to force us to choose between one camp and the other. We need to work for the politics of peace and reconciliation within both Israel and Palestine.

<title>Letters to the Editor</title>
<date>Thu Jun 01 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The decision of Britain's National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) to invite its members to boycott Israeli academics that do not publicly dissociate themselves from Israeli government policies represents the latest round in the attempt of the extreme left and their fellow travelers to delegitimize Israel as the new incarnation of  apartheid South Africa. 
Along the way they have succeeded in gaining sympathy from more moderate liberals, who are critical of Israeli policy toward the Palestinians, but who lack in-depth knowledge of the situation. But make no mistake, for those behind the boycott campaign it is not about Israeli policy, it is about challenging Israel's right to exist. As such, it undermines support for a two-state solution and thereby fuels the conflict. 
Most of the promoters of the boycott are not motivated by conscious animosity toward Jews per se. However, in effect, their approach is prejudiced because it applies a different standard to Israel than it does to any other country. As an individual, I might care more about Israel or Palestine because I am emotionally connected to it - this is legitimate, but an external organization like NATFHE needs to have more objective criteria. Since Israeli academia and Israel itself are hardly among the worst human rights offenders in the world, it begs the question - why Israel? 
In the short term, it is unclear what the practical effect of the boycott will be. NATFHE will cease to exist on June 1 when it merges with the AUT to form the University and College Union (UCU). From NATFHE literature it would appear that the boycott policy will become defunct once the merger takes place. However, in the past, NATFHE has not always abided by its own rules, so this will need to be clarified soon. 
Democratization of higher education unions in the U.K. should make it more difficult to push through an overt boycott of Israeli universities in the future. After all, most union members are far more concerned with the fact that lecturers' income has fallen massively in real terms over the last 30 years. 
However, the problem is mutating into a new form - the notion of a "personal boycott," which is contained in the NATFHE motion. Instead of publicly calling for collective action, this encourages individuals to conduct their own boycott. This represents an insidious threat to academia worldwide. Instead of judging research on merit, it opens the door for academics from around the world to be judged according to their nationality and political opinions. It has begun with Israel, but who knows where it will end?

Regarding "Politics is killing them," May 19 
Your reporter claims politics is killing innocent sick Palestinians. Your reporter seems to have missed one important detail. The Palestinian Authority has an investment fund of billions of dollars, which it misappropriated from the donations received from Western donors, and refuses to use some of these funds to provide food and medical supplies for the Palestinian population. 
As with all the other problems faced by the Palestinian population, the cause can be laid directly at the feet of their leaders. 
It is very sad indeed to see how little their leaders are concerned for their welfare.

<title>Making Israel take responsibility</title>
<date>Thu Sep 14 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Many countries try to excuse their failings by blaming outsiders. For several decades after independence, people in the Irish Republic blamed its economic under-performance on centuries of British rule. Similarly, Israel uses anti-Semitism to excuse its expulsion of Palestinians in 1948, its discrimination against the Palestinians who managed to remain inside the Green Line, and its territorial  expansionism after 1967. 
All good excuses contain a germ of truth. The 19th-century Irish famine, which was exacerbated by British policies, greatly damaged the morale of the survivors and their descendants. Similarly, the Nazi Judeocide has left a huge scar on the survivors of that catastrophe. However, to escape dysfunctionality, every society must admit its own failings. Irish economic woes stemmed from a culture of risk-avoidance which, while derived from colonial history, had to be admitted and overcome by citizens of the independent state. Similarly, Israelis will never be secure until they admit their responsibility to make restitution for the crimes of their state against the Palestinians. Israelis should beware of false friends who tempt them to avoid this responsibility by misrepresenting the  critics of Israeli policies as anti-Semites. 
A salient example of this phenomenon appeared in Haaretz last week, in an article ("One hundred years of hostility," Sept. 8), which alleged that Sinn Fein was and is anti-Semitic, and tried to smear the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC) by association. Belonging to no party, I will leave it to Sinn Fein to defend itself. However, those Zionist Irish Jews who were prominent supporters of Sinn Fein would be surprised at last week's characterization. 
In his autobiography ("Living History"), Chaim Herzog wrote "My father [Yitzhak Herzog, later first Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Israel] was an open partisan of the Irish cause. The outstanding Jewish leader in the revolution was Robert Briscoe." 
Eamon de Valera, president of Sinn Fein from 1917 to 1926, was hidden in Rabbi Herzog's home on several occasions during the revolution. Briscoe, who made several trips to Germany to buy arms, was one of the hard-line Sinn Feiners, who followed de Valera in rejecting the 1921 treaty with Britain - an event which triggered civil war in the new state. Briscoe was also a Zionist who, while spending 38 years in the Irish parliament, found time to visit Poland in 1938 as an agent of Jabotinsky and to raise funds for the Irgun in New York in 1939, using his stature as a Jewish fighter for Irish independence. De Valera became a life-long friend of Herzog, meeting David Ben-Gurion in  Herzog's Jerusalem home in 1950 and being honored by the Irish Jewish community in the mid-1960s by the planting of a forest in Israel. 
In its early years, Israel received a great deal of sympathy in Ireland. While Briscoe's prominent place in Irish politics may have played a role, the two main reasons were a fellow-feeling for Jews as another people who had experienced religious persecution and ignorance about the dispossession of the Palestinians. As the truth about 1948 became known and the horrors of the post-1967 occupation became apparent,  attitudes changed. 
Coincidentally, the first English-language article to debunk the myth that the Palestinian refugees of 1948 had left on the orders of Arab radio broadcasts ("The Other Exodus," by Erskine Childers, The Spectator, May 1961) was written by the grandson and namesake of a prominent Sinn Feiner, who used his yacht to import arms from Germany in 1914 and who took the same side as Briscoe in the Irish Civil War. 
The IPSC reflects the fact that Irish people, having experienced settler colonialism, understand the suffering of Palestinians who endure it today. However, IPSC membership also includes Israeli Jews and Palestinians living in Ireland. Moreover, far from being "a subset of the Republican movement," as was claimed, the Belfast branch has Unionist members and  supporters. 
Our shared goal is universal human rights. We want all who have the right to reside between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, including refugees, to enjoy that right in peace. Unfortunately, many Israelis think that Palestinians should have less entitlement in their homeland than Jews who migrated to Palestine since 1882. The IPSC thinks both ethnic groups should enjoy all rights stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We have no view on the future organization of the territory. That is a decision for all those who are Palestinian or Israeli or both, including refugees. 
Many members of the IPSC are veterans of other anti-racist campaigns, such as those concerned with South Africa, East Timor and rights for Native Americans. IPSC members also support campaigns for West Papuans, Kurds, Tibetans and others. The Belfast branch is affiliated to a network which opposes attacks on immigrant workers in that city. With this wide perspective, we see that hafrada (separation) is the Zionist form of apartheid, so we argue that Israel should be treated like the old South Africa. 
Our campaign is gaining momentum. Recently, several Irish cultural events rejected Israeli embassy sponsorship and Irish trade unionists prevented use of Dublin trams for training staff of the projected tram system between West Bank settlements. But this is only the beginning. This campaign, part of a world-wide effort to help Israelis overcome their dysfunctional denial of responsibility, will cease only when Israel conforms to International Law.

<title>Not good enough</title>
<date>Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
The unilateral approach is not unreasonable in the absence of a Palestinian partner for an agreement, but anyone who proposes withdrawing to defensible borders, getting out of the Palestinians' lives, liberating them from the regime of checkpoints and apartheid in the territories, and returning most of the settlers to Israel within its pre-1967 borders must propose a plan that has geographic and demographic logic - not a temporary political compromise that leaves the problem burning on a steady flame. If Israel believes that what is best for it is to draw its own borders, with the support of the international community, it must aspire to viable ones. 
With the elections approaching, Kadima has remembered what it was founded for, and its leaders are promising, albeit somewhat weakly, that they intend to carry out an additional unilateral withdrawal in the West Bank after the elections, while canceling Israel's commitment to the road map. While the disengagement from Gaza involved withdrawing to the recognized international border, a kind of declaration that the era of settlement had ended, the withdrawal from the West Bank is much more than a political declaration. Its role is to enable the establishment of two states, which may in the future be led by reality to live in harmony and mutual affinity. 
The number of seats that Kadima is receiving in the polls, combined with those received by other parties that favor leaving the territories, indicate that there is broad public support for another move, and a major one. The obstacle on the path to carrying out another withdrawal is not Hamas, because ending the occupation is a necessity that does not depend on the nature of the occupied party's leadership. Rather, it is the abstract term "settlement blocs," which has gained too much weight in Israeli discourse and appears to reflect a new mistaken idee fixe. The number of "blocs," as well as their size, changes constantly, and the appetite for annexing territory has not waned for a moment. 
Avi Dichter, one of Kadima's senior members, talks of the Hebron-Kiryat Arba bloc, the Karnei Shomron-Kedumim bloc, the Ofra-Beit El bloc and three other blocs that would not be evacuated. This is not a withdrawal and it is not even worth discussing: It is merely talk about ending the occupation without ending it. 
Simple fairness requires presenting a withdrawal plan that does not remove people from their houses in dribs and drabs, but rather makes the 1967 borders its basis, along with those adjustments required by genuine necessity - not by "facts on the ground" established in error. There is no reason to postpone dividing Jerusalem, when every year that passes makes it an even harder demographic mixture to separate. There is no reason to annex the Jordan Valley, which is a vital land reserve for the Palestinian Authority. There is no reason to annex the entire Ma'aleh Adumim bloc, which cuts the West Bank into pieces and makes the division into two states a stingy pretense. 
The claim that Kadima has no platform and no plan, and is no more than a random collection of people seeking a safe Knesset seat, is unfair. Ehud Olmert is apparently determined to carry out another withdrawal. His proposal to exchange the road map for a unilateral plan with international backing is encouraging, and makes more sense than plans that aspire to topple Hamas. But so far, the plan he has proposed is insufficient.

<title>Olmert's marketing failure</title>
<date>Thu Jun 08 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Ehud Olmert has a problem. He was correct in identifying the demographic and political dangers that the occupation of the territories poses to Israel, and he put forth a worthy plan for the evacuation of most of the settlements and for convergence to new borders. But he failed in marketing. 
Olmert thought that the world leaders, who cheered Ariel Sharon's courage because of a limited evacuation of settlements, would willingly buy the new goods he was peddling: removing the settlers from the mountain ridge, and moving significantly closer to the Green Line. But to his surprise, the world was not enthused, and sent him back to do his homework. "Go talk with Mahmoud Abbas, and then come back to us," they say. 
It is hard to believe: For the first time since 1967, an Israeli leader proposes to pull out from most of the West Bank, and the world is silent. "Come back tomorrow," they tell Olmert. There are reasons for this that are not related to Israel. The governments in Washington, London and Paris, who lost domestic support, are disintegrating. Iran, Iraq and the price of oil are now of greater concern to the world than who will live in Beit El or Ofra. 
But there is another factor that Olmert did not take into account: that the Palestinians will carry out an international public relations campaign against his plan, and will succeed in swaying western public opinion of the validity of the opposing narrative. In short, that they succeeded in presenting convergence as yet another Israeli plot to take away lands and to further annexation, occupation, abuse and apartheid. Instead of arguing about the extent of the withdrawal, they diverted the discourse to questions of Israel's legitimacy and right to exist. 
When the western governments turned their backs on the Palestinians after the rise of Hamas, they turned to non-governmental organizations. It is easy to sell them Zionism as an evil empire, which drags the naive Americans by the nose. The boycotts against Israel by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) in Britain, and by the Ontario division of Canada's largest union of public employees, is just the beginning. Those coming after them will be easier to convince. 
Israel was caught by surprise. Just like in the case of the separation fence, it turns out that the internal Israeli debate is entirely cut off from the international agenda. What appears at home to be a serious withdrawal and an enormous concession, which will cause domestic rupture, is presented in the world as a tyrannical move against an occupied and wretched people. In Israel, there is fighting over the evacuation of some miserable outposts, and over there they hold serious discussions on the "one-state solution" that will put an end to the annoyance called Israel. 
Israeli public relations is finding it difficult to respond in kind and repulse the Palestinian onslaught because its policy is unclear. How can they market convergence if the government has yet to adopt it? And what to do with a prime minister whose internal message is that he is determined to carry out his plan, but abroad declares his love for Mahmoud Abbas? 
The result is that Israel is stuttering petty messages of pre-conditions for starting negotiations and the demands of the road map, which no one remembers anymore, rather than making a clear proclamation: We have decided to end the occupation and evacuate the settlements and move to a new line from which we will hold negotiations with the Palestinians after they sort out their internal affairs. Zionism is just, in more limited borders. 
Those around Olmert are saying there is nothing to worry about, that in the moment of truth the international community will rally in favor of convergence and evacuation of the settlers. Perhaps it will be so. But it is also possible that until the first home is evacuated, the world will come to see Israel's move as the wrong cure for the disease and choose the Palestinian narrative, which can be summed up in a single word: MORE. 
The decisions to boycott Israel, precisely at the time when the government is talking about a major withdrawal, are a serious warning signal. Successful marketing of convergence should be at the top of Olmert's priorities, and his trip to Britain and France next week will be an important test.

<title>Opening a door to Africa</title>
<date>Fri Jun 23 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki has confirmed that he wants to visit Israel and the Palestinian Authority this year. To make it possible, he has turned away from his declared intention of speaking to Hamas and says instead that his government will deal only with the Palestinian Authority led by President Mahmoud Abbas. 
The growing conflict among Palestinians means the timing of the visits, and even whether they will be possible, will depend on the outcome of the July 26 referendum and how anarchic the situation might be before and after that. Meanwhile, the Israeli embassy in Pretoria says it has not yet been contacted by the South African government about a visit. 
Until recently it was unlikely Mbeki would get to Israel, at least not as an official guest. He wanted to come, to take up a long-standing invitation, but made himself unwelcome in March by inviting Hamas to send a delegation to South Africa. His government said there was a "need to engage" with the Hamas leadership to help bring about peace and stability. 
The move upset Israel, which has a policy of refusing to talk to anyone who talks to Hamas. It also upset Abbas. 
Mbeki has changed his policy and conveyed it at a meeting with South African Jewish leaders last month. According to a statement issued by the leaders, he told them about his intention to visit Israel and the Palestinian Authority. He agreed to have a delegation of local Jews and Muslims travel with him. 
Abbas was a guest of the South African government in March and was given the honor of addressing parliament, as his predecessor, Yasser Arafat, had also done. Mbeki will reciprocate Abbas' visit and will address the Palestinian  legislative council. 
In practice that will, of course, mean he speaks to the Hamas government, which holds a majority in the legislative council. But, formally, he will be a guest of the PA president. Whether this will satisfy Israel remains to be seen. 
Mbeki has long wanted to get involved in the Middle East. It seems to be a personal mission for him. He believes South Africa's experience in ending apartheid offers lessons for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But so far he has made little headway. 
South Africa supports both Palestinian statehood and Israel's right to exist. In practice, though, in votes at the UN and elsewhere, it is highly critical of Israel. It has also kept silent about Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's call to "wipe out" Israel and his questioning of the Holocaust. 
The Jewish leaders who met Mbeki raised this issue. They told him that Jews, given their history, did not take threats of such a nature lightly, and did not expect their friends to take them lightly either; the international community needed to know how South Africa stood on the issue. 
Mbeki replied that his government's stance on the recognition of Israel and its opposition to all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism, was clear. For this reason, it disagreed with Ahmadinejad's statements and had conveyed this to the Iranian government. 
He did not know why no formal statement had been issued by his government and said he would look into it (so far, nothing further has been heard about this). 
Despite Mbeki's desires, his attempted role as a peacemaker in the Middle East has not carried weight. Israel is angered by any comparison with apartheid South Africa, and is wary of Mbeki's efforts to bypass official lines of communication. Successive Israeli governments have been cool and skeptical and he has not been viewed as a serious player. 
Perhaps, when he gets to Jerusalem, he will gain greater credibility in face-to-face encounters and persuade Israeli leaders of his good will and commitment to helping bring peace. Both sides do stand to gain significantly from an upgrading in relations, apart from the  obvious benefits of increased trade. 
For Mbeki, to be allowed to play a part in furthering peace would not only be personally rewarding to him but would raise his and his country's stature in the world. It could help South Africa win the permanent seat on the UN Security  Council that it wants. 
For Israel, there is the South African example of the dialogue between blacks and whites even when oppression was at its worst. And Mbeki could agree to urge Palestinians to heed a crucial lesson from South Africa's liberation struggle: Don't kill civilians. The African National Congress kept to the high moral ground and largely avoided attacks on white civilians. The country's whites therefore did not fear being killed and this helped make them more amenable to ending apartheid. 
A well-disposed South Africa could also use its influence to open the door to Africa and the developing world, transforming Israel's relations with the world.

<title>Sharon's second `big plan'</title>
<date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
Date: Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 IST 2006
The intense emotions of shock, orphanhood and fear elicited by Ariel Sharon's exit from the political arena evoked expressions bordering on kitsch, even from observers otherwise known for their sober approach.
"Parting from him is like parting from a father: expected, but always frightening and sad," Yaron London wrote, while Amnon Dankner described Sharon as "the portrait of a generation: "a figure embodying the split heart of everyone of us... from yearning to live peacefully to the necessity to resort to arms."
The similarity between Sharon and Yitzhak Rabin - and between those two and Moses on Mount Nevo - was inevitable: "From Moses to Sharon they all saw the land from afar, but none succeeded in bringing the train to a safe haven," one journalist concluded.
In other words, had his sickness not defeated him, Sharon would have brought us to the promised land - "peace with the Arabs and clear and recognized borders." The thwarted hope, or illusion, intensified the sense of loss. Again, cruel fate has robbed us of the chance for peace. Not our own acts and foibles, but "the angel of death, sharpening his scythe." But we will not stop pursuing peace and we will increase our support for Sharon's heirs, who are bound to continue his "heritage."
The sudden departure of a worshiped leader is always an opportunity to express his political will as one wishes to express it, not necessarily on the basis of the departed leader's real goals. The image of the "cruel general who became a peace hero" - although somewhat tarnished due to overexposure in describing Rabin - blinded the eyes of many. They failed to notice that Sharon was very close to the goal he had been aiming to achieve ever since he became an adult: a goal that has nothing to do with peace - to remove the Arab demographic threat unilaterally.
He was a junior partner to the removal of the demographic threat in 1948, by expelling hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. And later, when he climbed the rungs of power, his wish to initiate major historic moves grew.
His "big plan," which led to the war in Lebanon, attempted to solve the demographic problem by turning Jordan into Palestine, deporting the refugees from Lebanon, transferring them from the West Bank, and destroying the Hashemite kingdom. After this plan failed disastrously, Sharon drafted his canton plan, and strove to implement it in every post he filled. For many years he had to resort to underhanded, even illegal means, but he did not tire, and filled the territories with settlements and outposts.
Becoming prime minister enabled him to pursue his plan to "remove the demographic threat" - thus pulling out of Gaza seemed to subtract a million Palestinians from the demographic balance sheet. The "separation fence" next created isolated cantons, paving the way to fictitiously "losing" hundreds of thousands more. Setting up a separate transportation system, "border passes," and "closures" shattered the Palestinian community into four or five sub-communities, subjected to different conditions and gradually losing touch with each other.
On the eve of his hospitalization, Sharon could have surveyed his achievements with satisfaction. The moves to deal with the "demographic threat" gained unprecedented popularity that led him to believe he would be able to set up a Peronist-presidential regime in Israel. This regime would silence any criticism over his solving the "problem," by establishing an apartheid regime. The United States, entangled in Iraq, has signaled that the canton plan may be seen as the implementation of the Palestinian state, and the Israeli peace camp, crowning Sharon as its leader, also agreed enthusiastically.
The donor states agreed to funnel financial aid unequaled since World War II, thus financing Sharon's canton plan.
Indeed, cruel fate has robbed Sharon of attaining his deepest aspiration, to eliminate, after 60 years of struggle, the Palestinian demographic threat. However, there are signs that his illness has spared him the disappointment he would have suffered had he remained in power. For the present "big plan" - as it was in the war in Lebanon - is based on hasty, erroneous assumptions.
The Palestinian Authority's crumbling is only a matter of time, and donor states' patience is running out, which will lead to the drying up of the PA's financial sources, and therefore, a catastrophic economic crisis. The anarchy in the territories will spin out of control, and the violence directed internally and at Israelis will raise pressure to "react appropriately."
Extremist groups in Israel will undermine the "treacherous government," a new attempt will be made to revive the "Jordan is Palestine" idea and export the problem to Jordan, since it has no solution in the territories, or whatever remains of them once the "settlement blocs" have been stolen from them. The U.S. will be called upon to restore order, maybe in the style of Bosnia or Kosovo.
Like in the "big plan" of 1981, the biggest mistake at present is the attempt to solve the problem unilaterally with dictates and excessive power. Ariel Sharon is no longer capable of changing his approach, and perhaps he never was. But those who claim to be continuing Sharon's heritage should never forget that "heritage" also means learning from his mistakes and avoiding them.

<title>Staying home</title>
<date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>

A dispute between neighbors over a fence led to a precedent-setting ruling vis-a-vis an anti-Semitic incident in South Africa. Mel Fishman, a native Israeli, as the local media have noted, who lives in Mpumalangha province (north of Johannesburg), sued his neighbor, Gerhard Birkhausen, for demanding that he remove a dog kennel that he had placed on his side of their joint property line. 
For years, Fishman had been on good terms with Birkhausen, who maintained a canine grooming parlor next to his house, but their relations went downhill after Fishman purchased some land from a relative of Birkhausen's, and after he began trimming the hedges between their yards to create a fence. Birkhausen, who is also an artist, painted anti-Semitic slogans, including swastikas, in the area around Fishman's house. 
The local Equality Court - one of several created in the post-Apartheid era in order to combat racism - found for Fishman. The plaintiff's lawyer and the representatives of the civil rights organization that dealt with his suit expressed disappointment at the low fine (2,000 rand, or about NIS 1,200) levied against Birkhausen, particularly in light of the fact that the dog breeder did not express regret for his actions and claimed that he was merely exercising his constitutional right to free speech. 
Members of the local Jewish community, however, expressed satisfaction with the judgment, which, despite the low fine, underlined the fact that anti-Semitism was considered an expression of racist aggression and was illegal. 
The precedent says more about the normalization process in South Africa after decades of racism and discrimination, which left the vast majority of non-whites in the society with no rights or economic foundation, than it does about anti-Semitism in the country. 
In the past five years, South Africa has gotten onto the track of political and economic stability. It has a strong legal system and a free press, which does not hesitate to criticize the government. Still, some observers point with concern at the undue accumulation of power on the part of the ruling party - the African National Congress from the Nelson Mandela era, which is led by Tabu Mbeki - which in the absence of a genuine opposition has grown too strong. 
The political stabilization and economic health also find expression in demographic trends within South Africa's Jewish community. After years of emigration, which reduced the community from a peak of 120,000 in 1980 to about 70,000 at the start of the decade, experts are now speaking about an increase of 10 percent or more in the number of Jews living in the country. There are also increasing signs of stability and even renewed economic growth within the community, which is considered highly Zionist and boasts the highest proportion of children studying in Jewish day schools in the Diaspora. 
The government encourages return migration, and the proportion of South African Jews who are now returning is high. Among the returnees are a few thousand who immigrated to Israel. In addition, Israelis are estimated to comprise about 10 percent of South Africa's Jewish population. 
The Jewish establishment, which has expressed regret for not doing enough to end the Apartheid government, is consoled by the fact that many Jews were prominent in the anti-Apartheid opposition groups that fought against the racist regime and for human rights. Fear of social and economic chaos and violent crime gave way to optimism, and many Jews feel they have a mission to build a new, egalitarian society that will repair the injustices of the past. 
South Africa is now an economic and political leader of sub-Saharan Africa, and it has a central role in leading the Third World and the developing nations. The Jewish community can play an important role in developing political and economic connections on the African continent. The Chief Rabbi of South Africa, Warren Goldstein, 34, appointed after the death of Rabbi Cyril Harris, was known for his outspoken anti-Apartheid positions. Goldstein spoke recently about the migratory trends within the community, saying that it is choosing between "going home" (to fulfill the Zionist vision) and "staying home" to reinforce the local Jewish community.

<title>Stop scaring us!</title>

The State of Israel is the strongest state in the region - militarily, economically, scientifically and culturally. It enjoys broad support from the United States and European countries. It has peaceful relations with Egypt and Jordan. We could even have built a peace arrangement with Lebanon and Syria, if we had wanted to, but certainly no threat is hovering over Israel from that direction. 
But Benjamin Netanyahu is threatening us that they will throw us into the sea. Who? The Palestinians? Let's say they want to - can they? Netanyahu and his supporters on the right and the extreme right need to scare us so that they can continue eating away at the Palestinians' lands, just as long as everything is ours. This is the right and its doctrine. 
But far more worrisome - in words and actions - are our generals, those in active duty and those who once were: Moshe Ya'alon and Shaul Mofaz. They order a strategy of power and more power, from here to eternity. They warn of a threatening future, both in Jordan and in Egypt. They launch provocative acts of aggression on the lands of the West Bank, and continue  assassinations while ruining or murdering innocent people (without any ticking time bomb). All of this is to ensure that there will be action and risk, that the army will be given a larger budget, that the arms industry will grow and increase trade and that we will continue to worship our heroes who sacrifice their lives for our security. 
Every simpleton knows that there is no existential threat to Israel. Every reasonable person understands that the Israel Defense Forces' excessive operations against the Palestinians stir hatred, anger, fanaticism and a lust for revenge. The aim of the generals' remarks, which were not slips of the tongue, but intentional leaks, is to make us continue to be afraid and continue to allow the killing, destruction, expulsions, roadblocks and apartheid roads, and more and more fresh blows to be delivered, inspired by the vivid imaginations of our generals. 
When the past chief of staff - the one who opposed the withdrawal from Lebanon and from Gaza, and destroyed more homes and anything else that stood in his way than anyone else - also joined the group of doomsayers and fear mongers, I was reminded of the speech made by U.S. general and president, Dwight Eisenhower in 1961. In his farewell address to his nation, after serving eight years as president, he warned of the close ties between the army and the huge arms industry (in Israel it combines industry, purchasing and commerce all in one). The huge influence of this industry on all areas of life can lead to the superfluous and dangerous use of unnecessary force. Further on in his address, Eisenhower focused on the need to nurture democracy and conciliation between peoples, and to prevent war and change priorities in the division of manpower and production. The army and military industry are strong and influential, he said, and therefore this influence must be reined in and efforts should be made to build peace, conciliation, freedom and human rights. 
The U.S. only realized how right he was after it was too late, when it was becoming mired in the Vietnam War and cultivating the Cold War. In Israel, the IDF became a sacred cow upon the establishment of the state and today the army's top brass is very powerful. The IDF is a conqueror with a free hand on the trigger; everyone salutes it and anyone who criticizes it is marked as a flawed patriot. This army scorns human life and property, mocks the other and abuses injured populations. It is an army that has transformed every village and city into a detention camp for the sake of "our security," while knowing full well that every time it breaks into these places, a response will be provoked that will come at Israel's expense. 
The most worrisome thing today is the caution with which people from the peace movement speak about the possibility of reconciliation - even with the Hamas government - lest they be accused of a lack of "nationalism." Also worrisome is the acceptance of the fact that Israel may withhold the Palestinians' money while demanding that they uphold all agreements, at a time when we are the first to violate an agreement. 
The hastiness of the criticism, the search for collective punishments and the dispatching of the Palestinians to the Muslim countries, are also a folly that could be dangerous. Apparently our "wise men" will be happy if the Muslim countries once again mobilize against us. Then we will again be able to see ourselves as the ultimate victim of the world, and then - long live the army, long live armaments. And then there will be many festive memorial days. 
It does not have to be that way. It can be different. It is possible to try and build conciliation, to try and understand that the Palestinians are also entitled to a state of their own. We have to understand that we are applying a racist, colonialist and contemptible policy that we did not want. Merely saying these things aloud gives us the chills because after all, we thought that we, the Jews, have humanitarian values and that we remember that every person was created in the image of God. If we really do remember this, but continue with our actions against the Palestinians, then all of us  are afflicted with split  personalities.

<title>The checkpoint generation </title>
<date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
For nearly a month now, a young Palestinian has been hospitalized at Beilinson Hospital; soldiers shot him at a checkpoint in northern Nablus on Saturday, November 4. Haitem Yassin, 25, is conscious now, but he is still hooked up to a respirator. In recent days, he has been suffering from a high fever, apparently caused by an infection in his abdomen, which was wounded in the shooting. His family is still waiting for a report from the hospital about the number or type of bullets that caused the serious injury.  
At the Samaria Brigade, they are still investigating what happened that day at the fortified and isolated Asira al-Shmaliya checkpoint, through which only the inhabitants of several villages are permitted passage. However, according to testimonies taken by a researcher for B'Tselem - The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, it emerges that Yassin had irritated the soldiers. He dared to suggest to them that their demand of women to feel their own bodies to carry out a "security check" was inappropriate. So annoying was he that a soldier shoved him.  
Yassin, who had returned from overseas a few months earlier, had apparently not yet internalized the fact that it is dangerous to remind a soldier that a Palestinian is a human being. When the soldier shoved, Yassin shoved back. The soldier, according to the testimonies, started to scream and curse and hit. He quickly received reinforcement from two other soldiers, who fired into the air and at the ground. Even though Yassin fell to the ground after the shooting, the soldiers, relate the witnesses, threw him onto a concrete block, handcuffed him and kicked him. They also kicked him in the head, according to the testimonies, and beat him with their rifles.  
In a village in the Nablus area, S., another young Palestinian, is recovering from the trauma he suffered from a harsh beating at the hands of a soldier at the Jit checkpoint, midway between Nablus and Qalqilya. The office of the Israel Defense Forces Spokesman has stated that it was the young man who had shoved and hit a soldier who told him to return to his vehicle, whereas the soldier only fended him off, but the testimony of S. is completely different. He, like many others on that day, November 9, had got out of his vehicle while on the way to the Jewish settlement where he works, in order to find out why, just when everyone was hurrying to work, the line of cars at the checkpoint wasn't moving.  
According to one taxi driver, the soldiers announced that the cars would not be able to go through until noon. S., according to his own testimony, intended to return to his vehicle when the soldier approached him and looked as though he was going to hit him with his rifle. S. grabbed the rifle and pushed it aside. This apparently really bothered the soldier, who grabbed him, pulled him away from the rest of the people, flung him to the ground, and proceeded to him in all parts of his body. Including his head.  
Other soldiers, at the Beit Iba checkpoint west of Nablus, also got annoyed: At a student who felt he was suffocating among the mass of people who flocked to the checkpoint on October 9, and who felt the only way he could get some air was to climb a pole. When he refused to obey the soldiers' orders to come down, because there was no room and no air, they fell upon him and beat him with a rifle. According to the testimony of a friend, who spoke to an activist from Machsom Watch, the soldiers also broke his glasses and punished him: They detained him in "solitary confinement," in a kind of punishment cell into which the soldiers and the commanders throw Palestinians who "misbehave." The cell is intended for security suspects, but all too often people who dare to argue with the soldiers are thrown in there, or held in another sort of punishment cell at other checkpoints.  
In tens of thousands of homes in the West Bank live others, who may have not ended up in the hospital, but who every day accumulate harsh impressions of the nature and behavior of almost the only Israelis whom they encounter - the soldiers at the checkpoints. The non-Palestinians who pass through the checkpoints can also reach a similar conclusion - that most of the soldiers stationed at them are crude, arrogant, boastful and definitely hardhearted. All too often it appears that the soldiers intentionally cause the line of cars and people to dawdle at a checkpoint for a very long time. All too often they are seen laughing and grinning at the sight of the hundreds of people jostling and crowding in the slow line behind the narrow inspection turnstile.  
The Palestinians are not interested in, and do not need to be interested in, the explanations that Israel will give: It's a difficult mission; the soldiers are afraid; maybe someone will come bearing an explosive belt; they're young, still children; they're defending the homeland; if they weren't posted at checkpoints in the middle of the West Bank, suicide terrorists would be free to enter Israel.  
The truth is that even the soldiers' parents should not be interested in these explanations. They should, however, be very worried about their country sending their sons and daughters on an apartheid mission: to restrict Palestinian mobility within the occupied territory, to narrow the Palestinian expanse in order to enable Jews to move freely within that same occupied territory and in order to increase their expanse within it. In order to carry out this mission in full, facing the natives, the soldiers must feel and act like "superiors."

<title>The new British anti-Semitism</title>
<date>Thu Feb 16 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
Earlier this month, a parliamentary committee of inquiry began to hear testimony on the subject of the proliferation of anti-Semitism in Britain, with the aim of submitting a report that would aid the government of Britain in combating the phenomenon. 
This matter took on added significance in light of the trial of Abu Hamza, one of the leaders of the Islamic organization "al-Muhajiroun" (the Exiles), who is accused of inciting to murder Jews and recruiting British Muslims for objectives of the global Jihad. In the wake of a few studies that I have published about the issue, I was asked by the British House of Commons to appear before a parliamentary committee of inquiry. 
In fact, Britain has begun to generate its own suicide terrorists - for instance, Asif Mohammed Hanif, who blew himself up in April 2003 at "Mike's Place" in Tel Aviv, killing three civilians and wounding scores of others. Since then, homegrown Muslim terrorism struck in the heart of London, on July 7, 2005. This was not an anti-Jewish action but part of the global Jihad which threatens the West as a whole. But for some leading Muslim clerics like Sheikh Omar Bakri Muhammad (recently expelled from Britain), Jews, Christians and the West are all part of the "infidel" enemy to be destroyed. He and Abu Hamza openly recruited Muslim youth for "holy war" in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Palestine. 
In absolute numbers, Great Britain is today second only to France in serious anti-Semitic incidents among European countries. The hostile climate of opinion has been accompanied by an increase in violent assaults in the last two years. The number of synagogue desecrations has also soared, as well as serious attacks in the London neighborhood of Finsbury Park, and in the cities of Swansea and Edinburgh. A near-tripling in anti-Semitic incidents in British schools prompted the National Union of Teachers to issue new guidelines in July 2003 for combating anti-Semitism. There were also acts of vandalism in the months following the American invasion of Iraq, such as the desecration of a Jewish cemetery in the East End of London, where more than 400 graves were smashed. Last June, particularly ugly desecrations took place in Manchester and London cemeteries. 
In the past year, much has changed for the worse when it comes to anti-Semitism in Britain. Between 15 percent and 20 percent of Britons could be defined as anti-Semitic, according to a sampling by the Jewish Chronicle last year. As many as one in five Britons believe the Holocaust is "exaggerated"; a similar percentage would not vote for a Jewish prime minister, and a much higher number hold conventional anti-Semitic stereotypes about the link between Jews and money. As elsewhere in Western Europe, over 50 percent of Britons think Israel is the greatest danger to world peace. 
Last April, the Association of University Teachers (AUT), which has some 40,000 members, voted by sizable majorities to impose a boycott of two Israeli universities, Bar-Ilan University and University of Haifa, in solidarity with the Palestinian cause. The rushed vote was held on Passover eve, preventing most Jewish members from taking part. Just before the vote, speakers addressing the AUT's executive union meeting declared Israel a "colonial apartheid state, more insidious than South Africa," and called for the "removal of this regime." The boycott was reversed but the campaign continues. For most British Jews, such discriminatory boycotts are eerily reminiscent of anti-Semitic methods. 
The old-new anti-Semitism in Britain is not the kind of hatred that prevailed in Europe 60 years ago. The emerging multi-cultural society of Great Britain will not tolerate cries of Sieg Heil, jackboots, or the openly racist mythology that was irrevocably stained by the Holocaust. Still, the Muslim Council of Britain once again boycotted International Holocaust Memorial Day. 
It should be added that the vilification of Israel is leading to a sweeping accusation of the Jews as collaborators with a movement and a state that is conceived by some of the country's elites as a new form of fascism. This is evidenced by the unacceptable ease with which Israel is accused of "ethnic cleansing" or genocide of the Palestinians. 
This is not to say that British culture is inherently or overwhelmingly hostile to Jews. Great Britain, the birthplace of modern liberalism, continues to be an open society today, with a stable democracy, a free press and an independent judiciary dedicated to protecting individual liberties. For several centuries, and through World War II, Great Britain was, relative to the rest of Europe at least, a model of tolerance. Nevertheless, Great Britain has regrettably become home to a wave of anti-Jewish sentiments, innuendos, motifs, symbols, and public statements, which have gained legitimacy in British public discourse far beyond what is either healthy or acceptable.

<title>The problem that disappeared</title>
<date>Mon Sep 11 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
A month after the war in Lebanon ended, the time has come to ask what the Olmert government has to offer, now that the unilateral withdrawal plan is off the table. Beforehand, though, we must ask if more time, thought and planning is dedicated to policymaking than to coming up with a casual answer to journalists' questions. If the decision to go to war was made in a moment, in reaction to the abduction of the soldiers, it is questionable whether anyone even decided to put the realignment plan back in a drawer. 
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert mentioned it in a speech, Interior Minister Roni Bar-On said the realignment was being frozen temporarily, and Shimon Peres said there would be no withdrawal from the territories in the next 10 years. The impression is that the government has lost its way. 
Over the last two days, a chance rolled around for Olmert to recall the road map, in honor of British Prime Minister Tony Blair's visit. It is difficult to understand why Olmert waited for Blair's arrival to discuss a meeting with Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) or to promise the release of prisoners, just as it is difficult to understand why the Israeli government ignored Abu Mazen and then remembered him only after Hamas had taken power. The political vacuum generated by the government leaves a wide opening for those who have a clear agenda: the Hamas military wing, which is taking control of the Gaza Strip; and the settlers, who have already announced that the cancellation of the unilateral withdrawal will lead to a push for new construction in the West Bank. 
Everyone in the Sharon government talked about the "demographic problem" to convince people of the justness of the pullout. Now the Palestinians have been forgotten and demographics have been forgotten - all because the data can't be used for political ends. But the apartheid regime in the territories remains intact; millions of Palestinians are living without rights, freedom of movement or a livelihood, under the yoke of ongoing Israeli occupation, and in the future they will turn the Jews into a minority between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. 
The unfinished separation fence has become a monument to the shortsightedness of the Israeli policy to neither swallow nor regurgitate. The fence was meant to serve the unilateral withdrawal, but it has become clear that more outposts will be erected wherever the fence has not been completed, now that the Justice Ministry has suggested "laundering" the existing illegal outposts. When we want to withdraw, we will have to contend with more settlers. 
If the incumbent cabinet expands rightward to survive, it will not be able to set out a new political agenda. Even in the current situation, the cabinet does not appear capable of developing policy, only of reacting to the day's events from the gut and using force. The unilateral release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners sitting in our jails - with and without blood on their hands, with and without a trial, with and without a reason (some are held as bargaining chips) - could serve as a gesture that sets in motion a process of building mutual trust. 
But that is not enough. The least we can expect from a government that does not have a better solution to offer, and that has relinquished the solution for which it was elected, is that it tries to begin speaking with whoever is willing on the other side, that it involves Europe, that it suggests bringing an international force into the region - possibly with a United Nations mandate, to at least prevent deterioration. And perhaps this will be the way toward separation into two states.

<title>Uglier and uglier</title>

Palestinian politics has become exhausting and boring. At the end of last week the Fatah Central Committee convened in Amman under the leadership of Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas. This used to be a most important Palestinian political body - something like the politburo in the communist regimes or the secretariat of Mapai (precursor of the Labor Party) in days gone by. Now, at the meeting in Jordan, they decided on the establishment of a national unity government with Hamas, ignoring the fact that they are no longer in charge and that the government that is in power today is one that exists on behalf of Hamas. 
Farouk Kaddoumi, secretary general of Fatah, participated in the meeting (which was held in Amman because he does not enter the occupied territories), and declared that a government of experts must not be established because such people cannot lead the people "in a revolutionary period." The members of the young leadership reacted scornfully - What revolution? The man hasn't got a clue. 
Sixteen members participated in the meeting of the Fatah committee, all of them above the age of 70, and they discussed the question of whether and when to hold the movement's sixth convention. This is an almost permanent subject of debate that has been bandied around in the Fatah leadership for more than a decade now. The young members of the movement are already fed up with arguing with their elders. You aren't relevant, you aren't living in reality, you don't understand what is happening around you - these were some of the reactions to the meeting that were voiced by former government ministers and spokesmen for the younger generation, including Nabil Amar, Kadoura Fares and Hatem Abdul Qader. 
In Hamas the situation is no better. After the successes and dynamism that characterized the movement in the recent past, its leaders have sunk into stagnation. Internal tensions are not allowing them, whether in the territories or abroad, to evince flexibility on ideological issues. Hamas' leaders do want to lift the siege and the boycott by most of the world from themselves, but are unable to adopt a conciliatory formula on international policy or to bring the Fatah into their government. The heads of Hamas are insisting on holding on to all the powerful positions of the administration and most of the flexibility they have shown with respect to policy took the form of agreement to the "prisoners' letter," in which there is indirect and insufficient recognition of Israel. 
Can this state of affairs continue much longer? It is difficult to know. In the meantime, the 150,000 employees of the PA are receiving partial salaries and scraping by with difficulty. Every Monday and Thursday, there are demonstrations and strikes by these employees, which often turn violent. Hamas spokesmen are now accusing Abbas and his people of continuing in their corrupt ways. The Hamas organ Al Risala wrote last week that Abbas' office transferred $32 million to the Fatah leadership (which does not include Hamas members), and millions more were transferred to Palestinian television. Spokesmen for Abbas reacted angrily. 
It is clear that the phenomenon of Al-Qaida-style kidnappings is also a result of the anarchy in government. The demand by the new organization, the Holy Jihad Brigades, to release prisoners in return for the two Fox Network journalists it abducted was not directed at the State of Israel, but rather at the United States. Despite their release, this is a dangerous precedent because thus far every act of Palestinian terror has been to date done in a nationalist context and not in a context of global Islam. 
In the Palestinian public there is the fear that the stagnation and the anarchy will engender a harsh response from Israel that will win American backing. "The Americans are not succeeding in Iraq, they are having a hard time reining in Iran and we are the only ones they are succeeding in hitting hard, by means of Israel, in order to prove their capability," they are saying in the Palestinian media. 
Furthermore, the stagnation and anarchy in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are not attracting any attention from us in Israel. We have already become accustomed to it all: to the economic siege of the Palestinians, the apartheid roads, the regime of discrimination and collective punishment, and of course to "the lords of the land" who build all sorts of outposts. Only a few years ago each of these subjects aroused debate in Israeli society. Now there is hardly any. Everything keeps going on in the same way, only it is becoming uglier and uglier.

<title>What is Hamas doing in South Africa?</title>
<date>Fri Mar 31 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
"There will be cloudy weather over parts of racist South Africa," Zimbabwean TV weather anchors would forecast during the dark days of apartheid. Understandable perhaps, but bizarre. Fast forward to contemporary Israel and one wonders whether a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority will accept assistance in dealing with avian flu from the non-existent State of Israel? 
Even during the apartheid era, the differences between the South African and Israeli context were greater than the similarities, particularly on the fundamentals. The South African state was universally regarded as illegitimate, yet internationally recognised, de facto and de jure, even by Zimbabwean weather forecasters. Hamas' non-recognition of Israel is of a completely different order in that it denies the right of the State of Israel to exist. Moreover, Israel lives under the constant regional threat of hostile undemocratic regimes and now proto-nuclear powers that seek its destruction and sponsor acts of indiscriminate terror against its people. By contrast, in supporting the overthrow of the apartheid regime, Pretoria's African regional neighbors sought justice and democracy for all the country's citizens, rather than the state's destruction. 
Whilst Abu Mazen's official visit to South Africa starting this week has attracted little attention, Pretoria's invitation to Hamas has precipitated consternation in Israel. This is understandable. Responsible for some of the most heinous acts of terrorism, Hamas to date has rejected the international agreements signed with Israel by the PLO/Palestinian Authority and shows no signs of moderating its position as demonstrated by its failure compromise with Fatah to form a government of national unity. It is contended that as an Islamic fundamentalist movement, Hamas cannot compromise its fundamentals without changing the raison d'etre for its existence and there is little prospect of this as a party in power. 
Thus Israel is asking of South Africa, "What is there to discuss with Hamas?" What can South Africa deliver that the infinitely more powerful and influential Vladimir Putin could not? Informed Israelis may well question what South Africa hopes to achieve in talking to such a party when its own policy of "quiet diplomacy" toward the Mugabe regime has yielded nothing but embarrassment for Pretoria and further suffering for millions of Zimbabweans. 
Indeed there is a strong sentiment of dismissiveness and irritation in Israel at this middle-ranking country on the tip of Africa, with a governing party strongly affiliated to the PLO, "poking its nose in" where it is not wanted. For sceptics, South Africa's naivete and arrogance may have the unintended consequence of conferring recognition of Hamas' policies and positions toward Israel. South African watchers may also point to President Mbeki's own pretensions toward global statesmanship as the key to his personal involvement in facilitating dialogue between  Palestinians and Israel. 
Such is the case for the prosecution. There is, however, a different interpretation of South Africa's involvement that merits consideration. 
Last week at a Foreign Press Association press conference in Jerusalem, former prime minister Shimon Peres contended that his and Kadima's  approach to Hamas would be to first seek dialogue. Only as a second choice would a Kadima-led government carry out its four-year plan of disengagement unilaterally. Thus if the principle of dialogue is accepted and the policy of dialogue is the preferred option of a Kadima-led government, the same holds true of the international community and South Africa's desire to have a dialogue with the newly-elected government of the Palestinian Authority. 
Secondly, like it or not, many South Africans have a deep and personal interest in the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in particular. The country boasts an influential, but ever-diminishing Jewish population of some 80,000. There are Jews in the cabinet and parliament, including the leader of the official opposition. South African Jews are highly prominent in business, the judiciary and academia. One is reminded of the links of South African Jewry when walking past Jaffa Gate, restored with the support of South African Jews. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon singled out South African Jews as particularly welcome to make aliyah. 
But South Africa also has a much larger Muslim population of some 800,000, many of whom are successful, influential and enjoy strong and growing ties with the Middle East region. 
Thirdly, given Israel's often fraught relations at the United Nations, it is worth considering that South Africa is likely to be granted a permanent "African bloc" seat on any expanded United Nations Security Council. Every state needs friends in the international community, none more so than Israel and Palestine. South Africa carries a disproportionate weight in multilateral fora and still enjoys a degree of moral political capital. This is not just derived from its successful transition, but because, since democratisation, it has been a leading advocate of anti-poverty campaigns, debt write-off, trade reform and diplomatic conflict mediation. 
South Africa's testimony at the 2004 International Court of Justice hearings on the security wall aggrieved the Israeli government and its abstention from the recent International Atomic Energy Agency vote on Iran's referral to the UN Security Council was viewed as a sop to Teheran, or at worst, an act of hostility toward Israel. Yet South Africa's position was consistent with its approach to international relations, that is to seek consensus in multilateral forums and to oppose injustice,  unilateralism and pre-emption. 
South Africa's position on Iran's nuclear program was to await the full IAEA report before even considering a vote of referral. As the spurious grounds for invading Iraq demonstrated, being bulldozed or misled into adopting bellicose positions based on highly imperfect or manufactured intelligence is dangerous and counterproductive. 
South Africa can teach Israel and Palestine nothing. It has no experience in territorial, religious, or fundamentalist struggles. For South Africans, suicide bombers are a TV image, not a daily threat. It cannot mediate, cajole, nor persuade. It has neither the leverage, nor the political repertoire, to influence the deep and stark realities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. With all his charisma and credibility as a figure of reconciliation, not even Nelson Mandela could make the desert of Israeli- Palestinian relations bloom. 
South Africa is not viewed as an impartial (or even honest) broker by Israel and may even be viewed as a useful idiot by Palestinians. But what South Africa can do and has every legitimate right to do, is to share its story and to provide the protagonists a space for dialogue. Whilst South Africans generally understand far too little about Israeli history, fears and suffering, nor indeed about your particular struggle for identity, emerging from our past, we do have a degree of domestic success in conflict resolution, reconciliation, reconstruction and nation-building. Surely these are some of the issues that go to the very heart of the challenges that  confront Israel today?

<title>469 Israelis petition Spain to recognize a Palestine state</title>
<date>29/10/2014</date>
<content>
An Israeli petition calling on the Spanish parliament to recognize a Palestinian  state in November, when it is expected to hold a nonbinding vote on the matter,  is gaining steam on the Internet, garnering 469 signatures.Among those  spearheading the Israeli initiative is former Foreign Ministry director-general  Alon Liel, in hopes that Palestinian statehood recognition would help break the  stalemate in the peace process.




“We are horrified by the possibility,  almost a reality, of a single state,” Liel told The Jerusalem Post on Tuesday.  “We are afraid that such a state will end up being an apartheid  state.”There is broad consensus in the international community that the  two-state solution should be based on the pre-1967 lines, with some land swaps,  Liel said as he called on the Israeli government to accept this position as  well.Parliamentary initiatives to support a Palestinian state are  growing, as the peace process remains deadlocked with no apparent prospects of  renewed negotiations.Last week, the Upper House of the Irish parliament  passed a nonbinding resolution calling on its government to recognize Palestine  as a state. It followed a similar vote by the British House of Commons this  month.A petition similarly circulated by Liel in advance of the British  vote received 363 signatures.This month, the Swedish government also  made waves when it said it would soon recognize Palestine as a state.But  in spite of the parliamentary votes, the UK and Ireland have not recognized  Palestine as a state. The British government has maintained its position that  recognition should be granted only at the conclusion of a negotiated  final-status agreement that ends the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The  Spanish government concurs with the UK. Former Spanish prime minister Jose Maria  Aznar this weekend published an opinion piece in the The Times of London against  parliamentary initiatives to recognize Palestine as a state.A majority  of the international community, 138 nations, already recognize Palestine as a  state. But to date, only three EU member states have done so – Hungary, Poland  and Slovakia.They took that stance before joining the EU.But in  spite of the support, the UN has yet to accept Palestine as a member  state.To seek membership status the PA must secure the support of the UN  Security Council. In January, Spain will become one of the 15 nations with UNSC  membership.Aznar warned that “recognizing Palestine as a state in the  face of Hamas’s attacks on Israel is detrimental to peace.”In his  opinion piece in the The Times Aznar wrote, “Nevertheless many countries are  today indulging in a ‘recognition now’ policy” with regard to a Palestinian  state.Aznar predicted, “We should expect similar moves to these across  Europe. No matter how well intentioned these initiatives are, recognizing a  Palestinian state now is inappropriate, counterproductive and unwarranted. It  will not promote peace and it will not boost a negotiated solution. This is why:  First, recognizing Palestine will induce the Palestinians to stray from a  negotiated solution, given the fact that a hard line has got them this far,”  Aznar said.Such “feel good statements,” he said, only encourage the PA  to resist negotiating with Israel.These parliamentary initiatives, he  said, “unfairly put pressure only on Israel.”He blamed the stalemate in  the peace process on PA President Mahmoud Abbas, charging that he failed to  accept a US framework document, united with Hamas and demanded unacceptable  concessions from Jerusalem.“Israel is today a bulwark against jihadism,  and Western countries need the support of Israel against this and other threats  to global security,” Aznar said He echoed Netanyahu when he stated that Hamas  and Islamic State are “parts of the same Islamist front” which the West should  not legitimize.
He called on leaders of “free nations” to reject  unilateral moves and to urge Israelis and Palestinians to resume direct  bilateral talks.

<title>Arab League joins PA bid for United Nations timeline on Israeli pullout to pre-1967 lines</title>
<date>29/11/2014</date>
<content>
Arab foreign ministers decided on Saturday to support the Palestinian  Authority’s plan to seek a  UN Security Council resolution calling for a full  Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 lines and the establishment of an  independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital.The  decision followed a meeting of the ministers in Cairo to discuss the latest  developments in the region and PA President Mahmoud Abbas’s plan to seek a  Security Council resolution that sets a timeline for Israel’s pullout and the  creation of a Palestinian state.




Abbas said that if he does not receive  answers from Israel regarding his demand to resume the peace talks on the basis  of the pre-1967 lines by the end of the day on Saturday, he would proceed with  his statehood bid at the Security Council and join international organizations  and treaties, including the International Criminal Court.The Arab  ministers said that the Arab countries would present a draft resolution to the  Security Council that includes the PA demands for a withdrawal to the pre-1967  lines.However, the ministers did not say when the draft resolution would  be presented to the council.However, they said that they would continue  to hold consultations with all members of the Security Council, as well as  various international parties, to win their backing for the proposed  resolution.The Arab League ministers also reiterated their opposition to  Israel’s demand to be recognized as a Jewish state.Abbas attended  Saturday’s meeting in Cairo. He threatened to proceed with his statehood bid at  the Security Council unless the peace talks with Israel are  revived.“Israel does not know where its borders are and is refusing to  define them,” Abbas said. “We will present an Arab plan to the Security Council  calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state. All indications are that  US mediation efforts to revive the peace talks have failed.”He said that  the PA had asked US Secretary of State John Kerry to work together to draft the  resolution that would be presented to the Security Council. The PA also asked  Kerry to put pressure on Israel to stop settlement construction and release more  Palestinian prisoners, Abbas added.Abbas warned that if the Palestinian  move at the Security Council is thwarted, “we would move toward defining our  relations with Israel by halting security coordination and asking the occupation  to assume its responsibilities [toward the Palestinian population].”The  US is expected to use its veto power in the Security Council to block the  Palestinian resolution. It has spoken in favor of the resumption of direct  negotiations as the sole path to solving the Israeli Palestinian  conflict.The Prime Minister’s Office would not comment on Abbas’ request  to resume talks based on the pre-1967 lines. But in the past, Netanyahu has  rejected that language.An Israeli official said, “Abbas always wants to  talk about the borders of the future Palestinian state, but refuses to answer  the fundamental questions. Will the Palestinian state recognize the Jewish  state? Will he agree to demilitarization? Will he end incitement to hatred  against Israel?” The Israeli official added, “By avoiding these essential  questions, he makes a serious discussions of the borders impossible. These  issues are intertwined. He cannot just chose the ones that he is comfortable  discussing.”The official warned any Palestinian decision to unilaterally  seek statehood recognition or to turn to the International Criminal Court “could  be highly destabilizing.”With respect to Abbas’s threats to end the PA’s  security cooperation with Israel, the official said that both sides benefit from  the relationship.The official noted that, just two months ago, Israeli  security forces had uncovered a Hamas plot against Abbas.In Cairo on  Saturday, Abbas told the emergency meeting of Arab foreign ministers, “We are no  longer able to live with the status quo. We have no choice but to  internationalize the Palestinian cause.”He also reiterated the  Palestinians’ refusal to recognize Israel as a Jewish state.“We  recognize the State of Israel, but we won’t recognize a Jewish state at all,”  Abbas stressed. “If Israel wants to change its name, it should go to the UN.  This is its business.”Abbas accused Israel of working toward  “consolidating apartheid through a number of laws.”“The situation in the  West Bank is dangerous and can’t continue as it is,” Abbas said in his speech.  “The most dangerous thing facing the Palestinian cause at this time is the  continuation of the status quo.”He said that Israel knows very well that  there would be no Palestinian state without the Gaza Strip. Israel, he charged,  is continuing with its policy of creating facts on the ground by building  settlements on Palestinian territories.Abbas also met in Cairo with  Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Sisi and briefed him on his plan to go to the  Security Council. The two also discussed the situation in the Gaza Strip and the  continued closure of the Rafah border crossing, a PA official said.The  official quoted Abbas as saying during the meeting that the donor countries  should fulfill their promises to fund the reconstruction of the Gaza  Strip.

<title>Abbas wants UN to replace US as leading negotiator in peace talks, aide says</title>
<date>9/9/2014</date>
<content>
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas wants the UN to replace the US as leading peace broker between Israel and the Palestinians, a senior official told Bloomberg in an interview published Tuesday.Senior Fatah official Nabil Sha'ath said if Israel does not agree to a West Bank pullout in the next round of talks, the Palestinians would challenge the Jewish state politically, "all over the universe." One thing on the future agenda, according to Sha'ath, is to urge the international community to handle Israel "as it did apartheid South Africa." 




Sha'ath said their dream of statehood was not over and that they would turn to the UN Security Council to take over the peace process. PA chief Abbas is slated to ask the UN for a deadline for a full Israeli withdrawal to pre-1967 lines, and will set a three-year window for the pullout.Taking on the US,  Sha'ath said its "plan has not worked out," as he urged the global community to adopt a different plan.As for the unity agreement between rival factions Hamas and Fatah signed in April, Abbas' aide said the PA stood by the agreement, adding that only through national unity, could a deal with Israel be struck. 
Abbas's top aide said the Palestinian people were "totally disillusioned and disappointed" in peace talks, specifically America's role in them.

<title>Arab workers' firing draws wall-to-wall condemnation from Israeli politicians</title>
<date>20/11/2014</date>
<content>
Ashkelon Mayor Itamar Shimoni’s dismissal of Arab workers renovating bomb  shelters in the city’s preschools drew criticism from across the political  spectrum Thursday, and government officials pointed to its  illegality.“We should not discriminate against an entire public because  of a small minority that is violent and militant,” Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu said.




“The vast majority of Israeli-Arab citizens are  law-abiding, and we are acting resolutely against those who break the  law.”Interior Minister Gilad Erdan said his ministry, which is  responsible for municipalities, is examining the legality of Shimoni’s  decision.“We cannot act in a way that will besmirch an entire population  group in Israel. Decisions like this can lead to increased tensions,” he told  Israel Radio, calling for leaders to try to bring calm and security.In a  Facebook post Wednesday night, Shimoni wrote that bomb shelter renovations being  performed by Arabs will be stopped as of Thursday, and that he had ordered the  placing of armed security guards for kindergartens and preschools that are next  to construction sites that employ Arabs.“I thank the Ashkelon police for  its cooperation on this matter and the donor who helped pay for the security  guards,” said Shimoni. A spokesman for the Lachish regional police, including  Ashkelon, said they have nothing to do with the  initiative.Attorney-General Yehuda Weinstein on Thursday sent a letter  to the mayor telling him that if he does block the employment of Arabs in  Ashkelon, it could have “grave public and legal  consequences.”Weinstein’s deputy, Oren Funo, wrote that a 1988 law  prohibits discrimination due to race or ethnicity in the workplace, that this is  a fundamental tenet of the law in Israel, and that the mayor would need to  explain himself if he issues a discriminatory order.Erdan and Justice  Minister Tzipi Livni asked Weinstein to investigate Shimoni.In a letter  to Weinstein, Livni said the mayor’s instructions “undermine the basic  principles of equality and nondiscrimination and violate the Equal Opportunities  in the Workplace Law,” and she called for Weinstein to deal with the violation  to the full extent of the law.The commissioner for equal employment  opportunities at the Economy Ministry, Tziona Koenig-Yair, called the  municipality’s actions illegal, adding that in recent days the ministry received  several requests regarding employers firing or wishing to terminate the  employment of Arab male and female employees solely on racial  grounds.She clarified that the Equal Opportunities Law (5748-1988)  clearly prohibits employers from discriminating against their employees on  account of their race, ethnic origin or religion.Employment  discrimination due to race, whether by terminating employment or accepting for  employment, is forbidden by law.“During these difficult times, I expect  employers to exercise responsibility and leadership to encourage tolerance and  equal opportunities, and not exclusion, particularly local authorities such as  the Ashkelon Municipality, which publicized that it has terminated the  employment of Arabs in the municipality, a step that breaks the Equal  Opportunities Law,” she said.Economy Minister Naftali Bennett said the  country must have zero tolerance for racism in the  workforce.“Ninety-nine percent of Israeli Arabs are loyal and want to  integrate. There is a tiny minority that uses violence and causes terrorism, and  we must crack down on that, but [we must] also integrate and bring closer the  vast majority of Israeli Arabs. This is a key to our future  here.”Bennett said he already instructed that his ministry reaffirm its  opposition to workplace discrimination, which is illegal.Finance  Minister Yair Lapid said calls not to employ Arabs are racist, unacceptable and  intolerable.“That is surrendering to terrorism, because we are giving up  our everyday lives to extremists instead of supporting coexistence,” he said.  “The vast majority of Israeli Arabs live with us, and we don’t need to insult  them and behave like this.”Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon said “the  attempt to prevent Israeli Arabs from making a living just because they are  Arabs goes against our values.At this time, we must reject all racism  and discrimination against Israeli Arabs or any other person and act to bring  calm.”Ya’alon pointed out that by law Israeli Arabs have rights equal to  all other Israelis, and said the country must be careful to ensure they can  exercise those rights, and be careful to avoid dangerous populism in order to  continue working toward the Arab minority’s integration in general society,  rather than alienate them.Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz said it  was “sad that relations between Jews and Arabs will suffer because of some  jihadist fanatical terrorists.”He said that on the one hand “one can  understand” the fear of parents of kindergarten children afraid “someone will  take a knife one day, as happened in the synagogue in Jerusalem, shout ‘Allahu  Akbar’ and begin to attack.”On the other hand, he said, “this is  something that should be handled while keeping the generally good relations  between Jews and Arabs.”Steinitz said it was important to be “very  careful to keep Arab-Jewish relations as good and normal as possible.” Most  Israeli Arabs, he said, “are loyal to the State of Israel and would never engage  in terrorist activities against the State of Israel.”Opposition leader  Isaac Herzog (Labor) said the Ashkelon mayor’s decision was  immoral.“Even in more difficult wartimes than today, Israel did not take  steps of discrimination and deprivation against Arabs who live among us as  citizens with equal rights. Where will we be if we fan the flames?” Herzog  asked.The Labor Party leader called on all leaders to show  responsibility, criticize the decision and work toward safe coexistence between  Jews and Arabs.Meretz leader Zehava Gal-On said she understands why  parents of preschoolers in Ashkelon are afraid of having Arab workers near their  children in a time when there have been many terrorist attacks, and “when they  hear the government say again and again terrorists are equal to every  Arab.”However, she said, racism is the easy option and it does not have  any justification from a security standpoint.“Not only is this against  the law, but it is clearly immoral,” she wrote on Facebook. “The decision takes  the children in these preschools into consideration, but not the children of the  workers, who will ask their fathers why they aren’t going to work and will have  to hear an answer that will scar them for life.”Ahmed Tibi (United Arab  List- Ta’al) petitioned Weinstein against Shimoni’s decision, which he called  anti-Semitic.“Security is an excuse for clear racism and  law-breaking.By that principle, Arab nurses and doctors should be fired  from hospitals, and Arab bus and taxi drivers should be separated from Jews.  This separation has a name, and it’s apartheid,” he stated.Tibi warned  that “what starts with separate buses in the occupied territories quickly moved  to separation between Jews and Arabs in Israel.”Histadrut labor  federation chairman Avi Nissankoren said he thinks it is “unforgivable that in  the State of Israel someone would take away a person’s right to work because of  his religion or origins.”Jafar Farah, the director of the Mossawa Center  – The Advocacy Center for Arab Citizens in Israel, said his NGO would “sue the  mayor of Ashkelon for inciting for breaking the law prohibiting discrimination  in the workplace.”Farah added that if there were Jews willing to work in  construction, then they would not hire Arabs.“Let’s see Ashkelon,  hospitals and other places get by without Arab workers,” he said.“The  stoppage of Arab labor will paralyze services and cause losses of more than NIS  100 million a day.”Farah blamed Netanyahu for worsening discrimination  against Arabs and the security of Arabs and Jews.“Thousands of Jewish  workers are employed in Arab municipalities and have never received similar  racist treatment.”Thursday night in Ashkelon, dozens of residents  gathered to demonstrate in favor of Shimoni.The Abraham Fund Initiatives  released a statement saying it is understandable that the current security  situation causes fear among parents and the public in general, but “public  leaders at the local and national level need to act responsibly and avoid  actions that label Arab citizens as a danger.“Unfounded labeling only  increases the feelings of fear and hostility and is dangerous and harmful to the  fabric of relations between Jews and Arabs in Israel.”Meanwhile, an  urgent letter sent by Jerusalem’s Deputy Mayor Yossi Deitch and council member  Yitzhak Pindrus to the Egged bus line chairman Avi Friedman on Wednesday made an  unequivocal demand to fire striking Arab bus drivers who have not shown up for  work the past four days following the suicide of a fellow driver in Jerusalem on  Sunday “This is a real danger to human life if it is not addressed immediately,”  said the letter to the Egged chairman.
Following an onslaught of  unfounded claims in the Palestinian media Monday that the driver, Yusuf Hassan  al-Ramouni, was murdered by Jewish settlers, an autopsy report concluded the  driver’s death was self-inflicted, resulting from hanging himself inside the  vehicle.

<title>CONCERT REVIEW</title>
<date>2/9/2014</date>
<content>
After a summer of concert cancellations, the great jazz vocal group The  Manhattan Transfer played to a full house at Tel Aviv’s Mann Auditorium on  Monday.Or, in the words of “Birdland,” their vocalese hit and tribute to  Charlie Parker and the classic New York jazz club he used to play: Yes indeed  they did, Yes indeed they did Yes they did Manhattan Transfer played in the Holy  Land Yes they really did Yes indeed they really did told the truth way down in  Holy Land.




And like Parker in that whimsical song, they “cooked,” as  their rhythm “swooped and swirled.”Showing an energy belying their  years, the vocal quartet comprised of Janis Siegel, 62, Cheryl Bentyne, 60, Alan  Paul, 64, and Tim Hauser, 72, whirled through a 19-song set, featuring many of  their greatest hits, like “Birdland,” “Trickle Trickle,” “Java Jive,” “Corner  Pocket,” “Route 66” and – as the encore – the finger-snapping “Boy From New York  City.”The voices may not be as velvety as they were at their height in  the ’80s, but when singing and harmonizing together, they channeled that  foot-tapping magic that led them to 10 Grammy awards and recognition as one of  the all-time premier jazz vocal groups. They were artfully accompanied by their  long-time pianist and musical director, Israeli Yaron Gerhovsky; Cliff Almond on  drums; and Boris Kozlov on bass.Siegel was especially good, scatting  wonderfully in a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald – “A-tisket, A-tasket” – that would  have made the First Lady of Song proud. Likewise, she soared on  “Birdland.”The one awkward point of the show was a rather screechy  vocalese rendition of “Tutu,” by Bentyne, which was Miles Davis’ tribute, as she  pointed out, to the “great Bishop Desmond Tutu.”Tutu is the virulently  anti-Israel South African Nobel Peace Prize laureate who likes to accuse Israel  of apartheid, and who just last week urged a giant Dutch bank to divest from  Israel. Not sure Tel Aviv was the best place to sing Tutu’s tributes, even in  jazz form, especially when there are so many other – better songs – in the  group’s repertoire.But forget Tutu. The significance of the group  playing in Israel precisely now – after a summer of war – was not lost on its  members.“We know how difficult it has been and we are proud and honored  to be here,” Paul, said about three-quarters through the 100-minute performance,  and just after Siegel sang a wonderful bossa nova song in  Portuguese.Paul said he wanted to dedicate the next song to all the  children, “praying that they can live in peace without fear and in  joy.”With lights dimmed low, Paul – holding a page of lyrics – sang a  cantorial-sounding Yiddish lullaby, transporting the listener from the Brazilian  rainforests to a Polish shtetl.
Then, after a warm round of appreciative  applause for the gesture, it was – boop bop, boop bop – back “way down south in  Birmingham, I mean south, in Alabam,’” right smack-dab in the middle of “Tuxedo  Junction,” that upbeat Glenn Miller jazz classic, which they sang with  infectious enthusiasm and energy – even now, after all these years – to near  perfection.

There are few more poignant Holocaust stories than the events surrounding the  long self-imposed incarceration of Anne Frank and her family in Amsterdam and  the subsequent publication of the young girl’s diary The story of Frank’s time  in the family’s hideout and the family’s eventual capture by the Germans will be  given a new highly visual and emotive rendition by Czech dancer and actress  Mirenka Cechova when she performs The Voice of Anne Frank at this year’s Israeli  Fringe Theater Festival in Acre.Cechova conceived the solo show in 2007  and has performed it all over the world over the last seven years. It has  received a string of prestigious official kudos, including the Outstanding  Performance Award at the Prague Fringe Festival and Top Overseas Production at  the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown, South Africa. Even so, Cechova says  she is very excited at the prospect of bringing the show to this part of the  world.




“It is very special to bring this to Israel. It has been my aim  from the very beginning. I wanted to bring it to a place where people understand  the story very deeply.I am looking forward to the response of the  audience and to the connection with the people,” she says.The emotional  and historical link between Israel and the Holocaust is self-evident, but how do  audiences in other countries around the world respond to this story? While  people in South Africa may identify with certain aspects of oppression conveyed  in The Voice of Anne Frank, others who perhaps have no personal or family  experience of such circumstances may respond differently.“I think there  is a common element, and it is a very deep emotional connection from all places  through the story of a 13-year-old girl,” observes Cechova. “This is a girl who  is suffering in her special circumstances, but she is also going through puberty  and has her adolescent troubles.”In addition to the personal predicament  in which Anne Frank found herself, Cechova believes that the members of  different audiences tend to relate to the show in a very personal way and that  their personal and cultural background can color the way they read into the  dramatic stage action. “Audiences everywhere accept this play very strongly but, of course, there are places where they have  had their own struggles, and they put their own experiences into the  performance,” Cechova notes. “In South Africa, there was a strong response from  the people who were oppressed during apartheid, so they understood the  performance in their own way.”And, possibly more poignantly, Cechova  says she is particularly aware of the fact that there could be youngsters in her  audiences who may be able to readily identify with many of the emotions the  heroine of the story experienced.“I think it is very important to  perform this show for children who are the same age as Anne Frank was, and they  can relate very much to this and can learn this topic and study the context  around Anne Frank,” she says.Cechova believes there is a precious  educational message to be conveyed through The Voice of Anne Frank.“I  feel it is very important to discuss the subject with the young people after my  shows, to explain to them more about what Anne Frank was and to give them  knowledge of her story and the heritage she is spreading,” she says.The  32-year-old Cechova is no stranger to challenging production themes. A couple of  years ago she presented S/He Is Nancy Joe, a daring solo dance show about  transgender issues.And Dante: Light in the Darkness and The Death of  Marquis de Sade, which she performed last year with the Tantehorse physical mime  theater company, were not exactly a physical or emotional walk in the park,  either.As the subject matter suggests, The Voice of Anne Frank is a  highly dramatic show based on a very emotive story.“This is a very  strong piece for me personally as well, as I feel as if I am a bit addicted to  performing this piece because I feel it is very important to perform this show,  possibly even more than other pieces I do. I love the others too, but this one  is special,” she admits.It appears that, polished professional skills  notwithstanding, Cechova has a vested interest in portraying Anne Frank’s  story.“People are always asking me if I am Jewish. I am not Jewish,”  says the dancer, “but some of my relatives were sent to concentration camps.  This topic was discussed in my family all the time since my childhood, so I grew  up in this context and paradigm. That is why this production is very important  for me.”Cechova first encountered the story of the young Jewish Dutch  girl at school.“I read it when I was 13. It is part of the education  system,” she explains. “But I read it a second time when I was a student in the  theater faculty, and that time I was really sucked into it. I was old enough to  really understand and appreciate it.”There was no turning  back.“At the time, I thought I would love to take a year off to really  research the topic and learn about other stories, not just the one about Anne  Frank,” she continues.“I wanted to do a performance that would honor  Anne.”Initially, Cechova came up with a grand plan but eventually  realized she would have to scale it back.“Originally, the show had three  parts. The first was about The Diary of Anne Frank, which lasts an hour like it  does today. Then there were the second and third parts that were about other  stories from the Holocaust. But that became a very long piece for the audience,  and very tough,” she says.So we are left with the one-hour production,  which is replete with drama, high emotion and even humor. There are lighter  moments in between the dark passages, and it is fair to say that few in the  audience will remain unmoved by the work.For those who would like to  talk to Cechova about the performances, she will be available for questions or  just to chat after the shows.
The show is in English. The part of Kitty  is “played” by the cello.

<title>Erekat: Resolution to be put to Security Council calling for Palestinian state by 2017</title>
<date>24/10/2014</date>
<content>
RAMALLAH, West Bank - The Palestinians' chief peace negotiator has laid out in the clearest terms yet plans to establish an independent Palestinian state within three years, even if it means ignoring pleas from the United States not to push ahead.Expressing deep frustration and a degree of resignation that years of efforts to forge a two-state solution with the Israelis have made next to no progress, Saeb Erekat said there was no option other than to make a unilateral push for statehood.




He said a resolution would be put to the United Nations Security Council next month calling for a November 2017 deadline for the establishment of two states based on the boundaries that existed before the 1967 Middle East war, when Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza and seized east Jerusalem - the areas the Palestinians want for an independent state."The status quo cannot last," Erekat told members of the foreign press at his offices in Ramallah on Thursday. "We want to establish a state no later than November 2017. That's it."The Palestinian leadership is well aware that the United States will almost certainly veto any such UN resolution, although it will first try to convince the Palestinians not to make such a move so that the veto does not have to be used.Erekat said US Secretary of State John Kerry had told him at a conference in Cairo this month that the Security Council was "not an option", but avoided the word veto. The United States is a major source of funding for the Palestinians.Even if a statehood resolution is thwarted in New York, Erekat reiterated plans to sign up to more than 500 international organizations, conventions, treaties and protocols as Palestine, creating a de facto independence.That includes the International Criminal Court, which the Palestinians have repeatedly talked about joining in recent years without taking concrete steps. Erekat said the time for prevarication was over."We are going to surprise you this time. We will sign the Rome statute," he said, referring to the treaty that established the International Criminal Court in 1998.

MUST BE TWO STATESThe United States, the European Union and Israel are opposed to any unilateral moves towards statehood, saying independence should only emerge via negotiations with the Israelis. Kerry said on Wednesday, however, that the current situation was unsustainable.The negotiations were suspended in April, with Israel opposed to the Palestinian Authority's plans to forge a reconciliation government with Hamas, and the Palestinians frustrated by persistent Israeli settlement building.The conflict in Hamas-ruled Gaza in July and August, in which more than 2,100 Palestinians and 73 Israelis were killed, also refocused world attention on the Palestinian issue.Unilateral moves towards statehood are likely to make Israel even less inclined to return to negotiations, but Erekat said that was for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to worry about.Some opinion polls show 70 percent of Israeli Jews now oppose a two-state solution, which has been the bedrock of negotiations for decades. Erekat said any other outcome would lead to an apartheid state."If he believes that he can sustain the status quo and we'll do that for him, forget it. This will not last beyond November 2014, we will not take it any more, business as usual," he said.While any move towards independence would have far more chance of succeeding if it were backed by the United States or the European Union - even if Israel remained adamantly opposed - Erekat said momentum was shifting in the Palestinians' favor.Sweden's decision this month to recognize Palestine was followed by a non-binding vote in the British parliament recognizing an independent Palestinian state. Further such votes are on the cards in France and Spain.
"There are good signs in Europe," said Erekat, 59, who has been at the heart of negotiations with Israel since the mid-1990s. "Hopefully 2015 will be the year of Europe recognizing Palestine."

<title>Full text of Prime Minister Netanyahu's UN speech</title>
<date>29/9/2014</date>
<content>
[Transcription] Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Speech at the United Nations  General Assembly September 29, 2014 Thank you, Mr. President, Distinguished  delegates, I come here from Jerusalem to speak on behalf of my people, the  people of Israel. I've come here to speak about the dangers we face and about  the opportunities we see. I've come here to expose the brazen lies spoken from  this very podium against my country and against the brave soldiers who defend  it.Ladies and Gentlemen, The people of Israel pray for peace.




But  our hopes and the world's hope for peace are in danger. Because everywhere we  look, militant Islam is on the march.It's not militants. It's not Islam.  It's militant Islam. Typically, its first victims are other Muslims, but it  spares no one. Christians, Jews, Yazidis, Kurds – no creed, no faith, no ethnic  group is beyond its sights. And it's rapidly spreading in every part of the  world. You know the famous American saying: "All politics is local"? For the  militant Islamists, "All politics is global." Because their ultimate goal is to  dominate the world.Now, that threat might seem exaggerated to some,  since it starts out small, like a cancer that attacks a particular part of the  body. But left unchecked, the cancer grows, metastasizing over wider and wider  areas. To protect the peace and security of the world, we must remove this  cancer before it's too late. Last week, many of the countries represented here  rightly applauded President Obama for leading the effort to confront ISIS. And  yet weeks before, some of these same countries, the same countries that now  support confronting ISIS, opposed Israel for confronting Hamas. They evidently  don’t understand that ISIS and Hamas are branches of the same poisonous  tree.ISIS and Hamas share a fanatical creed, which they both seek to  impose well beyond the territory under their control.Listen to ISIS’s  self-declared caliph,Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. This is what he said two months ago:  A day will soon come when the Muslim will walk everywhere as a master… The  Muslims will cause the world to hear and understand the meaning of terrorism…  and destroy the idol of democracy. Now listen to Khaled Meshaal, the leader of  Hamas. He proclaims a similar vision of the future: We say this to the West… By  Allah you will be defeated. Tomorrow our nation will sit on the throne of the  world.As Hamas's charter makes clear, Hamas’s immediate goal is to  destroy Israel. But Hamas has a broader objective. They also want a caliphate.  Hamas shares the global ambitions of its fellow militant Islamists. That’s why  its supporters wildly cheered in the streets of Gaza as thousands of Americans  were murdered on 9/11. And that's why its leaders condemned the United States  for killing Osama Bin Laden, whom they praised as a holy warrior.So when  it comes to their ultimate goals, Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas.And  what they share in common, all militant Islamists share in common: • Boko Haram  in Nigeria; • Ash-Shabab in Somalia; • Hezbollah in Lebanon; • An-Nusrah in  Syria; • The Mahdi Army in Iraq; • And the Al-Qaeda branches in Yemen, Libya,  the Philippines, India and elsewhere.Some are radical Sunnis, some are  radical Shi'ites. Some want to restore a pre-medieval caliphate from the 7th  century. Others want to trigger the apocalyptic return of an imam from the 9th  century. They operate in different lands, they target different victims and they  even kill each other in their quest for supremacy. But they all share a fanatic  ideology. They all seek to create ever expanding enclaves of militant Islam  where there is no freedom and no tolerance – Where women are treated as chattel,  Christians are decimated, and minorities are subjugated, sometimes given the  stark choice: convert or die. For them, anyone can be an infidel, including  fellow Muslims.Ladies and Gentlemen, Militant Islam's ambition to  dominate the world seems mad. But so too did the global ambitions of another  fanatic ideology that swept to power eight decades ago.The Nazis  believed in a master race. The militant Islamists believe in a master faith.  They just disagree about who among them will be the master… of the master faith.  That’s what they truly disagree about. Therefore, the question before us is  whether militant Islam will have the power to realize its unbridled  ambitions.There is one place where that could soon happen: The Islamic  State of Iran. For 35 years, Iran has relentlessly pursued the global mission  which was set forth by its founding ruler, Ayatollah Khomeini, in these words:  We will export our revolution to the entire world.Until the cry "There  is no God but Allah" will echo throughout the world over… And ever since, the  regime’s brutal enforcers, Iran's Revolutionary Guards, have done exactly  that.Listen to its current commander, General Muhammad Ali Ja'afari. And  he clearly stated this goal. He said: Our Imam did not limit the Islamic  Revolution to this country… Our duty is to prepare the way for an Islamic world  government… Iran's President Rouhani stood here last week, and shed crocodile  tears over what he called "the globalization of terrorism." Maybe he should  spare us those phony tears and have a word instead with the commanders of Iran's  Revolutionary Guards. He could ask them to call off Iran's global terror  campaign, which has included attacks in two dozen countries on five continents  since 2011 alone. To say that Iran doesn't practice terrorism is like saying  Derek Jeter never played shortstop for the New York Yankees.This  bemoaning of the Iranian president of the spread of terrorism has got to be one  of history’s greatest displays of doubletalk.Now, Some still argue that  Iran's global terror campaign, its subversion of countries throughout the Middle  East and well beyond the Middle East, some argue that this is the work of the  extremists. They say things are changing. They point to last year's elections in  Iran. They claim that Iran’s smooth talking President and Foreign Minister,  they’ve changed not only the tone of Iran's foreign policy but also its  substance. They believe Rouhani and Zarif genuinely want to reconcile with the  West, that they’ve abandoned the global mission of the Islamic  Revolution.Really? So let's look at what Foreign Minister Zarif wrote in  his book just a few years ago: We have a fundamental problem with the West, and  especially with America. This is because we are heirs to a global mission, which  is tied to our raison d'etre… A global mission which is tied to our very reason  of being.And then Zarif asks a question, I think an interesting one. He  says: How come Malaysia [he’s referring to an overwhelmingly Muslim country] –  how come Malaysia doesn't have similar problems? And he answers: Because  Malaysia is not trying to change the international order.That's your  moderate. So don’t be fooled by Iran’s manipulative charm offensive. It’s  designed for one purpose, and for one purpose only: To lift the sanctions and  remove the obstacles to Iran's path to the bomb. The Islamic Republic is now  trying to bamboozle its way to an agreement that will remove the sanctions it  still faces, and leave it with the capacity of thousands of centrifuges to  enrich uranium. This would effectively cement Iran's place as a threshold  military nuclear power. In the future, at a time of its choosing, Iran, the  world’s most dangerous state in the world's most dangerous region, would obtain  the world’s most dangerous weapons.Allowing that to happen would pose  the gravest threat to us all. It’s one thing to confront militant Islamists on  pick-up trucks, armed with Kalashnikov rifles. It’s another thing to confront  militant Islamists armed with weapons of mass destruction. I remember that last  year, everyone here was rightly concerned about the chemical weapons in Syria,  including the possibility that they would fall into the hands of terrorists.  That didn't happen. And President Obama deserves great credit for leading the  diplomatic effort to dismantle virtually all of Syria's chemical weapons  capability. Imagine how much more dangerous the Islamic State, ISIS, would be if  it possessed chemical weapons. Now imagine how much more dangerous the Islamic  state of Iran would be if it possessed nuclear weapons. Ladies and Gentlemen,  Would you let ISIS enrich uranium? Would you let ISIS build a heavy water  reactor? Would you let ISIS develop intercontinental ballistic missiles? Of  course you wouldn’t. Then you mustn't let the Islamic State of Iran do those  things either.Because here’s what will happen: Once Iran produces atomic  bombs, all the charm and all the smiles will suddenly disappear. They’ll just  vanish. It's then that the ayatollahs will show their true face and unleash  their aggressive fanaticism on the entire world. There is only one responsible  course of action to address this threat: Iran's nuclear military capabilities  must be fully dismantled. Make no mistake – ISIS must be defeated. But to defeat  ISIS and leave Iran as a threshold nuclear power is to win the battle and lose  the war.To defeat ISIS and leave Iran as a threshold nuclear power is to  win the battle and lose the war.Ladies and Gentlemen, The fight against  militant Islam is indivisible. When militant Islam succeeds anywhere, it’s  emboldened everywhere. When it suffers a blow in one place, it's set back in  every place. That’s why Israel’s fight against Hamas is not just our fight. It’s  your fight. Israel is fighting a fanaticism today that your countries may be  forced to fight tomorrow.For 50 days this past summer, Hamas fired  thousands of rockets at Israel, many of them supplied by Iran. I want you to  think about what your countries would do if thousands of rockets were fired at  your cities. Imagine millions of your citizens having seconds at most to  scramble to bomb shelters, day after day. You wouldn't let terrorists fire  rockets at your cities with impunity. Nor would you let terrorists dig dozens of  terror tunnels under your borders to infiltrate your towns in order to murder  and kidnap your citizens. Israel justly defended itself against both rocket  attacks and terror tunnels. Yet Israel also faced another challenge. We faced a  propaganda war. Because, in an attempt to win the world’s sympathy, Hamas  cynically used Palestinian civilians as human shields. It used schools, not just  schools - UN schools, private homes, mosques, even hospitals to store and fire  rockets at Israel.As Israel surgically struck at the rocket launchers  and at the tunnels, Palestinian civilians were tragically but unintentionally  killed. There are heartrending images that resulted, and these fueled libelous  charges that Israel was deliberately targeting civilians.We were not. We  deeply regret every single civilian casualty. And the truth is this: Israel was  doing everything to minimize Palestinian civilian casualties. Hamas was doing  everything to maximize Israeli civilian casualties and Palestinian civilian  casualties. Israel dropped flyers, made phone calls, sent text messages,  broadcast warnings in Arabic on Palestinian television, always to enable  Palestinian civilians to evacuate targeted areas.No other country and no  other army in history have gone to greater lengths to avoid casualties among the  civilian population of their enemies. This concern for Palestinian life was all  the more remarkable, given that Israeli civilians were being bombarded by  rockets day after day, night after night. As their families were being rocketed  by Hamas, Israel's citizen army – the brave soldiers of the IDF, our young boys  and girls – they upheld the highest moral values of any army in the world.  Israel's soldiers deserve not condemnation, but admiration. Admiration from  decent people everywhere.Now here’s what Hamas did: Hamas embedded its  missile batteries in residential areas and told Palestinians to ignore Israel’s  warnings to leave. And just in case people didn’t get the message, they executed  Palestinian civilians in Gaza who dared to protest.No less  reprehensible, Hamas deliberately placed its rockets where Palestinian children  live and play. Let me show you a photograph. It was taken by a France 24 crew  during the recent conflict. It shows two Hamas rocket launchers, which were used  to attack us. You see three children playing next to them. Hamas deliberately  put its rockets in hundreds of residential areas like this. Hundreds of  them.Ladies and gentlemen, this is a war crime. And I say to President  Abbas, these are the war crimes committed by your Hamas partners in the national  unity government which you head and you are responsible for. And these are the  real war crimes you should have investigated, or spoken out against from this  podium last week.Ladies and Gentlemen, As Israeli children huddled in  bomb shelters and Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system knocked Hamas  rockets out of the sky, the profound moral difference between Israel and Hamas  couldn’t have been clearer: Israel was using its missiles to protect its  children. Hamas was using its children to protect its missiles.By  investigating Israel rather than Hamas for war crimes, the UN Human Rights  Council has betrayed its noble mission to protect the innocent. In fact, what  it’s doing is to turn the laws of war upside-down. Israel, which took  unprecedented steps to minimize civilian casualties, Israel is condemned. Hamas,  which both targeted and hid behind civilians – that a double war crime - Hamas  is given a pass.The Human Rights Council is thus sending a clear message  to terrorists everywhere: Use civilians as human shields. Use them again and  again and again. You know why? Because sadly, it works.By granting  international legitimacy to the use of human shields, the UN’s Human Rights  Council has thus become a Terrorist Rights Council, and it will have  repercussions. It probably already has, about the use of civilians as human  shields.It’s not just our interest. It’s not just our values that are  under attack. It’s your interests and your values.Ladies and Gentlemen,  We live in a world steeped in tyranny and terror, where gays are hanged from  cranes in Tehran, political prisoners are executed in Gaza, young girls are  abducted en masse in Nigeria and hundreds of thousands are butchered in Syria,  Libya and Iraq. Yet nearly half, nearly half of the UN Human Rights Council's  resolutions focusing on a single country have been directed against Israel, the  one true democracy in the Middle East – Israel. where issues are openly debated  in a boisterous parliament, where human rights are protected by independent  courts and where women, gays and minorities live in a genuinely free  society.The Human Rights… (that’s an oxymoron, the UN Human Rights  Council, but I’ll use it just the same), the Council’s biased treatment of  Israel is only one manifestation of the return of the world’s oldest prejudices.  We hear mobs today in Europe call for the gassing of Jews. We hear some national  leaders compare Israel to the Nazis. This is not a function of Israel’s  policies. It's a function of diseased minds. And that disease has a name. It’s  called anti-Semitism.It is now spreading in polite society, where it  masquerades as legitimate criticism of Israel. For centuries the Jewish people  have been demonized with blood libels and charges of deicide. Today, the Jewish  state is demonized with the apartheid libel and charges of genocide. Genocide?  In what moral universe does genocide include warning the enemy's civilian  population to get out of harm's way? Or ensuring that they receive tons, tons of  humanitarian aid each day, even as thousands of rockets are being fired at us?  Or setting up a field hospital to aid for their wounded? Well, I suppose it's  the same moral universe where a man who wrote a dissertation of lies about the  Holocaust, and who insists on a Palestine free of Jews, Judenrein, can stand at  this podium and shamelessly accuse Israel of genocide and ethnic  cleansing.In the past, outrageous lies against the Jews were the  precursors to the wholesale slaughter of our people.But no  more.Today we, the Jewish people, have the power to defend ourselves. We  will defend ourselves against our enemies on the battlefield. We will expose  their lies against us in the court of public opinion. Israel will continue to  stand proud and unbowed.Ladies and Gentlemen, Despite the enormous  challenges facing Israel, I believe we have an historic  opportunity.After decades of seeing Israel as their enemy, leading  states in the Arab world increasingly recognize that together we and they face  many of the same dangers: principally this means a nuclear-armed Iran and  militant Islamist movements gaining ground in the Sunni world.Our  challenge is to transform these common interests to create a productive  partnership. One that would build a more secure, peaceful and prosperous Middle  East.Together we can strengthen regional security. We can advance  projects in water, agriculture, in transportation, in health, in energy, in so  many fields.I believe the partnership between us can also help  facilitate peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Many have long assumed  that an Israeli-Palestinian peace can help facilitate a broader rapprochement  between Israel and the Arab World. But these days I think it may work the other  way around: Namely that a broader rapprochement between Israel and the Arab  world may help facilitate an Israeli-Palestinian peace.And therefore, to  achieve that peace, we must look not only to Jerusalem and Ramallah, but also to  Cairo, to Amman, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh and elsewhere. I believe peace can be  realized with the active involvement of Arab countries, those that are willing  to provide political, material and other indispensable support. I’m ready to  make a historic compromise, not because Israel is occupying a foreign land. The  people of Israel are not occupiers in the Land of Israel. History, archeology  and common sense all make clear that we have had a singular attachment to this  land for over 3,000 years.I want peace because I want to create a better  future for my people. But it must be a genuine peace, one that is anchored in  mutual recognition and enduring security arrangements, rock solid security  arrangements on the ground. Because you see, Israel's withdrawals from Lebanon  and Gaza created two militant Islamic enclaves on our borders from which tens of  thousands of rockets have been fired at Israel.These sobering  experiences heighten Israel's security concerns regarding potential territorial  concessions in the future. Those security concerns are even greater today. Just  look around you.The Middle East is in chaos. States are disintegrating.  Militant Islamists are filling the void.Israel cannot have territories  from which it withdraws taken over by Islamic militants yet again, as happened  in Gaza and Lebanon. That would place the likes of ISIS within mortar range – a  few miles – of 80% of our population.Think about that. The distance  between the 1967 lines and the suburbs of Tel Aviv is like the distance between  the UN building here and Times Square. Israel’s a tiny country. That’s why in  any peace agreement, which will obviously necessitate a territorial compromise,  I will always insist that Israel be able to defend itself by itself against any  threat. Yet despite all that has happened, some still don't take Israel’s  security concerns seriously. But I do, and I always will. Because, as Prime  Minister of Israel, I am entrusted with the awesome responsibility of ensuring  the future of the Jewish people and the future of the Jewish state.And  no matter what pressure is brought to bear, I will never waver in fulfilling  that responsibility.I believe that with a fresh approach from our  neighbors, we can advance peace despite the difficulties we face.In  Israel, we have a record of making the impossible possible. We’ve made a  desolate land flourish. And with very few natural resources, we have used the  fertile minds of our people to turn Israel into a global center of technology  and innovation.Peace, of course, would enable Israel to realize its full  potential and to bring a promising future not only for our people, not only for  the Palestinian people, but for many, many others in our region.But the  old template for peace must be updated. It must take into account new realities  and new roles and responsibilities for our Arab neighbors. Ladies and Gentlemen,  There is a new Middle East. It presents new dangers, but also new opportunities.  Israel is prepared to work with Arab partners and the international community to  confront those dangers and to seize those opportunities. Together we must  recognize the global threat of militant Islam, the primacy of dismantling Iran’s  nuclear weapons capability and the indispensable role of Arab states in  advancing peace with the Palestinians.All this may fly in the face of  conventional wisdom, but it’s the truth. And the truth must always be spoken,  especially here, in the United Nations.Isaiah, our great prophet of  peace, taught us nearly 3,000 years ago in Jerusalem to speak truth to power.  לְמַעַן צִיּוֹן לֹא אֶחֱשֶׁה וּלְמַעַן יְרוּשָׁלִַם לֹא אֶשְׁקוֹט עַד-יֵצֵא  כַּנֹּגַהּ צִדְקָהּ וִישׁוּעָתָהּ כְּלַפִּיד יִבְעָר.For the sake of  Zion, I will not be silent.For the sake of Jerusalem, I will not be  still.Until her justice shines bright, And her salvation glows like a  flaming torch.Ladies and Gentlemen, Let's light a torch of truth and  justice to safeguard our common future.
Thank you.

<title>Grapevine: The spice of life in Israel</title>
<date>30/12/2014</date>
<content>
No one can say there is no variety in the life of a president.This past  Tuesday morning, President Reuven Rivlin attended a conference on incorporating  haredim into the workforce, and immediately afterward returned to his residence  to address Christian spiritual and lay leaders. The common denominator was  indeed religion – but beliefs and practices were wide apart. At the Christian  reception, guests were charmed by singer Mary Manasa, and those in the front  rows formed a spontaneous choir and sang Christmas carols with her.




■  WHOEVER IS looking for Jewish Agency chairman Natan Sharansky this week won’t  find him in Jerusalem. Sharansky is in Warwick in the UK, where he is  participating in the Limmud conference with Palestinian rights activist Bassem  Eid and veteran South African journalist Benjamin Pogrund, who was deeply  involved in the anti-apartheid campaign and a friend of Nelson  Mandela.On Tuesday, the trio participated in a panel discussion on  whether democracy and peace can go hand in hand. Later that day, Sharansky was  joined by fellow former Prisoner of Zion Yosef Mendelevich in paying tribute to  the memory of British Soviet Jewry activist Michael Sherbourne, who coined the  term “refusenik.” Sherbourne, who died this past June at the age of 97, was a  London-based teacher of Russian language and an ardent human rights activist. In  a pre-social media era, he was an important channel of communication between  Soviet Jewry and the free world.This morning, Sharansky is scheduled to  deliver a lecture on the topic, “Can Israel be Europe’s future?” ■ THE ONLY  thing sadder than an orphan is a parent who has to bury a child. Aside from  children who lost a mother or father in a terrorist attack, there were three  orphans who lost both parents among the 50 youngsters who this week came  together in Jerusalem for their bar and bat mitzva celebrations, which  culminated with a ceremony at the President’s Residence.There were also  children who had lost siblings, and children who had themselves been injured in  terrorist attacks. Among the adults, who comprised both parents and volunteers  who work with and for the Organization of Israel’s Terror Victims, were people  wearing leg braces or walking with the aid of crutches.Terror makes no  distinction between adults, children, nationalities, ethnic origins or religious  beliefs; it strikes indiscriminately.We all know this and when we read  of a terrorist attack in a newspaper or see video footage of one on TV, we may  shudder, but then we go on to the next thing. It’s not that easy in a room full  of people who in one way or another, have been victims of terrorism; and whose  scars, whether physical or mental, will in many instances never fade.Of  the three complete orphans, one was Yigal Faizkov – whose parents, Oleg and  Ludmila, were killed in the terrorist attack on the Hilton in Taba in October  2004.Yigal’s grandparents are raising him and his older brother, the  19-year-old Daniel.Another was Michelle Levine – whose parents, Eitan  and Rima, were killed in a shooting attack near the Shoket intersection in  February 2004. Michelle was their only daughter, and was adopted by her  aunt.And then there was Nadav Wollensky – whose parents, Abraham-Isaac  (Avi) and Avital Yocheved, were killed in a shooting attack on the  Ramallah-Nablus road in August 2002. Nadav has an older brother, the 15-year-old  Yigal, who was also injured in the attack.Popular singer Moshe Peretz  was so moved by Orel Mamistalov, who told of having lost her father, Yosef, to a  suicide bomber when she was only 18-monthsold, that instead of singing what he  had originally intended with a playback, he sang unaccompanied – a song he had  specially composed about a mother’s love for her son. He later sang another song  with playback, accompanied by one of the youth, Mor Kakun – who was loudly  applauded by the audience not only because she was one of their own, but because  she has a marvelous voice and in all probability, a great musical  future.■ YEARS OF foot-dragging in the peace process have not impacted  negatively on the eternal optimism of Israel’s ninth president Shimon Peres, who  continues to believe that peace between Israel and the Arab world is possible  and will one day be achieved. When asked about his optimism, Peres often says  that the final destiny of both an optimist and a pessimist is the same, so why  should he bother being a pessimist if he can get more pleasure from life by  being an optimist? Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid apparently shares Peres’s spirit  of optimism, though not necessarily where peace is concerned.When  welcoming Eshkol Regional Council head Haim Yellin to his Knesset list, Lapid  said at the tail end of the greeting: “Immediately after the elections, we’ll  continue where we left off – at full speed.Everything is ready;  everything is on the table. We’ll restart it all.” That kind of confidence  spells optimism with a capital O.Any organization or institution that  holds a function at the Peres Center for Peace can also join the optimists  club.Chances are high that if event is taking place at the center, Peres  can be persuaded to give the opening address. That’s what happened this week at  the police innovation conference, at which Peres and outgoing Israel Police  chief Insp.-Gen. Yohanan Danino were the keynote speakers.Danino first  took Peres on a tour of an exhibit highlighting the latest technologies used in  detecting and preventing other crimes. Peres could not resist trying parts of it  out – there’s a small boy in every grown man.Peres opened the conference  by expressing full confidence in the police force, and said the breadth and  sophistication of corruption had surprised everyone and could prove to be a  source of despair for Israel’s citizens. Nonetheless, he urged police to  continue with the battle. “You stand on the front lines of justice as the  defenders of democracy,” he said. “Continue to stand at the gates and fight  corruption, because that is the true test of not giving favor to  anyone.”Danino also referred to the safeguarding of democracy, but noted  that in addition, the police have the responsibility of protecting the safety of  every individual in Israel. Of particular concern, he said, is the safety of  Jerusalem’s residents. The Jerusalem police force has been boosted by 1,000  additional policemen and women, he noted, and at least 400 more are  needed.The situation continues to be explosive and sensitive, he  cautioned, and no one should misread what appears to be a relatively quiet  period.■ EL AL CEO David Maimon surprised judoka Gili Cohen, when he  presented her with her own personal Hanukka miracle in the company’s “Nes  Hanukka” campaign. El Al asked relatives of people scheduled to fly abroad on  the airline during the holiday to write in and say why such passengers were  entitled to a miracle.Cohen’s mother wrote: “Gili is a 23-yearold judoka  who has been practicing the sport since she was four years old. She has been an  Israeli champion for three consecutive years, and is ranked No. 7 in the world;  she won a bronze medal in the most recent European championships.“Gili  is a modest athlete, but determined, clever and talented. She is working hard in  order to get to the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016, and it looks as if she  might make it. She trains diligently, and is currently completing a round of  competitions, after which she will return to Israel; three days later, she will  fly to New York to meet her brother Eyal, who is a college student there. They  haven’t seen each other since August, and as her mother, I would also be happy  for a Hanukka miracle.“I’m waiting for her to return from a month of  training so that the two of us can fly to New York. We’re both on the same  flight, but she’s more important.”The letter was one of thousands  received, but Maimon was particularly moved and came to personally meet mother  and daughter in the King David Lounge at Ben-Gurion Airport, where he presented  the Cohens with their miracle – which included round-trip flight, shopping  vouchers, hotel accommodation, spa treatments and more. They were one of eight  lucky winners.■ IT’S HARD to tell at the moment how the Deri drama will  play out in the end.There are Arye Deri’s detractors, who believe his  resignation was a publicity stunt and he will play hard to get for a few days,  before reluctantly accepting the vote of confidence of the Shas Rabbinical  Council. But people close to Deri say he was genuinely hurt by the recently  released video, and that he really does not want to drag the memory of party  spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef into the mud.One doesn’t have to be  a handwriting expert to note Deri’s mood changes in his letter of resignation –  in which he was originally upbeat in his resolve, but became increasingly  despondent as the letter continued. His handwriting also shows him to be  generous and far less egotistical than many people think.What political  pundits seem to have forgotten is that at the start of his political career,  Deri was like a favored son in the Yosef household. There was genuine affection  between him and Ovadia Yosef, who stood by him during his trial. Even if Deri  was aware there were recordings in which he was being criticized by the great  rabbi, to actually hear that criticism in the voice of his mentor must have been  like a wound in his heart.The question is: What will happen to Shas if  Deri doesn’t accede to the wishes of the rabbis? And if he doesn’t, what will  happen to the newly founded Shas status of women advisory council – headed by  Deri’s wife, Yaffa; and Ovadia Yosef’s daughter, Israel Prize laureate Adina  Bar-Shalom, who has moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and even sacrificed her  intention to run for Knesset in order to demonstrate loyalty to Shas? Following  the announcement of a women’s advisory team, Bar-Shalom decided that if she was  going to be active in Shas, she may as well live in Jerusalem. Contrary to  expectations, she did not move to Har Nof’s Hakablan Street, where her late  father had lived and the Deri family resides. Instead, she has taken up  residence in Beit Hakerem, which in some parts is likewise a haredi  neighborhood.She is married to Rabbi Ezra Bar-Shalom, a former rabbinic  judge in Tel Aviv.Having set up a college for haredi girls in Jerusalem,  Bar-Shalom was for many years on a frequent commute between Jerusalem and Tel  Aviv, and was able to move to the capital only after her husband reached  retirement age.Even if Deri does take up the Shas leadership again, it  will be interesting to see whether the Bar-Shalom/Deri alliance will continue  after the Knesset elections. Both Deri’s people and those of Eli Yishai are  trading insults and accusations that are bound to negatively impact both Shas  and Yishai’s new party, Yachad Ha’am Itanu.While their leaders are doing  what they can to prevent a civil war among loyal Shas followers and those who  have followed Yishai away from Shas, it is difficult to imagine the Shas women’s  council will remain intact if the party fails to pass the voting threshold, or  if it ends up with only one or two Knesset seats.Then again, Yishai  being the key suspect in the release of the aforementioned recording of Ovadia  Yosef may work in Deri’s favor, with a huge Shas turnout on Election Day –  especially in view of the latest developments.But no one should try to  preempt what may happen. There are so many changes on the political horizon  every day that only a fool would try to forecast what Israelis will wake up to  on March 18.■ FORMER LEGISLATOR Einat Wilf, who last week was the guest  speaker at a British- style afternoon tea hosted by the Israel, Britain and the  Commonwealth Association at the Sharon Hotel Herzliya, voiced regret that in the  war of words, the Jewish state has not yet been able to emulate the victories  achieved in armed conflict.The event was the last in the three-year  tenure of chairman Alan Webber. As of January 1, the new chairman is eminent  physician Prof. Alex Deutsch, whose wife, Gloria, is a regular contributor to  the weekend edition of The Jerusalem Post.Meanwhile, Webber remains on  the IBCA board and is in charge of the November 2017 centenary celebration of  the Balfour Declaration.Wilf’s audience was charmed both by her and her  adorable four-year-old son, Yonatan, who is used to sitting quietly through his  mother’s lectures. Even people on the Right of the political spectrum could not  help but admire the Jerusalem- born-and-raised Wilf’s eloquence, her ability to  speak unhesitatingly in English for the better part of an hour without notes or  teleprompter, and her direct responses to questions. Several audience members  declared her to be a great loss to Israeli politics, and said that even if she  isn’t running for the Knesset this time around, they hope she will run in the  next election.■ WHILE MORE than one male MK has fathered 12 children,  the highest number of children brought into the world by a female MK were those  of Anastasia Michaeli, a former fashion model and TV personality who was the  first female MK to give birth while in office. She gave birth to her eighth  child during her Knesset tenure.Two of the women currently running for  Knesset are also mothers of large broods, but unlikely to have more children –  though one never knows until there’s a slight bulge in the abdominal region. The  two, who are running for election on the Bayit Yehudi list, are Sara Eliash, a  mother of 10 and grandmother of more than 30; and Yehudit Sheilat, 59, a mother  of nine.Both women are highly educated professionals and community  activists, in addition to running their large households.Another  religiously observant woman who is joining the race is Jerusalem Deputy Mayor  Rachel Azaria, who is joining Moshe Kahlon’s Koolanu party. Azaria is somewhat  younger than Eliash and Sheilat, and her brood is therefore not yet as large,  but she still has several child-bearing years ahead of her.It will not  be Azaria’s first experience working with a member of the Kahlon family. Moshe  Kahlon’s brother Kobi, who is a senior deputy mayor of Jerusalem, has taken a  leave of absence to help out with his brother’s election campaign – so Azaria  will be dealing with two Kahlons over the coming three months.■ YOU KNOW  it’s election time when strident Likud MK Miri Regev visits south Tel Aviv and  crouches down in front of the camera for warm, eye-level contact with an African  child – who is presumably the offspring of one of African migrants who have  sought refuge in Israel, and whose presence Regev so vociferously opposes when  she’s in the Knesset.■ FELLOW LIKUDNIK, Culture and Sport Minister Limor  Livnat – who is bowing out of politics, along with several other ministers and  MKs – had one of her final moments of glory this week at the Israel Olympic  Committee Awards, in which achievements were recognized and scholarships  distributed. American-Israeli sprinter Donald Sanford, who was named Sportsman  of the Year alongside judoka Yarden Gerbi, who was named the Sportswoman of the  Year, could not contain his emotions, and his choked-up reaction was  contagious.■ YET ANOTHER Likudnik, Silvan Shalom – the minister for  infrastructure, energy and water; regional cooperation; and Negev and Galilee  development– has been honored by the settlement movement in Judea and Samaria  for all the support he has given in his various ministerial roles, and for his  willingness to lend an attentive ear to settlement representatives. Signatories  to the honor were the following council heads: Yossi Abrahami, Givat Ze’ev;  David Elhiani, Jordan Valley; Yigal Lahav, Karnei Shomron; Yochai Damari, Hebron  Hills; Yaakov Guterman, Modi’in Ilit; Ezra Garshi, Emanuel; Mordechai Dahman,  Megilot; Hananel Dorani, Kedumim; Asaf Mintzer, Elkana; Chen Filipovitz, Har  Adar; Benny Kashriel, Ma’aleh Adumim; Malachi Levinger, Kiryat Arba; Shlomo  Lalush, Ma’aleh Ephraim; Shlomi Langer, Oranit; Gershon Messika, Samaria; Eli  Shviro, Ariel; Avi Naim, Beit Aryeh; Davidi Pearl, Gush Etzion; Shlomo Katan,  Alfei Menashe; Oded Revivi, Efrat; Avi Roeh, Mateh Binyamin; Meir Rubinstein,  Betar Illit; and Shai Elon, Beit El. Also included were former chairman of the  Council of Jewish Communities in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip Pinchas  Wallerstein; and Ze’ev Haber and Moshe Yogev, secretary- general and treasurer  respectively of Amana.■ EVERYONE LIKES some share in glory.Thus,  when Israel Radio’s political reporter Yoav Krakovsky announced that Walla  Editor-in-Chief Yinon Magal had joined Naftali Bennett’s Bayit Yehudi, Krakovsky  could not help but note that he and Magal, together with Yair Weintraub and  Benny Teitelbaum, had been together in a training course provided by the Israel  Broadcasting Authority; and that Magal was a former presenter of Mabat News on  Channel 1.■ IN ALMOST every election, there are those who question the  source of funding for various election campaigns. Labor MK Miki Rosenthal  decided to run a modest NIS 40,000 campaign, which he is paying for out of his  own pocket; he’s not soliciting donations because he is wary of who might decide  to give him money. He believes an amendment should be introduced to the election  law so that it is mandatory for every candidate to indicate his or her  relationship to campaign donors.■ ONE OF the last of the Likud princes  to enter the political arena, Naftaly Naor is the son of former cabinet  secretary Arye Naor and of Supreme Court Justice Miriam Naor, who will very  shortly become the second female president of the Supreme Court, with the  upcoming retirement of present incumbent Asher D.Grunis. Naor, who is  hoping to become a Likud MK, is the grandson of Esther Raziel Naor, who was an  active member of the Irgun, and twice arrested by the British Mandate  authorities. Following the establishment of the state, she was elected to the  first Knesset and served in seven Knessets altogether, for a total of 25  years.Interviewed on Channel 1, Naor said that while he was very proud  of his parents, he did not perceive himself as a prince. Those days are passé,  he said; today, an MK must go out in the field and get to know the people they  represent.■ SOMETIMES CUPID is standing right beside us, and we don’t  even see him until after his arrow has hit the mark. Jerusalem Post Managing  Editor David Brinn did not set out to be a matchmaker when he asked nighttime  graphic artist Eitan Lessing if he would be willing to temporarily move over to  design the paper’s weekly French edition during a colleague’s maternity leave.  When Lessing moved downstairs, Cupid moved with him.At that time the  managing editor of the French edition was Sarah Lalou, and she and Lessing got  to know each other well – “real well,” in Brinn’s words – so much so that they  turned the temporary arrangement into a permanent relationship. This was sealed  by a rabbi at the beginning of the week, when the couple celebrated their  wedding at Kibbutz Ramat Rahel on the outskirts of Jerusalem.During the  three months ensconced in the cozy offices of the French department, Lessing  managed to learn enough French to propose, and Lalou said, “Oui.”■  NOVELIST AND translator Michelle Mazel, who is a member of Israel’s community of  retired diplomats and their spouses, was talking to someone about Georgia. The  conversation was in Hebrew and the other woman kept referring to Gruzia, which  was what Georgia used to be called in Hebrew. That is, until a particular  Georgian ambassador objected and said the name of his country was Georgia, and  he wanted it to be known as such in Hebrew, just as it is in other  languages.Some people do not adapt quickly to change and Mazel’s  interlocutor was one of them. Mazel kept correcting her during the conversation,  but to no avail. The other woman simply could not understand that Gruzia and  Georgia are one and the same, with the difference that the word Gruzia is now  taboo.
After their conversation, Mazel bumped into another woman, who  Mazel was under the impression would appreciate the story, and she told her  about the first woman’s ignorance. To this, the second woman replied: “How  stupid. Everyone knows that Georgia is in the United States!”

<title>Left-wing screams apartheid over new security edict for Palestinian laborers</title>
<date>26/10/2014</date>
<content>
Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon’s new security edict could soon prevent Palestinian laborers, who cross the security barrier to work in Israeli communities, from returning home aboard the country’s public bus lines.The security program, which has yet to be put in place, would require the laborers to head home at night through the same IDF checkpoints from which they entered, security sources told The Jerusalem Post Sunday morning.




Technically speaking, Palestinians can continue to use Israeli buses on either side of the barrier, but the edict makes this very cumbersome.There is no start date for the security edict, which is likely to begin with a pilot program at the Eyal crossing in Samaria, security sources said.As work to construct the West Bank security barrier advances, the IDF’s Central Command is examining ways of supervising the transit of Palestinians and has drawn up proposals that entail them Palestinians leaving and returning through the same crossings, the source explained.Israeli left-wing politicians and activists immediately attacked the decision, calling it tantamount to apartheid because it prevented Palestinians from using Israeli public transportation lines.“This is an official governmental stamp on a policy of apartheid in the territories.Separating Jews and Palestinians only deepens Israel’s status as a pariah state,” Meretz party head Zehava Gal-On said in a prepared statement.“Not only has Defense Minister Ya’alon destroyed our relationship with the US, he is destroying our relationship with the entire world,” she charged.Gal-On was referring to Ya’alon’s trip to Washington last week in which he was denied high-level meetings with US officials as payback for once having referred to US Secretary of State John Kerry as “messianic” and “obsessive” in his drive to restart peace talks.Settlers, especially the Samaria Regional Council and the Samaria Citizens Committee, have long lobbied to keep West Bank Palestinians off Israeli buses, claiming they pose a danger to passengers. As such, they hailed the new edit as a victory.But a security source clarified that it had nothing to do with public buses.“This does not touch upon public transport,” the source said.The source stressed that the matter was “security-based” and that the goal was to “supervise the entrance into and exit out of Israeli territory, thereby decreasing the chance of terrorist attacks inside Israel.”Another security source said the decision had been taken “solely due to security considerations and would not prevent Palestinians from going out to work or making a living.”“No one is preventing Palestinians from continuing to work in Israeli territory and heading to where they wish,” the source explained. “On the contrary.”The source explained that “Palestinians authorized to enter Israel will do so through a single passage in order to prevent a situation in which Palestinians stay in Israel illegally instead of returning to their homes,” something that could increase the chances for terrorist attacks.“This is a mechanism that is supposed to minimize the presence of Palestinians in Israel illegally yet allow Palestinian workers to continue to work inside of Israeli territory,” she source continued. “It is something that every sovereign country does to defend itself.”But Sarit Michaeli of the rights group B’Tselem told The Jerusalem Post West Bank Palestinians who arrive in Israeli cities and towns to work must pass a rigorous security check before receiving a permit, so it is hard to imagine that they pose a threat.
“I think that it is very disingenuous to speak about it as a security issue,” Michaeli said.

<title>Livni and Lapid appeal ministerial approval of bill applying Israeli law to settlers</title>
<date>9/11/2014</date>
<content>
Two ministers on Sunday blocked legislation they believe is tantamount to a de  facto annexation of West Bank settlements, a move the international community  vehemently opposes.The bill passed the Ministerial Legislation Committee  on Sunday with a 6-4 vote. It was designed to provide a legal loophole that  would offer residents of Judea and Samaria the same rights citizens in the rest  of the country have, without actually annexing that territory.




Area C of  the West Bank, where 350,000 settlers live, is under Israeli military and  civilian rule, but Israeli law is not fully applied there. The legal definition  of annexation is the full application of Israeli law, such as was done decades  ago in Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.The new legislation maintains the  status of the West Bank as an area of the country under military rule, but it  mandates that every law passed in the Knesset must have a complimentary military  one within 45 days, based on orders from the OC Central Command.Finance  Minister Yair Lapid (Yesh Atid) and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni (Hatnua)  immediately appealed the vote, which places the issue on Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu’s desk.The legislation can only move forward if Netanyahu  brings it to the cabinet for a vote. Should it pass the cabinet it would go to  the Knesset, where it would have to undergo three readings, as well as a review  by a legislative committee.Netanyahu, like his predecessors, has opposed  all attempts to annex Area C of the West Bank, but he has supported initiatives  to enable residents of that area to enjoy the full benefits of the country’s  law.The prime minister has yet to issue a statement on the matter. At  issue for him, is the question of whether this legislation is in fact a de facto  form of annexation.Lapid said on Sunday he believes it is.“We’re  talking about directly applying Israeli law to the territories, by directly  applying the power of the Knesset to the area, against the discretion of the  military commander, which effectively drains him of his authority,” Lapid said.  “Providing residents of Judea and Samaria with equitable treatment under the law  is a worthy endeavor.”But it’s clear, he added, that the goal of this  legislation is “ annexation.”Should this bill be passed, Lapid said, it  is possible that a referendum would be needed for any territorial concessions in  Judea and Samaria that are included in any future peace deal with the  Palestinians.“There will be serious diplomatic consequences,  particularly in this sensitive period,” he said.But MK Orit Struck  (Bayit Yehudi), who along with MK Yariv Levin (Likud) proposed the bill on  behalf of the Knesset lobby group the Land of Israel, dismissed  Lapid.Although Struck said it was no secret that she supported the  annexation of Area C, as does her party, headed by Economic Affairs Minister  Naftali Bennett, the intent of this bill is to provide solutions to the  residents of Judea and Samaria without annexation.Former Foreign  Ministry legal advisers Alan Baker and Robbie Sabel told The Jerusalem Post that  military orders, even those that complemented existing Israeli laws, were not  tantamount to annexation.But Sabel, who is now a professor of  international law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, warned that there are  other possibly problematic aspects of the law. The fact that it places the  military commander under the authority of the Knesset when it came to issuing  laws, could in fact, mean that the bill was a de facto form of annexation, he  said.Struck dismissed this argument, however, noting that the IDF did  not act independently of the government in the territories – it follows  government dictates now and making it responsive to the Knesset won’t change the  status of the territories, she said.The bill’s explanatory portion  states that “the law in Judea and Samaria today relies on Ottoman, Jordanian,  British and Israeli laws, as well as many [military] orders... This system  creates legal confusion and intolerable differentiation between the rights and  duties of Israeli citizens who live in different parts of the  land.”Construction Minister Uri Ariel (Bayit Yehudi) criticized the  ministers who opposed the bill, saying in the ministerial committee meeting:  “Sometimes it seems as if settlers are fine for paying taxes, fighting and dying  for the country, but not for living.“There is clear discrimination here  against residents of the State of Israel.Stop evading the issue. You  know how to ask [for settlers to] do their duties but when it comes to giving  them citizens’ privileges, you have all the arguments against it. This is an  embarrassment to the concept of a Jewish and democratic state. Shame on you,”  Ariel said.Following the vote, Struck and Levin said the ministerial  committee made an important decision to prevent discrimination.“We hope  that the government will unite behind the bill and expect that even ministers  who do not support settlements but do support civil rights will recognize  settlers’ civil rights and allow us to continue pushing this bill forward as  quickly as possible,” they said.Knesset Law, Constitution and Justice  Committee chairman David Rotem (Yisrael Beytenu), who co-sponsored the bill,  pointed out that hundreds of thousands of Israelis living in the West Bank vote  for the Knesset but that their lives are governed by OC Central  Command.“Important laws on matters like medical and rescue services,  handicap accessibility and the environment do not apply to these areas,” he  explained. “The purpose of the law is to allow normalcy in Judea and Samaria and  is a step toward creating equality in the lives of all Israeli citizens  throughout the land.”Meretz leader Zehava Gal-On said the bill will give  the Knesset the authority of the military commander of the West Bank, which  would violate the tenets of international law by which Israel behaves in the  area.“Whoever chose to live in a settlement knew that this is occupied  territory, and now he’s complaining and asking for a de facto annexation that  would only apply to settlers, which creates an apartheid policy and  discrimination between blood and blood,” Gal-On said.According to MK Dov  Henin (Hadash), the bill sends a message to Palestinians and the world that this  government is not a partner for peace and the ministers’ approval of it is  dangerous.Six ministers from Likud, Bayit Yehudi and Yisrael Beytenu  voted in favor of the legislation – Yair Shamir, Uri Orbach, Uri Ariel, Gilad  Erdan, Sofa Landver and Yuval Steinitz. Four from Hatnua and Yesh Atid Lapid –  Livni, Yaakov Peri and Yael German – voted against. Culture and Sport Minister  Limor Livnat (Likud) abstained and Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch  (Yisrael Beytenu) did not vote.There are 16 Israeli laws – personal laws  that cover issues such as taxations, army service, education and health benefits  – that apply to residents of Judea and Samaria, but there are a myriad of  non-personal laws, particularly relating to the environment and crime that are  not applicable and for which military orders have lagged behind.
The  military is in the process of updating its labor laws to match those already  existing in the country.

<title>New W. Bank bus lines to offer better service, security</title>
<date>5/11/2014</date>
<content>
Communities in the Mateh Binyamin and Samaria regional councils of the West Bank  will receive a slew of upgrades in their public transportation system come  November 14, the Transportation Ministry announced on Tuesday.Residents  of these areas will be encountering a reorganization of their bus lines, with  improved frequency and new armored routes leading to popular destinations,  through the Egged-Ta’avura bus company, a subsidiary of the Egged bus  cooperative and the Ta’avura Group.




Immediately following the June  kidnapping of Naftali Fraenkel, Gil-Ad Shaer and Eyal Yifrah from a hitchhiking  post in Gush Etzion, the ministry declared its intention to advance a plan for  enhancing bus reliability and frequency in Judea and Samaria. Along with Egged,  it began launching new lines in the region on July 1, arguing that hitchhiking  should be minimized.These initial improvements were the first in a  three-stage program launched in conjunction with local council heads.The  second stage will begin to run on November 14, when many Egged routes will be  transferred to Egged-Ta’avura company and receive significant service upgrades,  according to the ministry. The third stage is a long-term plan that requires the  purchase of 30 protected buses, Meir Chen, director of the ministry’s Public  Transportation Authority, said in a mid-July Knesset meeting on the  subject.During the July stage, Egged began operating a line from Neveh  Daniel to the Beit Shemesh train station, another line from Neveh Daniel to Kfar  Etzion, and a third from Jerusalem to Nokdim. In addition, it launched two night  lines that run from Ofra and Kfar Etzion to and from Jerusalem. An additional  line began running from Tel Aviv to and from Modi’in, passing through several  Samaria settlements en route.The changes and improvements being launched  in the current stage follow a study of the needs of passengers, ground  conditions and traffic and security restraints compiled by the Public  Transportation Authority in cooperation with the Mateh Binyamin and Shomron  regional councils, the ministry said. With the introduction of Egged-Ta’avura  into the region, a significant portion of the area’s buses will be replaced by  armored vehicles. The newer buses will also comply with the greener Euro 5  emission standards and have an internal public address system, the ministry  added.As part of the changes, there will be 18 new bus lines in the  region, including a direct line from Ariel to Jerusalem, an express bus from Tel  Zion to the entrance of Jerusalem, and express buses from both Nahliel and Dolev  to Modi’in, the ministry said. The frequency of lines running from Kedumim to  Jerusalem and those running from Modi’in to Jerusalem via the Binyamin  settlements will also be improved, it said. In addition, Binyamin lines that  formerly concluded their routes at Jerusalem’s central bus station will now  continue to the National Insurance Institute headquarters or to the Pisgat Ze’ev  neighborhood as their final destinations.The new bus routes, numbered  146, 149, 461, 462, 463, 466, 467 and 468, will be bulletproof and conclude  their routes at the light rail station in Pisgat Ze’ev in order to allow for  more journeys between the capital and these communities, the ministry said. From  Pisgat Ze’ev, passengers will be able to continue to either the light rail or  city buses at no additional charge using Rav-Kav magnetic cards.The  Transportation Ministry recommended, however, that for the time being these  passengers retain two Rav-Kavs – an “anonymous” card to be loaded with  multi-entry, integrated tickets for journeys between cities and continuing on  within Jerusalem, and a personal Rav- Kav for the remainder of the traveler’s  needs. The “anonymous” Rav-Kavs will be available at Egged-Ta’avura stands in  Eshkol and in the Pisgat Ze’ev Mall, the ministry said.To make residents  aware of all the changes, the Public Transportation Authority will be  distributing informative leaflets in mailboxes, at various public centers and in  local media publications, the ministry explained.Transportation Minister  Israel Katz stressed that the comprehensive upgrade would heighten the security  of settlers living in these regions, adding that the government had an  obligation to protect all youths and adults living in Judea and  Samaria.Chen, the Public Transportation Authority director, hoped that  after an initial adjustment period, satisfaction among users in Binyamin would  improve.“We will follow the activities of the lines and provide a  solution to any problem that might arise at the beginning,” Chen said. “At the  end of the launch period, assessments will be made and additional changes will  be implemented according to the level of need.”In response to the  Transportation Ministry’s announcement, area residents expressed both  satisfaction and hope that further improvements would be made.“We want  to thank the minister of transportation for the welcome change in modes of  transportation in Binyamin,” Mateh Binyamin Regional Council spokeswoman Tamar  Asraf told The Jerusalem Post. “It is definitely an important process that will  improve significantly the quality of life of Binyamin residents. We also hope  that in the near future there will be additional armored buses reduce the burden  of having to transfer from bus to bus.”The ministry’s announcement of  new lines and services came a week after security sources spoke of a potential  edict that could prevent Palestinian laborers from returning home to the West  Bank aboard public bus lines – arousing calls of apartheid from left-wing  politicians.The security program, which has yet to be put in place,  would require the laborers to head home at night through the same IDF  checkpoints they pass through in the morning to get to Israel proper, according  to the sources. Technically speaking, they would be able to continue using  Israeli buses on either side of the barrier, but the edict would make this a  challenging proposition.While there is no start date for the plan, it is  likely to begin with a pilot program at the Eyal crossing in Samaria, the  security sources said.

<title>Palestinians are winning propaganda war against Israel, former lawmaker says</title>
<date>28/12/2014</date>
<content>
Inasmuch as she is a political activist, former Labor and Independence MK Einat  Wilf is not vying for a seat in the next Knesset. She is not even sure which  party – if any – will get her vote.Speaking to members of the Israel,  Britain and the Commonwealth Association Thursday night at the Sharon Hotel in  Herzliya Pituah, Wilf said that, at the present time, with the proliferation of  political parties and the lack of clarity in their platforms, she feels  politically homeless.




That was not the key topic of her talk, however.  What she really wanted to get across was the inherent danger in the current  nonviolent conflict being waged by the Palestinians against Israel.When  they saw that armed conflict and terrorism didn’t work, Wilf said, they resorted  to the war of words – a battle that, so far, Israel is losing.“This is  all part of the Palestinian strategy of planting words, images, ideas and  arguments into people’s minds,” she said. “The world’s greatest atrocities were  preceded by preparing people’s minds that what they were about to commit was not  an atrocity but something they were doing for a noble cause,” she added, noting  that most people don’t think of themselves as evil.But what is happening  with the use of specific words, she said, is “a strategic threat. It’s a real  danger.”Wilf noted that, while in the Knesset, she had raised the matter  with the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, where she received a symbolic,  benign pat on the head – indulged to the extent that she was permitted to  present her thesis, but no one really took her warning seriously.The  more she travels abroad on speaking engagements in different countries, the more  she realizes how successful the Palestinians have been in their campaign, she  said.Wilf cited an example of a debate with a Palestinian spokesman in  London who had come up with the expression that Israel was committing cultural  genocide. There is no such thing and it doesn’t mean anything, said Wilf, but it  was a way of linking Israel with genocide and putting that concept into people’s  minds. The same thing happens when Palestinians and their supporters talk about  settlements, occupation, colonialism and apartheid, she said.Outlining  the methodology, Wilf said it starts with placard strategy equating Zionism and  Israel with racism, imperialism, apartheid and ethnic cleansing.“You  know what it says even though you don’t believe it,” she  said.Eventually, she continued, many people, even Israel’s best friends,  start to think that where there’s smoke there’s fire.In her travels, she  has found that people who are genuinely interested in peace in the Middle East,  including Jews who are not anti-Israel but are against the country’s policies,  fall victim to this strategy and utilize it. But the Palestinians and other  Arabs who are utilizing it have a different purpose.They want to get rid  of the State of Israel and they don’t want any Jews living in the land, which is  currently Israeli territory, “but no-one believes it,” she said, underscoring  the misconception in the popular belief that if Israel would only get rid of the  settlements and allow Palestinian refugees to return, there would be  peace.“It’s not what we do but who we are,” she said. “They hate  us.”Nonetheless, there are large numbers of Israelis who are willing to  make peace and share the land, but every time the Palestinians have had an  opportunity to create their own state, they have found a reason not to, she  added.
Moving on to unilateral recognition of Palestinian statehood, Wilf  pointed out that there is a lacuna in resolutions to this effect. If she was  writing the resolution, she would add the codicil that once a Palestinian state  is recognized it means the end of the Palestinian refugee situation, because  people who have a state are not refugees.

<title>PA: Netanyahu's pinning of Jerusalem terror attack on Abbas is 'a new low'</title>
<date>23/10/2014</date>
<content>
The Palestinian Authority on Thursday rejected Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu’s charges that PA President Mahmoud Abbas is responsible for recent  tensions between Israel and the Palestinians and supports Wednesday’s terrorist  attack and other violent incidents in the capital.The PA said that while  it “regrets the loss of all life,” it holds Netanyahu responsible for the latest  tensions in east Jerusalem and the West Bank.




Meanwhile, Abbas’s Fatah  faction published a poster depicting Abdel Rahman al-Shalodi, the Palestinian  behind Wednesday’s terrorist attack in Jerusalem, as a “hero and  martyr.”Fatah activists in Shalodi’s neighborhood of Silwan distributed  the poster, which hailed him for carrying out an attack on “settlers in occupied  Jerusalem.”Abbas’s spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudaineh, said in response to  Netanyahu’s charges that the “Israeli escalation and incitement and continued  occupation of Palestinian lands are the real reason for all the violence in  Palestine and the region.”Accusing Israel of inciting against Abbas, the  spokesman warned that this would create an “explosive climate in the Palestinian  and regional arenas.”Abu Rudaineh did not refer to the terrorist attack  in Jerusalem, in which threemonth- old Chaya Zissel Braun was killed and others  were injured.“The world now rejects the Israeli occupation and many  countries are recognizing the Palestinian state,” Abu Rudaineh said.Abu  Rudaineh also warned that the Palestinians would not remain silent vis-à-vis  Israel’s “dangerous policy and assaults.” He added, without elaborating: “We  have many options.”Israel was searching for excuses to avoid the peace  process, he claimed.“The Israeli incitement is an attempt to evade  [Israel’s] obligations toward international legitimacy,” he said. “Israel  has lost its temper because of the world’s recognition of the Palestinian  state.”Chief PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat also dismissed Netanyahu’s  allegations against Abbas, dubbing them “unfounded and  inflammatory.”Erekat said that Netanyahu has “no credibility to lose,  three weeks after he declared that the Obama administration was ‘against  American values’ and ‘anti-peace’ for condemning his government’s approval of  nearly 3,000 new settlement housing units in occupied east Jerusalem. But even  by his standards, Mr. Netanyahu’s statement represents a dangerous new  low.”Erekat accused Netanyahu and “his extremist government coalition”  of continuing to refuse the minimum requirements for peace, including acceptance  of the two-state solution.“Instead of pursuing peace, his government  systematically violates international law in order to consolidate its apartheid  regime in Palestine,” Erekat charged, referring to Netanyahu. “His stated plans  to turn Jerusalem into an exclusive Jewish city violate several UN Security  Council resolutions.”In an indirect reference to the Jerusalem attack,  Erekat said: “We regret all loss of life. At the same time we reiterate  that the Israeli occupation of Palestine remains the main source of violence and  instability in the region.”Hamas, for its part, praised the terrorist  attack, saying Shalodi was a member of the Islamist movement.
The “brave”  attack was a “natural and expected response to growing Israeli violations  against Palestinians and their holy sites,” Hamas said.

<title>US administration to unveil peace talks proposal</title>
<date>1/11/2014</date>
<content>
The US administration is planning to present a proposal to resume the peace  talks between Israel and the Palestinians after the mid-term elections for  Congress, slated for Tuesday, the Palestinian daily Al-Quds reported over the  weekend.The report came as State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki  announced on Friday that a Palestinian delegation would arrive at the US capital  for high-level talks on ways to move forward with the stalled peace talks and  the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.




The delegation, headed by PLO chief  negotiator Saeb Erekat, is expected to meet with US Secretary of State John  Kerry on Monday.The two sides are scheduled to discuss ways of ending  the recent upsurge in violence in east Jerusalem, a Palestinian Authority  official said.On Friday, Kerry phoned PA President Mahmoud Abbas and  discussed with him the possibility of reviving the peace talks amid ongoing  tensions in east Jerusalem, the official added.According to the Al-Quds  report, the new US proposal consists of three points: ending construction in the  West Bank and in east Jerusalem; suspending the Palestinian bid at the UN  Security Council for a resolution setting a timeline for an Israeli withdrawal  to the pre-1967 lines; and resuming the peace talks from the point where they  ended last April.Early in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s second  tenure as prime minister, the government imposed a 10-month moratorium on  building starts in West Bank settlements. The gesture did not jump-start the  peace talks, which at that time were also frozen.Since then, Israel has  refused attempts to halt West Bank settlement activity and Jewish building in  Jerusalem beyond the Green Line.The Prime Minister’s Office had no  response to the Al-Quds report about a US plan.Kerry spoke with  Netanyahu on Thursday night, but Psaki said the topic under discussion was the  violence in Jerusalem. Netanyahu’s office said it would not discuss the contents  of the conversation.The Al-Quds report quoted a source as saying that  the US administration believes that it is still possible to reach a peace  agreement on the basis of the two-state solution.However, the US  administration also believes that the “window for such a solution is narrowing  in light of the absence of confidence between Israel and the Palestinians and  rising tensions resulting from both sides’ unilateral  measures.”Meanwhile, Erekat accused the Israeli government of working to  destroy the two-state solution and “impose an apartheid regime in the occupied  Palestinian territories.”Erekat told French diplomats and German  parliamentarians that the Israeli government bears responsibility for the  ongoing tensions and the collapse of the peace process because of its continued  settlement activities and “assaults” on the Aksa Mosque.The Palestinians  are determined to proceed with their plan to seek a UN resolution requiring  Israel to pull back to the pre-1967 lines within three years, he  said.The Palestinians continue to push for unilateral recognition of  statehood, separate from the peace process, in a move that has growing support  in Europe, with Sweden becoming the first European Union member state to  recognize “Palestine” on Thursday.The UK and Ireland last month held  non-binding parliamentary votes in favor of Palestinian statehood. Spain is  excepted to follow suit this month.The US rhetoric against building in  West Bank settlements and east Jerusalem has grown increasingly  sharp.Last week, Netanyahu announced that 1,060 homes would be built in  Jerusalem beyond the pre-1967 lines, and spoke of plans for 12 new roads in  Judea and Samaria, including some to isolated settlements.Justice  Minister Tzipi Livni told Channel 2 on Saturday night that Netanyahu had spoken  of new settlement activity to appease right-wing politicians.Such  announcements, coupled with the rhetoric from right-wing politicians and  ministers, are harmful to attempts to restart the peace process, she  said.Livni said she feared Abbas had chosen a unilateral path to  Palestinian statehood rather than a negotiated one, and called on Netanyahu to  counter Abbas’s action by initiating a process together with moderate Arab  nations and the Palestinians.Israel must also stop announcing settlement  activity, Livni said, blaming the recent tensions with the US on new settlement  activity.
It creates a feeling of mistrust, Livni said, adding that  Netanyahu’s actions in courting right-wing politicians harm Israel’s security  and its relations with the US.

Senior MKs on the Right on Tuesday sought to apply all laws to Israelis living  in Judea and Samaria, with a bill that would require the IDF to issue orders  identical to laws the Knesset passes.According to the initiative, within  45 days of the Knesset passing a law, the OC Central Command would order that it  apply to the West Bank.




The cabinet discussed taking similar action with  labor laws earlier this week, requiring Israeli businesses in the West Bank to  provide Israeli minimum wage and benefits to all employees, Israeli and  Palestinian, among other changes.The new legislation was proposed by  Land of Israel Caucus heads Yariv Levin (Likud) and Orit Struck (Bayit Yehudi),  and was co-sponsored by coalition chairman Ze’ev Elkin (Likud), Bayit Yehudi  faction chairwoman Ayelet Shaked, Shas faction chairman Avraham Michaeli,  Knesset Law, Constitution and Justice Committee chairman David Rotem (Yisrael  Beytenu) and United Torah Judaism faction chairman Menahem Eliezer  Moses.According to Levin and Struck, the bill would not change the  status of the land in the West Bank and does not violate the tenets of  international law by which Israel behaves in the area.Levin and Struck  explained that 350,000 Israeli citizens live in the West Bank who vote for the  Knesset, but their lives are not run by Israeli law and government, rather by  the Defense Ministry.As of now, only 16 laws were applied to the West  Bank via legislation, which could be seen as a step toward annexation, including  tax laws, the requirement to serve in the IDF and criminal law. Any other laws  were applied via a military order.The bill’s explanatory portion states  that “the law in Judea and Samaria today relies on Ottoman, Jordanian, British  and Israeli laws, as well as many [military] orders... This system creates legal  confusion and intolerable differentiation between the rights and duties of  Israeli citizens who live in different parts of the land.”The MKs called  the situation “unacceptable from a democratic point of view,” which they said  harms the rights of Israelis living in the West Bank and leads to discrimination  against them.“This bill will protect the rights and duties of Israeli  residents of Judea and Samaria,” Struck and Levin wrote in a joint  statement.“There is no justified reason for Israeli citizens living in  Judea and Samaria not to be able to have their rights and duties established by  their representatives in the Knesset, who were elected to do so, even if  sovereignty is not applied to the land.”Meretz leader Zehava Gal- On  slammed the bill, calling it “a malignant combination of annexation and  apartheid.
“Applying Israeli law is de facto annexation of the occupied  territories, and applying it only to settlers creates racial discrimination,”  she said. “This is another step in the bizarre campaign to do everything to  discredit Israel in the world and turn it into a leper in the eyes of the  international community.”

<title>Spain to vote November 18 on Palestinian state recognition</title>
<date>14/11/2014</date>
<content>
Spain's parliament will hold a symbolic vote on November 18 over recognition of a Palestinian state, according to a report in Spanish newspaper El País.The vote initiative is being spearheaded by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party in order to urge the government "to recognize 'Palestine' as a state... with the belief that coexistence between the states of Israel and 'Palestine' can be achieved through dialogue and negotiations that guarantee peace and security, respect for citizen's human rights, and stability in the region."




The possibility of a recognition vote was first reported on October 17, following shortly after Britain's symbolic Palestinian recognition vote, though a date was not set at the time. At the end of October, an Israeli petition calling on the Spanish parliament to recognize a  Palestinian  state garnered 469  signatures.Among those  spearheading the Israeli initiative was  former Foreign Ministry director-general  Alon Liel, in hopes that  Palestinian statehood recognition would help break the  stalemate in the  peace process.
“We are horrified by the possibility,  almost a reality, of a single state,” Liel told The Jerusalem Post on Tuesday.  “We are afraid that such a state will end up being an apartheid  state.”

<title>The US and Israel: Top Ten Events of 2014</title>
<date>29/12/2014</date>
<content>
Relations between Washington and Jerusalem were marked this year, in large part, by insults."Poof" went the prospects of peace between Israel and the Palestinians, said US Secretary of State John Kerry, who himself was labeled "messianic" by Israeli defense minister Moshe Ya'alon for his "obsessive" focus on the peace process. Kerry later said Israel would become an "apartheid" state on its current path.




Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu was called "chickenshit" on Iran by an American official unwilling to speak on the record, skeptical of his willingness to bomb the state's nuclear facilities. On US air waves, Netanyahu called the Obama administration's critique of his governance "un-American."And in wartime, as a team sent from the Pentagon surveyed new Israeli tactics to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza, State Department officials called some Israeli strikes "appalling" in public, unbecoming of an American ally.Rhetoric aside, what actually defined the US-Israel relationship in 2014 were shared trials under fire from Islamic extremism, on the Israeli home front and throughout a fast-spiraling Middle East. Taken as a whole, these trends reflect a continuously strengthening alliance, challenged practically by policy differences on how best to confront similar threats.​10. Kerry's peace push definitively fails.Secretary Kerry began his push for peace in 2013 with fanfare: Handshakes were photographed in Foggy Bottom, and a deadline was set for peace by April of 2014.Looking back on the process, much of that time was wasted, according to Martin Indyk, the president's special envoy to the effort. In a speech to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy delivered in May, Indyk chided the Palestinian Authority for its rhetoric and leaks to the press, and its leadership for ultimately reconciling with Hamas.Indyk also placed much of the blame on Israeli leadership, which, from his accounting, allowed settlement activity to continue in a manner that publicly humiliated Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.In the early months of 2014, Netanyahu focused on Palestinian recognition of a Jewish state; the request was dismissed by the PA and the State Department as a fool's errand. The topic of Israel's Jewish nature was a theme throughout the year, with the State Department suggesting disapproval of a Knesset bill that would declare the state definitionally Jewish.A comprehensive peace accord nowhere in site, the parties agreed to work on a framework agreement for the continuation of talks. That fell apart at the announcement of a unity deal between Fatah and Hamas, and the framework document was never fully published.Both sides praised Kerry for his effort. But its definitive failure primed the region for renewed conflict. Violence in Jerusalem, heated rhetoric between the capitals and a war in Gaza swiftly followed, all of which tested US-Israel relations.9. Palestinian unrest claims American lives.Ten Israelis were killed this autumn in a spike in violence that gripped Jerusalem— and half of them were also American, including several praying rabbis butchered with meat cleavers and a baby girl thrown from her stroller, hit intentionally by a car.Earlier, 16-year-old Naftali Fraenkel, an Israeli-American, was one of three teenagers kidnapped and murdered in the West Bank. Their killings in June led to rogue reprisal attacks against Arabs, a major security sweep of the territory and, ultimately, war between Hamas and the IDF in Gaza.In that single month of violence, Palestinian terrorism claimed more American lives than were taken by Islamic State in public executions.Americans were not only victims of Palestinian violence: Three days after the abduction of the teens, 15-year-old American citizen Tariq Abu Khdeir was videotaped beaten by Israeli security forces in Jerusalem. The State Department condemned all the incidents and called for investigations.Ultimately, the high American death toll reflects a steady trend: American Jews pursuing aliyah are predominantly religiously observant, settling in hot zones of the conflict. Their presence provides yet another reason to expect continued American involvement in the peace process.8. United States scopes out an Israeli-Arab alignment."Quiet talks" are under way between Israel and its Arab neighbors over the possibility of a "major strategic realignment" over shared threats, Vice President Joe Biden told the Jewish Federations in November, citing "violent Islamic extremists" and a "regional struggle against Iran" as chief among them."Shame on us if we are not as nimble and as capable as our grandparents were in taking advantage of this— for the first time in the history of the state of Israel— common and consistent concern about the same threats," Biden said. "The historic conversion of basic interests creates the chance, just a chance, for closer relations between Israel and the entire Arab world."Netanyahu has acknowledged those efforts, calling the opportunity an historic one in the life of Israel— and proof that Israeli-Arab peace is not predicated on the founding of a Palestinian state.“Many have long assumed that an Israeli-Palestinian peace can help facilitate a broader rapprochement between Israel and the Arab world,” Netanyahu told the General Assembly this autumn. “But these days I think it may work the other way around: Namely, that a broader rapprochement between Israel and the Arab world may help facilitate an Israeli-Palestinian peace.”Biden disagreed: Alignment is only possible coupled with a two-state solution, he told the group.7. Israel's defense minister is banned from the White House.Washington's facilitation of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians inserted American players into domestic politics— subjecting them to heated political rhetoric, perhaps none so harshly phrased as the comments of Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon back in January.Entering the third quarter of the talks, Ya'alon said privately that Kerry was obsessed with the peace process, "messianic" in his ambitions, and suggested the region would be better off without his meddling. His comments were leaked, creating a media firestorm; the State Department issued a rare demand for the minister's apology.When Ya'alon visited Washington six months later, the White House refused to grant him any meetings. US officials acknowledged at the time that Ya'alon had crossed a clear line and that the snub was intentional.6. United States elevates Israel to "strategic partner."US President Barack Obama's last act of the year at the White House was signing the US-Israel Strategic Partnership Act into law. The act is an omnibus for the relationship, expanding cooperation across industries with a focus on defense.Lawmakers across party lines took over a year to draft this legislation, which recommits the US to maintaining Israel's "qualitative military edge" over its neighbors and allows for the forward deployment of US made weapons in Israeli conflicts.Perhaps most importantly, the law designates Israel as a "major strategic partner"— elevating the alliance from major non-NATO ally. No other country holds the US designation.

5. Washington brokers an historic gas deal between Israel and Jordan.Invested in the stability of Jordan, the State Department helped facilitate a preliminary gas deal over the summer between Amman and Jerusalem that will provide Jordanians with 45 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Israeli seas over a 15-year period.The deal, worth an estimated $15 billion, faces some political obstruction in Amman, where anger with Israel has grown since the Gaza war over the summer and throughout an increase in tensions over the Temple Mount-Haram al-Sharif this fall.Nevertheless, the deal ties Jordan and Israel together economically more than any other individual agreement. Jordanian firms are now among the largest stakeholders in the Leviathan and Tamar reservoirs, providing the Arab country with a desperately-sought economical energy source.Cyprus and Turkey are also considering opportunities with Israeli gas firms, though souring relations between Jerusalem and Ankara have reportedly frozen their talks.4. Israel criticizes Pentagon for security failures in Iraq.The dramatic rise of Islamic State shocked Washington and Jerusalem with equal measures of discomfort and fear. Netanyahu and then-Justice Minister Tzipi Livni linked the group to a common threat facing moderate nations worldwide: The rise of Islamic extremists is borderless, they said, neither Sunni nor Shia and found similarly in Gaza, Raqqa and Tehran.What put space between the two governments was an Israeli critique of the Pentagon's  fundamental ability to train Arab forces to fight for themselves— much less defend the Israeli people.Israel’s national security leadership watched as Iraqi security forces, trained over the course of five years by the US military with billions of dollars, “literally left their shirts on the ground and fled” when faced with a fight, one senior Israeli official told The Jerusalem Post after Mosul fell to ISIL.Bearing witness to the crisis from the sidelines, Israel “observed the effects of US-trained Arab forces in Iraq and, from that, has learned lessons on proposals for the Jordan Valley,” the official said.The Pentagon rejected the comparison as reductive. But the political message was clear: Between the failure of Gaza and the fall of northern Iraq, Israel is more reticent than ever to withdraw fully from the Jordan Valley. The policy shift makes a peace deal even more remote. 3. Obama administration calls settlement activity "incompatible with peace."The issue of Israel's settlement activity resurfaced dramatically and repeatedly in 2014, contributing to the end of peace talks and resulting in a marked escalation in rhetoric from Washington.Incremental housing announcements over the historic Green Line humiliated Abbas, guaranteeing the failure of Kerry's peace effort, US officials attest. And this fall, a series of additional settlement moves led the State Department to question Israel's fundamental commitment to peace.

"Moving forward with this sort of action would be incompatible with the pursuit of peace," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. "If Israel wants to live in a peaceful society, they need to take steps that will reduce tensions."That new language was debuted less than an hour after Obama hosted Netanyahu in the Oval Office on October 1, blindsiding the Israeli team and leaving the prime minister humiliated. "We raise these concerns as a partner who is deeply concerned about Israel’s future," one National Security Council spokesman told the Post at the time.2. War in Gaza largely supported by the United States.Despite a host of policy differences straining the relationship, US officials largely supported Israel's Operation Protective Edge over the summer. Obama said he had "no sympathy for Hamas," and his entire national security staff forcefully defended Israel's right to defend itself from rocket fire, the kidnapping of its children and the burrowing of tunnels into its territory.The US continued weapons deliveries to Israel throughout the war, replenishing the defensive Iron Dome missile defense system in the heat of the conflict. Funding was further increased for all Israeli defense systems after the war in the year-end defense budget.The shelling of several UNRWA facilities led to the US' harshest criticism of the IDF during the conflict: The attacks were "appalling," the US said, demanding swift investigation."The suspicion that militants are operating nearby does not justify strikes that put at risk the lives of so many innocent civilians," the State Department said. The US demanded Israel live up to its stated standards.But unlike Israel's critics, the Obama administration never suggested Israel intended to kill Palestinian civilians; and during the war, the Pentagon sent a "lessons learned" team to Gaza to study Israel's tactics on avoiding civilian casualties.1. Israel considers force in response to a global nuclear deal with Iran.Negotiations between world powers and Iran over its nuclear program were extended twice in 2014, much to Israel's relief. Throughout the decade-long crisis, Netanyahu has demonstrated a preference for delay over facing uncomfortable decision points— though singularly obsessed with its outcome, heavily reliant on the power of the United States.Facing the real possibility of a comprehensive deal in November, Israeli officials revealed to the Post the government's rationale for revisiting military action against Iran should a deal come to pass. The agreement under consideration, they explained, includes a weak inspection regime that, if followed to a tee, would allow Iran to become a nuclear state after the deal sunsets in roughly a decade.The fate of the talks— described by Obama as an historic opportunity to end the nation's greatest national security challenge— is far from certain. But in 2014, world powers effectively granted Iran the right to continue enriching uranium on its own soil. Western powers appeared increasingly eager for a deal. And Israel, Saudi Arabia and other Sunni nations shuddered as Washington opened dialogue with Tehran over the expansion of ISIL.The absence of these powers at the negotiating table has unintentionally heightened the prospects of an Israeli-Arab alliance, brought together by mutual distrust; and for the first time, Israel has suggested a willingness to disrupt a deal endorsed by the US, UN and EU with unilateral force.That might be all for naught: Without a deal, according to one US official, the result may be the same.

<title>UK MPs call for ‘action’ on Palestinian state recognition, demand sanctions for Israel</title>
<date>3/12/2014</date>
<content>
LONDON – British MPs held a three-hour debate in the House of Commons late  Monday, in which they highlighted their dissatisfaction with Israeli policies,  and several MPs called for sanctions and boycotts against the Jewish  state.The trigger for the debate – which took place less than two months  after legislators approved a non-binding parliamentary motion to recognize a  Palestinian state – was a petition calling for action to push forward such  recognition.




Labor MP Grahame Morris, who led the session, called for  addressing the situation “on the ground” in Israel, and warned that the status  quo was laying the foundation for the “next major escalation.”When  Conservative MP Robert Halfon challenged him to comment on the 19,000 missiles  fired at Israel and the recent murders of Israelis, Morris offered a general  condemnation of terrorism, but reiterated that Israel was being allowed to  “achieve its goals through force regardless of how illegal and counterproductive  its actions were.”He added there was currently “little economic pressure  to prevent Israel from continuing to colonize and annex as much of the West Bank  and East Jerusalem as it wishes.”As such, he called for “applying  further pressure” on the Israeli government through economic sanctions, and  highlighted “the iniquities of trading with illegal settlements on the West  Bank.”Over 50 MPs were crowded in the House of Commons’ second chamber  at Westminster Hall, most of them in the pro-Palestinian camp. Following remarks  from some of them regarding further Israeli “obstructions” to the peace process,  Morris expanded his list of proposed actions against Israel to include first a  suspension of arms export licenses, and then a ban on all arms trading in both  directions.MP George Galloway said Palestinians had a “legal and moral  right of an occupied people to rise up against their illegal occupier,” while  Liberal Democrat David Ward – who has tweeted in the past that he, too, might  have been willing to fire missiles at Israel had he been in Gaza – not only  called for a boycott of settlement goods, but said “it should go beyond  that.”In his reply to the debate, Middle East Minister Tobias Ellwood  told Ward he did not believe in introducing sanctions “when we are trying to get  people back to the [negotiating] table.” Ellwood maintained that the government  wanted to “reserve the right to recognize Palestine when that is most likely to  lead to a two-state solution.”But during the monthly Foreign Office  question session on Tuesday, Ellwood faced repeated criticism from MPs in all  parts of the Commons for failing to implement the will of Parliament as  expressed in the October vote on the Palestinian state motion.In  response, he told MPs pressing for recognition that “bilateral recognition would  not end the occupation” and that without a negotiated settlement, “the  occupation and the problems that come with it would still  continue.”Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, meanwhile, criticized Israel  for its “illegal” settlements, which he said were a roadblock to the peace  process.“We cannot allow one of the parties to this conflict to build  themselves into a position to dictate the eventual peace,” he  said.Longtime Israel critic Bob Russell of the Liberal Democrat Party  commented that public opinion in the UK was moving strongly against Israel  “because it is morally indefensible to support a state that has policies of  ethnic cleansing and apartheid.”Hammond replied that while he was not  sure he would agree with Russell’s reasons, he did agree that “public opinion is  moving against Israel in a country that has traditionally been understanding of  the Israeli position.”
In a veiled warning to Israel, he added that “we  have made the point strongly to Israeli Ministers and politicians that they are  losing the argument and public opinion not only in Britain, but in Europe and,  perhaps more importantly for them, in the United States.”

<title>WATCH: Palestinian protesters dressed as Santa Claus clash with IDF</title>
<date>23/12/2014</date>
<content>
Dozens of Palestinian protesters, some of them festively dressed as Santa Claus, clashed on Tuesday with Israeli security forces in Bethlehem, a day before the beginning of Christmas celebrations in the West Bank city revered as the birthplace of Jesus.The demonstrators gathered at Bethlehem checkpoint to protest against "an occupation that controls our lives, and surrounding us with the apartheid wall," a press release by the Popular Struggle Coordination Committee said.




The IDF Spokesman's Unit said that approximately 80 protesters hurled rocks at security forces, who responded with riot dispersal means.Around 50,000 Palestinian Christians, including 17,000 Catholics, live among 4 million Muslims in the West Bank and in Gaza. They say Israel's checkpoints and separation barrier cut them off from their neighbors and holy places in Jerusalem.The issue of Palestinian movement restrictions comes to the fore every year in the run-up to Christmas, when tens of thousands of religious tourists make their way to Bethlehem, other parts of the West Bank and Jerusalem to celebrate the birth, life and death of Jesus.When it comes to Bethlehem, a city of 25,000 just eight kilometers south of Jerusalem, the critical issue is getting foreign tourists past Israel's separation wall and checkpoints and convincing them to stay the night.Many now choose to stay in Jerusalem and make a day trip. Palestinian officials say the growth of Israeli settlements - there are now 22 around Bethlehem - is steadily strangling access, prompting tourists to stay away.
On the morning of Christmas Eve, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Fuad Twal, will leave Jerusalem in the head of a festive motorcade towards Bethlehem, where he will lead Christmas Eve mass in the Church of Nativity.

<title>Beit Safafa residents angry over highway set to divide village</title>
<date>27/1/2014</date>
<content>
One day after the Supreme Court upheld the state’s right to build a  controversial new highway through the Arab village of Beit Safafa, residents of  the southeast Jerusalem community on Monday expressed anger and  frustration.The battle over the 1.8-km. highway has gone on for  years, with residents vociferously opposing the extension of the Begin Highway  to the Tunnel Road that leads to Gush Etzion, because it will intersect the  middle of their neighborhood.




“What’s legal for them is illegal for the  village, because it destroys it,” said Muhammad Alian, a resident in his 60s who  was born in the village. “My family will live on the other side of the highway.  It’s like going into someone’s house and putting an ugly structure in the middle  of everything.”Adding insult to injury, continued Alian, is that despite  dramatically diminishing the quality of life for Beit Safafa’s residents, the  highway will provide no benefit to them whatsoever.“It’s for the Jews –  and I’m not talking [with] prejudice, I’ve lived and worked with Jews all my  life and am not against the people,” he said.“It’s just that the plans  they’re making are good for them – and no one else.”Despite Sunday’s  ruling, the court did make some concessions based on the Beit Safafa residents’  wishes and complaints, by canceling certain access roads around the main road  and ordering the state to produce an updated master plan before moving ahead  with the project.Still, Jamal Subhy, also born in Beit Safafa, compared  the construction to Nazi Germany.“This policy is like apartheid,” he  said. “They’re doing what they did in Germany – separating families and the  community. They’re acting like there’s no Arab village here.”Moreover,  Subhy said the construction is an elaborate scheme to ultimately push the  Palestinian residents out of their beloved community.“They’re trying to  turn this into an Israeli village – to get us to leave our homes,” he  said.Indeed, according to Mutaz Othman, the purpose of the highway is to  “take the land away from us.”“The main point is to take the land from  us, because if you live near the [highway] you will have no license to build,”  he said. “I will stay, but my children will not stay because there will be no  place to build to live.”Othman’s cousin, Zohair Othman, who owns a hair  salon in the village, echoed these sentiments, adding that the construction is  destroying the village’s landscape and adding pollutants.“This highway  is not for Beit Safafa,” he said. “We can’t use it and it will pollute the  community. In the past two or three days they’ve been removing olive trees, and  I took one to my house. Beit Safafa was once one of the most pastoral [villages]  in Jerusalem, but now it’s a road.”Zohair said he believes the state is  attempting to drive residents to Bethlehem, at which point they will no longer  be provided with Israeli identification and rights.“In 10 years the  people of Beit Safafa will no longer be able to build here, and since they can’t  afford to live in Jerusalem will be forced to go to Bethlehem,” he  said.“They’ll take away our ID and the Palestinian Authority will not  give us one.”Meanwhile, Abu Yazan, a lifelong Beit Safafa resident who  operates a furniture store, said he was equally concerned about the fate of the  Arab community.“Beit Safafa is a small village, and the people are  increasing but the land is becoming smaller, so the people have no room to build  their houses,” said Yazan. “In 20 years there will be no more land to build on,  because this is a very big highway and the land beside it and near it will no  longer be able to be built on.”Further exacerbating Yazan’s frustration,  he said, is the fact that the highway will have no utilitarian value to Beit  Safafa’s residents.“It gives no access to the people here, so it’s of no  use to us and lowers the quality of life,” he said.

<title>Demonstrators rally at Western Wall against peace deal with Palestinians</title>
<date>30/1/2014</date>
<content>
Several thousand men and women gathered at the Western Wall on Thursday  afternoon for a mass prayer rally against the ongoing negotiations between  Israel and the PLO.




Kommemiut, a group devoted to the preservation of  Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Golan Heights, organized the event.  Participants included Construction and Housing Minister Uri Ariel, Deputy  Religious Services Minister Rabbi Eli Ben-Dahan and MK Orit Struck, all from the  Tekuma party, a constituent of the Bayit Yehudi Knesset faction. MK Moti  Yogev (Bayit Yehudi) was also in attendance.The prayers were led by  senior national-religious leaders Rabbis Haim Druckman, Shmuel Eliyahu and Dov  Lior.Ben-Dahan also led part of the extensive prayer  service.Before the service, Ben-Dahan told The Jerusalem Post that the  emerging details of an outline plan being proposed by US Secretary of State John  Kerry were unacceptable.“We cannot agree to any deal that includes the  establishment of a Palestinian state and the expulsion of Jews from their  homes,” said Ben-Dahan.The service at the Western Wall lasted for more  than an hour, with the thousands of attendees fervently repeating the prayers  read over loud speakers, to the accompaniment of trumpet blasts.Eliyahu,  the chief rabbi of Safed and a controversial figure from the conservative wing  of the national-religious movement, helped devise the prayer service for the  event and implored those at the rally to cry from their hearts to  God.The head of Eliyahu’s office told the Post that the purpose of the  gathering was “to unite the community of those who love the Torah and the Land  of Israel against an agreement with an enemy that does not want peace but seeks  to destroy the Jewish people.”“Kerry doesn’t understand the reality  here, the problem is much deeper than he thinks. Unfortunately, we are already  experienced with what happens when we give up land to the Arabs, and we don’t  wish to see more rockets fired at Israel,” he said.“We have to rouse the  people through prayer against this tragedy, and against the expulsion of Jews  from their homes.”Meretz chairwoman Zehava Gal-on spoke out harshly  against the prayer rally and the participation of Bayit Yehudi  politicians.
“The ministers and MKs of Bayit Yehudi are not just a  messianic and extremist group that, within the government, promotes a  frightening apartheid vision, but also – and even principally – is a shameless  and hypocritical coterie that has sat for a year on the levers of economic power  [including] the Ministries of Housing [and] the Economy, the Knesset Finance  Committee and the Israel Lands Authority, and protests at every opportunity  against the decisions of the government that it itself is a partner in,” Gal-on  said in a statement to the press.

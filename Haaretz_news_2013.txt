<title>YouTube removes video calling on Alicia Keys to cancel Israel concert</title>
<date>Fri Jun 28 12:33:00 IDT 2013</date>

YouTube has removed a video calling on Alicia Keys to cancel a concert in Tel Aviv.
Set to Keys’ popular song “This Girl is on Fire,” the video was removed on Monday, according to the U.S. Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel.
The video, “Alicia Keys, Come Together with Your Sisters, Boycott Apartheid,” was removed, a notification by YouTube said, due to a copyright infringement claim by “Alicia Keys c/o Ziffren Brittenheim LLP.”
It showed Palestinian performance and visual artist Rana Hamadeh standing on an Israeli military vehicle waving a Palestinian flag.
“It is enough that we face physical and emotional violence and restrictions on our daily lives. But now we are also being silenced on the internet,” Hamadeh said in a statement distributed by the U.S. Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel. “I think if Alicia Keys understood the call to boycott, she would agree to honor it.”
Keys affirmed her decision to play in Israel in an interview published last month in The New York Times. She has been under pressure to cancel the July 4 concert.
The appeal to Keys to boycott Israel came first from Alice Walker in an open letter posted on the Pulitzer Prize-winning author’s website. Calls also came from Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and numerous pro-Palestinian organizations.

<title>British lawmaker suspended from party over 'Apartheid Israel’ tweet</title>
<date>Thu Jul 18 18:29:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
David Ward, a British lawmaker who made negative generalizations about “the Jews” and referred to Israel as an apartheid state, was suspended temporarily from the Liberal Democratic Party.
Following a meeting with party leaders on Wednesday, Ward was suspended until September 13, during which time he will serve in parliament as an independent. No parliamentary votes are scheduled between now and September 13, according to reports.
Ward met with party leader Nick Clegg and chief whip Alistair Carmichael in the wake of a July 13 tweet sent by Ward that read, “Am I wrong or are am I right? At long last the 
Zionists are losing the battle - how long can the 
apartheid State of 
Israel last?”
In January, on International Holocaust Memorial Day, Ward said he was “saddened that the Jews, who suffered unbelievable levels of persecution during the Holocaust, could, within a few years of liberation, be inflicting atrocities on the Palestinians in the new State of Israel - and continue to do so.”
The controversy was renewed when reports emerged that Ward asked his staff if replacing “the Jews” with “the Jewish community” would mollify his critics, leading to another round of complaint, and sanctions including a requirement that he attend language classes.
In a letter obtained by the BBC that was sent to Ward following the meeting, Carmichael praised Ward for his progress since February, including his appreciation of “the need to use language in this debate that was proportionate and precise.” But in reference to the tweet, he added, “We were in unanimous agreement that questioning the continued existence of the State of Israel fails the test of language that is ‘proportionate and precise.’”
Jonathan Arkush, vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said in response to the suspension of Ward, “We note that the Liberal Democrats have at last taken some action to address the completely inappropriate and offensive comments that he has made. However, suspension of the whip for just two months when Parliament is not sitting is too little, too late. It is a token and frankly an empty gesture.”

<title>Roger Waters concert features Nazi-like uniform, pig balloon with Jewish symbol </title>
<date>Thu Jul 25 19:10:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Roger Waters, a rock musician critical of Israel, used a giant, pig-shaped balloon emblazoned with a Star of David and symbols of dictatorial regimes during a recent concert in Belgium.
Waters, who recently urged other performers to boycott Israel and compared Israel to apartheid South Africa, was singing on stage on July 20 under the balloon while toting a machine gun replica and wearing a long black leather jacket with a red-and-white arm band, reminiscent of a Nazi uniform.
The former Pink Floyd member was singing “get him up against the wall, that one looks Jewish and that one’s a coon, who let all of this riff-raff into the room” – the lyrics of the song “In the Flesh.”
Thousands of fans shouted his name and applauded as he stood on stage pretending to fire the replica.
Michael Freilich, editor-in-chief of the Belgian Jewish monthly Joods Actueel, called on the government to issue a statement condemning what he called “an anti-Semitic display” at the concert.

<title>Roger Waters: I'm not anti-Semitic, I'm anti-apartheid</title>
<date>Mon Aug 05 15:18:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Former Pink Floyd star Roger Waters attempted to deflect accusations of anti-Semitism and defend his decision to use a pig-shaped balloon emblazoned with the Star of David, among other symbols, during a concert in Belgium.
Waters, who last year voiced support for the boycott of Israeli goods, came under fire for the use of the inflatable pig, which was destroyed by the audience at the end of the show. Apart from anti-Semitism claims, some accused him of being a Jew hater and Nazi supporter.
In a response posted on Facebook, Waters denied the allegations and said the Star of David represents Israel and its policies, and not Judaism.
"[I]n a functioning theocracy it is almost inevitable that the symbol of the religion becomes confused with the symbol of the state, in this case the State of Israel, a state that operates apartheid both within its own borders and also in the territories it has occupied and colonized since 1967," wrote Waters. "Like it or not, the Star of David represents Israel and its policies."
The statement said Waters is regularly criticized by pro-Israel groups for his support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.
As for the inflatable pig, the musician argued that it represents "the evil of errant government." Waters said the balloon was used in 193 shows since 2010 and that it was destroyed by the audience at the end of each one.
Waters noted that the show also uses other religious and commercial symbols such as the Crucifix, the Crescent and Star, the Shell Oil logo, the McDonald’s sign and a dollar sign.
The show, Waters concluded, "is many things. It is thoughtful, life affirming, ecumenical, humane, loving, anti-war, anti-colonial, pro universal access to the law, pro liberty, pro collaboration, pro dialogue, pro peace, anti-authoritarian, anti-fascist, anti-apartheid, anti-dogma, international in spirit, musical and satirical. It is not anti-Semitic or pro-Nazi." 
Waters pointed out that the Anti-Defamation League said it does not believe he had anti-Semitic intent, although it did regret the use of the Star of David.
This is not the first time Waters has come under fire for using Jewish symbols. In 2010, the ADL criticized the musician for using imagery associated with perpetuating Jewish stereotypes.

<title>UC Berkley anti-Semitism complaint dismissed</title>
<date>Wed Aug 28 20:58:38 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The U.S. Department of Education has dismissed a complaint against the University of California, Berkeley that had accused the university of allowing a hostile environment for Jewish students to exist on campus.
In a letter dated August 19 and released August 27 by UC Berkeley, the education department’s Office for Civil Rights indicates that it is closing its year-long investigation after concluding that events that took place on campus — such as mock military checkpoint demonstrations held during Israeli Apartheid Week by Students for Justice in Palestine — constitute “expression on matters of public concern directed to the University community.”

<title>Spanish festival bans jazz player for attending pro-Israel event</title>
<date>Wed Sep 11 16:25:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Organizers of a music festival near Barcelona prevented a local jazz musician from performing because of his support for Israel.
The organizers of the Fiesta Major Alternativa told Eric Herrera that he could not play with his band, Amusic Skazz Band, on Aug. 29 after photos surfaced of him attending an event marking Israel’s 65th anniversary in Barcelona earlier this year, band members told the news site Dialogo Libre.
The band canceled its performance in Manreza, where anti-Israel activists reportedly handed out posters of Herrera posing next to the Israeli flag at the celebration. The same photos were circulated among some festival goers ahead of the event.
Reports in Spanish media did not say whether Herrera is Jewish.
“Obviously, we decided not to play at all,” the band wrote in a news release issued last week. The statement also said that organizers told the band they “could not guarantee their safety.”
The organizers wrote in a statement that the cancellation was “due to unease generated among various groups and organizers [over] the fact that members [of Amusic Skazz Band] actively participate in demonstrations of support for the Zionist state of Israel.” This “political stance clashed head-on with the ideals defended by the majority of groups present,” the statement read.
Organizers also wrote that they reject claims “that were made in media” that the campaign against Herrera was anti-Semitic.
“We believe this campaign of denunciation of Zionism is not an anti-Semitic campaign,” the organizers wrote, adding that “Zionism is the ideology that justified the creation of the State of Israel, a state formed through colonization, war and military occupation, and has established an apartheid regime based on institutionalized racism.”
Jolanda Estede of the cultural department of the municipality of Manreza told JTA that the city did not wish to comment on the incident because the festival was “an independent event not organized by the municipality.”
She added, however, that the city provided security for the festival.

<title>Once prominent in South African politics, Jews take a back seat</title>
<date>Tue Dec 03 19:02:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
A forum of young Jewish adults in South Africa recently invited the country's anti-corruption crusader, Thuli Madonsela, to meet with them at the Sydenham Synagogue in Johannesburg. For the most part, South Africa's Jews are cheering on Madonsela, who, in her role as Public Protector (equivalent to ombudsman in other countries,) has doggedly investigated the misspending of public funds on upgrades to President Jacob Zuma’s private homestead, Nkandla.
South Africa’s most celebrated political cartoonist Zapiro (real name Jonathan Shapiro) portrayed her recently as a knight galloping on her horse towards Nkandla, past bumbling officials trying to stop her.
Though Madonsela is not a politician per se, her actions in making the government squirm remind older South Africans of a “knight” from a previous era, sharp-tongued Jewish Member of Parliament Helen Suzman of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party. As the party’s sole MP for 13 years in the race-based parliament, she often made the government squirm with questions to ministers about racial laws which degraded and humiliated black South Africans. When a minister accused her of posing questions to embarrass South Africa, she replied: “It is not my questions that embarrass South Africa; it is your answers.” Jews voted overwhelmingly for her and her party.
Jews were once prolific in South African politics at every level. In addition to Suzman, the Progressive Party was represented by former-leader Tony Leon, as well as Selma Browde and Harry Schwarz. The African National Congress, the liberation movement that became the governing party in 1994, also had a full complement of Jews, including Joe Slovo, Ronnie Kasrils and Denis Goldberg. Jews were also prominent in municipal politics. Over Johannesburg's 120-year history, 22 of its 94 mayors have been Jewish, according to the city’s website. Cape Town has had 13 Jewish mayors since 1907.
Today, however, Jews are largely absent from formal politics. Of the few remaining, most are in their twilight years, such as 86-year-old ANC parliamentarian Ben Turok, who was one of several Jews (the late Lionel Bernstein was another) involved in drawing up the 1955 Freedom Charter – the key document of the liberation struggle. A few, younger Jewish politicians can be found here and there, such as Jack Bloom, a veteran of the liberal Democratic Alliance and leader of the Opposition in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature.
Bloom says Jews played a key role in ensuring that the ANC remained multi-racial during the apartheid years. For example, fully half of the white defendants in the Treason Trial of 1956 were Jewish, as were all five of the white defendants in the infamous Rivonia Trial.
Says Bloom: “If they had not been there among the mainly-black accused, there would have been few whites at all, the racial atmosphere would have been harsher and the ANC’s ideology might not have stayed on such a firmly non-racial track. Another example is Jewish lawyer Lazar Sidelsky, who gave Nelson Mandela his first job as a legal clerk when no-one else would. Activist Walter Sisulu, who spent many years in jail on Robben Island with Mandela, commented that if he had not done so Mandela might have gone back to his rural birthplace in the Transkei, become a tribal chief and remained there.”
South Africa's Jews will vote in next year’s elections, but their presence in the top ranks of the political parties will be negligible. Recent incidents in the ANC have been labelled by angry Jews as anti-Semitic and anti-Israel, such as the party’s Western Cape leader's wooing of Muslim voters by equating the DA with support for Israel, and saying it gives business to Jews in preference to Muslims. Jewish sentiments veer mostly towards the DA.
When only the country's five million-strong white population was eligible to vote, Jews stood out prominently; but they are a lot less visible today, with 50 million, predominantly black voters. In addition to which, the SA Jewish population is roughly half what it was in the 1960s and ‘70s. Another dampener is white fears of accusations of racism if they criticize the black government. Mainstream SA Jewry has also become more religious and inward-looking. The Jewish influence today is felt mainly in business, the arts and the professions.
Given their history of distinguished politicians, will SA Jews continue to stay out of direct political roles? It’s not as if they are without strong views. But despite inviting people like Madonsela to meet them, they still feel a little like outsiders, unlike the days when their own Helen Suzman led the charge in parliament. Many of the country’s new, black political elite regard liberals like Suzman as historical footnotes. In an interview a few years before she died in 2009, she said she had been “airbrushed” out of South African history.
Bloom says the absence of Jews is part of the general white withdrawal from formal politics. “But the Jewish energy has been rechanneled into social and civic activism. For example, in creating ambulance services, development projects in needy communities, and so on.” Jewish NGOs like Ma’Afrika Tikkun - of which Mandela is a patron - run numerous upliftment projects in disadvantaged black communities countrywide. Jewish companies and private benefactors give widely to such causes.
“As another example of Jewish involvement in the country,” says Bloom, “we have people like Gill Marcus, Governor of the SA Reserve Bank, whose signature appears on the banknotes.”
For the time being, however, there are few signs of South Africa's Jews taking the plunge and re-entering formal politics.

<title>Nelson Mandela’s rabbi is waiting to greet him</title>
<date>Fri Dec 06 19:37:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
Since the news of Nelson Mandela's passing, individuals and organizations in the South African Jewish community have been flooding phones and inboxes with messages. Jewish prayer services are being organized everywhere. Most South African Jews never met him personally, but they felt as though he was a friend they knew.
South African music icon Johnny Clegg, whose songs celebrated Mandela at a time when doing so was dangerous in South Africa, said in a message: “Nelson Mandela will always define a deep part of what and who we are as individuals and as a nation. It is difficult to separate the great journey to secure a democratic and non-racial South Africa from his personal qualities and character. For all South Africans he was the face and form of that voyage, particularly in the crucial decade of 1990-2000.
“In the defining and tempestuous years of 1990 through to April 27th 1994 his leadership never gave the impression that he was overwhelmed by events, even in the darkest hours of Boipatong and other atrocities that were meant to derail the negotiations. When at times we felt doubt or fear, his strong resonant voice rolled out over the radio or TV and, like a tide going out, our reservations about the future receded. We took immense nourishment and succour from his fearless and positive attitude. His charismatic openness, straight aim, direct but respectful communication with his opponents was a singularly rare quality in a time of racist and right wing demagoguery. A country in turmoil needs to feel that the Ship of State, riding the storm, is in good hands and he never gave us cause to doubt that the storm would pass and the country would be free. It is the qualities of tolerance and forgiveness however which stand out as his lasting legacy as well as the way he used these to unite the country both during and after his presidency.
“With all our fellow South Africans we acknowledge with deep gratitude the debt we owe to this Man from Qunu, who bequeathed us this great country of promise. Today, although we grieve, we also proudly rejoice in his remarkable life, which we were privileged to share through extraordinary times.”
South African Chief Rabbi Warren Goldstein stressed Mandela's relationship with South African Jewry. “South African Jews have had a long, close and meaningful relationship with former President Nelson Mandela… that involved every stage of Mandela’s life," he said. "And so we mourn his loss together with fellow-South Africans… The greatest tribute we can pay is to live with the values he practiced and taught… human dignity, forgiveness, kindness, courage, tenacity, strength, honesty and integrity.”
One of Mandela’s strongest supporters during his presidency was the late former South African chief rabbi, Cyril Harris, who led South African Jewry through the transformation to democracy. On sighting Harris during his trip to Israel in 1999, Mandela proclaimed: “My rabbi has come!”
Mandela and Harris, together with Harris’ wife Ann, cooperated on projects such as the creation of the organization for upliftment of needy black communities, Ma’Afrika Tikkun, of which Mandela was a patron. Ann Harris recalled Friday morning Mandela's closeness with her late husband, saying: “Well, I am sure his rabbi is waiting to greet him…”
Harris was equally warm to Mandela and when he was being treated by a Jewish doctor for eye problems from working in lime quarries on Robben Island during his imprisonment Harris declared: “We’re sorry you are having trouble with your eyes, but we want you to know that there is nothing wrong with your vision.”
Ann Harris said Friday that Mandela's most important quality was dignity. "An innate dignity and nobility, this quality of royalty… statesmanship, leadership," she said, and recalled a story from 1994.
 “On the first day of Rosh Hashanah, soon after he became president, he rang up to say happy New Year to myself and Cyril. Our domestic worker Constance Balintaba answered and said: “It’s the Jewish New Year, they are at the synagogue, and they don’t answer the phone because of the Jewish holiday." Mandela asked if she would pass on the message. “Of course," she said. Then he asked where she came from. She answered Lusikisiki, and in an animated tone he said “Ah! We are neighbors, I come from a village nearby, not far from you," and they had a long chat about it. She was absolutely over the moon.”
 One of Mandela's earliest encounters with South Africa's Jews was in 1941 when, as a young man, he came to Johannesburg seeking work, and was given his first job by Jewish attorney Lazar Sidelsky. This act – both unusual and brave – made a lasting impression. Later, many white comrades with whom he formed close bonds were leftist Jews. Of the 156 accused in the Treason Trial of 1956, 23 were whites – more than half of them Jews. The 17 activists arrested at Liliesleaf, Rivonia in July 1963, included five whites – all of them Jews.
At Wits University where he studied law, he made some Jewish friends who later defended him in the above trials. The defense in the Treason Trial was headed by advocate Isie Maisels, and Sydney Kentridge was his counsel. Kentridge said later: “I could somehow tell from the many talks I had with him that this man was a leader – of course I couldn’t have guessed he would become the leader he, in fact, became.”
His Jewish connections then were primarily with individuals – friends, activists, lawyers and journalists. With the Jewish majority, he had little contact. Although most Jews, along with almost all white South Africans, went along with apartheid, they voted consistently for liberal opposition parties and backed Parliamentarians like anti-apartheid Helen Suzman. Jewish women’s groups and others worked to alleviate the effects of apartheid on blacks.
After President FW de Klerk announced in February 1990 that the ban on the ANC was lifted and Mandela would be released after 27 years in prison, a new period began in which he engaged with mainstream Jewish organizations, philanthropists and businessmen, such as the South Africa Jewish Board of Deputies, at whose National Conference in 1993 he was keynote speaker.
In 1985, a movement, Jews for Social Justice, was started for action against apartheid, supported by Rabbis Norman Bernhard and Ady Assabi. Shortly after his release from prison Mandela attended a Shabbat service at Temple Shalom in Johannesburg, at Rabbi Assabi’s invitation. Some congregants protested, since just prior to it Mandela appeared on television embracing PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat at an event in another African country.
Mandela displayed profound loyalty to friends and comrades such as Helen Suzman. During apartheid, when she was the sole MP of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, she was the first Parliamentarian to visit Mandela on Robben Island. He remained close to her even after she was marginalized by the new black political elite. “I have been airbrushed out of history by the new regime – but my friend Mandela still comes to see me," Suzman said.
The Israeli-Palestinian question inevitably came up with Zionist South African Jews. Instinctively, he was sympathetic to Palestinians, given the links during apartheid between the ANC and PLO. However, he attended a ceremony at Oxford Synagogue in Johannesburg in 1995 to honor assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
His trip to Israel in 1999 with Jewish leaders aimed to repair negative feelings caused by Israeli links with apartheid South Africa, in which it cooperated on military matters. Mandela proposed a Mideast peace plan in which the Arabs would recognize Israel within 1967 borders, and Israel would relinquish captured territory. In Gaza, he met Arafat and in Israel visited Rabin’s grave and Yad Vashem.
His positive attitude after his release from prison reassured nervous whites, Jews among them, that after living with “packed suitcases under the bed” during apartheid, they had a future here. Most people always knew apartheid couldn’t last. It seemed likely to end in a racial bloodbath. Under Mandela, however, there would be no bloodbath. He encouraged all South Africans to build a “rainbow nation." He invited one of his warders from Robben Island to his presidential inauguration and had lunch with Percy Yutar, a state prosecutor in the Rivonia Trial.
On Friday morning, the South Africa Jewish Board of Deputies announced it is working with Chief Rabbi Goldstein to arrange special prayer services, and issued the following statement: “The sad day has arrived that our dear Madiba has left us… We join with all the peoples of the world in paying tribute to the life of a true giant of humanity… A man of unflinching courage and unswerving principle, of boundless compassion and the profoundest humility, Nelson Mandela epitomized the miracle of South Africa’s democratic transformation. Many heroic men and women played their part in bringing about the triumph of justice and democracy in South Africa, but the name of Nelson Mandela towers above them all.”
The South African Holocaust and Genocide Centre released a statement: “Tata Madiba, your legacy will never be forgotten. [We will] continue to honor your memory by striving to build a more caring and just society in which human rights and diversity are valued and respected.”
One thing that is gratifying to South Africans across the board is that Mandela, contrary to freedom fighters in so many other places, lived to see his dream of a democratic South Africa come true.

<title>Alan Dershowitz retiring from Harvard Law School</title>
<date>Mon Dec 16 14:48:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
Alan Dershowitz, one of the country’s most prominent lawyers and a passionate, sometimes controversial, advocate for Israel, is retiring from Harvard Law School.
The 75-year-old lawyer, who is known for taking on high profile and often unpopular causes and clients, has taught at Harvard Law for half a century. His retirement is official at the end of the week.
In 1967, he became the youngest full professor in the school’s history. An expert in criminal and constitutional law, Dershowitz has served on the defense team of celebrities including O.J. Simpson and Claus von Bulow and, more recently, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.
Dershowitz, speaking from a conference in Israel, said last week according to the Boston Globe: “Yeah, I’m really retiring. …My retirement consists of reducing my schedule down to only about 10 things at any given time.”
Dershowitz, a Brooklyn native who has written and spoken often on his Orthodox Jewish upbringing and education, has used his prominence to defend Israel over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Among his harshest critics is Noam Chomsky, the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology linguist with whom he has had a long-running public feud over Israel.
In 2006, Dershowitz publicly challenged former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, for the views he expressed in his book “Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid,” calling the book biased.
While “proud to be Jewish and engaged with Israel’s future,” Dershowitz also assisted Palestinian students when they sought inclusion of the Palestinian flag in a campus display, Harvard Law School dean Martha Minow told JTA.
Minow described Dershowitz as a devoted teacher of 50 years. “We look forward to his continuing vibrancy, wit, and wisdom,” she said in an email to JTA.

<title>ADL: Hawking's Israel boycott a 'slap in face of academic freedom'</title>
<date>Thu May 09 17:53:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The New York-based Anti-Defamation League has slammed British physicist Stephen Hawking for pulling out of an Israeli conference because of pressure from pro-Palestinian activists.
Hawking "has delivered a slap in the face to academic freedom," the ADL said in a statement Wednesday. The boycott campaign "relies on an abhorrent and false comparison of Israeli democracy to Apartheid," charged the group, which fights against defamation of Israel and Jews.
The renowned physicist canceled his planned appearance at next month's Presidential Conference in Jerusalem, apparently in response to the urging of Palestinian activists and academics.
Hawking informed President Shimon Peres of his decision last weekend, but decided not to make it public. Thus it became public knowledge only on Wednesday, when it was reported on the website of the British Committee for the Universities of Palestine and picked up by the British daily The Guardian.
According to the statement published with Hawking's approval by BRICUP, a group that works to promote an academic boycott of Israel, the cancellation was "his independent decision to respect the boycott, based upon his knowledge of Palestine, and on the unanimous advice of his own academic contacts there." The group didn't publish Hawking's letter to Peres, but said it would do so if it received his permission.
Conference chairman Israel Maimon told the Guardian that Hawking's decision was "outrageous and wrong."
"The use of an academic boycott against Israel is outrageous and improper, particularly for those to whom the spirit of liberty is the basis of the human and academic mission," he continued. "Israel is a democracy in which everyone can express their opinion, whatever it may be. A boycott decision is incompatible with open democratic discourse."
In a subsequent conversation with Haaretz, Maimon noted that Hawking was being more Palestinian than the Palestinians: While he was boycotting the conference, other Palestinians had agreed to attend it as speakers.
"Hawking's stance strengthens the extremists," Maimon added. "After all, extremists don't talk; moderates talk. This boycott isn't a path that encourages dialogue, it only encourages the extremists."
The three-day conference, which will open on June 18 at Jerusalem's International Convention Center (Binyanei Ha'uma), is being cosponsored by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It will bring together people from the fields of government, economics, technology, science and entertainment to discuss the question of how to shape a better future for the world, the Jewish people and Israel.
Among the guests who have confirmed their attendance are singer and actress Barbra Streisand, who will sing at the opening event in honor of Peres' 90th birthday; former U.S. President Bill Clinton; former President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev; actress Sharon Stone; Prince Albert of Monaco; Daniel Kahneman, winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in economics; and a number of senior executives from the high-tech world.

<title>One of Canada’s largest student association endorses BDS against Israel</title>
<date>Sun Mar 31 13:43:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
One of the largest student association in Canada passed a resolution endorsing the global boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign against Israel.With the passage late last week of the resolution, York University's student association joins two others in Canada - the University of Toronto and Concordia University graduate student associations - in endorsing the BDS campaign, according to the York University Excalibur.The campaign calls for universities to divest from holdings in companies that do business with Israel and to cut ties with Israeli academics.The vote by the council of the York Federation of Students was 18-2 in favor and was advocated for by the Students Against Israeli Apartheid at York.Jewish student groups at York complained that they were not given advance notice of the vote and had little time to prepare an argument against the resolution.In comments to the Excalibur, Safiyah Husein, a vice president of the York Federation of Students, portrayed the resolution as uncontroversial. "Indeed, not everyone supports reduced tuition fees, equity campaigns, or sustainability work, but we know the majority of our members believe this work is vital and important," Husein said.Chaim Lax, president of Hasbara@York, said his group was disappointed and called the resolution “fundamentally racist, and a possible violation of [York’s] anti-discrimination codes.”The York Federation of Students resolution will have no actual bearing on the university's investment portfolio."York University uses best practices in developing its policy on investments, and this is built on advice from major investment consulting firms," York spokeswoman Janice Walls told the Canadian Jewish News.The student federation represents over 52,000 undergraduate students at York, Canada's third-largest university.

<title>Oxford University Students Union expected to reject Israel boycott motion, Jewish union says </title>
<date>Wed Feb 27 14:00:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
	Oxford University Student Union is expected to reject a controversial motion Wednesday evening calling for a boycott of Israeli institutions, goods and produce, according to the U.K.'s Union of Jewish Students.
                
	Along with the boycott, the motion proposed by student Emily Cousens also calls for the prestigious university's students union, and for Britain's National Union of Students, to join the international campaign for boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against Israel.
                
	"Many students have already voted against it and the likely outcome is that it will be rejected this evening," a spokesperson from the Union of Jewish Students, an umbrella organization for Jewish students in the U.K. "We eagerly await the results."
                
	The motion, which will be voted on at 5:30 P.M. local time, reads: “We [the Oxford University Student's Union and the National Union of Students] have a moral responsibility to fight injustice,” and demands that Israel “end its occupation of all Arab lands.”
                
	It also calls on the union to “conduct research into higher education institutions’ contacts, relations, investment and commercial relationships that may be implicated in violating Palestinian human rights as stated by the BDS movement.”
                
	The vote follows tensions on the Oxford campus last week, after far-left British Member of Parliament George Galloway caused a storm by walking out of a debate on Israel's presence in the West Bank when he discovered that the speaker debating him was an Israeli citizen.
                
	In a statement after the event, Galloway said, "I refused this evening to debate with an Israeli, a supporter of the Apartheid state of Israel. The reason is simple; No recognition, no normalization. Just boycott, divestment and sanctions, until the Apartheid state is defeated."
                
	The student arguing against the motion, Eylon Aslan-Levy, accused Galloway of "pure racism." Galloway's walk-out was greeted by cries of surprise and the word "racism" from the students in the hall who applauded Aslan-Levy.

<title>Pulitzer Prize-winner Anthony Lewis dies at 85 - Jewish World News</title>
<date>Tue Mar 26 00:48:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
Two-time Pulitzer winner Anthony Lewis, whose New York Times column championed liberal causes for three decades, died Monday. He was 85.
                
Lewis worked for 32 years as a columnist for the Times, taking up such causes as free speech, human rights and constitutional law. He won his first Pulitzer in 1955 as a reporter defending a Navy civilian falsely accused of being a communist sympathizer, and he won again in 1963 for reporting on the Supreme Court.
                
His acclaimed 1964 book, "Gideon's Trumpet," told the story of a petty thief whose fight for legal representation led to a landmark Supreme Court decision.
                
The legal world this month marked the 50th anniversary of that landmark decision but noted that many in the U.S. still face a judge without the help of a lawyer.
                
Lewis' wife, Margaret Marshall, confirmed his death from complications from heart and renal failure.
                
Lewis saw himself as a defender of decency, respect for law and reason against a tide of religious fundamentalism and extreme nationalism. His columns criticized the Vietnam War, Watergate, apartheid in South Africa and Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
                
He wrote his final "Abroad at Home" column for The Times on Dec. 15, 2001, warning against the U.S. fearfully surrendering its civil liberties in the wake of the terrorist attacks three months earlier.
                
"The hard question is whether our commitment to law will survive the new sense of vulnerability that is with us all after Sept. 11," he wrote. "It is easy to tolerate dissent when we feel safe."
                
Gail Collins, then the editorial page editor of the Times, said when Lewis resigned that he had been an inspiration.
                
"His fearlessness, the clarity of his writing and his commitment to human rights and civil liberties are legendary," Collins said. "And he's also one of the kindest people I have ever known."
                
"Gideon's Trumpet" became a legal classic, telling the story of Clarence Earl Gideon, whose case resulted in the creation of the public defender systems across the nation. In Gideon v. Wainwright, the high court ruled that criminal defendants are entitled to a lawyer even if they cannot afford one.
                
Gideon's victory, Lewis wrote, "shows that even the poorest and least powerful of men — a convict with not even a friend to visit him in prison — can take his cause to the highest court in the land and bring about a fundamental change in the law."
                
The best-selling book was later made into a television movie starring Henry Fonda.
                
Lewis was known for his skill at interpreting and writing clearly about the decisions of the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950s and '60s. The court was instrumental in groundbreaking decisions that helped break down persistent racial segregation.
                
"One cannot talk about the Warren court without talking about Anthony Lewis," said Ronald K. L. Collins, a scholar at the University of Washington School of Law who put together a bibliography of Lewis' expansive writings on free speech. "He was almost the 10th justice of the Warren court. He was careful in his journalism, but his ethos was clearly the same as the Warren court."
                
Fighting for the underdog was a theme for Lewis. He won his first Pulitzer Prize at the age of 28 for a series of articles in the Washington Daily News that were judged responsible for clearing a civilian employee of the U.S. Navy from McCarthy-era allegations that he was a security risk.
                
Lewis said Abraham Chasanow was a middle-class man, uninterested in politics, who was terrorized by the federal loyalty-security program of the 1950s when unnamed informants alleged Chasanow was a radical communist sympathizer. The Navy ultimately apologized to Chasanow.
                
"We need to celebrate and understand our unique freedom, and it is unique in this country this freedom of speech and press," Lewis told the Times in 2007. "And I don't actually think we understand it well."
                
Joseph Anthony Lewis was born in New York City on March 27, 1927.
                
He joined the Times in 1948 and spent most of his career there.
                
He studied law for a year at Harvard in the 1950s so he could go on to cover the Supreme Court for the Times. He began his twice-weekly "Abroad at Home" column from London in 1969.
                
Marshall said Lewis was a humble man who loved vegetable gardening, opera and musicals, and wrote on a manual typewriter until the day he died.
                
"He loved people," she said. "He was enthusiastic about so much. Most of all, he loved the rule of law. He was really passionate about that. He had a very high regard for judges and the judicial system. He really thought that was the core value that made the United States so different."
                
When Lewis retired, he told the Times that his career as a columnist had led him to two conclusions.
                
"One is that certainty is the enemy of decency and humanity in people who are sure they are right, like Osama bin Laden and (then-Attorney General) John Ashcroft," he said. "And secondly that for this country at least, given the kind of obstreperous, populous, diverse country we are, law is the absolute essential. And when governments short-cut the law, it's extremely dangerous."

<title>U.K. union passes resolution banning member visits to Israel </title>
<date>Sat Jun 08 19:33:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The congress of one of the U.K.'s largest trade unions, the GMB, has ordered its members to refrain from visiting Israel and the Palestinian territories on trips organized by the Trade Union Friends of Israel (TUFI), the Jewish Chronicle reported earlier this week.
TUFI is an organization aimed at the promotion of Israeli-Palestinian trade union co-operation and the strengthening of links between Israeli, Palestinian and British trade union movements.
The motion stated that funding for participants of TUFI trips must be stopped since the organization opposes attempts to boycott Israel.
The GMB represents over half a million members, from various sectors.
According to the report, a TUFI spokesman expressed disappointment at the outcome of the vote.
The Jewish Chronicle also reported that in Northern Ireland, a motion to boycott Israel that was put before the its largest union was dropped after the discovery that language used to justify it was misleading. The motion stated that legislation was passed in Israel that would sanction segregation between Jews and Arabs on buses. 
In April, the Teachers Union of Ireland adopted a resolution in support of an academic and cultural boycott of Israel, which the union called an “apartheid state.”

<title>Retired South African diplomat: Israel repeating apartheid</title>
<date>Tue Jun 18 17:05:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The recently retired South African ambassador to Israel has taken a parting shot at the country's treatment of Palestinians, calling it a "replication of apartheid."
Ismail Coovadia made the statement in a letter to pro-Palestinian activists.
In it, Coovadia explained his decision to reject a symbolic gift from the Israeli government — planting trees in his honor in a national park named after South Africa.
He said Israeli policies that discriminate against Palestinians appeared to be reminiscent of his experiences under South Africa's apartheid system. South Africa's post-apartheid government frequently identifies with the Palestinians.
Coovadia, who completed his four-year term in January, confirmed the letter's contents on Tuesday.
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said Coovadia did not made such complaints during his term. Israel routinely rejects the apartheid comparison.

Pet Shop Boys singer defends playing Tel Aviv
Pet Shop Boys singer Neil Tennant defended his band’s decision to play in Israel amid pressure to cancel the June 23 concert. On the British duo’s official website, Tennant wrote on Sunday: “I don’t agree with this comparison of Israel to apartheid-era South Africa. It’s a caricature. Israel has ‏(in my opinion‏) some crude and cruel policies based on defense; it also has universal suffrage and equality of rights for all its citizens both Jewish and Arab. In apartheid-era South Africa, artists could only play to segregated audiences; in Israel anyone who buys a ticket can attend a concert.” The statement came after the British-based pro-Palestinian group Innovative Minds released a poster urging the Pet Shop Boys to boycott Israel by canceling their Tel Aviv show. Headlined “Open your eyes to the reality of apartheid Israel,” the poster showed a photo of the duo wearing sunglasses stamped with the captions “1 child killed every three days” and “2 kids caged every day.”
Anti-Defamation League blasts Alice Walker over ‘fervently anti-Jewish’ book
The Anti-Defamation League on Tuesday issued a statement condemning the Pultizer Prize-winning American author Alice Walker over the “fervently anti-Jewish ideas” it said she expressed in “The Cushion in the Road: Meditation and Wandering as the Whole World Awakens to Being in Harm’s Way,” an essay collection. “Alice Walker has sunk to new lows with essays that remove the gloss of her anti-Israel activism to reveal someone who is unabashedly infected with anti-Semitism,” ADL National Director Abraham Foxman said in the statement. Last year Walker refused to authorize a new Hebrew translation of “The Color Purple,” to protest Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. ‏(Haaretz Staff‏)

<title>Culture Fop / This article is not about Barbra Streisand, Alicia Keys or the Pet Shop Boys</title>
<date>Tue Jun 25 21:04:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Yes, it’s very exciting when big international music stars come to visit. And it’s nail-biting when others exert pressure on them to cancel their shows as a political statement. Then it’s even more thrilling when they publically defend their decision to come anyway.
But this article is not about a certain Funny Girl who did her own little rendition of “Happy Birthday, Mr. President” last week in Jerusalem for a certain nonagenarian.
Neither is this article about a certain Girl on Fire who defied an open letter from a certain Lady in Purple and still plans to come to Tel Aviv in July to sing of a certain “concrete jungle where dreams are made of.”
Nor is this an article about a certain animal- and gay-friendly electronic pop duo that rocked Nokia Stadium on Sunday night and definitively stated that they disagree with the comparison of Israel to apartheid-era South Africa.
This is an article about what’s big in Israeli music news these days, including an epic head-to-head battle of reality TV singing competitions and two legendary bands that dusted off the guitars for a pair of reunion tours.
A pitch-perfect primetime face-off
For nine seasons, the only game in town for reality-TV singing shows was “Kohav Nolad” (“A Star is Born”), the Israeli version of “American Idol.” In the first few years, it produced some actual stars among its winners and runners-up that are still popular today. But, like its American cousin, recent seasons have suffered in the ratings and failed to produce artists that could succeed on their own without the show’s spotlight.
Enter “The Voice,” based on the Dutch format (also adopted in America), which gave “Kohav Nolad’s” 10th season some serious competition and almost single-handedly saved the struggling TV network, Reshet. The second season of “The Voice” just concluded in March.
Now a new kid on the block by the name of “X-Factor” (again, a foreign import) is arriving this summer to duke it out with “Kohav Nolad," setting the stage for an epic battle for viewers that could deal the final blow to the nearly decade-old franchise.
It’s a face-off that also has implications beyond bragging rights: Keshet, the network franchisee behind “Kohav Nolad," and Reshet, which produces the aforementioned “The Voice” and the new “X-Factor," are both dueling on the same channel. This may seem strange to Americans who are used to one channel owning and controlling all of its own programming, but that’s how it works here.
Both Reshet (“Network”) and Keshet (“Rainbow”) share time on Channel 2 – alternating days, in fact – and both are positioning to be the dominant concessionaire. The belters that each put before the microphone in July are singing for more than their supper: they’re soldiers in a fight for the future of Israeli TV.
Blast from the past
Meanwhile, Israeli music lovers are also getting a visit from the 1970s and 1980s, respectively, with reunion tours from the beloved rock groups Kaveret and Mashina.
Kaveret, which is often considered Israel’s first homegrown rock group, launched its first tour in 15 years last week with sold-out shows in front of 8,000 fans at the Israel Festival. It has been 40 years since the release of their first album. Kaveret (“beehive” in Hebrew, though the group is known abroad as “Poogy”), is made up of seven members and was birthed, in its earlier form, in the Israeli Defense Forces.
Mashina, whose brand of rock is a bit harder, as their name suggests and as a band of the '80s and early '90s ought to be, is one of Israel’s most successful and influential bands. They haven’t been away for quite as long a Kaveret but their series of shows in May and June constituted a type of reunion nonetheless.
Naturally, the TV war and the band reboots are related: front-men from each have served as judges on both shows. Like Israeli politics, it seems, nobody ever really disappears from the public eye.
Gidi Gov, the lead singer of Kaveret and one of Israel’s most popular voices, was a judge on “Kohav Nolad” last season, and thus went head-to-head with Mashina members Yuval Banai and Shlomi Braha, who were judges on Season 2 of “The Voice." From battling for viewers on the screen, they’re now trying to edge each other out for bums in the seats.
Back on the boob tube, Keshet and Reshet have been scrambling to get the biggest names in Israeli music behind the judges’ bench of their respective shows.
Gov won’t be returning to judge “Kohav Nolad” this season: He’s been replaced by one of Israel’s top female vocalists, Rita, who joins Mizrahi singer Eyal Golan (who also recently had his own singing competition), “Kohav Nolad’s” former host Zvika Hadar and publicist Rani Rahav.
They’ll rumble against an all-star cast at the ”X-Factor” which includes rocker Ivri Lider, Mizrahi singer Moshe Peretz, “Kohav Nolad” runner-up and apparent defector Shiri Maimon and punk rock pioneer Rami Fortis.
Giving a major boost to that show’s prospects is the addition of MC Bar Refaeli. That’s sure to inspire the troops.

Peace negotiations with the Palestinians will not be easy, Netanyahu told the cabinet on Sunday, but added that he intends to enter the talks honestly and assured them that he won’t compromise on Israel’s security needs.
The timing of the publication of the new EU guidelines to the Israeli settlements enabled Abbas and the Palestinian leadership to return to the negotiations table with Israel, writes Haaretz’s Amira Hass.
The spokeswoman of human rights group B'Tselem was injured during a Friday demonstration at Nabi Saleh after a Border Policeman shot her with a rubber bullet at close range.
Award-winning Indian director Mira Nair has turned down an invitation to be guest of honor at the Haifa Film Festival for political reasons, saying that she would not visit Israel until "Apartheid is over."
Arab members of Knesset are boycotting the formal Iftar dinner at Israel’s parliament to mark the end of the Ramadan fast over the Bedouin relocation plan, which was approved last month.
In hope to start a dialogue with the Arab world, Israel’s Foreign Ministry opened a “virtual embassy” to Gulf states.
Netanyahu’s candidate for Bank of Israel governor, Jacob Frenkel, tries to counter allegations that he stole items from the Hong Kong International Airport duty-free shop in 2006. Frenkel, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase International and former vice chairman of insurer AIG, was already BOI governor until 2000.
Israelis are flocking back to Antalya, the Turkish Mediterranean resort town, after staying away for two years due to soured diplomatic relations between Ankara and Jerusalem following the Gaza flotilla affair, in which nine Turkish citizens died.

<title>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas </title>
<date>Sat Aug 03 13:21:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said last fall that he did not want the “right of return” to Safed, where he was born in 1935 when it was a mixed city in British Mandatory Palestine. “It's my right to see it, but not to live there,” Abbas, whose family fled to Syria in the 1948 war, said in an interview aired on Israeli television in early November.
Many Palestinians were outraged – in Hamas-controlled Gaza, they burned pictures of him. Abbas had to backtrack and explain that these remarks were an expression of his personal feelings and not the position of the Palestinian Authority.
The minor uproar was a window into the quality that makes Abbas, known to most Palestinians as Abu Mazen, an appropriate person for the task of making peace with Israel: pragmatism. At the same time, many say he lacks that hard-to-define quality that Palestinians found in his predecessor, Yasser Arafat: magnetism. Lacking the qualities of a charismatic leader, many Palestinians wonder if will be able to sell his people on the compromises necessary for reaching a permanent solution with Israel. And many Israelis charge that the last time he had an opportunity to move forward with Israel, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a 10-month settlement freeze in 2009, the Palestinian leader simply marched in place.
But Abbas has made it clear on more than one occasion that he thinks the Palestinians should negotiate an end to the conflict, whether directly with Israel or by convincing the UN to recognize Palestine as a state. In December 2004, he called for an end to the violence of the Second Intifada and a return to “peaceful resistance” instead, telling the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that "the use of arms has been damaging and should end." In points of low or no-hope in recent years, he has tried to dampen talk of a third intifada by saying that it is not in the Palestinian interest.
 
"I do not support a return to armed struggle at this point in time. But, at a later date, this could be an option for the Palestinian people," Abbas told the Jordanian newspaper Ad-Dustour in a 2008 interview.  
Leaving the door open for a return to militancy – or terrorism, as the Israeli hawks would have it – is a stance that makes sense to most Arabs, but to most Jews sounds like a threat. In their mistrust of him, Israel’s rightists often point to Abbas’ doctoral dissertation, which he wrote in Soviet Russia. The paper underscores links between the pre-state Zionists and the Nazis. Some argue the paper is form of Holocaust denial, a claim he has flatly rejected. 
Unlike Arafat, who chose for himself the nom de guerre Abu Ammar and wore a handgun on the hip of his paramilitary suit, Abbas has always been viewed as a suit-wearing moderate whose jobs in the PLO involved fundraising and intelligence. (His own nickname, Abu Mazen, simply means father of Mazen, his first son).
Abbas is less adept with short quotes and spin, saving his strength for big oratories like the one he delivered at the United Nations last November, a speech which disappointed Israelis and showed the extent of his despondency with the erstwhile peace process: Nearly every mention of Israel was followed by words such as aggression, bombs, occupation, apartheid or threats. Netanyahu’s office said in a statement following the speech that Abbas' words were "full of dripping venom and false propaganda against the IDF and Israeli citizens,” adding, “This is not how someone who wants peace speaks."
In one part of the speech, however, Abbas declared that his goal was not to put an end to the state of Israel, but to carve out a state for Palestine. “We did not come here seeking to delegitimize a state established years ago, and that is Israel; rather we came to affirm the legitimacy of the State that must now achieve its independence, and that is Palestine,” he said in the speech.
Five years ago this summer, Abbas got into nitty-gritty negotiations with then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who reportedly suggested that Israel would annex about 10 percent of the West Bank – leaving the rest to the Palestinians and compensating them with a land swap, i.e. empty territory inside Israel proper.
According to the Palestine Papers, a series of leaked documents that surfaced in 2011, Olmert presented Abbas with a map but then refused to let him keep it, so Abbas sketched it out on a napkin. This so-called napkin map, the Clinton parameters, and the long-since forgotten “Abu Mazen-Yossi Beilin Document,” an unofficial paper worked out between Abbas and Beilin in October 1995, are among the key chips of institutional memory that the Palestinian president keeps in mind while he waits to see if his negotiators come back from Washington with a promising progress report.

<title>Roger Waters calls on fellow musicians to boycott Israel</title>
<date>Tue Aug 20 14:19:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
British rocker Roger Waters published an open letter calling on fellow musicians to join a boycott of Israel.
The letter, which condemns Israel for apartheid and ethnic cleansing, has been expected for several months, according to the Electronic Intifada, which first reported on its existence.
“I write to you now, my brothers and sisters in the family of Rock and Roll, to ask you to join with me, and thousands of other artists around the world, to declare a cultural boycott on Israel,” Waters wrote in the letter dated Aug. 18. The letter was previously drafted in July.
The former Pink Floyd front man said he was inspired to release the letter after British violinist Nigel Kennedy at a recent promenade concert at the Albert Hall in London called Israel an apartheid state. The BBC said it would remove his remarks in rebroadcasts of the concert.
Waters had told Electronic Intifada in March that he was drafting the letter.
Waters, who has been active in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, or BDS, movement for at least seven years, referred to the boycott of apartheid South Africa, saying that first a trickle of artists refused to play there, leading to a “flood.”
He singled out Stevie Wonder’s canceling of a performance for the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces as a recent success story. Wonder quit his participation in the December fundraiser at the last minute under pressure from many corners.
“Please join me and all our brothers and sisters in global civil society in proclaiming our rejection of Apartheid in Israel and occupied Palestine, by pledging not to perform or exhibit in Israel or accept any award or funding from any institution linked to the government of Israel, until such time as Israel complies with international law and universal principles of human rights,” Waters wrote.
Waters recently came under fire for using at in his concerts a huge inflated balloon in the shape of a wild boar with a prominently visible Star of David, as well as a hammer and sickle, crosses and a dollar sign, among other symbols. It is a gimmick he has used for several years.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday accused Israel of being responsible for the military takeover in Egypt, saying that he has "evidence" that points to Israel's involvement.
British rocker and Pink Floyd founder Roger Waters published an open letter calling on fellow musicians to join a boycott of Israel, condemning the country for apartheid and ethnic cleansing.
A Palestinian was shot and killed overnight Tuesday during clashes with Israel Defense Forces soldiers and Border Patrol officers in the West Bank city of Jenin. Two other Palestinians were wounded.
The chairman of the Yesh Atid faction in the Knesset, MK Ofer Shelah, said on Monday that as part of a peace agreement, East Jerusalem would become the capital of the Palestinian state.
Israel issued a formal apology to Japan over disparaging comments made by the outgoing director-general of the Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs Ministry, Daniel Seaman, on his Facebook page. Earlier this month, Seaman condemned the memorial ceremonies for the victims of the World War II atom bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, saying, “I am sick of the Japanese."
Israeli intelligence says 15 radical groups, some affiliated with al-Qaida, have amassed in the Sinai Peninsula, driving the Shin Bet to form a new unit to thwart attacks on Israel.Israel’s first monument to homosexuals persecuted by the Nazis will be built in central Tel Aviv’s Meir Park (Gan Meir) later this year, near the headquarters of the Gay Center.
The Daily Beast reported Tuesday that the Obama administration has temporarily halted aid to the Egyptian government "while it conducts a broad review of the relationship" between the two countries.

<title>Ahead of Israel show, Tom Jones gets the BDS treatment</title>
<date>Wed Aug 28 04:18:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Tom Jones, who is scheduled to perform in Israel on October 27, is the latest singer to feel the pressure of the BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanction) movement, the Telegraph reported on Tuesday.
Getting the 73-year-old Welsh singer to cancel his scheduled Tel Aviv performance is the aim of a petition titled 'It's Not Unusual To Boycott Apartheid,' which was put together by 'The Cardiff Palestine Solidarity Campaign,' the paper reported, adding that according to its organizers, the petition has attracted over 1,000 signatures.
"People in Wales know you care about human rights and social justice," the letter directed at Jones reads. "We ask you to reconsider and to cancel your performance in Israel, especially as you signed a pledge not to play in South Africa during its apartheid era."
Israel's consulate in New York, in turn, chose to also pun on the singer's signature song in their retort to the effort - a mass email campaign titled "It's Not Unusual To Love Israel," in which pro-Israel activists are urged to besiege Jones with letters supporting his trip, the Telegraph added.
"Over the past few weeks, Tom Jones has become the latest victim of a fringe campaign pushing for a boycott of Israel, which bullies artists and academics from coming to Israel," read the statement, according to the Telegraph. "It is time to tell Tom Jones that no music fan should be punished because of the agenda of online bullies."
Ahead of her July concert in Israel, singer Alicia Keys was similarly urged to cancel. In addition to various pro-Palestinian groups who set up Facebook pages and petitions, reknown American author Alice Walker, a vocal proponent of the BDS movement, published an open letter calling on the singer to cancel her trip. Keys played the concert as planned.

<title>Roger Waters compares Israeli policy to Nazi Germany, slams 'powerful Jewish lobby'</title>
<date>Mon Dec 09 15:13:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
Roger Waters, the legendary former front man of Pink Floyd and outspoken supporter of the BDS movement, has equated Israeli policies to those of Nazi Germany and slammed the "extraordinary" power of the Jewish lobby in the United States.
"The Jewish lobby is extraordinary powerful here and particularly in the industry that I work in, the music industry and in rock’n roll as they say," Waters said in an interview published in the online magazine counterpunch. "I’ve spoken to people who are terrified that if they stand shoulder to shoulder with me they are going to get f-cked."
Waters also said that the Israeli religious establishment's treatment of non-Jews is reminiscent of Germany in the 1930s. Calling the rabbinate "bizarre" and outlandish to the point of disbelief, Waters stated that in their eyes all non-Jews exist "to serve them… they believe that the Indigenous people of the region that they kicked off the land in 1948 and have continued to kick off the land ever since are sub-human."
The growth of the BDS movement should come as no surprise, said Waters, when one realizes "the parallels with what went on in the 30’s in Germany are so crushingly obvious."
Waters explained his calls for a cultural boycott of Israel as a reasonable method of fighting for Palestinian independence. "[T]he occupation, the ethnic cleansing and the systematic racist apartheid Israeli regime is unacceptable… I would not have played for the Vichy government in occupied France in WWII, would not have played in Berlin either during this time. Many people did, back in the day. There were many people that pretended that the oppression of the Jews was not going on. From 1933 until 1946. So this is not a new scenario. Except that this time it’s the Palestinians being murdered."
When asked why many anti-war musicians "do not touch the issue of Palestine," Waters responded by describing the effects of Israel's ''propaganda machine" on the American public opinion. "Netanyahu’s bluster is poured all over the United States, not just Fox but also CNN and in fact in all the mainstream media. It’s like a huge bucket of crap that they are pouring into the mouth of a gullible public in my view, when they say “we are afraid of Iran, it is going to get nuclear weapons…” It’s a diversionary tactic."
The reasoning behind Israel's settlement construction policy, said Waters, "is so transparent that you’d have to have an IQ above room temperature not to understand what is going on."
"The fact of the matter is no Israeli government has been serious about creating a Palestinian state since 1948… They’ve always had the Ben Gurion agenda of kicking all the Arabs out of the country and becoming greater Israel."
In August, the British rocker published an open letter calling on fellow musicians to join a boycott of Israel.
“I write to you now, my brothers and sisters in the family of Rock and Roll, to ask you to join with me, and thousands of other artists around the world, to declare a cultural boycott on Israel.”
In case you were wondering, Waters won't be joining Lady Gaga or Justin Bieber in their upcoming tours to the Holy Land.

<title>How South Africa's apartheid regime saved Israel's defense industry</title>
<date>Tue Dec 10 23:30:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
South Africa under apartheid was the Israeli defense industry’s biggest customer and funded its most ambitious projects. The South Africans were in effect a “captive customer”: The South African army had huge funds at its disposal, but due to the sanctions regime, the West refused to supply it with advanced military systems. Israel, which was cash-starved and suffered international isolation of its own, had no such limitations.
The cooperation reached its peak in the 1980s, which turned out to be apartheid’s dying days. Israel shared with South Africa its technologically advanced systems. Senior officials in the Defense Ministry and Israel Defense Forces had excellent ties with their South African counterparts, led by Defense Minister Magnus Malan, mililtary chief of staff Constand Viljoen and heads of the South African state defense industry.
The largest deal was reportedly signed in the summer of 1988. Israel sold South Africa 60 Kfir combat planes that were no longer in use by the Israel Air Force. These were substantially upgraded and put to use by South Africa’s air force and renamed the Atlas Cheetah. The deal was worth $1.7 billion, an unprecedented sum.
The Atlas Cheetah was portrayed as a project of South Africa’s air force, which was presented as the chief contractor. Israel’s involvement was played down, even though some details were published here and there. In reality, much of the work was carried out in the Lod plant of Israel Aircraft Industries, now known as Israel Aerospace Industries. Work was also done by Israeli firms that supplied subsystems and components.
The deal helped IAI overcome a crisis following the aborted Lavi jet project in the summer of 1987. An IAI facility was converted from a plant that built new aircraft to a plant that upgraded outdated aircraft.
Israeli defense suppliers had already developed a line of products for the Lavi, like radar and electronics systems. After the IDF canceled its orders, these companies hoped to export their products. Two customers were quick to place orders. China bought Israeli technology for its J-10, which was nicknamed the Chinese Lavi. South Africa’s air force opted to purchase the old Kfir combat planes and upgrade them with Lavi systems.
The Kfir was an Israeli version of the French Mirage with a U.S.-made engine. The U.S. administration had the right to veto exports of Kfirs, since selling the engines to a third party required the Americans’ consent. Some 200 Kfir fighters were produced, but they were outdated soon enough, and the IAF wanted to offload them. The South Africans, who feared Soviet and Cuban intervention in the civil war in neighboring Angola, seized the chance to strengthen their air force.
According to foreign sources, the deal with South Africa posed a problem: The United States joined the sanctions regime on apartheid, so there was no chance it would approve the sale of Kfirs with the original engine. IAI and the South Africans found a solution by purchasing French engines that were fitted to the South African version of the Kfir. This completed the circle. The Mirage, which was designed in France and copied by Israel, regained its original engine.
Israel joined the international sanctions in 1987 but announced that it would honor existing arms deals. The Kfir deal was therefore presented as an existing deal. It seems the French, who supplied the engines, used the same excuse.
The most plausible scenario is that the deal was promoted on the Israeli side by then-Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Defense Ministry director general David Ivry, IAI director Moshe Keret, the deputy director of the minstry’s foreign department, Haim Carmon, and the head of the military delegation to Pretoria, Brig. Gen. Hagai Regev.
It’s unclear whether Rabin was present at the signing of the deal in South Africa, or if all meetings were held by lower-level officials. The Defense Ministry celebrated the signing of the agreement but concealed its details, fearing that U.S. pressure would get the deal canceled.
Several weeks after the Kfir deal was signed, IAI boasted another achievement with the launching of the first  Ofek reconnaissance satellite. South African participation in this project was crucial; without funding from the apartheid regime, the project, which was almost shelved for financial reasons, would never have happened.
But these huge projects didn’t save the apartheid regime. In 1991, U.S. pressure forced Israel to halt deals with South Africa, and Yitzhak Shamir’s government was forced to sign a commitment not to export short and midrange missiles. Still, the United States didn’t interfere with the Kfir-Cheetah deal and the jets were made operative by South Africa’s air force until they were replaced several years later.
Ecuador’s air force, which bought some of Israel’s Kfirs, later purchased 10 Cheetahs after South Africa’s air force stopped using them. This was the last roll of the dice in this huge arms deal.

Pope Francis, the first non-European Pope, was named Time Magazine's "Person of the Year". Second place went to whistle-blower Edward Snowden.
Senior officials in U.S. President Barack Obama's administration have admitted to Israeli colleagues that they greatly underestimated the value of the economic sanctions relief reaped by Iran from the Geneva accord. 
South Africa under apartheid was the Israeli defense industry's biggest customer and funded its most ambitious projects. The two were brought together as a product of their respective international isolation. 
In a game of high-stakes power, Ukraine is pitting Russia and the European Union against each other in the bid for Kiev's partnership. 
The Israel Defense Forces pays the Association for the Wellbeing of Israel's Soldiers far more than market rates to cover the rent of lone soldiers. The association says the discrepancy is explained by their coverage of many of the soldiers' ancillary expenses.
Israel inaugurated its first memorial to gay Holocaust victims in Tel Aviv's Meir Park, "in memory of those persecuted by the Nazi regime for their sexual orientation and gender identity." 
Palestinians see a worrisome trend as the number of "honor" killings more than doubled in 2013. According to human rights groups, 27 Palestinian women were killed by male members of their families this year.

<title>Alice Walker urges singer Alicia Keys to cancel July concert in Israel</title>
<date>Wed May 29 23:25:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Alice Walker, renowned American author of “The Color Purple” who made headlines in Israel last year after refusing to authorize a Hebrew translation of her prize-winning book, has published an open letter urging singer Alicia Keys to cancel her scheduled July concert in Israel.
Walker, who is a proponent of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel and participated in the 2011 Gaza Flotilla, says in her letter that although she has never met her, "It would grieve me to know you are putting yourself in danger (soul danger) by performing in an apartheid country that is being boycotted by many global conscious artists."
Invoking the civil rights movement she fought in that the 33-year R&B star is too young to have known personally, Walker calls a boycott of Israel "our only nonviolent option and, as we learned from our own struggle in America, nonviolence is the only path to a peaceful future."
Just days after Alicia Keys confirmed her summer performance in March, the BDS campaign began to kick into gear, and websites, Facebook pages, and petitions urging Keys to cancel her plans to play Tel Aviv started popping up.
In her letter, Walker specifically holds Obama and his administration accountable for Palestinian suffering, and ends the letter by urging Keys to visit Gaza.
"This is actually a wonderful opportunity for you to learn about something sorrowful, and amazing: that our government (Obama in particular) supports a system that is cruel, unjust, and unbelievably evil….Please, if you can manage it, go to visit the children in Gaza, and sing to them of our mutual love of all children, and of their right not to be harmed simply because they exist."

<content>
Alicia Keys said Friday that she plans on going forward with her scheduled July concert in Israel, despite pressure from activists to drop the gig, the New York Times reported.
                
Just days after Alicia Keys confirmed her summer performance in March, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign began to kick into gear, and websites, Facebook pages, and petitions urging Keys to cancel her plans to play Tel Aviv started popping up.
                
Alice Walker, the renowned American author of "The Color Purple" and a proponent of the BDS movement against Israel, has published an open letter urging Keys to cancel the concert.

Responding to the calls to boycott Israel, Keys said Friday to the New York Times:“I look forward to my first visit to Israel. Music is a universal language that is meant to unify audiences in peace and love, and that is the spirit of our show.”

<title>Chief Palestinian negotiator: Two-state solution has a chance under Kerry's efforts</title>
<date>Mon May 20 23:26:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The top Palestinian negotiator with Israel on Monday threw his weight behind U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's bid to revive stalled peace talks, while describing the situation in the West Bank as apartheid worse than that suffered in South Africa.
Kerry is due to visit Jerusalem and Ramallah on Thursday and Friday. U.S.-brokered peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel broke down in 2010 in a dispute over continuing Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank. Israeli President Shimon Peres is expected to meet Kerry, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and Jordanian King Abdullah II in the Jordanian Dead Sea on Sunday, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Haaretz has learned..Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told a UN committee in New York on Monday that a settlement freeze and the release of Palestinian prisoners were not conditions for returning to negotiations, but rather obligations that Israel must fulfill.
"We have no conditions to resume negotiations," Erekat told the committee on rights of the Palestinian people, which was created by the UN General Assembly in 1975.
"Make no mistake we are exerting every possible effort in order to see that Mr. Kerry succeeds. No one benefits more from the success of Secretary Kerry than Palestinians and no one loses more from his failure than Palestinians," Erekat said.
He said that in the past two months Kerry had met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas five times, Erekat three times and that the three spoke by phone almost weekly.
"Mr. Kerry is keeping things (close to) his chest. He likes to work very, very, very below the radar and grow things like mushrooms," Erekat said. "We did everything ... in order to enable him to succeed. He is not going to wait for years or months actually, he's working very hard."
Palestinians seek to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza, where about 2.7 million Palestinians live, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Some 500,000 Israelis have settled in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Chance for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected any Israeli return to the lines that existed before Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, calling those boundaries indefensible.
"Today in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem ... I can sum up the situation with one word - apartheid. Worse than that which existed in South Africa," Erekat said. "Today Israel justifies its apartheid by the term security."
Israel's UN mission was not immediately available for comment on Erekat's briefing to the UN committee.
Erekat said the Palestinians had finished preparation to join a raft of international bodies, such as the International Criminal Court, but would not act yet in order to give Kerry and President Barack Obama "a chance" to pursue Middle East peace.
"We want to give a chance to all nations who have a common denominator of achieving two states on the 1967 lines," Erekat said. "There is a chance, there is a good opportunity now."
If the Palestinians were to join the ICC, they could file complaints with the court accusing Israel of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious crimes.
The Palestinians are able to apply to join the ICC and other international bodies after the 193-nation UN General Assembly approved the de facto recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine on Nov. 29.
It was a diplomatic setback for the United States and Israel, which were joined by only a handful of countries in voting against upgrading the Palestinian Authority's observer status to "non-member state" from "entity," like the Vatican.

<title>Desmond Tutu urges UEFA to strip Israel of Under-21 championship games</title>
<date>Wed May 29 14:43:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
South African anti-apartheid campaigner Desmond Tutu has joined calls for UEFA to move the Under-21 European soccer championship from Israel because of the the state's treatment of Palestinian sport.
UEFA has resisted the requests but Tutu's letter, to Britain's Guardian newspaper, which was also signed by ex-Mali striker Frederic Kanoute and a number of prominent sympathizers of the Palestinian cause, is aimed at increasing the pressure.
Last week UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino, speaking after the UEFA Congress in London, refused to condemn Israel or accept that the competition, which runs from June 5-18, should be moved.
Infantino told a news conference: "UEFA and the Israeli FA is responsible for football, it cannot be held responsible for the politics of a national government.
"And we have no plans to move the tournament, which is being held legitimately in a UEFA member association."
After last week's Congress, pro-Palestine demonstrators broke into a banquet being held for UEFA delegates, interrupting proceedings, but were removed by security officers.
Palestinians complain that Israeli authorities restrict the movement of their athletes between the Gaza Strip, which is ruled by the Islamist Hamas faction that calls for Israel's destruction, and the Israeli-occupied West Bank in which Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah group exercises limited civilian rule.
Israel limits the movement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to the West Bank citing security concerns but says it has eased travel for athletes.
UEFA, European soccer's governing body, last week agreed tougher sanctions to combat racism among players and officials and the authors of the letter feel the same standards should be applied to Israel.
Tutu's letter read: "On Friday, delegates from European football associations gathered in a London hotel for UEFA's annual congress. They agreed new, strict guidelines to deal with racism, suggesting a commendable determination to combat discrimination in the sport.
"We find it shocking that this same organization shows total insensitivity to the blatant and entrenched discrimination inflicted on Palestinian sportsmen and women by Israel.
"We call on UEFA, even at this late stage, to reverse the choice of Israel as a venue."
The Israeli FA has consistently said that UEFA will not bring political issues into the soccer arena.
Tutu, 81, the former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for standing up against white-minority rule in South Africa.
He played a pivotal role in the downfall of apartheid and subsequently worked to heal wounds in South Africa's traumatized society.

<title>Ireland teachers' union brands Israel 'apartheid state,' calls for boycott </title>
<date>Sun Apr 07 18:45:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The Teachers Union of Ireland has adopted a resolution in support of an academic and cultural boycott of Israel, which the union called an “apartheid state.”
The motion, passed unanimously on April 4 during the union’s annual congress, calls for “all members to cease all cultural and academic collaboration with Israel, including the exchange of scientists, students and academic personalities, as well as all cooperation in research programs,” according to a report on the website of the Center for Research of Globalization.
Gerry Quinn, the union’s vice president, seconded the motion for a call to boycott Israel.
David Harris, the executive director of the American Jewish Committee, said in a statement that the Irish teachers’ action “undermines the cause of Israeli-Palestinian peace by singling out, unfairly and without reference to the facts, one side in the conflict for targeting and isolation.”

<title>Opposition slams 'draconian restrictions' on marriage rights //Israel extends law restricting unification of citizens with spouses from 'enemy states' - National</title>
<date>Sun Apr 14 16:37:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet decided unanimously on Sunday to extend the Citizenship Law restricting the "family reunification" of Israeli citizens with certain foreign partners for an additional year.
                
The law denies entry or living permits to partners who are considered a security threat, among them Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, and citizens of enemy countries or from areas involved in long-term conflict with Israel. The law affects mainly Israeli Arab citizens and their families from the West Bank and Gaza.
                
The proposal brought before the cabinet on Sunday was submitted by Interior Minister Gideon Sa'ar, and was formulated based on a Shin Bet opinion regarding the volatility of partners from the Gaza Strip.
                
Meretz party head Zahava Gal-On slammed the decision as placing "draconian restrictions on Israeli Arab citizens' right to marry," calling the designation of all Palestinians as a security threat "racist" and discriminatory.
                
Gal-On, who petitioned the High Court against the Citizenship Law, said that "the only correct way is to individually evaluate everyone asking for family unification." She added that the government's approach was preventing thousands of people who live in Israel from attaining citizenship and achieving social rights.
                
Palestinian official Saeb Erekat called the law "racist" and an attempt to "distort the Palestinian social fabric and force the displacement of Palestinian families." He called on the international community to “seriously examine the pattern of Israeli policies contributing to a situation of apartheid and to look into the wider effects and implications of the Israeli government’s precondition of being recognized as a Jewish State.”
                
Israel generally grants citizenship to spouses of Israelis in a gradual process. In the spirit of this process, a similar process was instituted for the naturalization of spouses of permanent residents, though the process is a little longer. A 2002 temporary order excluded Palestinian spouses from these processes and barred them from becoming Israeli citizens.
                
In May 2006, the High Court rejected numerous petitions asking to overturn the Citizenship Law. However, most of the justices wrote that the law constitutes a violation of basic rights, mainly the right to a family life.
                
In March 2007, in a hearing surrounding later petitions against the law, the state said that an amended version of the temporary order was expected to be approved by the Knesset, and the court consequently ruled that the petitioners would have to revise their petitions in accordance with the amended orders after they were made public. After the hearing, the amended law was made public, and the petitioners maintained that the new version not only extended the validity of the law until July 2008, it also expanded the geographic jurisdiction of the law, making it applicable to spouses from Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq as well as other areas on which the government was free to decide.
                
Arabs make up about 20 percent of Israel's population of 7 million. About 3 million Palestinians live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Many families were divided by cease-fire lines after wars, and over the years, marriage between the two groups has been common.
                
Since 1993, more than 100,000 Palestinians have obtained Israeli permits in this manner and some Israelis see this as a security threat.

<title>Israeli security forces brace for Palestinian protests</title>
<date>Fri Mar 01 07:15:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
	Palestinian protests, mainly over the issue of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, are expected to resume on Friday with both organized and spontaneous marches throughout the West Bank and Jerusalem.
	In Jerusalem, demonstrations in support of the prisoners are slated to take place Friday morning at the Old City’s Damascus Gate and the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound on the Temple Mount. On Thursday, messages went sent to Palestinians’ cell phones urging all of them, and especially young people, to participate in the protests.
	In the West Bank, the main focus of activity will be the weekly march in Bili’in. Hundreds of people are also expected to demonstrate near the village of Salfit. Confrontations with Israeli soldiers may erupt at checkpoints, especially the Qalandiyah checkpoint near Jerusalem and the checkpoint near the Ofer army base.
	A demonstration is also planned in Hebron to commemorate the anniversary of Baruch Goldstein’s massacre of 29 Muslim worshippers at the Cave of the Patriarchs in 1994. The demonstration was organized by the Committee to Protect Hebron, the Popular Campaign Against the Fence and the city’s left-wing politicians. The Palestinians will be joined by Jewish and Arab activists from the left-wing group Hithabrut-Tarabut.
	“Hebron isn’t only subject to foreign occupation, but also to a racist regime of separation in the service of the settlers,” said Johayna Saifi of Hithabrut-Tarabut. “This separation regime expanded following the massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs and became even more severe after the outbreak of the second intifada [in 2000]. It makes the residents’ lives a living hell and paralyzes the heart of the city. At the same time, the city of Hebron – one of the most important economic centers in the territories – is strangled by a system of checkpoints that cuts it off from all its surroundings. In Hebron, apartheid rules, and we’re coming to the city in order to fight it.”
	“It’s clear to us,” said Hisham Sharabati of the Committee to Protect Hebron, “that the settlers are the long arm of the occupation, and cooperation with them by the army and police isn’t accidental, it’s part of the process of settlement and dispossession.”
	Over the past week, discontent in the West Bank had simmered into violence after a Palestinian detainee, Arafat Jaradat, died in Megiddo Prison on Saturday. According to Israel Jaradat died of a heart attack, but the Palestinians allege that he died of torture in the hand of Israeli security personnel.

<title>Palestinians warn of 'apartheid state' if Netanyahu wins Israeli election </title>
<date>Sat Jan 19 18:53:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
	The Palestinian president warned on Friday that Benjamin Netanyahu's expected victory in next week's election could lead to an Arab-majority country that will eventually replace what is now Israel – unless he pursues a more moderate path of a two-state solution to the conflict.
	Mohammed Ishtayeh, a top aide to Abbas, said that the president has been warning that Israel could end up with "an apartheid-style state, similar to the one of former South Africa."
	Israeli backers of creation of a Palestinian state say relinquishing control of the Palestinian territories and its residents is the only way to ensure Israel's future as a democracy with a Jewish majority.
	If that does not happen, Ishtayeh said, "we Palestinians will be the majority and will struggle for equality. He added that Abbas has told the Israelis that "there are Palestinians who are now calling for the one-state solution, because they no longer [consider] the two-state solution viable."
	President Abbas has been careful not to intervene in Tuesday's Israeli election, but it is no secret that the Palestinians hope that Netanyahu will either be ousted or at least soften his position in a new term. He has shown no sign of doing so, and opinion polls showing hardline, pro-settlement parties well ahead days ahead of the vote have led to a sense of despair among the Palestinians.
	During Netanyahu's current term, the Israeli leader has pressed forward with construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The international community considers settlement construction illegal or illegitimate. And the Palestinians have refused to negotiate with Netanyahu while he continues to allow settlements to be built, saying it is a sign of bad faith.
	Abbas's office said the Palestinian president spoke with multiple leaders in 2012 from Israel's centrist opposition, including lawmakers from the Labor, Kadima and Meretz parties, along with mayors, university professors and social activists. He said a mayor from Netanyahu's Likud Party was among them.
	Labor parliamentarian Daniel Ben-Simon told the AP he met with Abbas in Ramallah recently and was warned that time is running out for a two-state solution.	"Abbas said the two-state solution benefits both nations but he warned that if there is no two-state solution within the next two or three years then it won't be practical anymore," Ben-Simon said. "Abbas told me explicitly ... the idea of a one-state solution is escalating among Palestinians."
	Palestinian officials have been closely following the Israeli election campaign, fearing Netanyahu's ambitious plans for settlement construction over the next four years could prove lethal to their dreams of a state, Ishtayeh said. More than 500,000 Israelis already live in settlements that dot the West Bank and ring east Jerusalem, the Palestinians' hoped-for capital.
	Some in Abbas' circle are holding out hope that U.S. President Barack Obama will re-engage in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and, freed from domestic electoral considerations in his second term, get tougher with Netanyahu on settlements. Another aide, Nabil Shaath, suggested Europe is ready to jump in with its own peace plan if Washington is not.
	But short of trying to rally international opinion, it seems Abbas can do little if Netanyahu wins Tuesday.
	Israeli polls indicate that a majority of seats in Israel's 120-member parliament will go to right-wing, pro-settler or Jewish ultra-Orthodox religious parties. Likud is the largest among them. Netanyahu could comfortably form a coalition government with these parties, seen as his natural ideological allies. Likud's new slate of candidates is headed by hard-line lawmakers who oppose territorial concessions to the Palestinians, and a likely coalition partner, the pro-settler Jewish Home, even advocates annexing large chunks of the West Bank. Even if Netanyahu adds a centrist party to the mix, he's unlikely to shift course from the pro-settler policies of his current government.
	Under Netanyahu, construction reportedly began on nearly 6,900 settlement homes in the West Bank.
	That's a bit less than what was started by Netanyahu's predecessor Ehud Olmert, but many of the new homes are deeper in the West Bank, the Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now said this week. Thousands more apartments are in various stages of planning, Peace Now said, predicting an "explosion" of settlement construction in coming years.
	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his position on settlements Friday in an interview with Channel 1 TV.
	"I don't believe that settlements are the root of the conflict, I don't believe that territorial dimensions are the root of the conflict; the root of the conflict was and remains the refusal to recognize the Jewish state within any border," Netanyahu said. "I am not in favor of a binational state. We need to reach a solution. I don't want to rule the Palestinians and I don't want them to rule us and threaten our existence."
	"We believe the two-state solution is still possible, but Netanyahu and his current and upcoming coalition are killing this solution, they ... will be intensifying the buildings in the settlements, and they have no peace platform," Ishtayeh said.	The conflict with the Palestinians has largely been missing from Israeli political discourse this campaign season in Israel. The centrist Labor Party, which led peace talks with the Palestinians in the past, has shifted almost exclusively to domestic concerns, such as growing income gaps.
	Just one party, Hatnuah, led by former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, has focused on peace talks. Livni has warned that Israel's existence could be threatened without a peace accord, yet her message has not gained much traction.
	Palestinians believe hopes for their state are slipping further away with each new settlement home, and that partition of the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River may soon no longer be possible.
	Settlements are at the core of the paralysis in peace efforts talks since late 2008. Netanyahu refuses to freeze construction, rebuffing Abbas who says there is no point in negotiating while settlements steadily gobble up more of the occupied lands.	The standoff is likely to continue, though the Palestinians believe their diplomatic leverage has improved.
	In November, the UN General Assembly recognized a state of Palestine in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem. The vote, while largely symbolic, affirmed the 1967 frontier which the Palestinians want to be the base line for future border talks. Netanyahu, while willing to negotiate, won't accept the 1967 lines as a point of reference and wants to keep all of Jerusalem and parts of the West Bank.	Some Palestinian officials hope Obama will now be tougher with Netanyahu after what they considered a disappointing first term.
	The Americans "keep talking about negotiations and the need to restart the negotiations," Shaath said. "But what is needed is for the U.S. to pressure Israel to stop settlement activities and to go to real negotiations, to reach an agreement within six months."

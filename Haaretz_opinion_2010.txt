<title>1932 is already here </title>

Sebastian Haffner was a young lawyer in Germany in 1932. As a non-Jew, Haffner could have continued to further his career in the civil service. In describing the atmosphere in his country before the takeover by the Nazi dictatorship, he wrote that "the game dragged on tedious and gloomy, without high spots, without drama, without obvious decisive moments ... what was no longer to be found was pleasure in life, amiability, fun, understanding goodwill, generosity and a sense of humor .... The air in Germany had rapidly become suffocating."
Haffner chose to leave Germany. If he were to visit the neighborhoods of south Tel Aviv, Bnei Brak, Safed, Jerusalem or Bat Yam in late 2010, he would certainly recall those hard days in his homeland. He would find rabbis who sign racist manifestos against an ethnic minority and call for a policy of apartheid, fiery demonstrations against refugees from Africa, gangs of teens attacking Arabs, legislation promoting separatism and discrimination in racist and ethnic contexts, an oppressive public atmosphere, as well as violence and a lack of compassion toward people who are different and foreign.
Haffner would mainly warn against the anemic response of political institutions whose weakness and fears in 1933 led to a political reversal that could have been avoided. Of course, most Israelis do not see themselves as racist. The fact that half of Israel's Jewish population would not want to live next to Arabs is given various excuses, as is the popular and sweeping support of initiatives designed to keep Arabs or Africans from living alongside Jews. But only a few people who give those excuses would be willing to openly state that they support ethnic and racial separation.
The wild propagandists of the right like MK Michael Ben Ari  (National Union ) do not hesitate to use imagery and explanations taken from the anti-Semitic lexicon of Europe: Foreigners spread disease and take Jewish women; black refugees are violent criminals who endanger public safety.
This horrific propaganda is terrifying poor population groups who are already living with an infinite number of problems of survival. And the people who espouse this propaganda are persuading themselves that keeping foreigners out and racial separation produce hope for a solution to their problems. The historian Saul Friedlander defined this mood in Germany of the 1930s as "redemptive anti-Semitism." A society in existential confusion lacking a political direction that gave it hope was swept up by an apocalyptic idea at whose heart was the need to keep Jews out; if not, the nation's existence would come to an end.
Millions of people in Germany who would not have defined themselves as anti-Semites and certainly not as Nazis were swept up in the messianic and pseudo-religious public atmosphere. Israel today is becoming slowly and increasingly swept up in "redemptive xenophobia." To an increasing number of Israelis, the Arab, the African refugee and people who are foreign in their religion, skin color or nationality are considered the most serious problem society has to solve on the road to tranquillity.
No society is immune to deterioration into violent racism. In the Israel of today, we can observe quite a few conditions whose presence in other societies and among other peoples led to racial separation, ethnic cleansing and even genocide. There are minority groups  (Arabs and foreigners ) who are ostracized by the majority, a growing racist ideology, attempts to limit the political activities and civil rights of the minority, a tense security situation and strong political elements with vested interests in territorial expansion.
But this is not an edict from heaven. The task of responsible leadership is to stop this dangerous process. Benjamin Netanyahu frequently uses the imagery of 1938 regarding the international community's attitude toward the Iranian nuclear threat. Back then, at the last moment before the world descended into a horrific bloody war, the democratic powers could have stopped Hitler, but they stuttered.
Netanyahu must understand that the domestic reality in Israel today is 1932, and his pallid speech calling on people not to take the law into their own hands cannot extricate Israeli society from the xenophobic and intolerant atmosphere that has spread. For this, a move of an entirely different magnitude is required.

<title>A condition for peace </title>
<date>Tue Sep 07 01:29:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
In light of the Palestinians' acceptance of a land swap, the battle over the construction freeze in the settlements is not a struggle for their very existence, since most of them and their residents will be annexed to Israel in any agreement. The battle over the construction freeze is a battle for perception in Israel and abroad - between Greater Israel on the one hand and two states for two peoples on the other. So this battle is important for the existence of the diplomatic process.
Those who favor a Greater Israel have discovered that the assessment by former prime minister Yitzhak Shamir that half a million Israelis in the territories are enough to create an irreversible reality is not coming true. They have discovered that international opinion does not consider the West Bank part of Israel.
In addition, Israel showed that in exchange for peace with Egypt it could evacuate settlements. Those who favor a Greater Israel also understand that another outpost and another neighborhood will not change the West Bank's demographic balance. But they are convinced that as long as the construction process continues, the situation on the ground reduces the chance of dividing the country.
The defense minister has refused to recognize that. He used to justify granting building permits in the territories by saying it makes no difference where and how much construction goes on because the moment the border is agreed on, everyone will know the law. But if Menachem Begin froze construction before the peace treaty with Egypt, the same should be done after negotiations have gone on for 17 years and the number of Israelis living outside the settlement blocs has grown from 20,000 to 120,000.
Another declaration by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about a freeze, if it comes, will be more meaningful than Yitzhak Rabin's declaration in 1992 about "drying up" the settlements. At the time the subject was a change in national priorities, without mentioning a Palestinian state. Last year, when the Americans proposed building only in the settlement blocs, Netanyahu refused. He included United Torah Judaism and Shas voters in Beitar Ilit and Modi'in Ilit in the freeze to guarantee that those parties would also apply pressure for a renewal of construction in the West Bank, counter-pressure to the American pressure.
But now the "blocs" compromise means Netanyahu will be forced to turn the settlement enterprise, whose goal is to create a reality and perception of one state, into one that serves the idea of two states by determining a de facto border for Israel between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River.
Is Netanyahu blind to the light that ministers Ehud Barak, Dan Meridor, Michael Eitan and others have been able to see: that the settlement enterprise, which has expanded by 200,000 people since the Oslo Accords, is leading to a situation where more Israelis prefer no negotiations for fear of a civil war? That ever more people prefer democracy for Jews only, even if the world calls it apartheid? That more people sanctify settlement everywhere in the country, even if the result is a state with an Arab majority? That more Palestinians believe that their willingness to make do with a state in only part of Palestine is not relevant because we are trying to "Judaicize" that part too? That more Palestinians are convinced that the diplomatic path has failed and that the idea of resistance will reunify the Palestinians? That more people in the world believe that Israel is a factor harming regional and world stability and are questioning its legitimacy?
Netanyahu must realize that declarations and deeds are intertwined, in an honest attempt to achieve a solution. There is no point in dreaming about peace without creating the conditions for achieving it.

<title>And what happens in our community? </title>
<date>Sun May 02 11:35:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 
The headlines have screamed racism and discrimination. The segregation of Ashkenazi and Sephardi girls at the Beit Yaakov school in the West Bank settlement of Immanuel is indeed disgraceful and outrageous, while the apartheid in the ultra-Orthodox community as a whole engenders disgust. It starts with the deep arrogance toward the non-Jew that is embedded in Jewish religious law, and continues with racism toward Jews of Middle Eastern descent. Our shock as secular Jews over what's happening in places like Immanuel and Bnei Brak is justified and well-founded.
Having said that, let's take a look at some of our own enlightened, secular Ashkenazim. With us, it's not a matter of blatant, official discrimination as it is among the Haredim. We have no litmus test on admissions policies based on ethnic origin, we have nothing that resembles rabbinical segregation. Still, this should not be a source of pride.
The school in Immanuel is not admitting girls of Sephardi origin? This is a horrible thing. But what about the Israel Prize? Let's recall the ceremony that took place a few days ago: Almost all the recipients and presenters were Ashkenazi. It was once, and justifiably, dubbed the Israelovich Prize. Of the 158 prize laureates in cultural fields over the years, only 10 have been of Sephardi origin. And the picture isn't any better among the more than 600 laureates in all categories. True, no one decided to shut out Sephardim from this honor; no one imposed an ethnic admissions requirement as the rabbis have. On occasion, token Sephardim even win a prize - generally unknown rabbis in the category of Jewish thought - but the results speak for themselves.
Covert secular discrimination is sometimes more serious than blatant ultra-Orthodox discrimination, which is devoid of our purist rules of order. Open discrimination spawns opposition and outrage. But covert (and therefore more restrained) discrimination doesn't spark any protest.
Since the 1950s, they have been telling us that there is no discrimination; that soon we won't even know who's Ashkenazi and who's Sephardi; that the Israeli army is our melting pot. True, at one time the heads of the Labor Movement didn't hesitate to openly spout sickening racist statements, of the sort no one would dare utter today. In the 1950s, the enlightened statesman Abba Eban wrote that we needed to instill a Western spirit in them (meaning the Sephardim) and not let them drag us into their  unnatural Middle Eastern ways.
Andre Azoulay, a senior adviser to the king of Morocco, is convinced to this day that Moroccan Jews were brought to Israel only to provide cheap labor and serve as human shields in border regions. He points to comments by prime minister David Ben-Gurion and former World Jewish Congress president Nahum Goldmann that attest to this. In Israel, Azoulay's wife was also once told: "You don't look Moroccan." Every time I meet this impressive man, who has had such an amazing career, I can't help asking myself (and him): What would he have become if he had immigrated to Israel? The secretary of the workers' council in Dimona, where his cousins live? Or perhaps a textile worker, like them?
And what about another individual, who did immigrate to Israel from Morocco, Amir Peretz? He's one of Israel's most decent politicians and among the few who possess a worldview. He was doubtless the object of ridicule (either openly or secretly) from his first day as defense minister because of his ethnic background.
There is no discrimination, we claim, yet our entire political, economic, legal, academic and even military leadership is made up of Ashkenazim, with a smattering of Sephardim as the exceptions that so remarkably prove the rule. And the rule is that, even 62 years after its establishment, Israel is run by an ethnically pure elite. True, we did have two presidents of Sephardi origin, but there's no way they could have been Moroccan Jews, who until recently comprised the largest ethnic community in the country. We have had two or three Sephardi army chiefs of staff and there are already a few major generals, a bank head or two, but not one prime minister. Who's counting, though? Equality reins.
Equality reins? In looking at employment conditions, the situation is even worse. If in 1975 Sephardim earned on average 79 percent of the Ashkenazi wage, in 1992 that figure was down to 68 percent. According to studies that have not been updated, closing the educational gap between the two communities will take another 75 years. Prisons are full of Sephardim, while universities, where only about 7 percent of faculty are Sephardi, are much less so. But why do we need statistics? Let's ask ourselves honestly how many of the people who appear on television every day are Sephardi, and how many of the people who shape our fate are.
We cluck our tongues over Immanuel and the Haredim, but let's take a good look at ourselves first.

<title>Appeasing high risk groups can prove deadly</title>
<date>Sun Jan 03 01:10:19 IST 2010</date>
<content>
There is apartheid in the Middle East on the roads, too. Steps are taken to separate people according to their religion. It's a phenomenon that has escaped the notice of Jimmy Carter, Condoleezza Rice, Richard Goldstone and Scandinavian politicians, but it's there, white letters on a green background on traffic signs in Saudia Arabia. You can see it on highways leading to Mecca on which only Muslims can travel. Other drivers and passengers, impure heretics as they may be, are barred from using them. Out of revulsion they are relegated to another road.  
Limitations on Palestinians using Route 443 through the West Bank do not constitute apartheid, in the opinion of Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch. The elation of opponents of the limitations regarding the High Court of Justice's decision last week doesn't reflect the full text of the court opinion. The court in fact confirmed, not rejected, the security rationale at the basis of the prohibitions imposed nine years ago when terrorism struck.  
The Israel Defense Forces is being required to update its policies to conform with the calm on the highway since it stamped out terrorism. The 40 army vehicles a day that currently use the road from nearby Arab villages are not enough. A rate of 80 vehicles, the IDF's updated proposal, is also not enough. A further increase in the number and the installation of checkpoints are expected to satisfy the court. The principle of limiting traffic was not invalidated, only the way it is implemented on the ground.  
Route 443 from the Tel Aviv area to Jerusalem was partly built on the Arab side of the Green Line, as was Highway 1 to Jerusalem in the Latrun area. But this doesn't impede opponents of the occupation from putting their personal convenience in traveling between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem before the trouble of plodding along the old highway used prior to the Six-Day War. The shock absorber attached to their morality is exposed as more effective than the car.  
It's good that there is public and legal supervision of the authorities so they don't act arbitrarily, or in a manner that is biased or discriminates based on religion, nationality, race or gender. (I'm going to snitch here: There is an establishment at the Tel Aviv Port open to women only. Men who try to get in are turned away.) On the other hand, the pendulum can swing the other way and endanger lives, through the mad American logic that gave preference to Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's right to fly to Detroit over the safety of the hundreds of his fellow passengers on Northwest Airlines Flight 253.  
That is the dissembling, idiotic approach of Democratic U.S. administrations: Bill Clinton and his attorney general, Janet Reno, and Barack Obama and his attorney general, Eric Holder, who was previously Reno's deputy. With Clinton's blessing, Reno imposed a separation between intelligence collected on terrorism suspects by agencies such as the CIA and the law enforcement of the FBI. The result became apparent on September 11, 2001. Holder, who with Obama's support ordered a criminal investigation against CIA staff accused of harming terror suspects after September 11, is encouraging a mindset that prevented Abdulmutallab from being put on a no-fly list barring his entry into the United States.  
Holder, Rice and Obama, as well as Carter and Clinton, who were both governors of southern states before becoming president, have copied a simplistic notion of the civil rights struggle involving American blacks and implemented it in U.S. foreign and defense policy. Racist white mayors and state troopers harassing innocent black pedestrians and motorists? That's exactly what Muslims on Flight 253 and Palestinians on Route 443 must be spared, even if the world blows up.  
The intrusive inconvenience to those belonging to high-risk groups, meaning those who create risks and not those exposed to them, should create a measure of deterrence and difficulty for terrorists. The price of misguided lenience in the other direction is much higher.

<title>Are Israel and apartheid South Africa really different?</title>
<date>Mon Jan 04 01:09:26 IST 2010</date>
<content>
The day after the murder of the settler Meir Hai about 10 days ago, Major General (res.) Amos Gilad was asked to comment on the claim by settlers that the attack was able to take place because roadblocks had been lifted on West Bank roads. The security-political coordinator at the Defense Ministry told his radio interviewer that the policy of thinning out internal roadblocks has greatly contributed to the West Bank's impressive economic growth. According to Gilad, who until recently was coordinator of activities in the territories, the improvement of the Palestinians' economic lot has contributed substantially to Israelis' security.  
An army man, who is not suspected of belonging to a human rights organization, thus upsets the simplistic and most accepted formula: restrictions on Arabs means more security for Jews. The Supreme Court ruling last week to lift the ban on Palestinians using Route 443 shows that members of the judiciary also no longer stand at attention when they hear the magic word security. Nonetheless, the judiciary members, like politicians and the media, still find it hard to let go of their paralyzing dependency on this term. This is intentional: If discrimination is not mandated by security considerations stemming from the threat of Palestinian terrorism, how can we diagnose this regime as segregationist? If it is not diagnosed as such, there is no need to treat it.  
The Association for Civil Rights in Israel, which appealed against the ban on Route 443, dared suggest the word apartheid and was reprimanded for it. In her ruling, Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch wrote that "the great difference between the security means adopted by the State of Israel for defense against terrorist attacks and the unacceptable practices of the policy of apartheid requires that any comparison or use of this grave term be avoided." A similar argument was voiced during the days of Israel's military administration over its Arab citizens, which was lifted in 1966, and which is today considered a dark period in the country's history.  
Beinisch herself is a co-author of about a dozen rulings that exposed the malicious use of the segregation regime in an effort to take over Palestinian land. In some cases, most notably one concerning the separation fence near Bil'in, she wrote that the invasive route set by the army was inferior from a security point of view to the route proposed by experts at the Council for Peace and Security. In another case the state admitted that the person in charge of planning the fence did not inform government lawyers that the route had been adjusted to the blueprint for expanding the settlement of Tzofin. Were it not for human rights organizations and conscientious lawyers, who would prevent shortsighted politicians from annexing more and more territory "for security against terrorism"? asked Beinisch.  
One of the myths among whites in South Africa was that "blacks want to throw us into the sea." Many of apartheid's practices were formally based on security, mostly those involving restrictions on movement. Thus, for example, at a fairly early stage, black citizens needed permits to move around the country. During the final years of apartheid, when the blacks' struggle intensified as did terrorism, its practices became more severe.  
To avoid the rude word apartheid, Beinisch pulled out the well-known argument that apartheid is "a policy of segregation and discrimination based on race and ethnicity, which is based on a series of discriminatory practices designed to achieve the superiority of a certain race and oppress those of other races." Indeed, systematic segregation (apartheid) and discrimination in South Africa were meant to preserve the supremacy of one race over others.  
In Israel, on the other hand, institutional discrimination is meant to preserve the supremacy of a group of Jewish settlers over Palestinian Arabs. As far as discriminatory practices are concerned, it's hard to find differences between white rule in South Africa and Israeli rule in the territories; for example, separate areas and separate laws for Jews and Palestinians.  
Last Wednesday, Israeli policemen blocked the main road linking Nablus and Tul Karm. Dozens of taxis with Palestinian workers on their way home from another day on the job in the settlements were told to park on the side of the road. Cars with yellow license plates passed by. There was no roadblock for security inspections; it was just the memorial ceremony for Rabbi Meir Hai. Just as long as they do not say that there is apartheid.

<title>A retractionist-retentionist discourse </title>
<date>Fri Feb 12 02:11:12 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In his keynote address at last week's Herzliya Conference, Ehud Barak summoned up the most dramatic case for changing the status quo: "If, and as long as between the Jordan and the sea, there is only one political entity, named Israel, it will end up being either non-Jewish or non-democratic ... If the Palestinians vote in elections, it is a binational state, and if they don't, it is an apartheid state."  
This quote is particularly remarkable for the specific wording chosen by Israel's defense minister: He (perhaps unintentionally) suggested that the existing situation could already be described as apartheid.  
Considering the Labor Party's collapse, one may dismiss its leader's comments, but Barak's speech does matter, not because of its author, but because it articulates the core narrative of the centrist-pragmatic trend in Israeli-Jewish politics - from Likud realists like ministers Dan Meridor and Michael Eitan, to Kadima and the remnants of Labor and Meretz. Let's call it the "retractionist camp" - ready to support a withdrawal from the occupied territories that meets the minimum necessary requirement for the creation of a dignified and viable sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel, and therefore a sustainable two-state solution.  
They show realist tendencies, but there is a powerful disconnect (one that was pervasive in Barak's speech) between most of this camp's diagnosis of the situation (an "end of the world as we know it" threat of apartheid or binationalism) and their prescription for addressing it: resume negotiations, blame the Palestinians, more of the same. It's like telling someone they have life-threatening yet treatable cancer and prescribing two aspirins a day.  
If the situation is so dire, then bolder steps are surely called for. There are any number of game-changing options to consider. Maybe it is possible to engage Hamas (as is happening in the ongoing Shalit negotiations), to lift the Gaza siege, and to accept Palestinian unity instead of vetoing it, so as to facilitate an empowered negotiating and implementing address. After all, Israel spoke to the PLO before its charter was amended, and the United States engaged Sunni ex-insurgents in Iraq and is encouraging dialogue with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Alternatively, Israel could encourage internationalization of the conflict, handing the territories over to an international protectorate and international forces, or could embrace Salam Fayyad's two-year plan for statehood and scale back its Area C presence, or even withdraw to the 1967 lines while negotiating over a way settlers could reside under Palestinian sovereignty. Perhaps a Quartet-driven or imposed plan could be encouraged. Anything but business as usual.  
Yet most of those in the camp that favors retracting Israel's occupation - let's call them "soft retractionists" - eschew such bold positions. Their opponents, the "retentionists," support retaining all, most or at least enough control of the territories to render impossible a real two-state outcome (indeed, a commitment to retain all of Jerusalem under exclusive Israeli sovereignty is enough to negate a workable two-state option). Again, most retentionists belong in the "soft" category - they are ready to use the language of two states, and support negotiations, economic peace, even a partial easing of the West Bank internal closure. At the heart of both the retractionist and retentionist camps, in their "soft" manifestations, is a basic element of denial. Soft retentionists pretend that ongoing occupation can coexist with preservation of Israel's democratic character, its security, international acceptance, and a consensus about it in the Jewish world. Making noise about peace and throwing money at public relations will do the trick. Soft retractionists pretend that the occupation can be undone without a fundamental change in approach, and in particular while maintaining existing incentive and disincentive structures (which produced and preserve the current realities).  
But while the respective "soft" narratives are more pleasant to the ear, and easier to market, both are not only wrong but also increasingly irrelevant to Israel's future. The real struggle for the country is between what are commonly labeled as the extremes.  
Hard retentionists know they will have to rewrite the rules of democracy, and plead a special exemption clause for "Jewish democracy" and for the elevation of Jewish-only rights. Palestinians are to be dehumanized, human and civil rights groups and international humanitarian law excoriated and a vocabulary created for laundering and justifying an apartheid reality.  
Hard retractionists will need to stand up for (long-ridiculed) Jewish values, ethics and morality, for the unloved "other" in society, hold up a mirror to the nations' warts, and ultimately support international campaigns that distinguish between Israel proper and the occupied territories.  
Both camps have a vision for the country's future: the Jewish Republic of Israel - equal parts ethnocracy, theocracy and garrison state on the retentionist side, while for the retractionists, well, something that lives up to the words of Israel's Declaration of Independence.  
Retentionist cooperation with racist European Islamophobes and American dispensationalist evangelists (for whom Jews have a particularly unenticing role to play during the anticipated Rapture and Second Coming) is considered legitimate and necessary and is embraced by the mainstream. But when retractionists make common cause with the global civil and human rights community, they are vilified as traitors by the mainstream.  
The dominant discourse in Israel massively stacks the odds against the hard retractionists. The soft retractionists continue to feed that discourse even though it undermines the very outcome they know is necessary. Their frequent silence, no less than the settlers' noise, is drowning out Israeli democracy. The hard retentionists are very well represented in the Knesset, while the hard retractionists can barely rely on a tiny and shrinking number of Jewish MKs.  
It is the human and civil rights community, the New Israel Fund, the demonstrators at Sheikh Jarrah and the few brave public figures who have joined them - including David Grossman, Moshe Halbertal and Ron Pundak - who are now the standard-bearers and source of hope in this decisive phase of the struggle for Israel's future.

<title>A surgical strike on Israel's wallet could end the occupation</title>
<date>Fri Apr 30 01:13:12 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
What on earth will it take to persuade Israel to leave the occupied territories? Sometimes it seems as if nothing will work. For eight years now, the Arab Peace Initiative, which early Zionist leaders would have seen as a dream-come-true, has been collecting dust. Its terms include two states based on the pre-1967 borders, a mutually agreed-upon solution to the Palestinian refugee crisis, and normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and the entire Arab world. What once would have appeared to many to be Israel's salvation now seems impossible given Israel's entrenched colonial position in the West Bank and the settlers' political power.  
Perhaps American college students can help bring Israel to its senses. This past March 18, members of the student senate at the University of California, Berkeley, voted to recommend to the university's governing board of regents that they divest their holdings in General Electric and United Technologies - two companies that have profited from Israel's occupation of Palestinian land, its demolition of Palestinian homes, its aggressive campaign in Gaza last year, and the expansion of settlements. Although Berkeley's student government is not the first in the United States to vote for a divestment recommendation of this nature, it is by far the most significant.  
To be clear, the student bill does not call for a comprehensive form of divestment, and only targets companies involved in Israel's occupation and military misadventures.  
Some see the divestment proposal as counter-productive. "From the standpoint of advancing the causes of peace and justice for Palestinians, the Berkeley bill is worse than useless," claimed Haaretz's Bradley Burston in a recent column. Burston dismissed the idea of selling "some pension fund shares in American companies which make military aircraft engines" because those companies will "continue to sell them to Israel, regardless of the vote."  
But if history is any guide, Berkeley's divestment measure could have a positive impact. In the 1980s, Berkeley's student government was one of the first at any U.S. institution of higher learning to vote to recommend divestment from South Africa's apartheid regime. The UC system's board of regents initially resisted the divestment call, but student protests eventually led the regents to divest funds from companies with ties to South Africa. Eventually other campuses and local municipalities took similar actions.  
The United States government, formerly one of the chief enablers of apartheid, followed the lead of the students, passing the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act in 1986. The legislation prohibited all new U.S. trade and investment in South Africa, and stated five preconditions for lifting the sanctions, including a timeline for ending apartheid laws and the release of Nelson Mandela.  
"In South Africa, we could not have achieved our freedom and just peace without the help of people around the world, who through the use of nonviolent means, such as boycotts and divestments, encouraged their governments and other corporate actors to reverse decades-long support for the Apartheid regime. Students played a leading role in that struggle," Nobel laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu wrote in a letter to Berkeley's student government endorsing the current divestment bill.  
Whether one sees Israel as an apartheid-like regime or not, certainly the aforementioned history could offer lessons in how to end the occupation. If more American college campuses and local agencies pass divestment measures, eventually members of U.S. Congress may come to see that they must listen to their pro-justice, pro-peace constituents and not only to AIPAC. If that happens, a U.S. anti-occupation act could become a possibility.  
If the U.S. government were to seriously pressure Israel - for example, by conditioning $3 billion in annual aid on an end to the occupation and implementation of an equitable peace agreement - perhaps that would provide the incentive necessary to end the occupation.  
Although the Berkeley student president subsequently vetoed the divestment bill, and AIPAC's lobbying of student senators successfully prevented an override vote by the narrowest of margins, the proposal's eventual passage seems inevitable. That will turn the spotlight onto the university regents, who will face protests if they don't follow the divestment recommendation.  
We who promoted and rallied for this bill are a remarkably diverse coalition of Jews, Christians and Muslims; Israelis and Palestinians; and Americans of all backgrounds. Prominent Jewish supporters included Ofra Ben Artzi, sister-in-law of Prime Minister Netanyahu, and Hedy Epstein, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor.  
We Jews who support the divestment bill are fed up with Israel's violations of Palestinian human rights. We are unwilling to wait for political pressure to get Israel out of the territories to spring from the head of Zeus. And we believe that this move is in the best interests of the Israeli and Palestinian people.  
The consequences to Israel of not ending the occupation could not be clearer. "If this bloc of millions of Palestinians cannot vote [in Israeli elections], that will be an apartheid state," said none other than Defense Minister Ehud Barak, in his address to the Herzliya National Security Conference this past winter.  
Israel must choose: End the occupation or face the unraveling of the militarily enforced Jewish-majority state. The selective divestment approach that Berkeley students advocate will help build the political pressure to force Israel to make this choice.

<title>Barak should expose Netanyahu's 'true face' as he did for Arafat </title>
<date>Mon Jan 11 02:27:16 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Ehud Barak is living proof that a leader can influence history, for better or for worse. The first time was in Camp David, in July 2000, when he was the first Israeli prime minister to break the taboo on dividing Jerusalem.  
The second time was when he got back from there, planted the "no partner" land mine and destroyed the public's faith in the possibility of an agreement with the Palestinians.  
Almost 10 years later, Barak can fill in the missing pieces regarding an agreement over Jerusalem and dismantle that land mine. It is in his power to change history for a third time, for better or for worse.  
True, this time Barak is only chairman of a crumbling party and has never been further from the premiership. However, to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Barak's weight is many times greater than his formal title.  
The power of the Labor Party is greater than the 13 Knesset seats it holds. From a political perspective, Netanyahu's government can survive without the Labor Party, but from a diplomatic perspective, the departure of its only left-wing partner could spell disaster. That is the reason he is desperately courting every Kadima MK.  
Labor under Barak's leadership provides a beautiful face for this government (everything is relative), which Labor under foreign minister Shimon Peres gave Ariel Sharon's government. If Barak announced he didn't believe the government wants to pay the price of peace, who would be left to persuade U.S. President Barack Obama that Netanyahu meant what he said in his Bar-Ilan speech? The foreign minister from Yisrael Beiteinu, Avigdor Lieberman? Shas Interior Minister Eli Yishai? Perhaps Science and Technology Minister Daniel Hershkowitz, from Habayit Hayehudi?  
Barak has come a long way since he turned himself into the main salesman of the "no-partner" brand. He seems to be convinced that the failure of a diplomatic move (like the failure of a military operation) can highlight a problem in implementation and the need to correct an anomaly, not necessarily a fundamental flaw. He does not miss an opportunity to explain that the alternative to a two-state solution is a binational state or an outcast apartheid regime. His analytical brain can describe the reality well, but does nothing to change it.  
Brark proudly told members of the Labor Party Bureau Friday that the security situation has not been as good for as long a time. He did not need Gaza's firing on the western Negev over the weekend to know that this security is only as stable as the position of the Palestinian Authority.  
The cruel embargo on Gaza and delays in the diplomatic process have recently begun to eat away at the motivation of the Palestinian Authority's security forces in the West Bank. How long will Palestinian police agree to act as the occupation's sub-contractors?  
Cairo is somewhat hinting, somewhat threatening, that a failure of the Egyptian initiative to renew talks between Fatah and Israel will lead to renewed attempts by Egypt at reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas.  
Rapprochement with Hamas political chief Khaled Meshal will obviously be one of the issues raised in the upcoming meeting between PA President Mahmoud Abbas and Syrian President Bashar Assad in Damascus. The Arab peace initiative from March 2002 will be presented for ratification at the Arab League Summit, which is to meet in two months in Libya. If by then there is no essential change in the situation in the territories and in the diplomatic situation, this could be the eighth and last time it is presented.  
Barak is proud of the fact that at Camp David he revealed "Arafat's true face." The time has come for him to reveal Netanyahu's true face. If the prime minister intends to reach a permanent status agreement, let him assure Abbas that he will delay the tenders for expanded construction in East Jerusalem until negotiations are over. If we are dealing the old Netanyahu, who built neighborhoods in East Jerusalem to undermine Oslo, Barak has no business being in a right-wing government.  
What does he have to lose? He has already been prime minister, and he will not be again. At least he will not go down in Israeli history as the undertaker of the party that established the state.

<title>Barak's time </title>
<date>Mon Jan 11 02:37:13 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Ehud Barak is living proof that a leader can influence history, for better or for worse. The first time was in Camp David, in July 2000, when he was the first Israeli prime minister to break the taboo on dividing Jerusalem.  
The second time was when he got back from there, planted the "no partner" land mine and destroyed the public's faith in the possibility of an agreement with the Palestinians.  
Almost 10 years later, Barak can fill in the missing pieces regarding an agreement over Jerusalem and dismantle that land mine. It is in his power to change history for a third time, for better or for worse.  
True, this time Barak is only chairman of a crumbling party and has never been further from the premiership. However, to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Barak's weight is many times greater than his formal title.  
The power of the Labor Party is greater than the 13 Knesset seats it holds. From a political perspective, Netanyahu's government can survive without the Labor Party, but from a diplomatic perspective, the departure of its only left-wing partner could spell disaster. That is the reason he is desperately courting every Kadima MK.  
Labor under Barak's leadership provides a beautiful face for this government (everything is relative), which Labor under foreign minister Shimon Peres gave Ariel Sharon's government. If Barak announced he didn't believe the government wants to pay the price of peace, who would be left to persuade U.S. President Barack Obama that Netanyahu meant what he said in his Bar-Ilan speech?

<title>Boycott becomes them </title>
<date>Sun Jul 04 01:12:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
How charming the boycott cry is. Boycott Israeli universities, Israeli products from the settlements, flowers grown in Israel. When this call comes from Israelis, it reflects a great deal of despair, and stems from goodwill, of course. It's an enchanting formula: They'll boycott Israel, the public outcry will reach the government and the latter, being democratic, will have to obey the will of the people. How could they not have thought of it sooner?
They did think about it. That is exactly the formula behind the sanctions against Iran. Economic isolation, frozen bank accounts, senior officials not being able to travel abroad - then the Iranian people will wake up and change their regime, or at least its policies. Iran has been under sanctions for 30 years, and the people, wonder of wonders, have not risen up. They protest, but not because of the sanctions; because of the regime's suppression.
This remedy was also tried with Iraq. For 12 years the Iraqi people groaned under sanctions and dictatorship, but did not rise up against the great military leader who ruled their bedrooms. In the end there was no choice but war. Sanctions did not help.
And what about South Africa? The ostensibly successful sanctions and boycott, which led to the regime's fall? Sanctions - first military - were imposed on South Africa as early as the start of the 1960s. Then in the mid-1970s, they were extended to oil exports, and finally came the widescale sanctions of the mid-1980s. But apartheid was eliminated only in the mid-1990s, and even then it was not due to sanctions alone; in fact, in those years South Africa experienced economic growth and its exports increased 26 percent. President P.W. Botha's response to the blacks was no less vindictive than the West's desire to impose sanctions. Botha wanted to prove that outside intervention would not impact apartheid.
Israel has adopted the same policy. It has blockaded Gaza to spur the inhabitants to rise up against the Hamas regime, in order to achieve politically what the Israel Defense Forces could not achieve militarily. But three years of blockade, four years of fighting Hamas, and even the destructive Operation Cast Lead did not do the trick. The people of Gaza did not rise up, and the Hamas regime only grew stronger.
Anywhere sanctions are imposed - from Iraq to Iran, from Gaza to Pakistan - nationalist and radical forces actually have become stronger. Even the intellectuals who oppose the regimes have found themselves forced to defend them from outside intervention. Nationalism, or more correctly, extreme nationalism, rejoices.
People calling for a boycott of Israel or its institutions and products have given up on change from within. But what is worse, the call is motivated by the same logic that guides government policy in Gaza, and it is just as mistaken. After all, there is no reason whatsoever to believe that the Israeli government or the public will behave differently than Gazans or Iranians.
The fact that Israel is a democracy is no guarantee. Proof of this lies in the collective behavior in the face of Turkey's attack on Israel and the threat of military sanctions. Cancelling vacations in Antalya, protests and boycotting Turkish goods have become symbols of the "just struggle" against the bad guys.
If Israeli scholars are banned by universities in London, that's not so terrible. They can still go to Pennsylvania, and if they are banned there, they can still correspond and publish online; what's more important is that foreigners don't dictate policy "to us." If now, even before a boycott, lecturers have to think twice about what they say lest extreme nationalists mark them, then under sanctions, some elected officials may ensure such academics are immediately fired. In any case, people waiting for an academic uprising amidst a boycott should have their heads examined.
Who else can take part in the civil disobedience in the boycott proponents' fantasy? Farmers? Students? Travelers? Businesspeople? How many of them will wrap themselves in the Israeli flag to show the world we do not give in to sanctions? That will be the finest hour of the right wing, the "nationalist camp," fascism. Boycott becomes them.

<title>Boycotting the boycotters </title>
<date>Sun May 16 01:18:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Most people here are appalled at the notion that anybody beyond Israel's borders would think to boycott their country, products or universities. Boycotts, after all, are viewed in Israel as illegitimate. Anyone who calls for such a step is perceived as an anti-Semite and Israel-hater who is undermining the state's very right to exist. In Israel itself, those who call for a boycott are branded as traitors and heretics. The notion that a boycott, limited as it may be, is likely to convince Israel to change its ways - and for its own benefit - is not tolerated here.
Even an obvious, logical step - like the Palestinian Authority's boycott of products made in the settlements - is viewed by hypocritical Israeli eyes as provocative. Moreover, while the international boycott against apartheid South Africa is credited with leading to the regime's downfall, here it is considered irrelevant and unworthy of comparison.
It would be possible to identify with these intolerant reactions were it not for the fact that Israel itself is one of the world's prolific boycotters. Not only does it boycott, it preaches to others, at times even forces others, to follow in tow. Israel has imposed a cultural, academic, political, economic and military boycott on the territories. At the same time, almost no one here utters a dissenting word questioning the legitimacy of these boycotts. Yet the thought of boycotting the boycotter? Now that's inconceivable.
The most brutal, naked boycott is, of course, the siege on Gaza and the boycott of Hamas. At Israel's behest, nearly all Western countries signed onto the boycott with inexplicable alacrity. This is not just a siege that has left Gaza in a state of shortage for three years. Nor is it just a complete (and foolish ) boycott of Hamas, save for the discussions over abducted soldier Gilad Shalit. It's a series of cultural, academic, humanitarian and economic boycotts. Israel threatens nearly every diplomat who seeks to enter Gaza to see firsthand the unbearable sights.
In addition, Israel bars entry to anyone who wishes to lend humanitarian aid. We should note that the boycott isn't just against Hamas, but against all Gaza, everyone who lives there. The convoy of ships that will soon sail from Europe to try to break the siege will carry thousands of tons of construction material, prefab houses and medicine. Israel has announced that it plans to stop the vessels. A boycott is a boycott.
Doctors, professors, artists, jurists, intellectuals, economists, engineers - none of them are permitted to enter Gaza. This is a complete boycott that bears the tag "Made in Israel." Those who speak about immoral and ineffective boycotts do so without batting an eye when it comes to Gaza.
Israel is also urging the world to boycott Iran. But it's not just Gaza and Iran that are at issue here, because entry into Israel and the West Bank is being affected by the recent frenzy of boycotts. Anyone who is suspected of supporting the Palestinians or expressing concern for their lot is boycotted and expelled. This group includes a clown who came to organize a conference; a peace activist who was due to appear at a symposium; and scientists, artists and intellectuals who arouse suspicions that they back the Palestinian cause. This is a cultural and academic boycott on all counts, the type of boycott that we reject when it is used against us.
Yet the anti-boycott country's list of boycotted parties does not end there. Even a Jewish-American organization like J Street, which defines itself as pro-Israel, has felt the long arm of the Israeli boycott. It is permissible to boycott J Street because it champions peace, but we can't tolerate a boycott of products made in settlements that were built on usurped land. Denying a visiting professor entry into Gaza for an appearance at a university does not qualify as a boycott, but cutting off ties with Israeli institutions that provide fast-track degree programs for army officers and interrogators in the Shin Bet security service - people who are often viewed around the world as complicit in war crimes - is viewed as verboten.
Yes, an Israeli who lives in Israel will have a hard time preaching to others about the virtues of a boycott when that person does not boycott his or her own country or university. But it is his right to believe that a boycott could compel his government to end the occupation. As long as the Israelis don't pay any price, there won't be a change.
This is a legitimate, moral position. It is no less legitimate or moral than those who claim that a boycott is an immoral, ineffective tool while exercising that same option against others. So you oppose a boycott against Israel? Then let's first do away with all the boycotts we have imposed ourselves.

<title>Come join the march of the many </title>
<date>Fri Dec 10 00:57:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
The government and its institutions are those responsible for safeguarding our rights - all our rights. They have the power to enforce the law or break it, to foster an atmosphere of equality or of discrimination; it is in their hands to decide whether collective resources are equitably distributed among different groups in order to close socio-economic gaps or whether they are channeled into the hands of the few. Ultimately, the actions of our leaders are what will determine whether they back the state's commitment to the rights of all those living under its jurisdiction.
Alas, the past year seems to have set a new standard in the way the state betrays its commitments to the public. In government circles, the Knesset, academia and other spheres, Israeli democracy finds itself under threat.
In the Knesset, the recent wave of anti-democratic legislative initiatives was highlighted by the amendment to the citizenship law and the draft bill that would make it possible for small communities to reject "incompatible" residents. These bills, however, are only part of a more widespread trend which recently prompted the Knesset speaker to note: "There are members of Knesset who in their deeds turn to the emotions of the public and in so doing are creating a public global image of Israel as an apartheid state."
In the courts, the inconceivable inclination of the state to ignore court rulings reached new heights this year, prompting the attorney general to publish the following directive: "Implementation of court rulings ... is an obligation of the state. Obedience to court rulings does not just obligate the residents of a country and all who come through its gates, but rather it first and foremost obligates the state itself." Has the rule of law deteriorated to the point that it is necessary to enunciate such obvious guidelines? And, has the government changed its ways since the directive was handed down, or does it still regard certain court rulings with contempt?
Social services, be it welfare, health or housing, continued to be neglected; this is neither a new phenomenon in this country nor an act of nature - it's become systematic policy. This past year yet again, inequality, socioeconomic gaps and poverty reach record levels, leaving more citizens than ever to fend for themselves. Indeed, the recent national disaster in the Carmel Forest and the inability of the firefighters to control the blaze were painful reminders of the dangers of an economic policy that promotes cuts in public services. Maintaining a high level of public services in not in the interest of a particular demographic group but of society as a whole.
On racism, the origins of the wave that is now sweeping the country can be traced to government leaders: Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman spoke at the United Nations about "transfer of populations and territories" - and kept his ministerial seat; a municipal rabbi, a civil servant, published a halakhic decree that Jews are prohibited from renting apartments to non-Jews and not only kept his position, but has been joined by dozens of his peers. The common thread is that racism is receiving legitimacy and backing from the government, either through active participation or by tacit compliance.
Thus it is our government that is currently spearheading the attack against the foundations of our democracy. It is also responsible for the separation regime that is taking an even stronger hold in the occupied territories, the shameful treatment of refugees and migrant workers, and the close links that have been forged between those ruling the country and those groups seeking to intimidate and tag as "disloyal" anyone they see fit, targeting, among others, academia and human rights organizations.
Looking at this gloomy picture today, International Human Rights Day, one might ask: What hope is there for human rights in Israel? The events of the past year showed that this hope lies primarily in the hands of the citizens. It is critical that we remember that the power of the state and its institutions, and the budgets and resources they use, are given to it by us, the citizens - all the citizens. The chief responsibility of the state and all those working on its behalf is to be loyal to the public. The public still remembers its rights. Israelis demand that their government safeguard the basic rights of all those under its authority, they oppose cuts in public services, and they support equality and human rights. Everyone's rights.
Today, Friday, December 10, as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is celebrated worldwide, thousands of people will be gathering for the second year in the streets of Tel Aviv for Israel's Human Rights March. Working toward many different causes through shared values we will call out together: Human rights are everyone's rights. In order for the state to change direction, in order for the democratic forces to continue believing in our values and fighting for them even in the face of extremism, we will march together in the largest annual human rights event held in Israel. This is the march of the many who, despite the attacks against them, are determined to continue believing.

<title>Declaring war on the intellect </title>
<date>Tue May 18 02:12:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
By stopping the illustrious American scholar Prof. Noam Chomsky at the Allenby Bridge and barring his entry into Israel and the Palestinian Authority, the government's outrageous treatment of those with the audacity to criticize its policies has reached new heights. Israel looks like a bully who has been insulted by a superior intellect and is now trying to fight it, arrest it and expel it.
Chomsky is a controversial and bold intellectual. His linguistic research has brought him unquestionable respect, but his political writings and speeches, in which he bluntly and acerbically attacks any government that he thinks deserves it, have made him unpopular both inside and outside the United States.
Nevertheless, it is hard to imagine any country that would not feel honored to be visited by Chomsky, apart from Israel, which has its own accounts to settle with him. As a Jew who lived here for a brief period in the 1950s and is fluent in Hebrew, Chomsky takes a great interest in events here. In many articles, petitions and open letters, he has been sharply critical of Israel's actions and policies.
Like many other members of the intellectual left in the U.S., Chomsky has roundly condemned the occupation and displayed sympathy for the Palestinian struggle against it. In recent years, he has often been quoted as calling Israel an apartheid state. But despite this, he has firmly opposed any blanket boycott of Israel. He says it is the settlements that should be boycotted, as well as the bodies that support them, both in Israel and abroad  (including in the U.S. ), but that it makes no sense to boycott the Israeli public in general or its academic institutions.
Israel, however, has lost its last remnants of tolerance for anyone who does not join its shrinking chorus of supporters. On the right, but not only there, Chomsky is seen as a deserter, a traitor and an enemy of the people. The details of the incident, as reported by Haaretz correspondent Amira Hass, sound as if they were taken from the theater of the absurd or from some political satire on places and times that have gone down in infamy. The questions that were posed to Chomsky by a border inspector, on orders from his superiors, have to be read and reread to be believed.
"Israel," Chomsky was informed, "doesn't like what you say." Is this a reasonable pretext for a democratic state to detain someone for questioning or hold him up at the border? And who is this "Israel" that doesn't like what Chomsky says? The general public? The Interior Ministry? The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories? The government?
One does not have to be an ardent supporter of Chomsky in order to agree with his view that Israel is behaving like South Africa in the 1960s, when it understood that it was an outcast, but thought it could solve the problem with the help of a better public relations campaign.
Now that the affair has come to light, Interior Ministry sources are claiming it was COGAT that should have handled Chomsky, and that his detention was the result of a misunderstanding, whereas COGAT is claiming that it did not know of the scholar's arrival. This, at best, is blatant disingenuousness.
Interior Minister Eli Yishai and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should apologize to Chomsky and make sure that he is allowed to move freely around Israel and throughout the West Bank, including Bir Zeit University. It is not yet too late to repair some of the damage caused by this harmful folly.

<title>Destructive 'agnosticism' </title>
<date>Fri Nov 26 02:03:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In his November 5 opinion piece in Haaretz English Edition, Matthew Taylor (“Just who is misguided?”), of the Jewish Voice for Peace, lodged a complaint against the “older [Jewish] establishment” for being “condescending” to young Jews. His protest included an attack on remarks made by Julie Bernstein, of the Jewish Community Relations Council of San Francisco, who was a panelist in a workshop at the General Assembly earlier this month in New Orleans.
The irony of Bernstein being a young adult and part-time graduate student seems to have been lost on Taylor. The main target of his "j'accuse," though, was the recently launched plan of the Jewish Federations of North America and the Jewish Council for Public Affairs to actively confront the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS ) campaign, a well-funded internationally coordinated movement to isolate and delegitimize Israel. To bolster his argument, Taylor could have tried to demonstrate that BDS does not strive to dismantle the State of Israel. He did not, nor could he had he wanted to - because Israel's demise is the BDS movement's aim.
The leaders of BDS certainly speak plainly about their goals. Omar Barghouti, a founding member of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, spoke last March at a church in the San Francisco Bay area, and declared that for the BDS movement the 1967 occupation is "not the most important" issue. Instead, he said, the "foremost" demand of BDS is the right of return. The same Barghouti has also said, "If the refugees were to return you would not have a two-state solution; you'll have a Palestine next to a Palestine rather than a Palestine next to an Israel."
Other BDS advocates are equally explicit. "BDS represents three words that will help bring about the defeat of Zionist Israel and victory for Palestine," said Ronnie Kasrils, the veteran South African political figure and advocate for the Palestinian cause. And Palestinian-American journalist Ahmed Moor writes, "Ending the occupation doesn't mean anything if it doesn't mean upending the Jewish state itself ... BDS does mean the end of the Jewish state."
Some may try to dismiss these comments as merely individual opinions. But that is just more obfuscation. The sum of the BDS movement's central demands (as outlined in its manifesto, the "Palestinian United Call for BDS against Israel" ) - especially the demand for a "right of return" - make it clear that BDS seeks to disassemble the State of Israel. Or, as Barghouti envisions it, a "Palestine next to a Palestine" and no Israel.
While these BDS advocates are clear about their movement's goals, Taylor and Jewish Voice for Peace prefer murkiness. JVP's website declares: "Our mission statement endorses neither a one-state solution, nor a two-state solution ... we have members and supporters on both sides of this question, as well as many others who, like the organization as a whole, are agnostic about it."
In the face of the annihilationist and overtly anti-Semitic ideologies motivating Hamas, Hezbollah and their state sponsor Iran, this agnosticism coming from a Jewish group with respect to Israel's existence, and thus the safety of millions of Israeli Jews, represents a gross moral failure.
JVP's website also states, "JVP defends activists' right to use the full range of BDS tactics without being persecuted or demonized." Missing from this statement, and from any JVP public pronouncements, are any critiques of the BDS movement's explicit goal of dismantling Israel. Further, JVP not only defends pro-BDS groups, it also partners with them. Based in the San Francisco Bay area, JVP for years has repeatedly co-sponsored scores of events and demonstrations with anti-Israel and explicitly anti-Zionist organizations that overtly support the full range of BDS. These include the Al Awda Palestinian Right to Return Coalition, International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network, Students for Justice in Palestine, Sabeel, Bay Area Campaign to End Israeli Apartheid and the International Solidarity Movement, among many others.
It is important to draw a stark line between BDS supporters like the JVP and critics of specific Israeli government policies. In the American and Israeli Jewish communities, there is ample space for wide-ranging debate - from left to right - about specific policies. However, "agnosticism" on Israel's right to exist as an independent Jewish and democratic state within secure borders is, in fact, anti-Israel. Delegitimizing Israel and thereby promoting its isolation and destabilization is, in fact, anti-Israel. Applying harsher criteria for and imposing harsher punishment on Israel than are applied to any other country whose policies are considered objectionable, is, in fact, anti-Israel.
The time has come - particularly after JVP's behavior at the General Assembly and the subsequent gloating about its outbursts there - to remove the cloak of respectability that JVP has tried to place over its positions and ask all reasonable people to examine the organization's real record.

<title>Dubai hit shows Israel won't be safer with exiled terrorists</title>
<date>Mon Feb 22 02:37:10 IST 2010</date>
<content>
If Mahmoud al-Mabhouh were sitting in an Israeli prison instead of posthumously starring in the international media, his name would be on the list of prisoners whom Hamas is demanding in exchange for Gilad Shalit. He would almost certainly be one of the "arch-terrorists" that Israel, for its own security, is insisting be barred from the Palestinian territories after their release, a condition that Hamas has refused to accept. On top of this snag, the American government is strenuously opposed to the exchange, on the grounds that a Hamas success in securing the release of hundreds of prisoners would bolster the organization's prestige and highlight the impotence of the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority.  
Yet both these arguments are utterly specious, and merely lay bare the obtuseness and shortsightedness prevalent in both Jerusalem and Washington. The wantonly negligent handling of the plight of a young soldier languishing in captivity is characteristic of the policy, or lack thereof, regarding Israel's fate as a Jewish and democratic state.  
The Mabhouh case has knocked the bottom out of the argument that Israel will be safer if the worst of the freed terrorists are exiled to Damascus as part of a deal for Shalit. The huge effort put into assassinating Mabhouh in Dubai and the diplomatic and security risks - surely calculated ones - taken by whoever did it are indications of the man's standing in the world of terrorism. Exile, it transpires, can be an ideal hothouse for breeding arch-terrorists.  
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who gave the okay for the botched attempt to kill Khaled Meshal in Amman in 1997, must have realized by now that it is best to keep the most dangerous and sophisticated prisoners Israel releases close to hand. That way, it is easier to keep track of them. If a brother of Mabhouh, upon returning home after a prison sojourn, were to revert to his evil ways, no Israeli ambassador would be called in to explain the day after he was eliminated.  
Netanyahu is aware that Hamas has rejected deportation from the outset. There is no chance that further bargaining will shift it from this position. The only explanation for Israel's insistence on reinforcing the ranks of Meshal's gang in Damascus with vengeance-hungry exiles is that the prime minister does not want to pay the price of the deal.  
The price tag of the bigger deal with the Palestinians has also been known for a long time. It was set out in the Clinton parameters of 2000, the Arab peace initiative of 2002, the road map of 2003 and the Annapolis statement of 2007. All of these propose a comprehensive peace in exchange for a withdrawal to the 1967 borders, with minor, reciprocal border adjustments and an agreed solution to the refugee problem. In fact, the tariff has remained the same since the PLO's 1988 declaration of an independent Palestinian state.  
Netanyahu also avers that he has accepted the principle of two states for two peoples. But after accepting it, he immediately rushed to set impossible conditions: He demanded that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state and declared that East Jerusalem, the Ariel bloc and the Jordan Valley would be annexed to Israel. Having heard what his defense minister claims to have offered Yasser Arafat, and being aware of the map that his predecessor laid before Mahmoud Abbas, it is hard to believe that the prime minister thinks he can find a Palestinian partner for what he has in mind.  
America's dogged resistance to a reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas shows that President Barack Obama fears for the future of the Palestinian peace camp. But instead of moving the peace process forward with that same doggedness, the United States has been attacking the Shalit deal. That is far easier than pressuring Israel to transfer more of Area C to Abbas, remove more roadblocks and make sure that the freeze on settlement construction is not a hoax.  
Assassinating exiled terrorists will not defeat Hamas, and thwarting a prisoner exchange will not have a long-term impact on the balance of power in the Palestinian territories. The right way to tackle Hamas is to create a real political alternative to its violent and uncompromising course. In the absence of such an alternative, operations taken from James Bond movies that the foreign media attribute to Israel make this country look like a neighborhood thug and divert attention from the specter of apartheid crouching at the gate.

<title>End the siege on Israel </title>
<date>Fri Jun 11 01:18:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Israel's deadly attack on the "Freedom Flotilla" is proof of how Gaza continues to give Israel a taste of its own medicine. Intended to help solve Israel's problems with Hamas, the three-year-old siege of Gaza is developing into a siege of Israel, while it causes tremendous damage to the country's image around the world.
It should be clear to both Israel and the United States by now that the siege of Gaza has failed to accomplish its goals. Israel has failed to weaken Hamas, free Gilad Shalit or even put an end to arms smuggling.
To Israel's dismay, Hamas has succeeded in putting the spotlight on Gaza and directing world attention to the country's irrational policies toward not only the Palestinians, but also its own citizens.
From outside, the situation in Gaza may appear unsustainable for Hamas, but in fact the Islamic movement and its supporters are content to wait it out, calling Israel's bluff on the blockade. Indeed some cynics believe the current status quo is the best situation the Palestinians have enjoyed in a long time.
Late last month, at the fifth annual Al Jazeera forum in Doha, Osama Hamdan of Hamas and Ibrahim el-Moussaoui of Hezbollah applauded and shook hands with Abdel Bari Atwan, the editor of Al-Quds Al-Arabi, a widely circulated pan-Arabist newspaper, when he said: "I have good news: There is a Palestinian split. Things have never been better before. One camp is with the Americans, the Israelis and seculars, and the other camp is with Iran and Islamists. So, if one side loses, the other is bound to win, and this has been the best and safest situation for the Palestinians in a long time."
Atwan is known to favor the latter camp, and from his "good news," one can surmise that he is betting it is on its way to winning - clearly with tremendous help from the siege of Gaza.
What is even more unsettling from the point of view of peace-loving Palestinians is the fact that Israel's top politicians are aware of the implications of their damaging policies, even as they refuse to change them.
After meeting with Defense Minister Ehud Barak two months ago at his office in Tel Aviv, I walked away believing he understood that unless Israel changes its policies vis-a-vis my people, sooner or later the world will see those policies for what they are: apartheid. I believe the deadly attack on the flotilla, and the worldwide reactions that followed, are confirming Barak's fears - and sooner, rather than later. Israel's policies are no longer acceptable to the world community, and a change in policy is crucial.
The day after the Mavi Marmara incident, the head of the Mossad, Meir Dagan, bluntly told the Knesset: "Israel is becoming more of a liability and less of an asset for the United States."
The siege of Gaza has been going on for nearly three years, and strategically speaking, so far, Israel and its allies have been the biggest losers. The reaction from both the world's governments and its peoples to last week's attack shows not only the growing intolerance of Israel's policies, but an urgent need for Israel to rethink its long-term goals. Is it to exist as a democracy, and in peace with its neighbors, or will it continue to be the Palestinians' landlords?
If Israel's goal is to be a permanent landlord, then its future in the region is clear: More and more disgruntled Arab and Muslim youth will continue to join the lines of resistance against the apartheid in the territories and will continue to threaten the stability of the already weak neighboring Arab regimes. It is important to note that a large number of the people on the ships bound for Gaza were young Arabs from almost every country in the region. Today they may come on ships with peace activists, tomorrow they will storm the borders with jihadist movements. Then, it will not only be Israel facing them. Their own regimes and the United States will also have to face the consequences.
The fact that Turkey and Iran are sending aid to the Palestinians and criticizing Israel's policies will not only undermine the legitimacy of the nearby Arab regimes, which are already seen as helpless and ineffective, but will also lead their populations to draw inspiration from those two countries.
Egypt, realizing that its regime is weak and unstable, has already felt the heat and immediately opened the Rafah crossing with Gaza, which it intends to leave open.
So, is Israel ready to think seriously about long-term solutions, or does it intend to simply continue to impose a siege on itself?
Israel's leaders - with the help of the United States and the international community - must redefine their country's long-term vision and goals, and allow a Palestinian state to exist by its side. If Israel's goal is to live in a democracy and in peace with the Palestinians, then its path should be clear: Lift the siege on Gaza, encourage a unity government, and let the Palestinians build their own democracy.

<title>From 'Ajami' to 'Beaufort' </title>
<date>Thu Mar 11 01:17:14 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Just hours before Sunday's Academy Awards ceremony, Scandar Copti, one of the co-directors of "Ajami," announced that the film does not represent Israel. At around the same time, MK Jamal Zahalka was taking part in an Israeli Apartheid Week event at McGill University in Montreal, pouring oil on the flames of the Arab-Jewish rift. At a special Knesset session to honor the 12 members of the pre-state Jewish underground militias who were hanged by the British during the Mandate era (known as the olei hagardom in Hebrew), MKs Ahmed Tibi and Talab al-Sana called these men terrorists.  
As a movie, "Ajami" is no better or worse than others of its ilk created around the world that tell nearly the same story. In every part of the world in which national minorities fight the majority (especially when the fight regularly erupts into verbal and physical violence), the reality is even worse than in Israel.  
It's reasonable to assume that had the film not been set in Jaffa, where, it is implied, the sad state of the Arabs is the consequence of the Jewish sin of "the occupation of 1948," it would likely not have been nominated for best foreign film. Similarly, "Beaufort" and "Waltz with Bashir" were nominated for Oscars because they were critical of Israel.  
The political statement made by Copti turned "Ajami" from a movie into another link in the fight waged by the Palestinians in Israel against the state of which they are citizens. That makes it just like disrespecting the memory of the olei hagardom or accusing Israel of being an apartheid state even though the Israeli Palestinians' rights as citizens here exceed those of any Arab country (and include supernumerary rights, such as exemption from mandatory military service).  
It can be assumed that the Israeli Arabs would present their position more moderately (and thus more effectively) were it not for the encouragement they receive from Jewish entities in the areas of art, culture, academia, philanthropy and the media. A large proportion of Israeli films, both features and documentaries, focus on and promote the Palestinian narrative, whether directly or indirectly. This narrative blames the Jews for all the ills of the Arab community - the result of the mother of all occupations, that of 1948.  
All Israelis seeking public funding for a movie are aware that aid from international foundations, and even Israeli ones, depends on the submission of a screenplay that is critical of Israel. No filmmaker could obtain funding from a European or even an Israeli foundation (including governmental ones) for a movie that presents a balanced view of Israel, much less a positive one.  
The result: Dozens of "checkpoint films" telling the story of Arab suffering. None of the films in this genre delves into the reasons behind the checkpoints or asks about the mass killings that were prevented by the capture of terrorists or timely discovery of explosives at those very checkpoints. Many of these films show women weeping and crying out next to their demolished homes.  
The movies - in Israel, too - evoke sympathy for the oppressed and that is their purpose.  
But not a single movie has been made that shows the reasons leading up to the demolition of the homes, that tells the story of the hundreds of Jewish victims who were murdered by the terrorists whose homes were subsequently destroyed.  
Had they not wallowed in the mire of "We have sinned, we have trespassed," it is doubtful that "Ajami," "Beaufort" or "Waltz with Bashir" would have gotten so close to the pinnacle of Hollywood recognition. It is fashionable today to criticize or even to hate Israel. Among those contributing to hatred of Israel are, in addition to filmmakers, Israeli intellectuals and artists from other disciplines - and for exactly the same reasons that the filmmakers are so eager to make their self-flagellating films.

<title>Grandpa Bibi's responsibility </title>
<date>Mon Jun 21 03:04:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
At times, when I'm watching my little grandchildren, my thoughts turn to Grandpa Bibi. Doesn't Shmuel's grandfather also wonder what kind of country our generation will bequeath to theirs? Grandchildren turn the future from a mere political, social or economic concept into concrete reality, replete with responsibility. Doesn't Benjamin Netanyahu ask himself what he is doing to ensure that his grandson will raise his children in a Jewish and democratic state? Is it possible that this man, who has taken upon himself for the second time supreme responsibility for the fate of the Zionist dream, believes that time and his own inactivity are working for the good of future generations?
The dramatic speech Netanyahu delivered last July at Bar-Ilan University elicited hopes that he had begun to free himself of the shackles of the past and to overcome the fears of his revisionist father. He addressed the Palestinians as neighbors, not enemies, calling on them "to give our young generation a better place to live" and to act together to advance the two-state solution, each state with its own flag and government. He placed the partition of the land at the center of his political vision.
The leader of the right spoke of the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside the Jewish state as a Zionist interest, and not as a forced response to external pressure.
In the year that has passed since that "historic" speech, no Israeli or Palestinian child, including the infant Shmuel, has been born into a better world. Negotiations over the two-state solution have devolved into small-time haggling over neighborhoods in the West Bank and buildings in East Jerusalem.
Instead of discussing the 2002 Arab peace initiative, which is gradually fading away, the government occupies itself with shopping lists of Gazans. Most of the time and energy of the decision makers is devoted to putting out fires in international relations. Not only doesn't the government advance a solution to the conflict, it is not even managing it correctly and preserving the status quo.
Any child who has ever ridden a bicycle knows that if you stop pedaling you fall flat on your face. An Israeli leader who gives up on progress in the negotiations toward a two-state solution is dooming his grandchildren, and perhaps his children too, to a binational, one-state solution. This is no longer the nightmare scenario of lunatic-fringe leftists who have lost their faith in the god of the status quo. Moshe Arens, Netanyahu's first political patron, who appointed him deputy chief of mission at the Israeli Embassy in Washington D.C. in 1982, argues that the only realistic alternative to partition is extending Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank and giving Israeli citizenship to the Palestinian residents.
Although all of the official documents Israel has signed declare that the Gaza Strip and the West Bank form a single entity, Arens has unilaterally erased the 1.5 million Gazans from the demographic equation. But even if his forecast proves correct, when the time comes for Shmuel to enlist in the armed forces of "Isratine"  (Muammar Gadhafi's term) most of his age group will be followers of Allah and Mohammed, his prophet, or believers in the supremacy of halakha over the law of the land, or supporters of an apartheid government of isolated pariahs.
He will live, along with the grandchildren of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, if they remain here, in a state torn between fanatical Muslims and fanatical religious Jews. Sooner, rather than later, they will be an absolute majority and no Supreme Court will be able to intervene in the education of future generations of the enemies of progress and democracy.
You don't believe me? In Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, Jews who believe in the sovereignty of the Knesset are already in the minority.
Since the Bar-Ilan speech, Shimon Peres has been telling all guests to the Presidential Residence, albeit a little more hesitantly recently, that Netanyahu understands the dimensions of the "historical responsibility" that he bears. This is no mere inflated cliche: His actions and derelictions in coming months will affect Israel beyond 2010. When Grandpa Bibi plays with little Shmuel, he should know that his survival games are an irresponsible gamble on the fate of today's grandchildren.

<title>He will bring us all down </title>
<date>Wed Mar 17 04:00:13 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In the next frame of this cartoon, Benjamin Netanyahu will find himself running in thin air, then a moment later fall into the abyss. It's a frame we've seen before, one that always brings a smile in cartoons. But not in life.  
The prime minister is warning that if he's ousted, Barack Obama will go down with him. That won't happen - the constitution holds the U.S. president in the Oval Office for a full four years. Netanyahu, by contrast, is held in office by ministers Ehud Barak, Avigdor Lieberman and Eli Yishai. And it's best not to be in their hands when they smell the blood of the weak.  
The scene doesn't have to stop there. Netanyahu would do well to read his favorite book, John F. Kennedy's "Profiles in Courage," before bed. At the last minute he could change not only his life, but the course of history itself, by recognizing that Obama doesn't want to throw him under the proverbial bus, that Hillary Clinton is not out to settle scores over how he wronged her husband and that overall, maybe the world is no longer all that anti-Semitic, certainly not against us.  
It is we who didn't realize the sun had set over the occupation. Even our best friends, who for years saved us from UN Security Council vetoes, believe that Israel must quit the territories and withdraw to the western side of the separation fence - a secure and widely recognized border - with or without an agreement. This is the conclusion one reaches with a fair reading of Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, the Bill Clinton parameters and the letters exchanged between George W. Bush and Ariel Sharon.  
Netanyahu must get the message that Menachem Begin, Sharon and Ehud Olmert - his predecessors on the right - all came to understand, that the scenery looks entirely different once you're in power. Then he will understand that only the radical Palestinians and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad don't want to divide the land. It's good for them that Israel is turning into an updated version of an apartheid state. Israel haters everywhere understand well that the community of nations won't allow the rebirth of the Afrikaners' South Africa, one forcing on the world a single state between the river and the sea. This would be a single democratic state in which everyone has a vote, and when the ballots open, Ahmed Tibi will be elected prime minister.  
This is a scary prospect, more than Qassam rockets and far more than a second "Hamastan." It would be the end of a Jewish democratic Israel. Netanyahu can jolt the steering wheel at the last second and change the end of this film - to return to the vision of Theodor Herzl and create a Jewish national home in recognized, defensible borders. He will not only receive a Nobel Peace Prize, but enter history as a second David Ben-Gurion.  
What must he do? Create a third Netanyahu government, distance himself from the ideas of Tzipi Hotovely and other lawmakers in her camp, and join up with Tzipi Livni. Livni could be given half the steering wheel, with a joint Livni-Netanyahu government set up to divide the land and end the occupation. Half and half in the cabinet, fifty-fifty in government - the new administration would be one-quarter bigger than the current one. Lieberman would be released to do as he wishes and Yishai simply released.
And what about Barak? Let him remain defense minister. It's good for Israel and good for ending the occupation. Barak is, after all, experienced in unilateral withdrawals. He did a great job in Lebanon and would do the same in the West Bank.  
What are the odds of this actually happening? Only Netanyahu knows. Only he can decide whether to save Israel or let it continue to fall. Only Netanyahu - not Obama.

<title>Is Israel a normal country? </title>
<date>Fri Jul 09 08:22:54 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 Israel's decision in May to drop commandos onto a flotilla of pro-Palestinian activists was brutal. The killing of nine civilians by those commandos was a terrible consequence. Israel's blockade of Gaza and occupation of Palestinian territories in the West Bank, not to mention the road blocks, destruction of homes and other daily torments of the Palestinians, are also a form of institutionalized inhumanity. 
 Nevertheless, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's description of the Israeli raid on the activists' boat as "an attack on the conscience of humanity" which "deserves every kind of curse," and as a "turning point in history" after which "nothing will be the same," seems hysterical. Whatever one thinks of various Israeli governments  (and I don't think much of the current one ), reactions to Israeli government-sponsored violence tend to be much fiercer - not just in Turkey - than reactions to crimes committed by the leaders of other countries, with the exception perhaps of the United States. But then, in the minds of many critics, the two countries are often conflated. 
 Israel has never done anything comparable to the late Syrian leader Hafez Assad's 1982 massacre of more than 20,000 members of the Muslim Brotherhood in the city of Hama. Far more Muslims are still being murdered by fellow Muslims than by Israelis, or indeed by Americans. And if one thinks of the death toll wreaked by the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo - more than 4 million - talking of turning points in history, after the killing of nine people, sounds a little absurd. 
 But none of that seems to count as much as what Israel does. 
 So is it true, as many defenders of Israel claim, that the Jewish state is judged by different standards than other countries? I believe that it is. But, while anti-Semitism certainly plays a part, it may not be the main reason. 
 Especially after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, many Europeans, I suspect, sighed with relief that Jews could be aggressors, too. Jewish brutality relieved the burden of wartime guilt. Eagerness to overcome this guilt might even have prompted some people to exaggerate Israeli aggression. The old anti-Semitic slogan, promoted by the Nazi newspaper Der Stuermer, that "the Jews are our misfortune," has been given new currency by the Israeli conflict with the Palestinians. 
 There are other reasons, however, for the double standard directed at Israel. One is what the liberal Israeli philosopher and peace activist Avishai Margalit has termed "moral racism." The bloodlust of an African or Asian people is not taken as seriously that of a European - or other white - people. After all, some might say  (and many more might think ), what can one expect from savages? They don't know any better. 
 This is, of course, a deeply colonial sentiment, and the legacy of colonialism works against Israel in another way, too. As was true of apartheid-era South Africa, Israel reminds people of the sins of Western imperialism. Israel is regarded in the Middle East, as well as by many people in the West, as a colony led by white people  (despite the fact that many prominent Israelis have their roots in Tehran, Fez or Baghdad ). The Palestinians are seen as colonial subjects, and the longer Israel continues to occupy Arab territories, the more this perception will be confirmed. 
 Finally, Israel is still a democracy, and as such should not be judged by the same standards as dictatorships. We must expect more of Benjamin Netanyahu's government than of, say, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's regime in Iran - not because Jews are morally superior to Persians, but because Netanyahu was freely elected and is subject to the rule of law, whereas Ahmadinejad has helped to destroy whatever was democratic about Iran. In a sense, to hold Israel to the highest standards is to pay it the compliment of being treated like a normal democracy. 
 If some critics of Israel refuse to treat it as a normal country, however, the same is true of some of Israel's staunchest defenders. Special pleading for Israel as a nation of victims - the natural heirs of the targets of Nazi mass murder - is another way to apply a double standard. The French philosopher Alain Finkielkraut was right to criticize Erdogan for overreacting to the raid on the "Gaza freedom flotilla." But, by adding that Hitler's "Mein Kampf" is a best-seller in Turkey, he implied that Erdogan's Turks are modern-day Nazis. 
 Israel as a nation of victims is, in fact, contrary to its founders' creed. They wanted to create a new nation, a normal nation, a nation of good Jewish soldiers and farmers, different from the powerless Jews who fell victim to European persecution. It was only later, starting perhaps with the Adolf Eichmann trial in 1961, that the Holocaust became a staple of state propaganda. Later still, under such leaders as Menachem Begin, military enterprises were justified by references to the Nazi genocide. 
 That all Jews, including Israeli Jews, should remain haunted by a horrible past is understandable. But it must never be used to justify aggression against others. Israel is an immensely powerful country - freer, richer and better armed than all of its neighbors. Holding its leaders to account for their actions is essential, not only to protect Palestinians from brutality, but to preserve the freedom of Israelis. Allowing the past to cloud our critical faculties undermines Israeli democracy, and will have further dangerous consequences in the future.

<title>Israel demands peace from Palestinians as its own racism spreads</title>
<date>Sun Mar 14 03:15:01 IST 2010</date>
<content>
The Strategic Affairs Ministry never ceases to bring us peace of mind. How nice to know that someone in Israel is monitoring Palestinian incitement, ensuring they "create an environment of peace" and striving "to push them toward a culture of peace". After all, what do we care about construction in Jerusalem, Efrat or Ramat Shlomo, or about checkpoints, arrests, home demolitions, the army's "neighbor policy," bone breaking, land appropriation or the blockade of 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza?  
All of these are minor issues compared with naming a square near Ramallah after Dalal Mughrabi, a Palestinian woman who took part in a bloody terror attack three decades ago, calling for confronting the occupation or referring to suicide bombers as martyrs. These are the real threats to peace. After all, according to the road map, the Palestinians are responsible for ending incitement. After we have meticulously fulfilled everything the road map required of us and completely frozen settlement construction, it's now their turn.  
Yossi Kuperwasser, the deputy director of the Strategic Affairs Ministry and a generally bright man who once headed the Military Intelligence research department, explains that there are several categories of incitement. These include encouraging others to commit terrorist acts, demonizing Israel and creating an atmosphere of hostility toward it. The fact that the occupation persists in the Palestinian territories, and that any nation under occupation will do virtually anything to rid itself of this arrangement, is apparently missing from his consciousness. 
In his view, when Palestinians get up in the morning they begin cursing Israel and plotting its erasure from the map and school textbooks through the noble acts of their martyrs. The members of the team tasked with monitoring incitement disingenuously assert that there is no difference between scrutinizing this kind of incitement and monitoring anti-Israel rhetoric emanating from Europe or the United States. The difference, however, is profound: Israel hasn't occupied France or Cleveland, or destroyed a single home there.  
Incitement is an elusive affair. How, for example, would the monitoring team classify the following remarks: "The political statement made by [Scandar] Copti turned 'Ajami' from a movie into another link in the fight waged by the Palestinians in Israel against the state of which they are citizens. That makes it just like disrespecting the memory of the Olei Hagardom [pre-state Zionist militants executed by British authorities in the Mandate period] or accusing Israel of being an apartheid state even though the Israeli Palestinians' rights as citizens here exceed those of any Arab country (and include supernumerary rights, such as exemption from mandatory military service) .... Among those contributing to hatred of Israel are, in addition to filmmakers, Israeli intellectuals and artists from other disciplines - and for exactly the same reasons that the filmmakers are so eager to make their self-flagellating films."  
Did the writer of these words in these pages (Israel Harel, March 11) intend to incite against Arab citizens of Israel or against Israeli intellectuals? Wouldn't it be more appropriate to examine instances of incitement in Israel before sticking our nose into the affairs of an occupied nation?  
Here is a good place for the monitoring team to start: a poll conducted by the Maagar Mochot research institution and presented recently at a Tel Aviv University conference shows that 56 percent of Israeli high school students believe that the country's Arab citizens should be prohibited from being elected to the Knesset. That figure rises to 82 percent among religious youths. Around half the respondents say Israeli Arabs should not receive the same rights as Israeli Jews. In the words of Prof. Daniel Bar-Tal of the Tel Aviv University School of Education: "The worldview of religious youth melds fundamentalism, nationalism and racism."  
If using the criteria of the monitoring team, Bar-Tal's remarks could be considered incitement against religious youth, or even Israeli youth in general. Before we file an indictment against Bar-Tal, however, we should return to Kuperwasser's comment that the purpose of the incitement index is to convince the Palestinians to create a "culture of peace." With whom exactly are they expected to build such a culture? With Israel's young generation, which sees Israeli Arabs as a dangerous foe from whom democratic rights should be withheld? With inciters who see an Arab film director, or the Jewish intellectuals who support him, as enemies of the state?  
The incitement index is not intended to actually gauge the measure of hatred Palestinians feel toward Israel, or to create the vaunted culture of peace. It is simply another dishonest tool being used to present Israel as a pure, righteous and peace-loving nation, all of whose citizens love Arabs. This is a veil intended to conceal the fact that, while a culture of peace is being demanded of the Palestinians, the Israeli side is witnessing an unimpeded spread of a culture of racism.

<title>Israel's apartheid doesn't stop at the West Bank</title>
<date>Wed Mar 03 01:40:12 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Here is a civics lesson about the Zionist heritage, which has recently basked in the limelight of another government decision.  
It has often been observed that poetry and lies have much in common, and this also applies to the state of Israel's founding document - the Declaration of Independence. It will "foster," it told me, "the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants... it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants." The document also calls upon "the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel" - not the "members of minorities," so beloved by the Zionist media - "to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the State on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions."  
However, since its establishment the state has not kept its promise. It continues to conduct itself like a Zionist occupation regime on every inch of the land. True, the military government has been lifted and "the Arab inhabitants" are usually free to move around in their homeland and even send representatives to the Knesset - but this is the sum total of the equality that was formulated and promised.  
The alienation between Arabs and Jews can be seen everywhere. It has not arisen solely in the context of the national conflict, but is rather a result of an establishment policy which has expropriated Arabs' lands to build communities "for Jews only" and has pushed the Arab inhabitants into localities under an "ethno-Zionist siege" on all sides.  
The Israel Police, which is responsible for maintaining public law and order, provides the most blatant evidence that the Israeli regime behaves as if it is a foreign regime. It abandons the Arab localities to the rule of criminal gangs, intervening only when concern arises that the crime might spill over into Jewish locales. The Arab alienation from the police - a symbol of the regime - is apparent, among other things, in the absence of Arabic writing on police vehicles. How does an Arab citizen feel about a police force that appears in his community, but does not include any writing in his language? Does this not symbolize, more than anything else, that the police represent an occupation regime, a foreign regime? How would the inhabitant of some Jewish locale feel if there were no writing in Hebrew on police vehicles, but only a foreign language?  
The alienation is also evident with regard to the central government. This is the only democratic country in the world where one-fifth of the citizens - who are declared to have equal rights, at least on paper - have no representation in the government or in "provisional and permanent institutions." And this is the case even before we start talking about budgetary allocations, master plans, the building of cities and communities, education, culture, industrialization and more.  
This national alienation is evident in the apartheid reflected throughout the media. Anyone watching talk shows on television will immediately notice a balance in terms of the guests in the studio: There is a religious person and a secular person, a settler and someone from Peace Now. Only the Arab citizen is absent from every discourse.  
Were the Arab Knesset members blessed with any imagination, they would pull the words "on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions" out of the Declaration of Independence and formulate them into a bill. After all, what makes a malicious Jewish populist any better than a malicious Arab populist? There is no dearth of Arab populists who would feel right at home with the Jewish populists in the studios or on ministerial committees. If the proposal is accepted, we will advance the principle of equality. If it is rejected, we will have exposed the lies and deceit of those who take the name of the Declaration of Independence in vain.

<title>Israel's legislation could eventually serve its enemies</title>
<date>Mon Nov 01 05:14:00 IST 2010</date>

The proposed law for the amendment of the communal cooperative directive − which enables admissions committees of small communities to reject candidates if they don’t meet certain criteria − is a wolf in lamb’s clothing.
At first glance, the proposal, which was approved by the Knesset’s Constitution, Law and Justic Committee, bans these committees from refusing to accept a candidate “exclusively on the basis of race, religion, sex, nationality or physical disability.” In actual effect, owing to a formula that allows as criteria for admissions “the lack of a candidate’s suitability for the community’s social-cultural fabric,” the proposal allows for the disqualification of anyone who is not a Zionist, meaning Arabs, and other types of “unsuitable” candidates. In this way, the proposal joins continuing discrimination against the Arab public in the housing sector, as well as a series of proposed laws that seek to harm this population.
The Arab population in Israel suffers from ongoing discrimination in housing and land allocation resulting from massive expropriation in the past, unwillingness to expand areas for building in Arab towns and villages and the lack of an authorized development plan in many of these communities. In addition to discrimination in many areas, such as education and employment, there is a growing sense that Arabs in Israel are not citizens who enjoy equal rights, and that what is now at play is policy designed to drive them away.
The result is mounting hostility between Arabs and Jews in Israel. There are those, such as Prof. Ruth Gavison, who support the notion of “separate but equal” in principle. Yet even these people must acknowledge that under existing circumstances of disparity, the barring of Arabs from communal settlements is discriminatory toward them. The foul odor of racism wafts from the desire to keep Arabs out of the communal settlements. Types of justification marshalled to warrant this approach, such as fears of decline in property values, of intermarriage or of outbreaks of violence, are dubious.
How would we respond were such arguments hazarded against Jews in another country? Weighing against the racially based preferences of Jewish individuals to live exclusively with people of their own religious group, there is the right of a minority not to be humiliated by prohibitions against belonging to a certain group. This right has prerogative.
The issue in question is not just the liberty of a resident to choose his neighbors. It is also the way the state allocates its economic assets. In such allocations, the state has no right to discriminate on a national-ethnic basis. Should we accept the assumption that the arguments utilized to justify the barring of Arabs from the communal settlements take precedence over the rights of equality and human dignity, then these arguments would apply not just to the small communities but also to all forms of settlement in Israel, including cities that lack traits of planned communal villages.
Such a possibility has no legitimacy in a democratic society. There is thus a straight line connecting this proposed law and calls issued by rabbis in Safed not to sell or rent apartments to Arabs. So long as the state has a Jewish majority, its Jewish character will be preserved. This difference between majority and minority justifies settlements for Arabs ‏(or vegans‏) alone, but not for Jews only. Since Jews are the majority, there is no concern about the preservation of their group identity, where the Arabs are a minority, and their collective identity is threatened.
The national isolationism that this proposal is designed to promote will deepen alienation and hostility. As things stand, separation between Arabs and Jews in Israel is extreme: There are scarcely any joint educational, residential or military service frameworks. A Jewish-Israeli can go through life without meeting an Arab-Israeli. That is how fears, stereotypes and malice is engendered.
No doubt, the proposal promotes the Yisrael Beiteinu party’s vision of making the Arabs disappear, and, until that time, of knocking them down in the hopes that they will lose their bearings. It is also clear that should the law be passed, the Knesset will notch a major “achievement” − the provision of ammunition to enemies of Israel who claim that it is a racist, Apartheid state.

<title>It's not the PR, stupid </title>
<date>Tue Jun 08 01:53:00 IDT 2010</date>

The core of Israel's atrocious failure in handling the Gaza flotilla isn't on the operational side, and not even in the clumsy planning and implementation of the public-relations aspects. It isn't even a matter of the policy of blockading Gaza, which has ceased serving its purpose and has become a millstone around our necks. The source of the debacle lies in our inability to grasp the nature of the campaign against us, and what conclusions must be drawn.
Having failed to defeat us by force, our remaining enemies have shifted their efforts to trying to weaken the world's support for the justice of our cause and to delegitimize our very existence. They are doing this systematically and ardently in all arenas, with a readiness to make sacrifices and use any means.
Regrettably, they are achieving substantial success. This is the common denominator of the world's response to the outcome of the flotilla raid, the reference to Israel by the recent Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference, the Goldstone report and the articles about the alleged nuclear cooperation between Israel and the apartheid regime in South Africa. They all depict Israel as a nefarious state with an irresponsible, trigger-happy leadership that indiscriminately uses illegitimate means and meets every problem with brutal, vengeful force.
And we play right into their hands. Again and again, we make our few friends left sick of us, and over and over we push the skeptics and neutrals into the arms of our inveterate hate-driven foes. We contribute to this not only by balking at peace, continuing "illegal"  (as we call it ) settlement, wanton misconduct in the territories, and barring intellectuals from entering Israel. We are also our callous toward the many Arab citizens who wish to continue living with us in peace as Israelis.
The delusionary attitude of rabbis and leaders toward Jews whose only sin is that they belong to the Reform or Conservative movements or are, God forbid, dark-skinned, drives many of our people away from us. On top of all this comes our bear hug of evangelical Christians.
We fail to take advantage of our opportunities to expound on our positive credo to the world, or to fulfill it. Our prime minister has avoided taking a leading role in the environmental struggle and halting global warming, just as he has recoiled from presenting our vision of disarmament and from appearing at the nuclear security summit convened by the U.S. president. These are all areas in which Israel has not only a clear interest, but also a favorable record. All we have left for the world is for it to see us using force, even when it is unnecessary and devoid of any sense, including innumerable apparent breaches of international norms, from piracy on the high seas to the misuse of foreign passports.
True, there is an abundance of hypocrisy and shortsightedness in the world, and our enemies exploit it at every opportunity. But we, by acts of both commission and omission, abet them. The reserves of tolerance toward us are running out at a terrifying rate. The debate over whether Israel has the right to exist is no longer confined merely to marginal academic circles in Britain or bleeding-heart trade unions in Norway. The legitimization of our continued existence is in peril.
This is not a PR problem of how to explain ourselves. This is first and foremost the outcome of a muddleheaded and shortsighted policy, guided by neither a moral compass nor long-range self-interest. Our fight is essential and right, but in diplomacy as in driving a car, to survive, you have to be smart, not just right.

<title>It's our duty to challenge Israel's law of segregation</title>
<date>Mon Dec 27 02:38:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Ilana Hammerman's articles challenge us to ask what the role of a citizen is in a country where the law is illegal. In this space known as Israel and the occupied territories, the space guarded by Israeli soldiers, there are six groups with different rights and different levels of freedom of movement, according to the law.
The first group consists of about 1.5 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, who have been under a prolonged closure for years, with only a small number of persons bearing special permits allowed to leave. The second group is the 2.4 million Palestinians in the West Bank, barred from entering Jerusalem or Israel proper unless they have special permits, which they can receive only in exceptional cases from the military authority known as the Civil Administration. The settlements, all of which are illegal by international law, have stolen 44 percent of West Bank land for Jewish settlers. They have been surrounded by patrol and access roads, on which Palestinians are not allowed to travel. The roads from one place to another inside the territories are also blocked by hundreds of checkpoints. The freedom of movement of almost all Palestinians in the West Bank is limited - to inside the West Bank only.
The third group is the quarter-million Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, who have blue identity cards and can travel in Israel, Jerusalem and parts of the West Bank, but whose travel outside of that space is controlled and restricted by Israel. Jerusalem Palestinians who leave the city to study abroad, or even in Bethlehem, lose their status of "permanent residents," which signifies their future temporary presence in the city.
The Palestinian citizens of Israel are the fourth group, and supposedly have the same freedom of movement as the fifth group: the Jewish citizens of Israel. Neither group is allowed to enter Gaza or the main cities in the West Bank. But the law allows Jews from the whole world and from Israel to settle in Israel and the territories, and to receive Israeli citizenship, while forbidding - with the endorsement of the Supreme Court - Palestinians from the first, second, third and fourth groups to intermarry and decide where to live together.
The sixth group is asylum seekers and migrant laborers, whose freedom of movement is restricted and who live in fear of being deported. While this group is new here, after 43 years of occupation, the regime that separates different groups of people with different rights is not temporary and resembles the apartheid regime.
In South Africa, too, the apartheid system was created thanks to detailed legislation that determined who had the right to vote, who had the right to live where, which persons had to carry passes to stay in white cities and which lived there by right, and which were considered strangers in the very cities in which they were born and grew up. Apartheid was not only a system of racial discrimination maintained by the military through the use of extreme force, but a system of discrimination regulated by legislation.
The State of Israel also emphasizes, both to its own citizens and the international community, that it is a state of law; the occupied territories are administered by a system of laws, orders and directives. The Supreme Court expanded its jurisdiction into the territories. Furthermore, Israel has signed most of the main international conventions on human rights  (although with significant reservations ), and invests considerable efforts in maintaining the rule of law. Like in South Africa, separation and discrimination are enforced by the law.
Like Ilana Hammerman, I too refuse to obey illegal laws. In a country where spacious prisons were built under the protection of the law, in which people live in fear, it is not only our right but our duty to offer a space of hope. As long as we do not have agreed-upon borders, we are living in an occupying country that discriminates between the rights of different groups based on their ethnicity.
In such a country, just like in South Africa under apartheid, it is our right and our duty to challenge the legality of the law.

<title>Legitimizing an obstacle to peace</title>
<date>Wed Sep 08 08:02:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
I feel compelled to speak out on the controversy surrounding the Israeli artists who have announced their refusal to perform in the territories. For the record, my career as a performer has spanned 68 years. In my 20s, I was a cofounder of the Cameri Theater in Tel Aviv ‏(of that group, I am the last one alive‏). I have resided in America since 1954, and as a concert artist I frequently work in the field of Jewish culture, performing in the languages of our people − Hebrew, Yiddish, Ladino and even in English, the language spoken by the largest Jewish community in the world.
As president of the Associated Actors & Artistes of America ‏(the umbrella union covering performers in the United States‏), I have often spoken out in opposition to cultural boycotts. I have argued that art opens minds and builds bridges, even when carried into the very heart of enemy territory − perhaps especially then. But life, as we know it, often defies simple formulas. In the political arena, artists make a statement by their presence or their absence.
Pablo Casals, the world-famous cellist, who chose life-long exile from his native Spain because of the fascist dictator who ruled the beloved country of his birth, said this: “My cello is my weapon; I choose where I play, when I play, and before whom I play.”
My own choices have often been dictated by similar sentiments. For many years, when apartheid was the law of the land there, I refused official invitations and lucrative offers to perform in South Africa. Indeed, I have always refused to appear in halls that were racially segregated, whether in America or elsewhere in the world. More than two years ago, I refused an invitation by the mayor of Ariel to appear at the opening of the very same cultural facility then under construction and now at the center of the controversy.
There are weighty reasons why I find myself in full support of the artists’ refusal to perform in the territories. And it should be noted that I am not alone in supporting the courageous stand of our Israeli colleagues. There is a growing list of over 150 prominent artists and arts leaders from the U.S. who have expressed similar concerns to mine.
The cause celebre regarding the new performance facility in Ariel has given rise to statements from the leaders of that community as well as from Prime Minister Netanyahu and the culture minister, Limor Livnat. While the latter asserts that “political disputes should be left outside cultural life and art,” both the prime minister and the settlers’ council make it clear that the matter is not about art at all, but about what they call an attack on Israel “from within.” 
The declaration of conscience signed by prominent Israeli artists − among them recipients of the Israel Prize, the highest cultural accolade given by the state − is characterized as emanating from “anti-Zionist leftists” and is described by the prime minister as being part of an “international movement of delegitimization.”
Clearly, anything that is connected to the settlers or to the settlements’ presence beyond the Green Line is political. And, if the refusal of the artists to perform in the territories is tantamount to delegitimization, it follows that any agreement to perform there would amount to legitimizing what many of us ‏(in and outside of Israel‏) believe to be the single most glaring obstacle to peace.

<title>Liberal Diaspora Jewry afraid to talk, afraid to be silent </title>
<date>Fri Jun 11 01:18:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
LONDON - Last week I wrote a comment piece for the Guardian comparing the Israeli attack on the Gaza aid ships to the British assault on the Exodus in 1947. The comparison between the two events is far from exact, but both involved the running of a naval blockade as a public relations stunt, and both succeeded in dramatically winning over world opinion. In each case a more complex narrative told by the other side went unheard. Israel has failed to convince the public in Europe that those on board included terrorists smuggling arms to Hamas, and that they attacked the Israeli commandos first. As in 1947, rightly or wrongly, the sympathy was with those whose vessels were boarded, not those doing the boarding.
Here in Britain, for the most part, ordinary people don't care about the complicated story of the Middle East. They don't buy the line that Israel stands on the front line of the war against terror. They may know of the impoverished city of Sderot and the rocket fire it faced over time, but in the balance sheet of life and death - when, in a densely packed strip of earth blockaded from all directions, children are made to go without food, toys and medicines - human sympathy has little difficulty attaching itself to the victims.
Early on Friday morning I turned on my computer to see if my piece had run. It hadn't. I fired off an e-mail to my editor to ask what had happened, and settled down to read Anshel Pfeffer's June 4 column on Haaretz.com, in which he made the case that the Diaspora had failed Israel by not being the friend it needed. The close, loyal, loving friend who can tell you bluntly when you are destroying yourself.
In 2000, I published a novel about pre-state Tel Aviv, and a few years later, a nonfiction book about the months I spent observing the people on one block of Ben Yehuda Street in that same city. I define my political orientation as being on the left - the same left as authors David Grossman, Amos Oz and Etgar Keret, though not the left of historian Ilan Pappe. So Pfeffer's piece spoke to me.
After I finished reading the column, my e-mail pinged. It was the Guardian editor. My piece had been published in the newspaper's print edition, but was being held from the online site until after 8 A.M., when a dedicated moderator to monitor readers' comments would become available. Since the beginning of the week, she told me, the site's supervisors had been dealing with "appalling levels of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and hatred."
This is the tight place in which liberal Jews in the Diaspora find ourselves, and we can hardly breathe, let alone speak. Wanting to articulate the same critique of Israeli policy as Israeli critics, we find ourselves adding our voices to a condemnation of the Jewish state, which is turning into hate speech here. There is no evil crime of which Israel cannot be accused: It's an outlaw state, a pariah state, a demonic force. Calls for an end to the occupation are now regarded as merely propping up Zionism, an apartheid system. The right of return is sacred; the law of return is a racist abomination.
An Indian novelist I met 18 months ago said he had been warned against me. "She's a Zionist," he had been told, as if I was a carrier of bubonic plague. In Europe, public opinion is tending in one direction only: An anti-Zionist narrative is being articulated in the media, and "soft" public opinion is being dragged along in its wake - especially among people who don't know much about Israel or Palestine, but see best-selling Swedish novelists whose books are dramatized on British TV, and Irish Nobel Peace Prize winners on a mercy mission to aid a civilian population. A one-state solution, just like South Africa? Sounds lovely, they say.
Since the Spanish Civil War, the left has allied itself to a succession of progressive causes. In my lifetime these have been Czechoslovakia, Nicaragua, Northern Ireland, South Africa. They are the struggles according to which you define your politics. Today it is Palestine. In the British media, critical pro-Israel voices are drowned out by pro-Palestinian ones and the angry American Zionist right. Either you're a supporter of apartheid or a self-hating Jew.
In such a climate, it is very difficult to speak at all. To critically support Israel is to discredit your own progressive values - to be a pariah in the artistic and intellectual communities that are your natural home. To feel you can't stay shtum a moment longer and must express outrage is to contribute to an environment in which anti-Semites cherry-pick your words for their own abusive propaganda. To stay silent is the peaceful alternative, but for a writer the one that seems most shameful.

<title>Like Netanyahu, Barak wants second shot as prime minister </title>
<date>Wed Feb 10 01:59:14 IST 2010</date>
<content>
His career has been eulogized more than once. They said he would never be leader again, that he was insensitive, arrogant and disconnected from the people. They reckoned that his party was disintegrating and predicted that he would defect to the rival camp and glean crumbs from the table of his historical antagonist. All the same, Ehud Barak is returning to the center of the political arena and has once again joined the list of candidates for prime minister. A Haaretz-Dialog survey published last Friday confirmed a gut feeling: Barak is the most popular person in the cabinet.  
True, he came last in that list of candidates for the premiership, and true, defense ministers always enjoy support in times of peace. But the elections will not take place tomorrow, and Barak is not running for prime minister right now. The survey shows that Barak has overcome the public's disgust and is once again considered legitimate. That's all he needs for the moment.  
Barak's comeback campaign has been going on for a few weeks, after a lengthy period during which he was seen as the copilot to his former subordinate in the military, Benjamin Netanyahu. It does not suit Barak to serve as number two, and he is behaving like his old self again and trying to separate himself from the prime minister. The lack of a border with the Palestinians "within the historic Land of Israel" is a greater threat than the Iranian bomb, Netanyahu declared, when he spoke at Auschwitz about the Islamic Republic, "the new Amalek." Barak wants peace with Syria, even at the price of returning the Golan Heights. Netanyahu doesn't.  
Barak likes attacking the "left" for its naivete and blindness, but he has adopted the left's generations-old knockout argument: If we do not partition the land between us and the Palestinians, Israel will become an apartheid state. Like his great rival, Ehud Olmert, Barak has concluded that only partition can save Zionism. Netanyahu is someplace else. He ostensibly backs a two-state solution, but now he is trying to overcome the demographic threat by giving the vote to Israelis living abroad. He will accompany negotiations with the Palestinians with a propaganda campaign against anti-Israel incitement in the Palestinian Authority.  
A tipping point in the delicate equilibrium between the prime minister and the defense minister became evident during the brouhaha over the Netanyahu family's maid. Barak, too, had maid troubles, which on the face of it were far more serious. Mr. and Mrs. Barak employed an illegal migrant, whereas Bibi and Sara's maid was legally employed and only complained of bad working conditions.  
But Barak ignored the matter, making do with a noncommittal statement from his office, while Netanyahu accused the media of persecuting him and took advantage of a state visit to Germany to defend his wife publicly. Barak never implored the media "to leave Nili alone," and his insensitivity seems to have paid off in retrospect. Netanyahu slipped back into his old image, the pressured and sweaty one, while Barak displayed self-control and restraint - precisely the qualities the public wants for the hand on the red button.  
Barak has not changed. He has always been respected but not liked. As defense minister he is demonstrating the same capability as he did in the army - to read the situation correctly and avoid the snags that hit others. His proposal to end Operation Cast Lead after a number of days, as distinct from Olmert who wanted to go on and on, was justified, and it immunized him against the Goldstone report's allegations. Meanwhile, preparing the army for the mission and the low number of Israeli casualties were notched up to his credit.  
Barak's aspirations are based on two models. One is Yitzhak Rabin, who used his term as defense minister to correct his image as a weak prime minister and return to the helm as the national savior. The other is none other than Netanyahu, who received a divided and fractured Likud in 2006 and came back with it to government in 2009. Barak believes that if they succeeded, so can he. His chances depend on how the security situation plays out. If there is a national crisis, Barak could be called on to take over because of his experience and composure. An unsuccessful war could gravely damage his career, as happened to Moshe Dayan and Amir Peretz, and to Barak himself in the second intifada.  
During the Olmert period, Barak tried to moderate the prime minister's aggression, to delay or shorten military operations. His critics say he feared that Olmert would take all the credit. Will Barak behave the same way when Netanyahu brings the Iranian bomb issue up for a decision? Will he manage to leverage the crisis to his own advantage and come back to the leadership in a big way?

<title>Little Goldstones </title>
<date>Thu May 13 23:52:52 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 
 Sometimes you have to point out someone else's defects in order to expose your own. 
 There is absolutely no doubt: Richard Goldstone has turned out to have a defect, and it's no small one. It's not necessary to continue to coddle him after he has been found defective. A thousand excuses about constraints will not save his soul, from the time he consented to be appointed an appeals judge in the service of apartheid. Even the seal of approval given him after the fact by the African National Congress will not remove the stain. At best, he will be able to stand with those who repent. 
 If someone places his hand in the bosom of apartheid - even if he later removes it - his hand becomes leprous. This is the hand that signed execution orders and handed over the backs of children to be lashed. Although a penetrating and disturbing account can be received even from the hand of a leper, there is no obligation to shake that hand, and certainly not to wash it. 
 With the fall of Goldstone there are many people rejoicing here, because with him his report will fall. This is only the rejoicing of the poor in spirit, rejoicing about which we can ask: What is it doing here? After all, Israel itself cooperated with the regime of racial segregation, and the Pretoria government had no better friend that the government in Jerusalem. 
 This has always been our way: To relax for our own benefit on the darkened side of the globe, to spend time in the shadow of oppressive regimes. We have never refused an indecent offer from a leprous country, and a business permit has always been found for it. 
 It is hard to resist temptation; and the more disgusting the government, the more skilled it is at being tempted. 
 They tried once to tempt me, too: After I publicly expressed reservations about the special relationship between the two countries, the South African ambassador phoned and asked to meet. He invited me to visit his country. Of course my wife was invited too, of course I would meet with ministers and legislators in the capital and rhinos in the nature preserve, and of course we would also meet with opponents of the regime, if we so desired; the name of Archbishop Desmond Tutu was mentioned. 
 I refused. It's true that I wasn't offered a judgeship, but I didn't even want to be a temporary guest. 
 I don't care that stones are now being thrown at Goldstone - a real white intifada - but I wouldn't want to identify among those stone-throwers people who went at the time to investigate apartheid at his expense, and returned full of impressions. 
 We also have to make sure that the glass in our house will not shatter. Many are liable to be hurt - even judges - and mainly those who sit in judgment wearing uniforms. Although our military courts do not mete out death sentences, they end lives, and not necessarily according to due process of law, as Ilana Hammerman occasionally reports in her columns. 
 "Those were the laws at the time," the great Goldstone is now arguing in his defense, and without realizing it, in the defense of others like him; this country is full of little Goldstones, and somewhat bigger ones too. 
 When Georges Clemenceau realized during the Dreyfus trial how quickly the mills of justice grind, and how human beings are ground into human dust, he bequeathed us a perpetual insight: Military justice is to justice, he said, what military music is to music.

<title>Mideast peace needs prophets, not yes-men</title>
<date>Sat Aug 14 16:10:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
“After I visited Israel and wrote “The Shadow Over Israel” for Haaretz, many people asked me what “my position” was. “Position” is a military term and spatial metaphor, and space and time and functions of each other: positions alter as events unfold — but “my position” is that I wish the best outcome for all. But what is that outcome, and what are the alternatives?
Picture a minor prophet. Perhaps he’d be working today as an astrologer. He’s looking towards Israel and Palestine, consulting his charts and stars, getting a handle on the future. But the future is never single -- there are too many variables – so what he sees is a number of futures.
In the first one, there’s no Israel: it’s been destroyed in war and all the Israelis have been killed. (Unlikely, but not impossible.) In the second, there’s no Palestine: it’s been merged with Israel, and the Palestinians either slaughtered or driven beyond its borders. Israel has become completely isolated: international opinion has been outraged, boycott measures have been successful, financial aid from the U.S. -- both public and private – has evaporated, and the United States government, weakened by the huge debt caused by its Iraqi and Afghani wars and lured by the promise of mineral wealth and oil, has cooled towards Israel and swung towards entente with the Muslim world. Israel has become like North Korea or Burma – an embattled military state – and civilian rights have suffered accordingly. The moderate Israelis have emigrated, and live as exiles, in a state of bitterness over wasted opportunities and blighted dreams.
In the third future there’s one state, but a civil war has resulted, since the enlarged population couldn’t agree on a common flag, a common history, a common set of laws, or a common set of commemoration days -- “victory” for some being “catastrophe” for others. In the fourth, the one-state solution has had better results: it’s a true one-person, one-vote secular democracy, with equal rights for all. (Again, unlikely in the immediate future, but not impossible in the long run.)
In the fifth future, neither Israel nor Palestine exist: several atomic bombs have cleared the land of human beings, though wildlife is flourishing, as at Chernobyl. In the sixth, climate change has turned the area into a waterless desert.
But there’s another future: the seventh future. In this future there are two states, “Israel” and “Palestine.” Both are flourishing, and both are members of a regional council that deals with matters affecting the whole area. Trade flows harmoniously between the two viable states, joint development enterprises have been established, know-how is being shared, and, as in Northern Ireland, peace is paying dividends.
That, surely, is a desirable outcome, thinks the stargazer; but how was it achieved? Since he has the gift of virtual time travel, he leaps into the seventh future and looks back at the steps taken to get there.
The impetus came from within Israel. The Israeli leaders saw that the wind had shifted: it was now blowing against the earlier policy of crushing force and the appropriation of occupied lands. What had caused this change? Was it the international reaction to the destructive Cast Lead invasion of Gaza? The misjudged killing of flotilla activists? The gathering boycott activities in the United States and Europe? The lobbying of organizations such as J-Street? The 2010 World Zionist Congress vote to support a settlement freeze and endorse a two-state solution?
For whatever reasons, Israel had lost control of its own story. It was no longer Jack confronting a big bad Giant: the narrative of the small country struggling bravely against overwhelming odds had moved over to the Palestinians. The mantra, “Plant a tree in Israel,” was no longer respectable, as it evoked images of bulldozers knocking down Palestinian olive groves. Israel could not continue along its current path without altering its own self-image beyond recognition. The leadership read the signs correctly and decided to act before a peaceful resolution slipped forever beyond reach. Leaders are supposed to guide their people towards a better and more secure future, they thought: not over the edge of a cliff.
First, the Golan Heights was returned to Syria under a pact that created a demilitarized zone with international supervision. The few Israeli inhabitants were allowed to remain if they wished, though they then paid taxes to Syria.
Then, with the help of a now-friendly Syria, Hamas was invited to the peace negotiations. The enlightened leaders – with an eye to Northern Ireland -- realized that they couldn’t set as a precondition something that remained to be negotiated, so they didn’t demand the pre-recognition of Israel as a Jewish state. Hamas, to the surprise of many, accepted the invitation, as it had nothing to lose by doing so. Peace was made between Fatah and Hamas, and Palestine was thus able to present a single negotiating team.
The negotiations were complex, but people worked hard not to lose their tempers. Several North American First Nations negotiators were invited as coaches, as they had much long-term experience and patience, and –remembering South Africa – they knew that yelling and denouncing would not accomplish anything. As soon as they stepped off the plane, they smudged with sage to cleanse the region of its buildup of fear, anger, and hatred, and despair, and with sweetgrass to attract positive emotions.
The agreement took less time than expected, as happens when people are serious. Then the Occupation – disastrous for those in both countries, both physically and morally -- was over, and Palestinian independence was declared. A mutual defense pact was signed, along with a trade and development pact. As Israel had realized that it could not rest its foundation on international law while also violating that law, the borders reverted to those of 1967, with a few land swaps along the edges. Jerusalem was declared an international city, with both an Israeli parliament building and a Palestinian one, and access to the various holy sites for believers.
Gaza was joined to the West Bank by corridors, as in the East/West Germany of old; the ports were opened, and the fishing boats could sail once more. Development money poured in, creating full employment. The water situation was rectified, with fair-access agreements signed, pollution cleaned up, and more fresh water created through a new cheap solar-driven desalination process.
What about the difficult matter of the Settlements? The First Nations advisors cited some of their own precedents: settlers could stay in Palestine if they wished, under lease agreements. The leases and taxes paid by the settlers were a source of income to the Palestinian state, and as their products were no longer boycotted, the Settlements did better. On the whole, peace and security reigned. There was even a shared Memorial Day, in which all those fallen in past wars were honoured.
The seventh future is within reach -- the stars favour it -- but the stargazer knows that many prefer the status quo: there can be advantage as well as profit in conflict. However, change often comes abruptly, like the fall of the Berlin Wall, the storming of the Bastille, or the end of Apartheid. The amount of blood shed during such transitions – from none to a great deal -- depends on the wisdom of the leadership.
How to promote such wisdom? It’s a prophet’s traditional duty to lay out the alternatives – the good futures, and also the bad ones. Prophets – unlike yes-men -- tell the powerful not what they want to hear, but what they need to hear. “How can I put this?” thinks the stargazer. “Something beginning with the handwriting on the wall…?”

<title>Missing the forest </title>
<date>Sun Aug 08 01:17:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Sometimes you really can't see the forest for the trees. The forest of political, governmental and institutional racism in Israel is dark and deep. One particular tree in that forest happens to have Israelis all riled up: The state's handling of the children of migrant workers. In the shade of a nearby tree is the state's handling of these children's parents, but this excites the Israelis somewhat less. And there are many other poisonous trees in the forest: Citizenship laws, loyalty laws, conversion laws, the razing of Bedouin villages in the Negev and even the story of the Arab delivery man who was convicted of rape for pretending to be a Jew. Each one galvanized parts of society into action, and this is well and good; but few see the big picture, and the big picture is several times worse than the sum of its components.
Enlightenment came from an unexpected direction; it was Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, of all people, who accurately defined the problem. In deciding on these children's future, he said, the cabinet is torn between humanitarian considerations on one hand and Zionist considerations on the other. The prime minister of Israel himself presents them as a contradiction, and this is the story in a nutshell.
Each particular wrong must be fought, of course, but we must not forget that all comes down to one large, fundamental truth: Defining Israel as a Jewish state condemns us to living in a racist state. This is the new definition of Zionism that we have subscribed to, and until we realize that we will not be able to uproot all the wild weeds that have seeded themselves here lately. Were we to not expel the migrant workers' children but continue to raze Bedouin villages we would not solve a thing. We will continue to move from one injustice to another until we recognize the racist nature of the state.
Israel is not the only place where racism is on the rise. Europe and the United States are awash in a turbid wave of xenophobia; but in Israel, this racism is embedded in the state's most fundamental values. There is no other state whose immigration laws are blatantly and unequivocally based on the candidates' bloodlines. Jewish blood, whether authentic or dubious, is kosher. Other blood, from those of other creeds or nationalities, is unacceptable. No country throws its doors wide open to everyone, but while other states take social, economic and cultural considerations into account in Israel bloodline is the name of the game. How else are we to understand the fact that someone who was born here, who speaks the language, cherishes its values and even serves in the military, can be unceremoniously expelled while a member of the Bnei Menashe community in India or the grandson of a half-Jew from Kazakhstan are welcomed with open arms.
In contrast to what we have been told there is no significant argument in the wider world, and of course not in Israel, over the Jews' right to a state. The argument is about its character. There is also no argument about the justice of the Law of Return: Israel is the place of the Jews who want to live there. The real argument is over the law's exclusivity, over the fact that it applies only to Jews. That's where it all begins. One could understand the need after the Holocaust, the necessity in the first years of the state, but 62 years after the founding of the state the time has come to reexamine the long-obsolete concepts.
Does anyone actually know the meaning of the term "Jewish state" that we bandy about so much? Does it mean a state for Jews only? Is it not a new kind of "racial purity"? Is the "demographic threat" greater than the danger of the state's becoming a religious enthnocracy or an apartheid state? Wouldn't it be better to live in a just democracy? And how is it even possible to speak about a state being both Jewish and democratic? But anyone who tries to enter the cauldron of this debate, who tries to think outside the box of tired cliche, is automatically fated to delegitimization and slander. Just ask Avraham Burg, who last week announced his intention to set up a political party along those very lines.

<title>Mr. Prime Minister, douse the flames of racism </title>
<date>Mon Dec 20 01:27:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
"How would we feel if we were told not to sell an apartment to Jews?" asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [speaking at the National Bible Contest for Adults]. "We would protest, and we protest now when it is said of our neighbors." He added: "Such things cannot be said, not about Jews and not about Arabs. They cannot be said in any democratic country, and especially not in a Jewish and democratic one. The State of Israel rejects these sayings."  ("Netanyahu slams top rabbis' call to forbid renting homes to Arabs," Haaretz, Dec. 8 )
The prime minister spoke properly and correctly when he came out against the racist, despicable call by municipal chief rabbis not to sell or rent apartments to Arabs. But if the legislation concerning community admission committees' right to accept or reject potential members passes its upcoming second and third readings - the message promoted by those rabbis will receive additional validation from the Knesset. If they don't vigorously oppose that bill and try to prevent its passage, the Knesset, the government and the prime minister will in essence be saying that words are one thing, but deeds are another.
On the one hand, the rabbis' racism is condemned and democracy is praised. On the other hand, a law may be passed that allows membership committees to disqualify candidates from living in small locales on the basis of "the candidate's lack of suitability for the social-cultural fabric of the community." Meaning, disqualifying those who are not Zionist - in other words, Arabs.
It is worthwhile to point out that that supporters of the law do not even try to hide its purpose, which is to "Judaize" the Negev and Galilee and enable residents of small communities "to choose their neighbors," according to unclear criteria that make it possible to exclude minorities and other weak populations.
In our view, passage of such a law is like putting an obstacle in the way of a blind man. The law unleashes the racist "evil urge" that exists in one form or another in virtually everyone - the same urge that pushes people to want to live with neighbors like them and to reject the alien, the different, the minority. Even someone who is not a racist and never even thought about screening his neighbors, may do so the moment this law gives him the tools to do so. In this way the legislation in question is not only an expression of racism, but it also aids and abets it.
This bill - beyond its grave violation of the dignity of the person undergoing the admissions process, with its screening, labeling and diagnosis, just because he wants to live in a small community - will serve opponents of Israel in their claims that this is a racist apartheid state. If it becomes law, it could also serve anti-Semites who want to exclude Jews from their communities. In such cases Israel will not be able to protest, as the prime minister said, because a similar discriminatory and racist law will be on its books.
That is why it's time to turn Netanyahu's justified position into deeds. He must throw his entire weight and responsibility behind preventing passage of the admission committees' bill in the Knesset plenum.
The fire of racism fanned by this bill will not be doused by any super-tanker plane, and we certainly will not receive any help from the international community in this matter. The responsibility for heading it off rests with the prime minister and the Knesset.

<title>Netanyahu did one thing right in the Jerusalem debacle</title>
<date>Sun Mar 21 01:14:21 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In the sea of (justified) mudslinging at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, there is also room for a good word. Intentionally or not, the prime minister has revealed the lies about Jerusalem and presented things truthfully. Intentionally or not, Netanyahu has put the capital's occupied parts that the world does not recognize in their proper place: Ramot is the same as Psagot; Neveh Yaakov is the same as Kokhav Yaakov. There is no difference between Yitzhar and French Hill. They are all settlements, including Ramot, which was built in no-man's-land. Intentional or not, you have to appreciate Netanyahu's move.  
A revelation has come forth in Jerusalem: Most of it is a settlement. After decades in which we lied ourselves to pieces and rendered kosher that which was not - only to ourselves, not to any other country - the truth has been revealed. It has been revealed after years in which no one thought to call the residents of these giant neighborhoods settlers. Years in which Teddy Kollek, a Labor Party man and a man of peace, of course, was considered a "builder" and not the greatest of settlers. He settled more Jews in occupied areas than any settler leader. Years in which doubting the settlement enterprise was tantamount to heresy and treason. So of all people, this right-winger, Netanyahu, proponent of the Greater Land of Israel, has lifted the veil.  
The work of the righteous is sometimes done by others, as the saying goes. (Let's not forget the assistance of the Obama administration - its only real achievement so far.) From now on we will have to conduct ourselves in the neighborhoods in the occupied areas just as we do in the settlements in the occupied areas. Any additional construction will come at a heavy political cost. House demolitions in the city have already been completely stopped; we can thank Netanyahu and Obama for that, too. Those who wanted it all may now lose it all, and that's a good thing.  
How pleasant it was all those years to think that Jerusalem was ours alone. We did what we wanted, we enacted the Jerusalem Law, we annexed areas that were not ours and believed that this was enough to whitewash reality.  
Now, perhaps, it's over. Thanks to the Obama-Netanyahu team, questions will arise: What exactly is the difference between this occupation, which we never admitted to, and the occupation we have admitted to? What's the difference between the Shoafat refugee camp and the Deheisheh refugee camp? Why is it okay to issue blue ID cards to residents of the Shoafat refugee camp and allow them relative freedom of employment, and not to the residents of Deheisheh? Why does a Palestinian from Beit Hanina not endanger security when he drives on Israeli roads and even takes off from Ben-Gurion International Airport, while his friend from Abu Dis is a ticking bomb? After all, they are the same Palestinians - in Jerusalem as in nearby Bethlehem and distant Jenin.  
Why, in the framework of negotiations "without preconditions," are eastern and northern Jerusalem not up for discussion, when every provocative act of construction on the other side of the Green Line in the capital, which has hardly expanded westward at all, is intended to create unilateral "political facts" - in other words, preconditions? And we must not forget that this huge building project in Jerusalem is for Jews only; not one Palestinian neighborhood has been built in 43 years of occupation. Should that not be called apartheid?  
Even the new magic and foolish solution of the greatest master of words, President Shimon Peres, has persuaded no one: Israel, the president now tells his guests from abroad, has the right to build in "Jewish neighborhoods." And how, Mr. President, did they become Jewish, all of them on Palestinian land, if not by massive, illegal settlement, just like in Ariel, Ma'aleh Adumim and Gush Etzion, which are now within the "consensus" we invented for ourselves? Consensus? Only in Israel. And to a great extent this consensus, too, has been fabricated.  
And we have not yet said a word about "sanctity," another reason for demands for sovereignty and settlement. Since when is sanctity a value in a secular state? What does it have to do with sovereignty? And to how many Israelis in this city, in all its new Jewish neighborhoods and old Palestinian suburbs, is it indeed sacred? And is it sacred only to us?  
These are the questions. The answers may be given soon, thanks to Obama and Netanyahu.

<title>Our bleeding-heart prime minister </title>
<date>Fri May 28 00:52:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
How can we rely on those Palestinians? For 43 years, they have been building the settlers' homes with the sweat of their brows, paving roads for them and building their fences, and then suddenly, out of the blue, a boycott? Is that the way for partners to behave? Is that how they pay us back after we educated them for so many years to be our hewers of wood and drawers of water?
The prime minister, too, doesn't understand this ungratefulness. At the Likud faction meeting this week, he complained bitterly about the Palestinian Authority's decision to boycott 500 items produced in the settlements and to halt the work of the 6,000 people who are building settlers' homes. "They think they can do everything they want," the prime minister concluded angrily as his heart bled over the terrible injustice being done to us while the whole world looks on and says nothing.
But really, how can they do this to us? After all, we provide them with work, a living, a good life, wealth and happiness, and they respond with ill feelings. Do they not know that without Arabs it's impossible to build? After all, the boycott could force the settlers to build their homes themselves, and why should the lords of the land suddenly start working in construction? That's only good for the natives. That's why there's an occupation that can supply modern slaves who work for half price, just like during apartheid.
The Yesha Council of settlers also doesn't understand what the boycott is about. It responded with sharp words and denounced the "hostile act." MK Uri Ariel (National Union ) proposed a counter-boycott, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that it was "unacceptable for the Arabs to wage an economic war against us."
Shraga Brosh, the president of the Manufacturers Association, believes that it's a scandal; this view is shared by ministers Avigdor Lieberman and Benjamin Ben-Eliezer. Because only we are allowed to carry out a publicity campaign to buy "blue and white." They are forbidden to develop their economy because their very essence must be to support us, their good masters. It's a fact that we sell them all the surplus from our factories, all the rejects, as well as all the medicine that has expired. Otherwise where would they get medicine from? We also pass work on to them. They are the ones who sew our shoes and produce the coals for our barbecues on Independence Day, because, after all, any work is respectable.
During that Likud faction meeting, Netanyahu revealed a terrible secret, according to which "the Palestinians tried to prevent us from being accepted into the OECD." That's just one more scandal in a long series, because if this plot of theirs had succeeded, he wouldn't now be able to go to Paris, and then to Canada and the United States. He wouldn't be able to enjoy the expensive double bed that El Al installed for him on the plane because simple first class is not suitable for such a VIP.
Netanyahu doesn't understand why the Palestinians opposed our joining the OECD. After all, they must return us a favor for cutting down their olive trees and plundering their land, for the killings, curfews, roadblocks and administrative detentions. Don't they understand that when we join the OECD we will become richer, and then we'll raise their salaries, give them generous pensions, annual vacations, clothing and social benefits? After all, Netanyahu said at the faction meeting that "Israel is striving for an economic peace, and we are working all the time to advance the Palestinian economy." What nobility!
Netanyahu also doesn't understand how they can refuse to accept his generous offer for "economic peace" and continue to struggle for an independent state. It's true that economic peace means a peace between a horse and its rider, but after all, what does an Arab want? A pita and some olives. And we'll give them plenty of those. On the other hand, if they dare be independent, who can guarantee that enough olives will remain for them?
And Netanyahu has another reason for being angry with them. He said they are "polluting our water sources." Indeed, that is the height of inconsideration. After all, we invested hundreds of billions in the West Bank to set up fancy recycling plants for sewage water, and hundreds of billions more to improve the environment in their villages and towns. Just look at the fruits of our investments in the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, which are known for their quality of life, cleanliness, beauty, spacious classrooms and sewage and water facilities that work just like in Switzerland.
So how do they dare sidetrack the recycling plants and allow sewage to flow into the nearest wadi, which unfortunately leads the smelly water to "our water sources"? After all, everyone knows that all the water between the Jordan River and the sea is ours.
The high point of Netanyahu's bitter dirge about the Palestinians came when he explained that "they themselves will be harmed by the boycott," so it is wrong. At that point, it finally became clear to me that we are dealing with a humane and sensitive person of the first order. All his efforts are guided by concern for the Palestinians so that they should not be harmed by the boycott. And that's what doesn't allow him to sleep at night.
That apparently is also the reason he demanded that El Al install a special double bed on the flight to Paris. So that maybe, despite everything, he would be able to forget his concerns about the Palestinians for a few minutes and catch a little shut-eye.

<title>Pins in the Goldstone voodoo doll </title>
<date>Thu May 13 23:52:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
What will they come up with next? The campaign to discredit Judge Richard Goldstone, his fact-finding commission and the report that now bears his name seems to reach new heights every week. The latest installment in this high-drama farce has been the revelations about Goldstone's record during apartheid-era South Africa, and the implication that his report can therefore be disregarded. The mind reels at the intensity of attempts by Israeli officials and others to do everything to dodge the real questions of accountability, policy and justice that have been lingering inconveniently since Operation Cast Lead. But inconvenient questions do tend to linger, and the attempts to deploy an ever-thicker smokescreen usually only draw more attention to what may be hidden behind it.
And yet, the recent attacks on Goldstone have been helpful in re-introducing into public discourse what is perhaps the most important question of all: moral responsibility. How must individuals behave when faced with injustice? What do we expect from our judges, public servants and elected officials? And what do we expect from ourselves? The focus on Goldstone's past, far from enabling us to escape the lingering questions of Cast Lead - and other questions that must trouble anyone seeking justice - actually serves to throw them into sharp relief.
So here are some complementary questions about justice and those involved in its disservice. And mind you, these questions were not drawn from a far-away past, but from the here-and-now. It is the present that will determine our future - and to what extent justice will be a part of it.
Consider this: What is the reader's moral judgment of a law that allows some people to reclaim past ownership rights but denies the same rights to others? This is the question today in Sheikh Jarrah.
How just do we deem the conduct of legal advisers who approve the evacuation of longtime indigenous residents from the center of a thriving city, enforcing almost complete separation between the hundreds who have moved in and the thousands who were displaced? This is the question today in Hebron.
What do we think of military commanders who collectively punish more than a million human beings, systematically answering their nutritional needs with provisions that keep them just above a state-secret "red line"? This is the question today in Gaza.
What do you make of a court of justice that speaks in lofty terms of how wrong segregated roads are, but falls short of connecting principle and practice, and does not simply ban such wrongs outright? This is the question today regarding Route 443.
Morally speaking, how do you feel about a government that orders the arrest of leaders of nonviolent civil protest? This is the question in West Bank villages like Bil'in.
These were not questions about Goldstone's past. There are questions about our present. Standing knee-deep in moral quicksand may not be the most convincing of postures from which to question someone else's morality.
But let us not stop here. Let us go further and assume for a moment that Goldstone is indeed guilty as charged of having served an unjust regime. If you will, while at it, let us believe in the fiction that - as was falsely claimed by Im Tirtzu's extremists - a huge part of Goldstone's report was based on the work of Israeli human rights NGOs. So what? How does this information affect the real questions about justice and morality that should be concerning us? Do any of these diversions make the real questions about the Israel Defense Forces' rules of engagement during Cast Lead or about civilian, noncombatant casualties in Gaza during the military operation less urgent or essential?
At the end of the day, after Goldstone is finally exorcised as a witch and Israel's human rights NGOs shut down, what then? Won't accountability still be a cornerstone of the rule of law? Putting the diversions aside for a moment - and the author is appreciative of how difficult that is, given the government's urge to obsess on nothing but diversions - are we not still left with alarming suspicions, partial information, and a very real need for a credible, independent investigation into Cast Lead?
Not only Goldstone, but all of us, are morally responsible for our actions and inactions, for when we choose to speak out for justice and for when we keep our silence and help perpetuate what is unjust. South Africa's past became a part of its future through the truth and reconciliation process; but here in Israel not only is there no reconciliation process, there is no desire by the government nor among most of the public to confront inconvenient truths. Rather, the focus is on truth-dodging, which only serves to further steer us away from reconciliation or justice.
The growing distance between where the moral compass points and where we as a society are headed is no one's problem more than our own. We can stick pins in the Goldstone voodoo doll as much as we want to but, when we wake up tomorrow morning, the very same reality will still be right here, exactly as we left it. Morally speaking, it's high time for our wake-up call, for a sincere look at our own image as reflected in our mirror, for truth-seeking instead of desperately, cynically, self-servingly trying to hide it - and hide from it.

<title>Secret, and shameful, ties </title>
<date>Fri Feb 26 01:57:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
LONDON - The last time it was revealed that Israeli agents were using British passports, in 1987, Margaret Thatcher put her iron foot down. There was no intelligence exchange between the countries for a decade, and no Mossad station in London until its reestablishment here only a couple of years ago.
This time, with no one really doubting that Israel was behind the Dubai assassination of Hamas arms dealer Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, or that Mossad agents used fake passports from the United Kingdom and other states - Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been compelled, reluctantly, to express diplomatic indignation. Even initially sympathetic media outlets became outraged in their tone over last week's passport scandal, and since it is election season, the Conservative party leader, David Cameron, seized on the episode as a handy stick with which to beat Brown and his government.
Thus the Israeli ambassador was called in to provide explanations at the Foreign Office. Obviously, Ron Prosor had none to give, and the meeting was brief, though still, it should be said, convivial. No threats were leveled, apparently. There is still a long way to go down the carefully graded list of diplomatic demarche before anything serious will happen to bilateral relations.
Similarly, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband's 45-minute meeting with his counterpart Avigdor Lieberman in Brussels this week was just for show. The British don't take Lieberman seriously and have never asked to speak to him on any matter of genuine importance.
Of course, if further evidence of Israel's involvement in Dubai is uncovered, Jerusalem might have to own up discreetly, perhaps provide a few operational details. Some cooperation with the investigations of the Serious Organized Crime Agency and the Metropolitan Police might help placate Whitehall. A reprimand by the British government might follow, or a member of Israel's London embassy staff could agree to be made a scapegoat. But these are all diplomatic niceties, distractions from the real business afoot.
Mabhouh's absence may slow down arms shipments from Iran to Gaza, but the fallout from his assassination could make it harder for Israel to confront the much more serious Iranian threat. The worst-case scenario now is for bilateral intelligence-sharing to be suspended.
While the UK relies on Israel for much of its intelligence on Iran, not to mention other areas of interest in the Middle East, Israel also needs Britain on its side with respect to Iran, particularly because of its role in the European Union. With Russia and China blocking any serious action from the UN, Israel needs an EU initiative if sanctions are really to hurt Tehran. And Britain is both a permanent member of the UN Security Council and the EU 3+3 on the Iran issue, sharing that distinction only with France.
Yet Israel-Britain relations have not been at their warmest for the last year or two. For all Brown's repetitions of how he learned to love Zionism at his preacher-father's knee, bilateral links are not as close as under Tony Blair. Partly to blame for this were last year's Gaza incursion and the Goldstone report, which the UK declined to oppose in the United Nations; the requirement to label settlement-produced goods as such in the UK; and, of course, the attempted arrests of senior Israeli figures on war crimes charges.
As murky as this whole spy story has been, one thing is clear: The passports scandal has finished off any amendment to the law on universal jurisdiction, which is what allowed arrest warrants to be issued in the UK for alleged war crimes committed elsewhere. Theoretically, the necessary change in the law has the support of a majority in the House of Commons, including the shadow cabinet and most Labor MPs. But Brown is not going to risk a rebellion so close to the polls after such a public scandal.
"Israel has put the death of one Hamas guy over its relations with the UK," complained one pro-Israel lobbyist. "Why should the government stick its neck out for Israel when it's just done this?"
Even Israel's staunchest allies in Parliament are livid. "If it was Israel, it was outrageous," fumed MP Mike Gapes, a long-time member of Labor Friends of Israel and, perhaps more significantly, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. The illicit use of foreign passports, he said, "is one of the most appalling things another government can do. Our citizens around the world face the risk of being associated with an organization of criminal activity and murder."
For certain parts of the British establishment, open ties with Israel have always been awkward. One senior intelligence adviser tells of how he could not meet his Israeli counterparts at his office as it was frowned upon by his superiors, and was thus expected to receive intelligence from the Israelis in the backrooms of pubs and restaurants.
For now, Israeli diplomats in London can afford to be sanguine. But while the secret ties will remain strong, they will remain just that - secret, even shameful.
Israelis tire of being compared with apartheid South Africa, but they should remember that Britain once had clandestine intelligence-sharing links with Pretoria as well. That didn't make South African leaders welcome in London, even without the threat of arrest hanging over them. Jerusalem should be wary of becoming another dirty secret.

<title>Segregation of Jews and Arabs in 2010 Israel is almost absolute</title>
<date>Fri Oct 29 02:43:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Under the guise of the deceptively mundane name "Amendment to the Cooperative Associations Bill," the Knesset's Constitution, Law and Justice Committee this week finalized a bill intended to bypass previous rulings of the High Court of Justice. If indeed this legislation is approved by the Knesset plenum, it will not be possible to describe it as anything other than an apartheid law.
Ten years ago, the High Court of Justice ordered the town of Katzir to accept the family of Adel and Iman Kaadan, Arab citizens of Israel, as members of the community. Seven years later, the court issued a similar ruling against the Galilee village of Rakefet, which, like Katzir, is Jewish. Now, however, the legislature has come up with a proper "Zionist" response to the justices: If it becomes law, the amendment will give acceptance committees of communal villages the authority to limit residence in their towns exclusively to Jews.
Using polished and sanitized language, the bill would allow such committees in small rural suburbs to reject applications from families that "are incompatible with the social-cultural fabric of the community, and where there are grounds to assume that they will disrupt this fabric."
In other words, if admissions committees were previously forced to exercise some degree of creativity if they wanted to hide their national-ethnic grounds for rejecting Arabs, now, as Rabbi Akiva said, "All is foreseen, and freedom of choice is granted" (Pirkei Avot 3 ). Arabs? Not here. Sorry, the law is with us on this.
Those who feign innocence, including some from the center of our political map, will say, "The bill is not intended to keep out Arabs. What's wrong with supporting the right of communities to protect their unique way of life?"
Indeed, what is wrong with that? There's no argument that the vegetarians of Moshav Amirim, in the Galilee, have a right to defend themselves against an invasion of carnivores, just as the practitioners of transcendental meditation at Hararit, in the Misgav region, need to be able to meditate without interruption, but those communities are genuinely unique in character. This is not the case for the dozens of yeshuvim kehilati'im (literally, "community settlements" ) all over Israel, whose principal cultural feature is the fact that their residents are Jewish and Zionist - hardly a population under imminent threat, whose unique way of life needs protection.
Several months ago, we were given a glimpse of just how quickly the new law will be implemented, when several such villages, anticipating the Knesset's action, hurriedly established bylaws that effectively barred Arabs. In the communities of Yuvalim and Manof, in the Misgav area, applicants are now required to declare their allegiance to the Zionist vision, while in Mitzpe Aviv, a bit to the south, applicants must declare their identification with the values of Zionism and the definition of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.
It's not as if Arab families are standing in line to move to these gated communities, which were established mainly in the 1970s and '80s by Zionist organizations like the Jewish Agency and the Jewish National Fund for the purpose of "Judaizing" areas like the Negev and the Galilee. No one ever expected these towns to provide the answer to the horrendous housing shortage faced by Israel's Arab population. For them, not a single new town has been established since 1948, with the exception of a few impoverished Bedouin settlements in the Negev. Nor has the central government seen fit to assist or give approval to the existing Arab municipalities in the drawing up of master plans that would allow them to implement a program of growth and development to meet the needs of a growing population or mitigate their poor quality of life.
And this is without even mentioning cities like Upper Nazareth, Safed or Carmiel, where a variety of statements have been made - sometimes by the most senior municipal officials themselves - that are designed to push Arabs out or prevent their integration into these cities.
Segregation of Jews and Arabs in Israel of 2010 is almost absolute. For those of us who live here, it is something we take for granted. But visitors from abroad cannot believe their eyes: segregated education, segregated businesses, separate entertainment venues, different languages, separate political parties ... and of course, segregated housing. In many senses, this is the way members of both groups want things to be, but such separation only contributes to the growing mutual alienation of Jews and Arabs.
Several courageous attempts - particularly in mixed cities and regions - have been made to change the situation, bridge the rifts and promote integration. These range from efforts to develop mixed educational frameworks, to joint economic ventures and other interventions intended to foster good neighborly relations based on equal opportunity. Until now, these attempts addressed a situation of de facto segregation. From today, however, segregation will be de jure, to the shame of Israel.

<title>Settlers, tell us, what do you think will happen?</title>
<date>Sun Jan 03 01:10:18 IST 2010</date>
<content>
What constitutes the life of a settler? A house on the cheap; a standard of living above the national average; a job usually subsidized by the government; a fierce religious, nationalist, uncompromising conviction on the justness of his cause; a supportive, heavy-handed social environment; a highway system; transportation arrangements; socially enriching activities; and, at times, a life that comes with the risk of danger.  
The settler goes to and from his home without seeing anything. He does not see his neighbors, he does not see the danger he exposes his children to, he does not see the moral baggage he carries on his back. He does not want to see all this, and an entire system surrounds him that makes life easy for him despite his blindness.  
Some of the highways on which he drives are cleansed of Palestinians; he has never visited the neighboring villages, not one of whose names he would know were it not for traffic signs pointing in their direction. His teachers, functionaries and rabbis sketch out the scenery that is his world, leaving him no shred of doubt: the Arabs are terrorists, all of them are suspicious packages, and the Jews are allowed to do as they wish, for they are the lords of the land, and there is no other but they.  
He is convinced that he is a member of a special people, a light unto the nations, and that he, the settler, is the torch bearer at the vanguard. They preach to him on how his life is much more "principled" than that of other Israelis, those who have the misfortune of living in the sovereign State of Israel. There, they are Hellenizing, draft-dodging traitors and hedonists. And what of the settler? Well, he's a good Jew, the best there is, the last of the Zionists. Isn't that good enough? For he is also a victim, the only victim of terrorism, the victim of all Israeli society, constantly persecuted and deprived.  
It's hard to contend with such a well-oiled propaganda machine. Nothing can overcome it, not even cold, hard facts. Neither does the fact that the settler's residing in the territories violates international law, that most of the land on which his home sits was usurped from his neighbors by fraud or violence, that no country in the world recognizes his presence in the occupied territories. He will always explain how he was "sent" there by the government, even if he knew that moving into his new home sometimes was the result of deceit or invasion.  
The specter of being evicted from his home is what let him buy it cheaply in the first place, like all stolen property. Thus he should have known that his home is liable to be temporary, yet he sees his eviction as an "expulsion," "deprivation" and "an infringement of civil rights." The fat budgets devoted to him and the unfathomable political clout will certainly relieve him of his constant sense of injustice, as will the fact that no other Israeli minority group has extorted the majority and sown fear and terror for so many years. The settler is in his own domain: I am a superior individual and have been sent as an emissary to fulfill a commandment.  
Whether motivated by ideology or real estate, he is convinced that he will remain there forever. Now we must ask him in what direction (which is also our direction) is he headed? After years of hearing them say no - no to evacuation, no to a construction freeze, no to the High Court of Justice, no to international law, no to negotiations, no to America, no to the world - they must finally be made to answer the simple, cutting question: To what do you say yes? They will remain in the territories forever, there will be no negotiations, and of course there will be no peace, no to two states and no to civil rights for the Palestinians. Fine. Then what will there be, for heaven's sake?  
Go ask them. Try to get their opinion on how things will look here in another decade or two. For how many more years can 3.5 million people live without any civil rights? For how many more years will the world continue to turn a blind eye and remain silent? What will become of a state that is dependent on others like no other country? And what will happen when the Palestinians become the majority? The settlers will be evasive in their response. Make them give one.  
Let's ask and then try to understand. We will continue to indulge your religious whims and territorial lust, but give us an answer on where you think all this will lead. Will Jewish immigrants relocate to the territories by the millions? And if not? Will the Arabs continue to compromise, beg and submit? And if they don't? Will the Palestinians live forever under apartheid conditions? And if they don't? Will the world keep quiet and will America continue to act like Israel's patron state? And if not?  
Perhaps God will help. But what if he doesn't?

<title>Sharon's real legacy - keeping the Arabs out of sight</title>
<date>Wed Jan 13 02:31:15 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Let's assume the optimistic forecast by special U.S. envoy George Mitchell comes true and in two years the establishment of an independent Palestine is declared at a ceremony. The event will be broadcast on prime time, but most Israelis will opt to view "Big Brother 6," "Survivor 7" or whatever the next television hit is. Viewers will behave this way not because they oppose a Palestinian state but because they are indifferent. Palestine-shmalestine simply does not interest them.  
Most Israelis today are cut off from the conflict with the Palestinians and do not interact with them. From their point of view, the Palestinians are blurry figures during TV newscasts: Mahmoud Abbas and Ismail Haniyeh speak, women covered from head to toe mourn in a tent, men run with a stretcher after an ambulance, men concealing their faces fire Qassam rockets. Israelis have no interest in knowing anything further. Nablus and Ramallah are about 40 minutes by car from Tel Aviv, but in the eyes of Tel Avivians they are on a different planet. New York, London and Thailand are much closer.  
The settlers beyond the separation fence are the only Israelis who see Palestinians, mostly through car windows on the roads they share. The settlers, like the Palestinians, are disconnected from the residents of the Tel Aviv region, Haifa or Be'er Sheva, who hardly ever cross the fence. They have no business in Elon Moreh, Yitzhar or Psagot. The big settlements like Ma'aleh Adumim and Ariel can be reached almost without having to see Palestinians.  
The policy of isolation is the real legacy of Ariel Sharon, who built the fence in the West Bank, left the Gaza Strip and pushed the Palestinians out of the Israeli labor force. Sharon did not believe in peace and was not interested in links with the "Arabs." All he wanted was to protect the Jews from attacks by their "bloodthirsty" neighbors. Keeping them out of sight lets Israelis live as if there were no conflict, with only settlers on the periphery and soldiers on the firing line. 
The "demographic problem" also is not frightening when it is locked up behind walls and fences.  
In the past Israel's economy relied on Palestinian workers, but only older Israelis remember them at restaurants, construction sites and gas stations. Here and there one can still find friendships; waiters at Restaurant 206 in Kiryat Shaul sometimes gather their tips for a Palestinian friend who once waited tables and is now besieged in the Gaza Strip. Stories like this are almost part of folklore. The Israeli economy is geared toward Wall Street, not Shuhada Street. The stock market is hardly affected by routine security issues, and real estate prices are flying high as if this were Hong Kong, not a country under threat on a constant war alert.  
The Israel Defense Forces, who sent generations of Israelis to the territories, has minimized the exposure of its soldiers to the Palestinians. Fewer and fewer people do reserve duty, and even fewer in the West Bank. The regular army has minimized the activities of its units in the territories and transferred much of the policing duties in the West Bank to the Kfir Brigade. Air force crews, who carry the burden of the fighting in the Gaza Strip, see the Palestinians as silent spots on their screens fed from drone footage.  
Entertainment intensifies the gap in the way Israelis have come to regard their country, and the way it is seen in the world. The local media describes Israel as a Western high-tech superpower, an annex of Manhattan and Hollywood. The foreign media covers the conflict: terrorist attacks and assassinations, settlements and peace talks. When the Israelis who have never visited a settlement see themselves on CNN they are offended: We are not like that. This is anti-Semitic propaganda.  
Foreigners visiting Israel are amazed to discover the degree to which reality here is disconnected from what they heard at home. They expect a violent apartheid state, and are surprised that the toilets and buses are not separate for Jews and Arabs. They imagine a conservative, buttoned-up society and are shocked by Tel Aviv's nightlife. They walk in the street and realize that in London or Paris they see a lot more Arabs than in most Israeli cities.  
Because of the entertainment and indifference, the government doesn't face public pressure to pull out of the territories and establish a Palestinian state, and the opposition to the American peace initiative is being led by the extremists on the right. Most Israelis simply don't care; they gave up on the territories a long time ago. If Mitchell succeeds in his mission, they will hear about it and change the channel.

<title>Sometimes a frog is just a frog</title>
<date>Wed Jun 16 06:11:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Israel is finding it more difficult than ever to explain the righteousness of its actions to the world. No matter how hard it tries, the world refuses to believe our reasons for keeping Gaza under a blockade for so long. We explain that the Gazans are not suffering from a humanitarian crisis, and that if they are, it is their own doing. But those goyim, feeble-minded as they are, refuse to believe us. We prepare ‏(particularly for our guests from across the sea‏) full companies of soldiers dressed in white, reflecting our desire for peace and our inherent hospitality in the very color of their uniforms. Yet they, through a complete lack of understanding of our noble goals, find reason for condemnation even in that.
And it is not only with regard to Gaza and the flotilla: The folly of Israel-haters extends into every corner. We explain, simply and clearly, that most of the land in the West Bank is inhabited by our settlers, that they are the pillar of fire advancing before the camp, that the lands were not taken from their owners but are “state lands” − that is, areas that were ours from the beginning, promised to Abraham by God Himself. And if they were not ours from the beginning and were not promised to us by the Almighty, they were purchased from their owners with full payment, with deeds and receipts.
But the goyim, they of little faith, persist in believing what they wish.We pave roads for the benefit of those who enjoy a higher standard of living under our rule, but they, blockheads that they are, refuse to understand why we must then make those roads unavailable for their use. We build separation fences along the safest, shortest routes available, and they, idolaters that they are, become locked in an idée fixe about segregation and apartheid, as if those terms had ever cropped up in our darkest dreams.
They are not even intelligent enough to understand our most private, intimate lives. Out of a love of cleanliness and order, we separate our white, kosher girls from our less kosher Mizrahi cousins. For generations we have maintained racial purity in matters of marriage, protecting ourselves from every evil, and they, small thinkers, swallow all this chatter fed to them by those who are not even circumcised, while expecting us to hurt the feelings of Israel’s keepers of the faith.
We have always known how to look in the mirror with directness and courage. We must therefore admit that we sometimes appear − to a superficial, naive glance − a bit less attractive than we would like, certainly than we are entitled to look. Still, we wisely explain, with reference to the Brothers Grimm story, that something that looks, on first, distorted glance, like a frog, is to the penetrating eyes of the enchanted princess a prince. But they, with their bottomless hatred of our nation, reinterpret the story to mean that frogs live in this swamp who have never seen a royal palace, but were born in the swamp and will remain there forever.

<title>South Africa is already here </title>

<content>
How could the Israeli public allow a few dozen racists go down into the lion's den of Umm al-Fahm on their own? Do Michael Ben-Ari, Baruch Marzel and Itamar Ben Gvir represent only themselves or just the fringes of the extreme right? After all, thousands of Israeli citizens agreed when they heard the thugs' explanations of the reasons for their march.
Hundreds of thousands in Israel are pleased with the Citizenship Law, glad that the bill will, when it passes - and it will pass - allow discrimination against Arabs who will want to buy a home in a Jewish community, and the majority of the public considers MK Hanin Zuabi a traitor.
Where were all these people while the fascists marched through Umm al-Fahm? Suddenly they are not comfortable being seen with those who reflect precisely the zeitgeist?
Participating in this march should have been Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, MKs Anastassia Michaeli and David Rotem, the settler leadership, the followers of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the heads and residents of Jewish communities in the Galilee, as well as the owners of homes in Tel Aviv and Ra'anana who refuse to rent apartments to Arabs. This march should have carried the banner "[National] Pride Parade." Alas, only 1,300 participants showed up, along with the police force that protected them.
But they are certainly not alone. They simply do not need yet another demonstration. Israel's apartheid movement is coming out of the woodwork and is taking on a formal, legal shape. It is moving from voluntary apartheid, which hides its ugliness through justifications of "cultural differences" and "historic neglect" which only requires a little funding and a couple of more sewage pipes to make everything right - to a purposeful, open, obligatory apartheid, which no longer requires any justification.
In South Africa of the 1950s, the whites were afraid even of the white immigrants, lest they bring with them liberal ideas that would affect the local volk.
But mostly they feared the blacks. In a short period of time the insular white community adopted a series of laws that were meant to preserve their purity. In 1949, the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act was passed; in 1950 and 1957 the Immorality Act and amendment made interracial sexual relations a criminal offense carrying a seven year prison sentence. In 1950, in the Population Registration Act, each citizen was categorized racially. In 1953 the Bantu Education Act was passed which established that the blacks will receive a different and lesser education than the whites, and in 1950 the Group Areas Act was passed which determined "group regions," establishing where each racial group could live and which led to the expulsion of 3.5 million blacks from their homes.
This listing is presented here as a service to the racists in the Knesset, in case they did not know what kind of legislation to propose in order to complete their plan. This is also a public service for those who did not participate in the Umm al-Fahm march, so that they will know what they should require of their representatives.
With considerable delay, the South African Group Areas Act is now being copied into Israel's book of laws. An individual can no longer purchase land, build a home or even rent an apartment in small communities in which the absorption committee opposes their presence. According to Adalah - the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, the law will "protect" 68.3 percent of all communities in Israel from being "stained."
The remainder of communities, and especially the large cities, will have to continue, for the mean time, to make do with voluntary apartheid. But the days will also come, as they did in South Africa, when an appropriate solution was found for its cities. It will be possible, for example, to grant homeowners committees the authority to determine who can buy or rent an apartment in a building. After all, what is good about a small community should also be good in an even smaller building. And of course a law which encourages snitching will also be passed.
So, while the government of Israel is trying to gain Palestinian recognition for its Jewish identity, it is building within it the double identity of the state. A protected autonomy for the Jewish majority and a stunted autonomy for the Arab minority.
Israel is quickly defining the borders of the Arab autonomy and through apartheid legislation it is granting the Arab minority a legal standing of enclaves with lesser rights; of a cultural-ethnic region which, because it is being expelled from the broader who, can also demand international recognition for its unique standing.

<title>Take the masks off </title>
<date>Fri Aug 06 00:54:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
It's hard to know whether in our relations with the Palestinians we have reached a turning point of the kind that is termed "historic," but it's clear we're at a point where the sides have to take off their masks. A peace agreement is apparently closer than ever right now. The Arab states that are united in an anti-Iranian coalition want an agreement, as does Syria, which thirsts for the Golan Heights. The Palestinian leadership in the West Bank also wants an agreement; the secular Palestinian elite has apparently decided that an imperfect state right now is preferable to clinging to the dream of drowning the Jews in a flood of returning refugees in the future.
Thus the largest question mark hovers over the goals that the Israeli government and Israeli society have set for themselves. The number of answers to the question "what is Benjamin Netanyahu shooting for?" is equal to the number of people who speak with the prime minister. This fact suggests that the solution to the riddle will never be found behind closed doors; instead, it will arise in the noisy public square, where Netanyahu will have his back to the wall.
In the meantime, all the sane elements in Israeli politics must focus on taking down the obstacle that is so highly cherished by all the knights of the occupation: the claim that the dispute cannot be solved because the Palestinians seek to restore the situation in the country before 1948.
It is imperative that the Palestinian leadership and Israel's government begin direct negotiations immediately, accompanied by American and European pressure to ensure that the sides' national agendas are presented in public. The major issues are familiar: borders, Jerusalem and refugees. In the missile era, when the whole country is within range of the enemy's arms on all sides, local security arrangements of the sort Netanyahu loves such as holding on to the Jordan Valley are largely a pretext for killing time.
Beyond this, Israel's public must ask itself if it's legitimate to demand that the Palestinians engage in peace negotiations when next month the routine of land grabbing and settlement sprawl is destined to regain momentum. The worst mistake by Ehud Barak and his government 11 years ago was to proceed with negotiations when settlements were expanding and building was accelerated within them. That lesson must not be forgotten.
More than ever, a freeze on construction in the territories is a crucial prerequisite for progress in negotiations. With a chance to end a century of warfare staring him in the face, Netanyahu is worried about keeping his coalition together. This argument about coalition stability is so pathetic it says something about the lack of a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
If it turns out the government cannot hold together if it renews the settlement freeze, if it finally becomes clear that the settlers and the rest of the fanatics in the cabinet and Knesset are dictating the agenda, it will be best to put this government to rest. A prime minister can be replaced, if not in this Knesset, then in the next one. At any event, it's hard to imagine a government worse than the current one; it's a government whose legacy will include the selection of children of foreign workers for expulsion.
It could turn out that the next elections will usher in a yet more ultra-nationalist, clerical, fanatic and anti-democratic Knesset and government, but that result would have one advantage: It would make clear to everyone where we stand. Today more than ever the choice is clear. On the one hand, we can have a future of an apartheid-like state that is armed, "according to foreign sources," with Armageddon weaponry, while continuing on the path of a binational state steeped constantly in blood. Or we can have two states configured along the 1967 borders, with equitable land swaps. No other solution is viable.

<title>Teacher of a lifetime</title>
<date>Thu Jan 07 06:29:13 IST 2010</date>

There is a pedagogic poem in Tel Aviv; through the curtain of indifference and darkness, a ray of light. In an educational system that provides only grades and sterile surroundings, the encouragement of thinking is prohibited. It's a place where teachers are mute and educators blind in the stupefying brainwash of propaganda, evasion and ignorance in the curricula. But a courageous voice has been heard: The principal of Aleph High School of the Arts, Ram Cohen, called his 11th-graders to a meeting last week and gave them a real civics lesson, a real education in values. Instead of the usual blah-blah, cheap Zionism and cheaper democracy, cliches within hollow and specious cliches, Cohen spoke the truth to his students. 
Cohen told his students about the occupation. He told them that you can't brutally crush values the way Israel has been doing for 42 years and say we are educating for democracy. He asked them whether they would be willing to live under an occupation. He told them he does not justify terror but understands what leads to attacks. He called on educators to tell students that the occupation is cursed and called on students to serve in an army that protects security, not an army busy with the occupation. 
"Talk to each other, talk to your parents, go out and demonstrate," he told them, doing what any educator should do. But in the Israel of 2010, nationalist and militarist, Cohen's remarks raised a storm. MKs called for his dismissal, he was summoned for "clarifications" in the Education Ministry and the Tel Aviv municipality. He was not allowed to give interviews, which is outrageous in and of itself. 
Education Ministry Director General Shimshon Shoshani was also shocked. "A principal who thinks he can preach has no place in the education system," said our "educator" No. 1, comparing Cohen's civics lesson to the incitement preceding the death of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. "I'm not opposed to lessons with the homeroom teacher discussing the occupation as a concept," the director general squirmed. "Let people speak out for and against. Are we looking at what is happening in the West Bank as occupation?" 
The true face of the education system as collaborating with the occupation was suddenly revealed. The director general compares murderous incitement to remarks about human values; he still dares question whether the West Bank is under occupation. He still thinks there can be a "for" and "against" to the occupation. An education system that reconciles itself to yeshiva heads who preach nationalism and racism, rabbis who sanctify every stone in a land not ours, teachers who advocate the continuation of settlements that have been invalidated by international law - these are all proper and not considered "political." 
Teacher-propagandists who do not tell their students the whole truth about our history, who think democracy means voting on election day, civics means demonstrating for the release of kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit, Zionism means traveling to Auschwitz and values means taking part in a telethon for the Israel Defense Forces' welfare fund are accepted by the heavy-handed system. An educator who tries to infuse real content into his job is called in for clarifications. 
Principal Cohen once talked about how he came to change his positions: From his home in Modi'in, every day he saw a long line of Palestinian laborers heading home on foot after a hard day's work because they are not allowed on the apartheid road. Should he not tell this to his students? Is it not only his right, but also his obligation to do so? Is it not essential for his students to see what is going on around them, not only to go on the March of the Living wrapped in the national flag, but to see the march of our neighbors' lives? 
Cohen's high school has changed since the bygone days when I was a student there. Under his leadership it has become a school of thinking children. As opposed to his obeisant colleagues, Cohen has also come out against the militarization of the schools and their classification by the number of combat soldiers they produce for the IDF. In so doing, he has also done his job. 
Cohen is a real teacher of a lifetime, "the country's best teacher" as the cheap contest underway now is called, in which his name will certainly not be mentioned. Instead of sending him a letter of appreciation he is excoriated; instead of calling on all educators to follow his path, he is summoned to give explanations. If we had had a few dozen more educators like Cohen in our day, maybe we would not have had a Goldstone report.

<title>Thank you for bringing us together </title>
<date>Fri Oct 22 02:41:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In his October 13 opinion piece  ("The man behind Avigdor Lieberman" ), Aluf Benn proposed focusing on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in order to understand the proliferation of measures aimed at repressing the ambitions and aspirations of the Arab public in Israel. To my mind, this is a correct approach, but not sufficient. I also propose viewing the measures being taken by the current government as clear manifestations of the rise of a new right in Israel. This must be understood as a historical development that is beginning to change the face of the state and its attitude toward the Palestinians in general and the country's Arab citizens in particular, a development that will lead to a profound change among the Arabs themselves.
Israel's new right is fundamentally different from the classical revisionist right, which has almost disappeared from the country's political map. Taking its place is a right that closely resembles the European model represented by Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Pen or Austria's late Joerg Haider. It's a right that believes it is possible to subdue the minority only by force, and that emphasizes the racial superiority of the dominant ethnic group.
In its political propaganda, the new Israeli right relies on instilling among the majority fear of those perceived as alien. To the distress of those who hold democracy dear, among both the Jewish majority and the country's Arab citizens, this is not just a marginal rightist phenomenon, but rather a significant political force that supports the steps the government is taking.
The official policy coalescing here is aimed at hobbling the Arabs and bringing about a new violent confrontation with the Palestinians; those behind it are prepared to pay the price of conflict with the Arab world and the West in order to maintain their ideology of Jewish supremacy.
But not everything being done by the new right is negative. Here are two ideas that could earn Netanyahu a nod of gratitude from the Palestinians.
First of all, the demands and policies of the extreme right, as part of the government, will quickly lead to the exposure of the true face of official Israel - as an occupying state, one that tramples human and civil rights, abuses a part of its citizenry and is based on a belief in ethnic superiority that manifests itself in ways even more complex and effective than those employed in South Africa during the apartheid era.
Secondly, the right in power today is well on its way to negating Israel's earlier achievements in crushing the Palestinian people, and it will bring about their reunification. The Israeli left and center did quite a lot to split the Palestinian people and to transform them into distinct groups: Palestinians in Israel, Palestinians in the West Bank, Palestinians in Jerusalem, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Palestinians in the diaspora. Each of these groups became  focused on achieving distinct goals for itself, and in this way the Palestinian people have been prevented from creating a united front and working toward common goals.
Regrettably, a large part of the fragmented Palestinian elite bought into the Israeli policy and its members have each made the struggle of their respective group the main purpose for which they strive. Take, for example, the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, which today is the main demand of most of the Palestinians. This is a demand that accepts the principle of the splitting of the Palestinian people and is ready to accept that split as a permanent situation.
The Netanyahu government and the extreme right that has taken control of Israel's agenda are striving for two goals that in the end will constitute the main catalyst for the reunification of the Palestinian people, initially in terms of its political consciousness and later in its political agenda as well.
First, the aim of achieving a partial agreement with the Palestinian Authority - based on geographical separation and on the establishment of a "crippled state" - will not be acceptable to the Palestinians. Sooner or later, thanks to the policies of the current government, most will realize that the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel is past its time and no longer feasible, and that there is no alternative to going back to the idea of a single, binational, egalitarian state for Palestinians and Jews in historical Palestine.
Second, the demand to recognize Israel as a Jewish state will ultimately make Palestinians realize that the main problem lies not in Ramallah, but rather in Tel Aviv. Not in the occupation of one territory or another, but rather in the insistence upon extorting an acceptance of Jewish ethnic superiority, even from those who are not candidates for citizenship in Israel. The Palestinians will be obliged to merge their political platforms and pose a counterdemand.
The Palestinians' counter-proposal must be based on a demand for democracy as a humane solution for everyone. They must not content themselves with a territorial enclave between Nablus and Ramallah that will be called the "State of Palestine."
For all this and more, the Palestinians will yet say: "Thank you, Mr. Netanyahu."

<title>The center cannot hold</title>
<date>Fri Dec 03 10:29:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
LONDON − Another week, another broiges. Welcome to the wonderful world of the Anglo-Jewish community, where the latest rumpus is a rather manufactured debate around comments made by one Mick Davis, chairman of the United Joint Israel Appeal.
Speaking at a communal event in late November, Davis’ point was that he and others in Diaspora leadership were troubled, when it came to Israel, by such issues as settlement building, the proposed loyalty oath and the inequality suffered by the country’s Arab citizens. Prime Minister Netanyahu, in Davis’ opinion, lacks the courage to move forward toward peace, and he expressed concern that if a two-state solution was not enacted, Israel would run the risk of becoming an apartheid state, with the minority ruling over a majority.
So far, all pretty familiar sentiments. Israeli leaders from Ehud Olmert to Ehud Barak have gone further, and even among the notables of the Jewish Leadership Council − whose executive committee is chaired by Davis − there was a consensus that what Davis said wasn’t different from anything that anyone says behind closed doors. For all the squeamishness about that big Jewish no-no of airing your dirty shmattes in public and thus, as the cliche goes, giving succor to our enemies, Davis’ comments were made in a Jewish context, to a Jewish audience and on a panel with several other Jews ‏(including Peter Beinart, the author of a landmark polemic earlier this year on U.S. Jewish leadership‏).
Jerusalem remained sanguine in the face of this apparently novel liberalism with a number of Israeli officials rather pointedly swearing that they had never heard of this Mick Davis ‏(apparently multi-millionaire Jewish philanthropists are of no great interest in Israel these days‏).
The only real criticism heard here − loud as it was − came from what even establishment insiders variously describe as “the hard right,” the “lunatic fringe” and “mad mental right-wingers.”
But Davis’ comments are nonetheless of interest, reflecting as they do the fact that the Jewish community leadership in Britain finds itself in a bit of a pickle. A few years ago, during the intifada, when Israel seemed under constant attack, they could rouse enough enthusiasm among the troops to defend the Jewish state. Now, there’s a growing concern that younger members of the community, who would have once segued seamlessly into becoming the next generation of leaders, are drifting out of the mainstream-affiliated groups. People aren’t that fired up about Israel’s anticipated next battle with the amorphous demon of delegitimization.
That’s not to say that Anglo-Jewry is experiencing an outbreak of galloping anti-Zionism among its younger ranks, or that the community is set to devote itself to pursuing a binational secular state. U.K. Jews will still jump up and down as needed over issues such as academic boycotts and the need to deal with Iran. But all the comfort of feeling a wider connection with the Jewish state, of fond memories from teenage Israel trips and annual visits to Herzliya − and even the pleasurable sense of outrage elicited by comfort-zone grumbles about British media bias − none of this makes up for getting slapped down if you dare to criticize Israel’s policies or find yourself dumbfounded in the face of Deputy Prime Minister Avigdor Lieberman or his proposed loyalty oath.
People here are exhausted by self-censorship and a relentlessly monolithic obsession with anti-Zionism. The best proof of this was the July 2010 survey on Anglo-Jewish attitudes toward Israel by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research, the most definite study of its kind to date. It reflected a community with a strong attachment to Israel − 95 percent had visited the country − but one very far from the frothing ultra-Zionism evinced by some of our columnists.
While 77 percent felt that Jews have a special responsibility to support Israel, nearly the same number thought they also have the right to criticize Israel, even in the general media. Nearly three-quarters oppose settlement expansion, and more than half favor peace talks with Hamas. Previous “niche” interests, such as activism to support Israel’s minorities, are gaining ground, even among the communal establishment, and some canny Anglo-Jewish leaders well understand the danger posed by not shifting with the tide.
If they leave others to take over the center ground, then they will make themselves increasingly irrelevant − and not only to their own community. The Jewish leadership also knows that if they want the British government to take them seriously, they have to reflect a more nuanced view. A particular worry is the emergence of bodies such as the U.K. version of J Street, which is currently being organized. Like the American original, this political group aims to more accurately reflect what it says are the more liberal political views of the majority of the Jewish community in the U.K.
“The idea of J Street is not healthy for us in the establishment” says one Jewish leader, warning that the emergence of an alternative Israel advocacy group will have an erosive impact on the power and influence still held by mainstream communal groups.
Perhaps what Mick Davis has reflected is a growing awareness that the center ground has shifted in the U.K. Even within our own provincial little bubble of broiges, Jewish leaders need to move with it to maintain their legitimacy.

 The most prominent example of a country that refused to allow Jews to marry non-Jews was Germany, when it enacted the Nuremberg Laws. While Israel makes sure it doesn't disengage entirely from the rest of the world by recognizing marriages outside its borders, marriages between Jews and non-Jews here are forbidden. Now, in an effort to address the "problem" of those who immigrated to Israel under the Law of Return but are refused status as Jews by the state, these people will have the option of entering a state-sanctioned covenant with their spouse, but only if the spouse is also classified as a non-Jew. 
It's as if there were never a guarantee in the Declaration of Independence that assured Israelis "complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex."  
The most outspoken opponent of Israel's becoming both a Jewish and democratic state was Rabbi Meir Kahane. The effort "to solve his problem" only pushed the country further into the abyss. To prevent his re-election to the Knesset, lawmakers launched an initiative to disqualify party lists that opposed democracy in Israel. This is a reasonable idea for a democracy that does not yield to those who seek to destroy it from within.  
Yet as a compromise between Labor, Likud and the religious parties, an addendum to the law banned any party that opposed Israel's standing as a Jewish state. Thus a new standard was reached via the tortuous, Israeli route. In principle, no party can run for the Knesset because it's clear that if most citizens want a state that is not tethered to Judaism, that's their basic right.  
Since then, the combination of "Jewish and democratic" has taken root in Israel and its laws. The phrase "Jewish" does not refer to the Jewish people in the same vein as it was applied in the Declaration of Independence and the UN Partition Plan calling for a Jewish state and an Arab state.  
Rather, it refers specifically to the Jewish religion, an entirely different matter than what the Zionist revolution had in mind. As such, Israel is disconnecting itself from the modern world by virtue of the 42-year-old reality of racist apartheid in the territories of Judea, Samaria and East Jerusalem - areas in which Jews are citizens and their non-Jewish neighbors are not. Denial of citizenship to non-Jews also contravenes the halakhic principle of ger toshav, which afforded special status to gentiles in the Kingdom of Israel.  
The dilemma of a state that is bound by ancient ties to a certain nation while promising "full equality of rights" for all its citizens is not unique to Israel. Many other nation-states such as France have experienced similar conundrums. The concept of the dominance of one religion within a single national entity was also not an Israeli invention. Catholicism traditionally played a much larger role in the identities of people living in Italy, Spain, France and Ireland. Having been drawn into the religious-racial-nationalist black hole, Israel now joins the Iranian-Afghan galaxy.  
From Sheikh Jarrah to the bones discovered during the expansion of Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon, from the so-called Nakba Law to the war on evolution being waged by the Education Ministry's chief scientist, from the foreign minister to the interior minister - Israeli democracy is losing its status as "a present absentee." The state still has a hand mirror that reveals the face of a young Dorian Gray. Yet in reality its racist defilement is changing its look.  
"The problem of timing" does not belong to the Jerusalem District Planning and Building Committee. In the run-up to the clash on the Iranian front, when the state will need all the domestic and foreign support it can muster, Israel is turning itself into an entity whose democratic right to exist is self-destructing.

<title>The illusion of 'Syria first' </title>
<date>Mon Feb 08 02:20:09 IST 2010</date>
<content>
What do these nagging Palestinians want from us? They should be thankful that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he supports two states for two peoples. So what if he also swore that Jerusalem will remain unified forever under Israeli sovereignty, vowed that Ariel is an inalienable part of the state and promised that the Israel Defense Forces will retain control of the Jordan River?  
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was not born yesterday; he understands that the prime minister does not really plan to continue the annexation of the Muslim Quarter in Jerusalem's Old City. It's clear that Netanyahu knows that it is unacceptable to thrust a long finger like Ariel into the heart of a Palestinian state. Surely he does not think that on the way home from Jordan a citizen of a sovereign Palestine would have to tell an Israeli security guard who packed his suitcase.  
Why do we believe Netanyahu when he makes peace noises and convince ourselves that he is only pretending when he hugs settlers? If the prime minister has no problem making baseless declarations for a domestic audience, why should he have a problem making empty statements for external consumption? If the prime minister is willing to take Jerusalem's name in vain to appease cabinet members Moshe Ya'alon or Avigdor Lieberman, who can promise to Abbas that the Bar-Ilan speech, which was only meant to shake off Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, is not just a ruse?  
These questions are for the U.S. administration to answer. It will not do what it must until it squeezes out of Netanyahu a clear stance on how he sees the basics of a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. Special envoy George Mitchell wasted too much time on the construction plans in the Old City's holy basin, in Ariel, and in the Jordan Valley. The time has come for him to ask to see the evacuation plans for the Jewish settlements and neighborhoods east of the Green Line. If it turns out that the Palestinian part of Netanyahu's two-state solution resembles the Bantustans from the dark days of apartheid in South Africa, Mitchell will be free to get on with mediating other conflicts. We will know that the games of the "peace process" are over and we will prepare for life under an apartheid regime.  
When Mitchell returns the mandate President Obama gave him to resume negotiations with the Palestinians, he would do well to also give back the mandate for reopening the Syrian track. Three prime ministers - Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Ehud Barak - encouraged Bill Clinton to bypass Yasser Arafat and try his luck with Hafez Assad. Netanyahu, too, tried his luck. What have we had since? Another intifada in the West Bank, another war in Lebanon, and another war in the Gaza Strip. How many days will Arafat's successors stay in power if Obama betrays them with Hafez Assad's successor? How long will it take for Hamas to take over the Dayton force after it becomes clear that the occupation has no expiration date?  
It's hard to believe that the Syrians are willing to cooperate via yet another round of negotiations at the expense of the Palestinians. Just a week ago, Syrian Minister Bouthaina Shaaban criticized Arab countries for ignoring the suffering of the residents of the Gaza Strip. In an article in the daily Al-Sharq al-Awsat, the spokeswoman for President Bashar Assad wrote that the Americans' talk about a peace process "clouds the fact that the Palestinians are prisoners of a racist occupation, of collective punishment and genocide."  
Every year since March 2002, Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization have reiterated their support for the Arab peace initiative. Hopefully they will do so again next month at the Arab League summit in Tripoli. The initiative offers Israel normalization with all Arab League members in return for a withdrawal from all territories occupied in 1967. It's doubtful whether the return of the Golan Heights will convince Assad to diverge from the Arab consensus and host an Israeli ambassador when his government perpetuates the occupation of the West Bank and Jerusalem.  
It's hard to exaggerate the contribution of peace with Syria to Israel's position in the region, especially to security in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Damascus channel must be reopened. This must be done in parallel with the Ramallah channel, not instead of it.

<title>The lie behind the right wing's truth </title>
<date>Wed Aug 04 02:16:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 
Some people are surprised at recent expressions of support on the right for a one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, through what appears to be a readiness to grant Israeli citizenship to Palestinians living in territories that would be annexed. I'm surprised they're surprised, because that has been the right wing's position since 1967. It's just that it hasn't been easy to openly advocate an explicitly annexationist stance. It has been much easier to speak of our right to the land, of the right of Jews to settle everywhere in the Land of Israel, while ignoring that this involves not only territory, but also people - millions of Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza.
Now the cat is out of the bag, comfortably out. For more and more Israelis, it's becoming clear that the chance negotiations with the Palestinians will produce an agreement to establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel is not great. If U.S. President Barack Obama's special envoy George Mitchell has not gotten the parties to the negotiating table after a year and a half of trying, it's clear, despite the American president's good intentions and commitment to solve the conflict, that his efforts do not look as if they are bound to succeed.
What's easier than announcing the failure of the vision of two states for two peoples, which the right has always opposed and is now using to propose its annexationist intentions, which have been its inner truth all along? It's just that now it is wrapped in flowery rhetoric supported even by champions of human rights. So when someone like former Likud politician Moshe Arens, with his American background, supports it, it even appears as if it has been inspired by the non-ethnic civil concepts of American democracy.
The annexationist truth now being revealed for all to see is accompanied by a lie hiding behind it. What is apparently offered by some right-wing spokesmen seems a commitment to civil equality, without a hint of nationalism. What is better than offering the Palestinian population of the territories Israeli citizenship? But if you examine carefully the pronouncements of right-wing spokesmen in the media, it turns out that no one is talking about granting automatic citizenship and the right to vote to the residents of the territories to be annexed to Israel. They speak of a "process," and some say it would take a generation.
What would happen in the meantime is clear. The Arab residents of the territories to be annexed might be offered citizenship, but it would be subject to conditions. They would be required to declare loyalty to Israel as a Jewish  (and democratic ) state. It can be assumed they would have to undergo a security check. It is reasonable to assume they would have to sever all ties, legal or otherwise, with their relatives in Jordan and other countries. It can further be assumed that those who are refugees from the 1948 War of Independence and their descendants would be required to declare they are forgoing both their right of return to Israel proper and their property claims.
In short, the annexation of the territories would take place, but equal citizenship wouldn't really be granted. No one on the right speaks of equal citizenship here and now. From a realistic perspective, it's clear Israel cannot possibly annex the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It's simply impossible from the standpoint of its foreign relations. Israel is not an apartheid state, but it turns out this is the dream of right-wing spokesmen who speak of one state from the Jordan to the Mediterranean. Self-righteous sweet talk cannot obscure either the inner truth or the lie that is associated with these ideas.

<title>The moment of decision nears </title>
<date>Sun Feb 07 01:55:13 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In his speech at the Herzliya Conference, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he thought negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians would be resumed in the coming weeks under American mediation. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said over the weekend that the focus of the talks would be the 1967 borders, with territory swaps.  
That formula was the basis of the previous Israeli government's negotiations with the Palestinians, but it is at odds with the stance of most Likud cabinet members in the current government, who have expressed support for the Land of Israel lobby in the Knesset. The revived lobby is preaching "strengthening the hold of the State of Israel throughout the Land of Israel and particularly in Judea and Samaria [the West Bank]." Of all the Likud cabinet ministers, only Netanyahu, Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor and Improvement of Government Services Minister Michael Eitan haven't come out with expressions of support for the lobby.  
A resumption of peace negotiations centered around an almost total Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank presents Netanyahu with a two-fold challenge. If he takes positions in keeping with the sentiments of the Land of Israel lobby, he will be thrust into a confrontation with the U.S. administration and denounced internationally as an opponent of peace. But if he takes the path proposed by Secretary of State Clinton, he will run into confrontation with his own Likud party and his right-wing coalition partners.  
Netanyahu has thus far avoided making a decision and for some time has relied on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' refusal to engage in direct negotiations. He has also relied on protracted discussions with the United States over the construction freeze in the settlements.  
Supporters of the right wing have made it clear to Netanyahu that they are not ready to countenance even the partial halt to new construction in the West Bank settlements. A new Haaretz-Dialog poll has shown that Netanyahu has lost the support of voters on the right, and even his West Bank tree-planting activity at Gush Etzion, in Ma'aleh Adumim and in Ariel has not returned them to the fold.  
Netanyahu's position in favor of the ultimate annexation of three West Bank settlement blocs and security surveillance on the border of a future Palestinian state are not at odds with proposals espoused by the previous Kadima-led government of Ehud Olmert. Netanyahu, however, has not yet managed to be convincing that he intends to realize a two-state solution through a partition of the land.  
Clinton's statement makes it clear that Netanyahu's grace period is nearing an end. Instead of senselessly courting the right, he should take a courageous stand and state clearly to his political partners that a withdrawal from the territories and the evacuation of the settlements are what is needed. Otherwise Defense Minister Ehud Barak's warning that without partition Israel will become a binational apartheid state will become a reality.

<title>The most Ashkenazi elite of them all </title>
<date>Sun May 16 01:18:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Gideon Levy raises an important issue: the incorporation of Mizrahi Jews into the elites of Israeli society. The picture he draws is depressing: "Our entire political, economic, legal, academic and even military leadership is made up of Ashkenazim, with a smattering of Sephardim as the exceptions that so remarkably prove the rule." ("And what happens in our community?" May 2 ) This picture is only partially true. The elites vary enormously in this matter. Some are more integrated, while others less so. The elite that is apparently the most Ashkenazi of all is that of the radical left.
In recent decades we have had ministers of defense, foreign affairs and finance who were Mizrahim. We have had chiefs of staff who were Mizrahim, GOCs, heads of Military Intelligence, commanders of the air force and Sayeret Matkal special operations force, attorneys general, directors general and senior officials at the Finance Ministry, heads of the Histadrut labor federation, and business tycoons. Even the Labor Party, a regular target for criticism in this respect, has twice elected a Mizrahi head, and the current Histadrut secretary general is far from being a "pet Mizrahi."
However, the elites calling for an international boycott of Israel, and the Israeli participants in Israeli Apartheid Week in cities around the world, and in general all those who tend to portray Israel as a despicable and failed state, solely responsible for the conflict - this indeed is an Ashkenazi elite "with a smattering of Mizrahim." It would be appropriate for the members of this elite, who excel at preaching morality, to show a little more humility and learn a lesson from Israel's business, political and defense elites on how to integrate Mizrahim.
As a rule, it can be said that all encounters in the modern era between the European world and the East, particularly the Middle East, have been unequal. Of these encounters, the one in Israel between those with origins in Europe and those from the Middle East was the least unequal because both sides shared the Zionist ideology that considered all Jewish communities as belonging to the same people. This approach did not, in practice, prevent prejudice, patronizing and discrimination, but it included an enormous advantage when compared to every other outlook, as far as integrating communities was concerned.
Among modern ideologies, only Zionism enables, and requires, that Polish Jews and Yemenite Jews be seen as one people. It is fashionable today to denigrate this philosophy that sees all Jews as one nation; it is fashionable to consider it a myth. But it is clear that when it comes to integrating people from Europe and the Arab-Muslim world, in nearly equal numbers, Israel is the most successful example of such an integration in modern history. From a Zionist standpoint, it could be said that this achievement is less worthy of wonderment; after all, it involves people of the same nation, despite the cultural differences between them. And it's not about the much more difficult integration of immigrants from different nations and cultures.
The more someone distances himself from Zionist ideology and considers less than obvious the Jewish national philosophy in its Zionist form, and the more that person considers the coming of Jews to this land as regular immigration rather than aliyah - the more that person should be impressed by Israel's achievements in building a nation. It is therefore better to embrace the Zionist outlook so there is room left to criticize the Israeli reality on this matter, not just be impressed by it. As an effort to integrate immigrants from the entire world, East and West, Israel is a phenomenal success story; Compared with the Zionist ideal of ingathering "the exiles" there is still a lot to be done.

<title>The spider, the road and the occupation </title>
<date>Thu Jan 14 01:14:19 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Even if the farce staged by Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and his deputy Danny Ayalon to make the Turkish ambassador feel small is forgotten, Route 443 is a better example of the wide gap between Israelis' self-image and the value of Israel and its arguments in the eyes of the international community. No propaganda campaign based on the cry "Gevalt, they're killing us" can save the occupation from the understanding that this is not a dispute about Jewish existence. Either way, Israel does not know how to defend this existence without groaning that "the spider of the settlements is proving burdensome, please help us handle it so we can continue settling everywhere, including in East Jerusalem."  
What does Israeli logic say about Route 443 and barring Palestinians from using it for years, in the best traditions of apartheid? (Which is flourishing here but which we are not permitted to call by that name.) Logic dictates that we need this road because it shortens the distance to Jerusalem and eases congestion on Highway 1. But because this efficient road passes through occupied territory, and has done so for 42 years - a temporary occupation, of course (here, in the script, the Supreme Court justices call for a wink) - it endangers the lives of Israelis. This is because the inhabitants of the occupied territory don't like the idea of their land being used without their permission.  
Therefore, for our convenience, we have to prevent Palestinian drivers from using the road. Here, too, the Israeli argument ranges from arrogant fury, as in "Who are you tell us how to defend the lives of our children?" to "After all, we do want to see two states for two peoples, etc." And as always, an examination of the argument reveals that what the Israelis call security, even when they are speaking absolutely sincerely, is not security but ownership of land cleansed of Arabs.  
Even when security reasons were not used in the usual demagogic manner, the removal of Arabs from territories inhabited by Israelis has always been described as "security." Anyone who carefully reads the debates about the military government in Arab-populated areas in the 1950s and '60s will see that even in the most penetrating documents written in its defense, security arguments are linked to preventing Arab farmers from entering the land in question. (This is why the military government in Haifa, Jaffa, Acre, Ramle and Lod, in which Jews were settled, was abolished quickly, and the Arabs there bunched together in remote neighborhoods, whereas in the rural areas the military government was retained until 1967.)  
Whatever the nature of the solution, from the Israeli point of view it always entails the removal of Arabs from areas where Jews live.  
Over the years, Israelis have learned to see any territory in which there are Arabs as endangering their security. To guard against them it is permitted to remove them, or fence them in, or settle in their midst, and then to protect the settlers from the danger to their security, namely the Arabs around them. Thus the barbaric wall that runs "almost" along the Green Line is perceived by Israelis as a security need; it's there to protect the security of Hashmonaim C, Maccabim D, Modi'in Ilit or Beit El. And for their convenience why should we care about the plight of the subjects of the occupation in Bil'in, Na'alin or Bani Saleh?  
As the moment of truth approaches, as Israel's role in Western politics becomes less important, Israel and its leaders are depicted as a nuisance when they maintain that this old land dispute is an issue of security. It's not a matter of security, but of a desire for convenience, for more land, more water. Our domestic consensus makes no sense to anyone outside Israel; it's seen merely as a national inability to see the sand running out in the hourglass.  
This is how we have arrived at the ludicrous conduct of the Netanyahu-Barak government toward the Palestinian Authority. The two-state solution was a gift the Palestinians offered Israel in the spirit of what Israel has always demanded: "You over there, we over here." But that's not what Israel really wants. Because if you have already conceded that, why shouldn't you concede more and more until you disappear completely behind the walls of your ghetto?

<title>The tyranny of the Israeli majority </title>
<date>Fri Dec 24 02:27:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In order to deal properly with the diplomatic dead end, we have to accept that the problem is not political in the narrow sense of the concept. It is not a question of right and left according to the common Israeli terminology: The problem is social and cultural, part of the structure of political culture in Israel. Therefore, it is unimportant who will be in the government in the near future, just as there was no importance to the identity of the coalitions that ruled during the Yom Kippur War, the two Lebanon wars and Operation Cast Lead in Gaza. The exception was the second government of Yitzhak Rabin.
The present political balance of power has created a Knesset that has become an assembly line of legislation that is dragging Israel down to the bottom of the list of civilized countries. In fact, the Israeli usually understands one thing about the concept of democracy: an unrestrained government of the majority. Here the principle of majority rule is considered the right of the stronger side to impose its authority on those weaker than it, without considering the limitations imposed by human rights.
The concept "majority" does not have the same moral and ideological meaning here that it has in Europe, where the right of the majority to rule was an expression of a liberation from the tyranny of the minority, which was acquired after long struggles and became another aspect of the right to freedom and equality and a means of guaranteeing the rights of the individual. That is not the case here: The average Israeli doesn't even understand why the same majority that elected the MKs is not authorized to decide who will sit on the judge's seat, or why Basic Laws have to protect the Arab minority from the majority.
The right of the stronger applies also, if not first and foremost, to our relations with the Palestinians. It is not only the settlement-oriented right that fails to understand why a great power like Israel even has to conduct discussions with the Palestinians, who are totally dependent on us. Even in today's Labor Party, which sees itself as the successor of Mapai, many believe the Jews are doing the Arabs a favor when they are even willing to discuss their demands.
That is why Israeli society is incapable of producing the moral and intellectual strength required to put an end to the occupation. Those who choose to hold on to the territories at any price are the minority, although a large one, but along with those who want to control as large a chunk of the territories as possible, there is a majority of society. Those who favor an apartheid state are a minority, but many have already accepted a situation of apartheid that does not call it by name, existing behind a smokescreen of being "temporary."
That is why the only significant argument between the left and the right was and remains primarily technical: How far, in terms of Israel's foreign relations, can we stretch the rope? As long as the gentile only barks and doesn't bite, there is no need to hurry. In that sense Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Revisionist boy from Rehavia, is a copy of another prime minister, Golda Meir, the "socialist" pioneer and the refugee from the land of pogroms in Russia, who arrived in Israel via Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Our American ally is not necessarily naive. Like President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in their time (see the article by Aluf Benn, "Better than Wikileaks," December 15 ), President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton know that Israel will not budge from its positions unless it feels that it is being bulldozed. Nixon and Kissinger wanted an Israel that was weakened and in mourning, but strong enough to enter negotiations with Egypt. Is it proper, is it worthwhile to wait for the day when Obama and the Europeans also reach the conclusion that it will be possible to talk only to an Israel that has suffered a stinging failure?

<title>Time to come clean </title>
<date>Fri Jun 04 02:02:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
NEW YORK - The revelations in my book, "The Unspoken Alliance: Israel's Secret Alliance with Apartheid South Africa," have angered Israelis across the political spectrum. Israeli politicians from Dan Meridor to Yossi Beilin, and writers from Haaretz's Anshel Pfeffer to the blogger Emmanuel Navon, have denounced my findings regarding cooperation between Israel and South Africa on nuclear issues, and dismissed them as false or inaccurate.
President Shimon Peres has said "there exists no basis in reality for the claims" put forward in my book. Beilin, despite praising the book on its back cover, has decided to stand by his former boss when it comes to the subject of nuclear weapons. As he told The New York Times: "The president's denial puts an end to the subject."
It does not.
Peres is being evasive. Although his signature does not appear on the minutes of a series of meetings that took place in South Africa and Switzerland between March and June 1975, the documents confirm his presence and record the statements he made there. They also show that one topic discussed at the meeting was nuclear-armed Jericho missiles. Peres' signature appears on a document dated just days after the first discussion of Jericho missiles took place, pledging to keep these and all other defense discussions secret.
To my knowledge, Peres has not denied his presence at these meetings, nor has he claimed that the South African documents are fake. If Peres is so adamant that his version of events is true, he should encourage the government to immediately release all Defense Ministry documents concerning Israeli-South African military cooperation between 1975 and 1990. The Israeli people deserve to see the historical evidence and draw their own conclusions.
A memorandum from the South African chief of staff at the time, R.F. Armstrong, written on the same day as the first Jericho discussion - March 31, 1975 - confirms the South Africans' exclusive interest in nuclear-tipped Jerichos. A South African who joined Israel Defense Forces' then-chief of staff Rafael Eitan at a 1979 missile test launch in Israel reiterates this narrow interest, writing that the Jerichos would only be worth the price if the warheads were extremely advanced, "with a nuclear warhead as the ideal."
The 1975 deal was never consummated, but there is no doubt Peres took part in the discussions and that the South Africans perceived Israel's proposal as a nuclear offer.
The Jericho missile program continued as a joint project based in South Africa throughout the 1980s, when Israeli rocketry experts went to the coastal town of Arniston. South Africa had by then successfully developed its own nuclear weapons and was seeking to miniaturize them for use as warheads. The Israelis helped with the missile development.
Furthermore, in 1976, Israeli intelligence officials approached Pretoria requesting that the safeguards be lifted on a 500-ton stockpile of South African yellowcake uranium that had built up in Israel over a period of 15 years. The South African minister of mines, Fanie Botha, traveled to Israel that July, where he met with Peres, then-prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and top army officials and nuclear scientists. Botha admitted to me in a 2006 interview that during this trip he lifted the safeguards, freeing Israel to use the yellowcake for military purposes.
In exchange, Israel provided South Africa with tritium - a substance that boosts the yield of thermonuclear weapons. Moreover, Israel funneled money to the nearly bankrupt Botha through a middleman in order to keep him in office until the deal went through.
Fanie Botha's visit to Israel is confirmed in a 1976 Israel Ministry of Defense document and in the records of a 1988 trial held in camera in South Africa's Supreme Court.
Haaretz columnist Anshel Pfeffer has criticized what he believes is "shoddy detail" in my book and conclusions that are "convoluted and tenuous at best" (May 28, 2010 ). He adds: "There are much more plausible explanations to Peres' cryptic reference to 'three sizes' of missile payloads, if that is indeed what he said in those secret meetings 35 years ago."
But Pfeffer does not offer us alternative explanations. Presumably, he believes that the phrase refers to the missile's range rather than its warhead. The documents themselves reveal this to be absurd, because in the same meetings Peres and Botha openly discussed the range of other missile systems. The term "payload" in English is not an ambiguous one: It refers to a warhead and not a missile's range.
Pfeffer goes on to misrepresent nuclear program expert Avner Cohen's views, suggesting that he "dismisses the claims" in my book. In reality, Cohen has praised my research and backed my conclusions. On May 25, he told The Independent: "The discussions between Israel and South Africa referred to in the documents seem to me authentic and refer, I believe, to nuclear weapons, even if euphemisms like 'correct payload' were used."
Thirty-five years later, it is time for Peres to come clean.

<title>Time to pay the bill </title>
<date>Fri Jun 11 01:18:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
The flotilla affair would not have developed into such an unprecedented crisis were it not the last link in a long chain of failures and acts of folly. These cast a heavy shadow - one that's getting longer - on Israel's status as a responsible and level-headed power. The fact that hatred for the sake of hatred is mixed up with legitimate criticism does not allow Israel to claim innocence.
Indeed, since its foundation, Israel has enjoyed almost unlimited moral credit. It has also enjoyed the status of a responsible country whose leaders are careful about embarking on adventures and whose judgment can therefore be counted on. During the Yom Kippur War, Golda Meir and the veterans of the Mapai party refused to employ a special kind of ammunition to hold back an invasion. Yitzhak Shamir prevented an unnecessary imbroglio during the Gulf War, while Yitzhak Rabin determined that Israel must not become enslaved to its conquests.
Thanks to this worldwide recognition, Israel was able to develop without hindrance that ultimate defense umbrella that foreign reports claim it has. This "ambiguity" was also acceptable to the Soviet Union - the Arabs' ally and weapons supplier. It was possible to allow the Israel of David Ben-Gurion, Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir to develop the Dimona nuclear plant quietly. It was possible to allow the Israel of Menachem Begin to bomb Iraq's plant knowing that it would not cross any red lines.
On the other hand, Benjamin Netanyahu, Ehud Barak, Moshe Ya'alon and Avigdor Lieberman belong to a different species of politician, one that cannot be relied on blindly. This is one of the key motives behind the U.S. administration's support for international supervision at Dimona; it's also the reason our allies in Washington, Paris and Brussels want to see the Mavi Marmara incident investigated by international bodies. They have concluded that it is no longer possible to let Israel function without supervision and pressure, because only pressure brings results.
Indeed, it turns out that to avoid an international investigation, Israel is prepared to significantly ease the blockade on the Gaza Strip. But the root of the problem goes much deeper - the realization that every Israeli action since the Beirut campaign and the attack on the Syrian army in the summer of 1982 until Operation Cast Lead has the sole aim of defending the conquests of the Six-Day War. Since we ultimately carried out all our wars with the purpose of defeating the Palestinians by perpetuating the situation in the territories, we created the feeling that Israel sees itself as existing for the sake of its conquests.
As long as the foot-dragging regarding the Palestinians continues in the United Nations, as long as media outlets report on construction in the territories under a heavy cloak of lies and fraud, and as long as we hear about shameful decisions on the lists of goods allowed into Gaza, the stockpiles of goodwill that were accumulated in past years will be depleted. Public opinion is no longer prepared to tolerate not only the occupation, including the attempts to gain control of Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods, but also Israel's self-righteousness and complete assurance that it has the right to maintain an apartheid regime in the territories.
The bill is now gradually being submitted for payment. That's why Israel finds itself against the wall over existential matters. If we had a genuine and burning desire to end the colonialist situation in the West Bank, for our own sake and not merely as a wink to Washington, it's very possible that we would receive the West's support on the nuclear issue. If we had acted in a trustworthy manner and not tried at every opportunity to lie to and cheat everyone, maybe we wouldn't now be facing an all-out attack on our life-insurance policy.
Reliability is a weapon, but the Israel of today, blind to developments in the world, is relinquishing this weapon with incomprehensible lightness. After Operation Cast Lead, no one believes any longer in our ability to investigate ourselves, and justifiably so. But to the same extent, it can be said that official Israel does not investigate because its citizens do not want to know.
The problem is structural and cultural - most people do not want to look in the mirror. They prefer to believe that in every case, Israel is the victim the world is abusing, so it is allowed to do anything, and any demand to investigate its acts is some form of anti-Semitism. In this way maybe it's possible to calm one's conscience, but this is not the way to build the country's future.

<title>Undermining liberty </title>
<date>Thu Mar 25 03:20:10 IST 2010</date>
<content>
The Jewish people's national movement - Zionism - was born as a secular movement and conducted itself as such. The ultra-Orthodox, who made up the absolute majority of Jews at the time of its establishment, objected to it furiously. They saw it as a movement of heretics, instigators and false prophets. Even the Holocaust, whose extent would not have been so fatal had the ultra-Orthodox rabbis not prohibited emigrating to Palestine, did not change this fundamental approach. To this day, albeit more in theory than de facto, the ultra-Orthodox do not recognize the State of Israel - just like the radical left and factions in the Arab community.  
The ultra-Orthodox community's growing strength is spurring it to dictate behavior patterns to the public majority. In matters like the graves under Ashkelon's Barzilai Medical Center, this dictation proves how powerful - and absurd - the ultra-Orthodox leaders' sense of power is.  
Perhaps this will be a turning point that will bring us all, religious and secular, to block the ultra-Orthodox community's ambition. We have seen how the majority's outcry forced the prime minister to come to his senses about the Ashkelon graves.  
The majority in Israel allows the ultra-Orthodox to issue decrees in the most basic matters of identity because of their political power. This majority is doing itself a grave moral injustice, especially to ultra-Orthodox society. The majority can wean the ultra-Orthodox from their absolute dependence on the state, thus turning them, albeit against their will, into a productive community.  
If the majority does so, then by force of reality, like the ultra-Orthodox in America, in addition to scholars who study the Torah there will be ultra-Orthodox scientists, doctors, engineers and psychologists. They will be productive, rather than dependent. Thus, one may assume, their appetite to impose on the majority's lifestyle that it objects to will diminish.  
If the ultra-Orthodox are undermining the freedom of spirit in Israel, the radical left on the other hand is undermining the Jewish people's very freedom as a state. This left uses the generous financial assistance of foreign states and organizations - including Jew-haters - who act, under the guise of "human rights," to deny the Jewish people's right to sovereignty, destroy the Jewish state's moral basis, return the Palestinian refugees, make the world hate Israel and undermine the legitimacy of its existence.  
When the ultra-Orthodox go too far, as they did in the Barzilai Medical Center, the majority, pushed by the media, rebels. But when radical leftist organizations provide most of the false data in the Goldstone report and organize "Israeli Apartheid week" in campuses abroad, the public hardly knows about it. This is because the media, a considerable part of which sympathizes with them, is silent.  
When the Im Tirzu movement exposes the New Israel Fund's deeds, financed by subversive bodies, it remains a lone voice in the wilderness. When information erupts in a different way the media, instead of denouncing the subverters, denounces their exposers.  
Thus, for example, the public is not aware that the governments of Britain, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden and others finance Peace Now's demonstrations, the groups advocating draft evasion and the serial petitions to the High Court of Justice (and the High Court's cooperation with these groups). These countries also finance activity that encourages Israel's Arabs to set up nationalist, cultural, political and organizational infrastructures to separate from the State of Israel.  
The "vision papers" issued by Israel's Arabs, whose composition was encouraged and financed by the United Nations, European Union and New Israel Fund, are in fact Israeli Arabs' divorce papers from the state whose citizens they are. The radical Jewish left supports the separatist trends deriving from these papers. Thus the Jewish sector has remained almost unexposed to the danger that in the tiny space of Israel a Palestinian state could rise - supported by numerous countries - in addition to the one that exists de facto in Judea and Samaria.  
Following the wide media coverage, the Zionist Jewish majority is aware of what the ultra-Orthodox are doing, and one may assume that one day it will put them in their place. But this majority remains passive vis-a-vis the real danger to its political future's freedom, even in its reduced state. Thus it allows the subverters to destroy the identity - as a prelude to destroying the existence - of the state that tens of thousands of it have sacrificed their lives to establish and safeguard for the past 62 years.

<title>We are all Zuabi </title>
<date>Wed Aug 18 01:57:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 
During the visit by leaders of the Palestinian community to Libya a few months ago, MK Hanin Zuabi  (Balad ) stood out in particular - the only woman in the "Arabs of 1948" delegation invited to visit Muammar Gadhafi. When we met with Gadhafi in his tent in the town of Sert, this remarkable woman showed courage that is rare in these parts.
The leader preached to us and advised us to practice one of the tenets of Islam - marry four women and bring many children into the world to fight the Israelis. Zuabi, who is known for her struggle for the rights of Palestinian women in Israel, did not hesitate and pointed out to Gadhafi that his philosophy was not acceptable to her because it oppresses women. The tent went silent. It's not customary to interrupt the leader, we had been told in the briefing before the meeting. Gadhafi listened and simply went on with his speech.
This story proves that Zuabi is cut from tough and unyielding cloth - an uncompromising fighter for her party's principles both domestically and abroad.
It's only natural the targeted assassination campaign led by members of the Knesset, which transcends party lines and opinions and is aimed at expelling Zuabi from the Knesset, would gain momentum. Zuabi, like most Arab MKs, is a nuisance to the various racists, and the delegitimization campaign against her is an inseparable part of the official efforts, with a tailwind from the obsequious Hebrew-language press, to declare Balad illegal.
The remnants of what is called "Israeli democracy" are getting lost in the name of protecting the Jewish State of Israel. It's the Israelis' right to think what they want, but it's our obligation to defend our principles, even if this entails a high individual and collective price. The Palestinians in Israel will not agree to recognize Israel as a Jewish state. The Palestinians, the authentic owners of the land here, are an inseparable part of the Arab nation. They were here before Israel, they are not transients and they are certainly not guests in their native land.
The efforts to expel from the Knesset the Arabs who are representing their voters, in addition to the racist laws the current Knesset has promoted, are liable to turn Israel into a new model of apartheid state, like the despicable one that once reigned in South Africa.
Most of the anger toward Zuabi stems from her participation in the flotilla to the Gaza Strip. But in a properly run country they would have opened an investigation not against her but against the "anonymous individuals" who set up a Facebook group calling for her execution. Moreover, the Israelis must understand that Zuabi took part in the flotilla for breaking the blockade of Gaza because she believes that no law in the world gives an occupier the right, moral or otherwise, to put 1.5 million people in prison because of a soldier captured by the Palestinian resistance forces.
On the flotilla she represented the Palestinians in Israel, not only herself and her party. The Palestinians' Higher Monitoring Committee, the only body that faithfully represents them, chose her to represent more than a million Palestinians in Israel. So the campaign against her is a campaign against all the Palestinians in the Jewish state - hence the danger in it.
Astonishingly, Israel's knights of human rights are not speaking out, which is dangerous for both Israeli and Palestinian society in this country. If you support expelling Zuabi from the Knesset, we are sending you a razor-sharp message: We are all Zuabi.

<title>Welcome, Mr. Erdogan </title>
<date>Tue Jun 08 01:53:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
If Recep Tayyip Erdogan wanted to visit Gaza - even bearing a sprig of coriander, which for some reason Israel forbids bringing in - I would bid him welcome in the name of Hamas and all the residents of Gaza. I don't know whether Egypt, which also blockades Gaza - and especially the Palestinian Authority, whose employees were thrown off rooftops by Hamas - would welcome such a visit with open arms. But as far as we Israelis are concerned, this is no longer our top priority.
After all, we're no longer in Gaza. It cost us some NIS 10 billion to destroy all the houses and synagogues in Gush Katif, move the graves and compensate the settlers. We left Gaza five years ago, under Ariel Sharon's government, with no preconditions  (which is a lot more than one can say of Turkey's conduct with regard to the Alexandretta district).
But instead of turning the evacuated territory into a wonderful tourist destination, Hamas turned it into a base for launching Qassam rockets. For years, it fired on Israeli towns and terrorized Israel's civilian population. If Erdogan had at least helped to rehabilitate Gaza and persuaded its leaders not to launch Qassams at Israel, he would have helped to calm the situation and also promote peace. But in the eyes of Islamic radicals, and sometimes even in our own eyes, we are still controlling Gaza.
Israel's problem is its deteriorating position in international opinion, due to its weakness and its inability to make serious concessions. The government headed by Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, Avigdor Lieberman and Eli Yishai is not perceived as one capable of reaching an agreement based on territorial concessions, and very far from being able to forge a permanent border between two states.
The flotilla incident, and the worldwide grudge against Israel that it sparked, would never have happened if we had been engaged in serious negotiations with Palestinian leaders. But instead, we have imposed a blockade, deported famous visitors and caused well-known rock bands to cancel their performances here as if we were lepers. It's somewhat reminiscent of South Africa under the apartheid regime.
When leaders are seen as weak, then, like a flock of sheep, they invite the wolves to attack. Thus we have fallen victim to all kinds of bizarre organizations, and are falling into traps that should we never have fallen into. Thank God for the United States, which, despite all its disappointment at us, is not letting us fall into the abyss - or at least, not before the next election there.
Our problem is almost always the same: First we oppose a commission of inquiry, and in the end we are forced to accede to the worst possible terms. We shouldn't waste so much as another day debating and digesting the decision to set up an international inquiry commission, in which Turkey, Israel and the U.S. would all participate, to investigate the flotilla and the circumstances that led to its bloody outcome.
It's all more or less known. The pictures of our battered, bloody soldiers on the deck of the Mavi Marmara, which were published in the Turkish paper Hurriyet, are decisive proof of who ambushed whom. From a military perspective, Israel was indeed guilty of an intelligence failure: The naval commandos did not know in advance that thugs with knives, saws, batons and every other kind of lethal non-firearm weapon imaginable were lying in wait for them.
Whether or not the blockade of Gaza is legal is a separate question. But it is hard to believe that not a single one of Turkey's intelligence agencies knew that a group of terrorists like that was waiting for our soldiers on the deck of the Mavi Marmara. The Turkish government must also explain how it happened that only this ship, and not any of the others, boasted such a violent group. Do they also lie in wait for coast guard inspectors in Istanbul with knives?
The question we must ask ourselves now is, how did we reach a situation in which it is legitimate to pounce on us and condemn us at every opportunity? Israel must reconstitute its government to create a majority desirous of finally beginning serious talks with the Palestinians. For without an agreement on permanent borders, an agreement with Syria and the restoration of our strategic ties with both Turkey and Europe, we will be added to the list of leper states.

<title>What Naomi Klein really wants </title>
<date>Fri Mar 26 03:45:13 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Several weeks ago, my colleagues and I at the Reut Institute published a comprehensive report on the growing efforts to delegitimize Israel. Discussing our report on Canadian radio, I mentioned the writer and political activist Naomi Klein - an internationally prominent speaker for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel - as one of a few notable individuals in Toronto who promote Israel's delegitimization. Klein soon published a vitriolic denial, which turned into an angry exchange published on a U.S.-based blog.  
Klein's main argument was that I was attempting to equate "non-violent tactics like BDS with a military campaign to destroy Israel." Thus, Klein accused me of lying when I said she intended to delegitimize Israel and challenged me to search her writings for evidence to prove it, publicly proclaiming I would find nothing.  
Well, I did find something. In my response to Klein, I argued that despite never explicitly rejecting Israel's right to exist, the fact that in her work, she singles Israel out, demonizes it, calls it a perpetrator of apartheid, and suggests it was born in sin, leaves little room for doubt regarding her intentions. Moreover, on at least one occasion a few months ago, Klein wondered publicly, "How about a one-state solution?"  
The rest of the exchange, and Klein herself, are largely insignificant in light of the greater phenomena at work. However, by taking Naomi Klein as a metaphor, we can unravel the core of a broader dynamic - "Kleinism," if you will - which damages the quest for a two-state solution.  
"Kleinism" represents a simplistic, artificial view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that has led many who consider themselves human-rights activists to focus their criticism nearly exclusively on Israel. It brands Israel as the new apartheid state, so it can do no right and its adversaries no wrong. It frames Israel as uninterested in peace or in ending the occupation. It ignores any structural obstacles to peace unrelated to Israel, the most obvious being the sharp divisions among the Palestinians.  
Thus, "Kleinists" seem to have concluded that one-sided criticism of Israel is the best way to promote peace, and that pressurizing the state with all available means, including BDS, is both legitimate and effective.  
As a result, Israel's branding as a violent, aggressive and discriminatory state is increasingly gaining traction. Consequently, the entire political model of Israel as a Jewish state is framed as inherently immoral. Israel is compared with South Africa's apartheid regime with such persistence and intensity that many seem not to be concerned by the fundamental differences between the two cases, and call for a one-state solution based on the South African formula of "one man, one vote."  
This dynamic is well exploited by the "network of resistance" - primarily Iran and its clients Hezbollah and Hamas, which have adopted a strategy that targets Israel's political and economic standing. In recent years, these groups seem to have inverted their position toward the Israeli occupation, coming to view it as a strategic asset, believing that continued Israeli control over the Palestinian population will create an "overstretch" between the Jewish identity of the state, its democratic values, its territory, and demographic trends, all of which will lead to Israel's implosion. Therefore, these groups have consistently sabotaged the political process via terrorism and thwarted Israeli attempts to unilaterally separate from the Palestinians.  
Israel thus finds itself stuck between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, the country suffers from the permanent military threat posed by the network of resistance, which impedes the political process and threatens to frustrate the paradigm of the two-state solution. On the other hand, Israel is framed in the West as ill-willed and illegitimate, in keeping with purportedly "moral" and "liberal" values, which promote the one-state threat.  
Whether intentionally or not, the upshot of these processes is that some human rights activists are aligning with fundamentalist Islamists against Israel. One particularly bizarre example of how these groups' values conflict - differences that melt away when it comes to Israel - is the annual gay rights march against "the Israeli Apartheid," which has taken place twice now in Toronto, while homosexuals are being hanged in Tehran and forced to flee Gaza for Tel Aviv.  
It may be that many BDS supporters are genuinely looking to change Israel's policies from a human rights perspective, and do not seek to delegitimize Israel. Indeed, such criticism is important and legitimate, even when harsh and sometimes even when unfair. Yet, the idea of precipitating Israel's capitulation using the model that brought down South Africa's racist regime - which is the conceptual and strategic core of the BDS campaign - is simplistic and unfounded and is likely to cause more human misery, chaos and bloodshed.  
We should not be misled by "Kleinist" terminology. Those who really care about justice, peace, human rights and international law should reject the superficial apartheid diagnosis and its accompanying disastrous prognosis. Instead, it is those in both Israel and Palestine who promote the principle of two states for two peoples who could eventually bring about a true and stable peace in accordance with international law. It is we who encourage national, civil and human rights. It is we, and not those who demonize one side, reinforce intransigence and weaken the two-state movement by promoting unrealistic and destructive solutions.

<title>When 'safety' is a threat </title>
<date>Fri Nov 05 01:36:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Last year Jewish college students in San Diego were confronted with a significant escalation of anti-Israel activity at two of our large state universities. This included a divestment resolution, a showy student-run "Apartheid Week," which was co-sponsored by departments at one university, and a stream of high-profile anti-Zionist speakers, many of whom were themselves Jewish.
Hillel of San Diego, which serves approximately 5,000 Jewish students on eight campuses across San Diego County, has always taken pride in its proactive Israel agenda; last year at the University of California, San Diego, alone, students organized over 90 Israel-related activities, including musical performances, films, conversational Hebrew language instruction, displays showcasing Israel's contributions to technological advancement and humanitarian needs across the world - and yes, also political speakers offering a variety of perspectives. However, in the face of the divestment resolution  (which was not approved ) and the visibility of the other anti-Israel activities, some members of the local Jewish community expressed concern that Jewish students were not fighting back in a strong enough fashion.
The issue of how students should "fight back" against anti-Israel activities on college campuses raises a dilemma for thoughtful people who care about the future of both the State of Israel and the Jewish people. On the one hand, we obviously cannot let the virulence of anti-Israel propaganda go unchallenged. We all know the danger and the threat posed by the rise of delegitimation efforts against the Jewish state.
On the other hand, fighting fiery speech with fiery speech serves only to enflame the campus. A polarized campus quickly turns into small groups of activists screaming at each other while the vast majority of students, who are uninformed, uncertain or simply turned off by the rhetoric, flee to the perceived safety of apathy. "Safety" is the operative word. Many students do not have the option of choosing their roommates, classmates or dining-hall mates. While well-meaning advisors usually have the luxury of going home in the evening to people who likely share their views, this refuge is not available to many students.
As a consequence, we have found that in this environment of heightened conflict, it is more difficult to engage uninvolved students around Israel issues. Even worse, it becomes more difficult to engage Jewish students around any aspect of Jewish life, not just Israel-related issues. They just don't want to be associated with the hostility. Polarization significantly undermines our work of encouraging both a love of Israel and a love of Judaism.
On the third hand, Jews have a long and distinguished tradition of "mahloket leshem shamayim," an argument for the sake of heaven, or disagreement expressed in a civil manner. On campus, as in the larger Jewish world, there are many views about the Arab-Israeli conflict. In the midst of the heightened tensions, we recognized anew that left-leaning Jewish students often feel bereft of community because of their politics. They are uncomfortable both with Jewish leadership's unwavering political support of Israel and with the demonization of the country that they see among their friends on the left.
Hillel has long prided itself on being a pluralistic organization, where students can explore and experience a range of authentic Jewish perspectives so they can decide for themselves where in the Jewish world they want to belong. Where do progressive students fit into the spectrum and what is our responsibility toward them?
Over the past two months, the board of Hillel of San Diego has gone through an in-depth process to address these questions and to come up with guidelines for Israel programming on campus. The guidelines confirmed the importance of the partnership of Hillel staff and students working together to create a proactive agenda that includes a wide range of Israeli cultural, social, educational and political activities that serve to strengthen students' personal connection with the country. In addition, we continue to trust our students to engage thoughtfully in the  so-called marketplace of ideas by striving to ensure a balance of political views. We encourage the creation of a space in which Jewish students can explore their values and commitments with regard to Israel without fear of being ostracized.
There are, however, limits to our multi-vocalism. Hillel of San Diego will not support any speaker or program that delegitimizes the State of Israel, demonizes Israel or promotes racism or hatred of any kind. We also are strongly opposed to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which we see as part of the delegitimation effort. In the face of such activities, Hillel of San Diego staff will work with student groups to be prepared with a strong, directly targeted response.
In the face of growing polarization in the American cultural scene, the standard joke that two Jews will have three opinions is rapidly changing to the unfunny scenario of two Jews with two opinions. At Hillel of San Diego we deplore this polarization. We are looking for a new paradigm that fosters a lasting commitment to Jewish life, a deep and intellectually honest attachment to Israel and opportunities for the next generation of Jewish leaders to find their many voices. We hope our new approach will help create the kind of community in which that paradigm can emerge.

<title>Who will be our Bono? </title>
<date>Sun Jul 18 01:47:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Notice the difference. Israel's biggest pop icon, Shlomo Artzi, takes part in a vacuous march masquerading as a civic-political protest with the aid of a ratings-hungry media. There, in this well-advertised space, Artzi effuses about the "line of the heart" and implores "the gods of reason, feeling and mind to bring back Gilad so he can be free as a bird."
In Ireland and Britain, by contrast, pop icons use their success and admiration to effect political change. Front men Bono of U2 and Chris Martin of Coldplay do not fear engaging in political activism. Quite the contrary: They see it as a goal and are willing to use their power as celebrities to cause revolutionary change and try to create a more just and better world.
Around two years ago, Nathan Jackson published a book covering Bono's development as a political activist ("Bono's Politics: The Future of Celebrity Political Activism" ). In the 1980s, the Irish rocker's activism was limited to Ireland, but in the middle of that decade Bono became aware of Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela, and joined the fight against apartheid.
Has Artzi ever said anything against the denial of rights to Palestinians living under occupation, or against the government's brutal and aggressive policy in many different aspects of Israeli life? Heaven forbid. Has he ever spoken out against arrogant declarations of war, unnecessary military actions, settler violence and racism against migrant workers? Inconceivable.
In 2003, Chris Martin came out on the front page of The Daily Mail against then-prime minister Tony Blair and his decision to join the coalition that would attack Iraq. There's hardly a need to elaborate on Bono's inexhaustible energy in fighting poverty and HIV/AIDS in Africa.
These campaigns, Jackson says, make Bono an outstanding political celebrity. Bono led a campaign against nuclear power stations in the north of England, and used a documentary film he helped produce to protest against the siege on Sarajevo from 1992 to 1995. With Bob Geldof, Bono joined a series of concerts and events throughout the world dedicated to scrapping Africa's $70 billion in debt, and to sending 35 million children to school.
The U2 front man is not fond of titles like "celebrity" or "philanthropist." In an interview in 2005, he said political activism for him was a goal as worthy as musical achievement. Celebrity, he said, is the currency one uses to make political change. After all, what can a rocker make other than noise, he asked.
Have you ever heard Artzi use his popularity to offer an intellectual alternative to the paradigms of power that guide Israel's leaders? Did he ever take the risk of making a bold political statement? Don't we deserve fewer sugarcoated front pages with Artzi and more political activism of Bono's kind?

<title>With a victory like this... </title>
<date>Mon Aug 23 01:58:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Two years ago, a basketball tournament was held at Tel Aviv University with the participation of student teams from 14 countries, including a Palestinian team from the occupied territories. The games were purportedly held "without preconditions," and every team put its best players on the court and aimed to win.
But unsurprisingly, the Shin Ben security service permitted only seven Palestinian players, including bench players, to enter Israel. Some of the key players on the team were compelled to stay at home. After several losses  (by 30 to 40 points), when it was the Palestinians' turn to face a team from one of the Israeli colleges, their coach announced that he had decided to spare his players another humiliation, and requested that the game be canceled.
The illuminating movie "Friendship Games," to be shown tonight on the Yes Docu channel  (directed by Ram Levy, along with Ibtisam Mara'ana, Duki Dror and Yoav Shamir), documents the tournament, which was the initiative of Ed Peskowitz, an American Jew and co-owner of the Atlanta Hawks basketball team in the NBA. The camera follows the Israeli coach to the Palestinian locker room. After a long while, he tells his players that in order to even out the teams, two of them will join the other side. He tells two of the Israeli bench players, including one known as Fatso, to don the shirts of the Palestinian team. The game ends with a decisive victory for the Israeli team and a strong sense of missed opportunity.
The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, like the basketball game, have preconditions. Not the conditions demanded by the Palestinians, but conditions dictated by Israel. The refusal to freeze Israeli building in East Jerusalem is a precondition, just like the demand to freeze it. The refusal to resume negotiations from the point where talks between the previous prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas left off after the Annapolis conference is no less a precondition than the demand to resume talks from square one.
The head referee, the president of the United States, has twisted the arms of his colleagues in the Quartet and is dragging Abbas to Washington. Barack Obama decided that the negotiations will be held without any commitment regarding building in East Jerusalem, and will be opened without even a declaration of principles stating that the talks will be held on the basis of a general formula, like peace and security for Israel and a state along the 1967 borders for the Palestinians. It's time to jump into the fountain in Rabin Square and cheer: The Palestinians have been shafted!
If Benjamin Netanyahu's aim is to play around as much as possible with the ball, and sometimes kick the opponent, then he can really chalk up another victory. But Israel's success in the negotiations, like the success of the student team in the tournament, is not measured by the terms "victory" or "defeat." What is victory over a weak Palestinian team worth, if it was won in friendly games that ended with virtually no interaction between the participants? What is a political process with the Palestinians worth if it erodes Abbas' standing and leads nowhere?
What have we to gain from humiliating our partner before his constituency on the way to the negotiating table? If Israel's approach on every one of the core issues is that winning is everything, there's no point in bothering so many VIPs with another unnecessary summit. Let's assume that we'll succeed, with the help of the Jewish power around Obama, to twist Abbas' arm some more and extract, for example, an agreement in which he concedes sovereignty over the Temple Mount. How many hours would such an agreement last?
All we need is a few more "victories" like the invitation to the launch of direct negotiations, "without preconditions," and we'll lose our last partners to a settlement that will prevent Israel from turning into an apartheid state or a Palestinian state  (the binational model is a nightmare, as far as I'm concerned).
What will we do if Abbas announces that he's had enough of losing in purportedly friendly games, and that he's decided the time has come to step down? Will we declare another victory and invite Hamas leader Khaled Meshal and Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the party?

<title>Zionists are not settlers. Zionists are not racists </title>

Israel Harel unsheathed the doomsday weapon that the right wing reserves for use when it feels threatened, in his article "Zionists are not tattletales" on this page on May 20. When Israeli patriots stand up and seek to end the occupation, with or without an agreement, and to establish an exemplary society here, that is when the right attacks.
Their weapon used to be din rodef - the Talmudic "law of the pursuer," which permits the extrajudicial killing of someone who endangers a life. But that ended with a pistol shot in a city square, when a Jewish terrorist shot prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in the back.
So now it's din moser, which permits killing a Jew who intends to turn another Jew in to the gentile authorities. Thus we witness the right calling the left "shtinkerim," i.e. "informers."
The uproar broke out 10 days ago, when the National Left, Peace Now, the Ofek student association and other leftist Zionist groups held a rally. Instead of demonstrating in our own little area, Tel Aviv, we decided to gather in Zion Square, in downtown Jerusalem. We came wearing white shirts and waving Israeli flags and placards saying "Zionists, not settlers," and we sang "Hatikva." And we paid for everything from our own Zionist sources, without any help from foreign governments.
This infuriated Harel and his cohorts. The national flag and anthem have been the exclusive property of the right for years. That is why they won the elections.
But the right is not the "national camp"; it's the binational camp. The national camp is the left, which wants to get out of the territories. For though the left fears Qassam rockets, it is terrified by the fact that since 2008, there has been a Jewish minority between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea - and by the fact that if we do not leave the territories, Zionism will drown in a binational ocean and Ahmed Tibi will be prime minister.
Harel claims that Ofra is the equivalent of the prestate "tower and stockade" settlements, that today's settlements in the territories are a continuation of the pioneering enterprise of that time.
But when David Ben-Gurion and the Jews in Palestine encouraged settlement under the nose of the British, they were building Jewish sovereignty and creating a Jewish majority in places that the world had designated for a Jewish state. When Harel and his friends establish settlements, they are undermining the Jewish state's sovereignty and its internationally recognized borders, and aiding the Palestinians in perpetuating an Arab majority. And they are thereby fostering the declaration of a binational state.
Harel accuses us of "hatred." The founding manifesto of the National Left, he charges, is phrased in the language of excoriation. But Harel himself headed the Yesha Council of settlements back in the 1980s - when, in a politely worded resolution, it demanded that the territories be annexed, and that "the legal status of Jews who reside permanently in in Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] and Gaza be set as [making] them subject to Israeli law, courts and administration." In less-laundered language, like that of the above-mentioned manifesto, Harel and his council were demanding that we become an apartheid state. We refused, because that isn't Zionism.
Since that unfortunate resolution, that stain on the people of Zion, Israeli law has still not been applied to those Jews. But Harel and company still seek to impose a settler law code on the Arabs. For example, when a soldier removes a caravan from an illegal outpost, there is a "price tag": A mosque will be torched, or a Palestinian wheat field set alight. Harel, who tries to depict himself as a settler with a Jewish heart, doesn't hear of such things, or see them or smell them.
But when something is said about the settlers, he is quick to react: "Shtinkerim! Zionists are not tattletales!" And other similar sentiments, all in refined Hebrew.
We prefer to reply in our Rabinesque language: Zionists are not settlers. Zionists are not racists. Let the Zionists return to their own borders.

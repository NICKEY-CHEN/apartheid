Hundreds of protestors rallied Friday in the Israeli Arab town of Baka al-Garbiyeh against the contruction of the separation fence to the east of the town.

Police at the scene of the demonstration say that there have been no untoward incidents recorded so far.

The protestors are bitter about the erection of the fence, which they say divides residents from the Palestinian section of the town, Baka al-Sharqiya. Palestinians demonstrated on the opposite side of the fence.

The protestors carried signs decrying the "Apartheid fence."

There was also a small demonstration of peace activists in Jerusalem, where right-wing hecklers shouted insults at the protestors.

Terror suspect's brother, wife said arrested Palestinian sources in Nablus reported Friday that Israeli security forces arrested the brother of a senior Fatah militant during an operation in the Old City on Thursday.

According to the sources, the operation was aimed at catpuring Naif Abu Shareh, who is believed to be the IDF's top Fatah target in the Nablus area

The sources added that, later in the night, the IDF arrested Abu Shareh's wife, in an apparent attempt to pressure him into surrendering.

On Friday, troops in the West Bank safely defused an explosive device they found on a Tul Karm road before dawn Friday, Israel Radio reported.

In the Gaza Strip, Palestinians fired two anti-tank missiles at an IDF base near the Neve Dekalim settlement and a mortar shell at the Neve Dekalim industrial area and at another settlement, according to the radio. There were no injuries.

Security forces arrested 13 Palestinians in Hebron suspected of throwing firebombs and stones at Israeli vehicles, Israel Radio reported Friday morning. Four other wanted Palestinians were arrested overnight in the West Bank, Itim reported.

IDF lifts blockade on Jenin The IDF lifted the blockade on the West Bank city of Jenin on Thursday for the first time since the hudna cease-fire collapsed in August 2003. The decision was made due to a decline in the number of terror warning in the area.

The IDF will remove some of the roadblocks surrounding the city and will enable Palestinian cars to travel through other IDF roadblocks.

Colonel Oren Avman, the commander of the main brigade in the area, met Thursday afternoon with his Palestinian counterpart to inform him of the decision.

Jenin has been under an almost continuous blockade since September 2000, except for a month during the hudna. At the moment, Nablus is the only West Bank city under blockade.

Clashes over separation fence Palestinians and foreign demonstrators clashed with IDF troops at a protest over the West Bank separation fence Thursday.

Palestinians threw rocks at troops near a fence construction site in the West Bank village of Budrus. Troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the demonstrators.

Two officers wounded in Nablus Two IDF officers suffered moderate wounds Thursday from an explosive device detonated near their vehicle in the casbah (marketplace) of the West Bank city of Nablus, Israel Radio reported. The two were evacuated to Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva for treatment.

The report said that the soldiers were carrying out routine operations in the area when an explosion when off near their jeep. The army has been continuing operations in Nablus for several weeks due to the high number of terror alerts emanating from the West Bank city.

Early Thursday, Israeli troops tightened a curfew on Nablus, conducting house-to-house searches for fugitives, witnesses said. Overnight, soldiers evacuated residents from their homes as they looked for militants, they said. In some places, the troops fired at furniture and walls, they added.

IDF soldiers on Wednesday had shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian who was in a group of youths throwing rocks at Israeli cars on a road west of Nablus, relatives said. The military said the youth was building a stone barrier across the road when soldiers told him to surrender.

The army has carried out a series of raids in Nablus, a center of militant activity, for more than two weeks. It had no immediate comment on Thursday's incidents.

In Jerusalem, a two-kilogram pipe bomb was found and safely defused Thursday at a police station near the Nablus Gate in Jerusalem. Police believe the motive behind the bomb was nationalist.

Security official: Fence to annex 6 percent of W. Bank
By Haaretz Service,	Gideon Alon	and Haaretz Correspondnet	| Jan. 4, 2004 | 12:00 AM

Six percent of West Bank territory will effectively be annexed into the Green Line with the completion of the separation fence planned for the end of 2005, a security official said on Sunday.

The official, speaking to a forum in support of the West Bank fence, said that the first and second phases of construction have already transferred 1.7 percent of West Bank territory to the west side of the fence.

In addition, Ministry of Defense data revealed that the fence's deviation eastward from the Green Line in the area between Salem and the settlement of Elkana has resulted in 15,000 Palestinians being located west of the fence. This population includes the residents of Baka al-Sharkiya as well as Palestinians residing illegally in Israel.

Lapid: Israel could face world boycott over fence Justice Minister Yosef Lapid warned the cabinet on Sunday that the upcoming discussion by the International Court of Justice at The Hague on the construction of the separation fence between Israel and the West Bank could be the first step in Israel being treated like a modern-day apartheid-era South Africa. He warned that Israel could be liable to international boycotts similar to those placed on South Africa during its apartheid regime.

The justice minister said that Israel had brought this on itself for not sticking to the original route of the fence in the West Bank, along the Green Line, thus turning the matter into an international dispute. He advised the cabinet to hold another discussion on the route "which will give us a degree of flexibility in international forums."

In response, Health Minister Danny Naveh on Sunday called Lapid's comments "dangerous." He criticized Lapid for even raising the matter.

Shas leader MK Eli Yishai said Lapid's comments put lives in danger. He said he was "sorry that Lapid was more concerned about Israel's image in the eyes of the world than by the need to worry about the needs of Israel's citizens."

MK Yossi Sarid (Meretz) demanded that Lapid appear before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee to explain what Israel should expect from the court discussion.

Balad MK Jamal Zahalka said in response to Lapid's comments that it is not enough to alter the route of the fence. The barrier should be torn down, he said, as "it is being built in contravention of international law." He expressed his hope that "intense pressure will be applied on Israel to force if to dismantle its racist wall."

The head of the Prime Minister's Bureau, Dov Weisglass, told the cabinet Sunday that an inter-ministerial committee of legal experts was putting together Israel's line of defense ahead of the Hague discussion.

Weisglass said that the panel's recommendations would be brought for the approval of a special forum comprising Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, Vice Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom, Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz and Lapid.

This forum of ministers will also decide on the line of defense Israel will present to the court.

The International Court of Justice has set a deadline of the end of this month for submitting arguments and said it would begin hearings on the fence issue on February 23.

The court announced the timetable with unusual speed last month, just 11 days after the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution asking the UN's highest judicial authority to render an urgent opinion on the issue.

The court, also known as the world court, said the United Nations or any of its member states may submit written arguments by January 30. Countries wishing to present oral arguments must inform the court by February 13, and hearings would begin 10 days later.

Although the Palestinian Authority is not a member, it would be permitted to state its case by virtue of its status as a UN observer and co-sponsor of the resolution requesting the court's intervention, the court said.

The court gave no estimate of how long the proceedings might last or when it might render its opinion. In the past, the 15 judges have taken months, and sometimes years, to publish their findings, although the court said it was taking "all necessary steps to accelerate the procedure."

Don't judge a Jewish community by its numbers
Rabbi Nathan Asmouch embodies in his own life story the story of the Jewish fate in the 20th century: He is the son of a father from Iraq and a mother from Britain who made their home in Vancouver, Canada.
By Yair Sheleg	| Jan. 5, 2004 | 12:00 AM

Rabbi Nathan Asmouch embodies in his own life story the story of the Jewish fate in the 20th century: He is the son of a father from Iraq and a mother from Britain who made their home in Vancouver, Canada.

Their home was traditional, but as Asmouch grew up, he found it insufficient and sought a stronger religious experience. He came to Israel to learn at the Sephardi Beit Midrash in the Old City's Jewish Quarter in Jerusalem, and married a girl from Hungary, Kathleen, who had also come to Israel to study Judaism.

After the birth of three children and a rabbinical stint in Hungary, Asmouch and his family set out for Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, where he serves as rabbi of the small Jewish community numbering 150 people.

For Asmouch, there are six countries involved in the story of his life - Iraq, England, Canada, Hungary, Israel and Zimbabwe - and he is only 33.

Last week, Asmouch arrived for a short visit in Israel to participate in the international conference of rabbis from the Diaspora held by the Amiel organization - a group that for 20 years has offered training programs for rabbis who go to serve Jewish communities in the Diaspora.

"This is a community of descendants of Jews who came from Lithuania at the beginning of the 20th century," Asmouch says. "They wanted to get to South Africa, but due to immigration quotas, they were not taken accepted but came to Zimbabwe (which at the time was ruled by whites and called Rhodesia, Y.S.). Our community is more traditional in spirit than the community in the capital, Harare, where there are now 300 Jews. Even though they have a larger community, they do not have a rabbi, the number of families that keep kosher is smaller, and they do not have an old age home. Their elderly population comes to our old age home."

Since the end of the apartheid regime in Zimbabwe in 1980, and especially since President Robert Mugabe came to power in 1987, the country's economic situation has degenerated considerably.

Inflation has now reached 600 percent a year, Asmouch says, as he takes from his pocket a banknote of 5,000 Zimbabwe dollars. "With this banknote, I can't even buy a bottle of cola, and when I get back to Zimbabwe, it will no doubt be worth even less than it did when I left for Israel," he says. "People rush to buy as much as they can the moment they receive their salaries, because a few days later their salary is already worth far less. People find it hard to survive the month when a loaf of bread costs 3,000 local dollars, and the average salary is only about 40,000 dollars."

One of the main factors for the deteriorating economy is the regime's harsh attitude toward the white minority, an attitude that has caused white investors to flee. In 2000, the blacks embarked, with the encouragement of the regime (or at least without any official intervention), on a campaign of looting farms owned by whites, who controlled about one-quarter of the country's land. This activity, along with doubts expressed by international observers about the propriety of the country's elections procedures, has led to the shunning of Zimbabwe by the West. The result is that whites in general, and among them the Jews, are trying to leave the country en masse. Asmouch says that in his community, the only people who have remained are "those who cannot afford to leave: Old people who have no future abroad, or people who still have businesses that they are unable to sell."

In the three months since having taken over his current post, five families have already left. The young people are intent on starting their lives in a more promising place, so that "of the 150 families in the community, about 30 are living in the old age home."

The country's Jewish and Muslim population is a mere fraction of the overall population, which totals 12 million.

Given the dwindling nature of the Jewish community, one might think that Asmouch would try to shut it down in a respectable fashion. "People have told me that within five years, there will no longer be a community, but I still believe that we will hold on." However, he himself does not plan to stay there for very long: When his children get older and need an intensive Jewish education, he plans to return to Israel.

What is most interesting about Bulawayo's Jewish community is that despite its small size, it maintains a Jewish school - of the 180 students, only four are Jewish. All the rest - mainly Christians, who comprise about 40 percent of the state, but also "a few Muslims" - come from non-Jewish homes "and pay good money," because "it's considered a good school, and they are also interested in Jewish ethics."

The curriculum includes both secular and Jewish content. Therefore, every Friday, the students assemble for a general service. "All of them (including the Christians and the Muslims, Y.S.) wear a skullcap, say [the morning prayer] Modeh ani and the blessing over wine for the Sabbath, and finish by singing Hatikva and Zimbabwe's national anthem," Asmouch says.

This is a surrealistic scene that larger and stronger Jewish communities, like some in France, would be glad to copy. Asmouch fulfills all the religious functions in the community: He is responsible for the minyan (prayer quorum) - "Every day, we have a minyan for afternoon and evening services, morning prayers on Monday and Thursday, and of course Sabbath services" - he reads from the Torah, and many times also serves as the cantor ("I have already managed to deal with their liturgy, which is Ashkenazi"). He also performs funerals and performs ritual slaughtering of fowl; the community imports kosher beef from neighboring South Africa.

Kathleen Asmouch, who took a special training course for wives of rabbis at Amiel, is active among the women of Bulawayo's Jewish community. The Jews of Zimbabwe are in a difficult position because they are part of the country's white minority, not because they are Jews. "There is no anti-Semitism in the country," Asmouch says. "I, for example, go around wearing a skullcap, and I don't feel any problem. The attitude from the average person on the street is, in fact, very warm and friendly, including from the Muslims. Even the Israeli-Palestinian conflict doesn't influence them."

However, the anxieties are always there, and every incident makes the Jews jumpy. On the eve of last Yom Kippur, the community's synagogue was burned down. The police investigation attributed the incident to a group of homeless people who lived in the neighborhood and lit a fire near the synagogue. "But nevertheless the community still has its doubts," Asmouch says.

The government too, he says, is not free of attempts to fan anti-Semitic sentiments. "The president and the information minister have said things of an anti-Semitic nature. The pro-government newspaper has also accused the community of responsibility for the fire at the synagogue, on the grounds that it was caused by an attempt to smuggle fuel at the synagogue building. But the general public does not believe these things, and therefore, the warm attitude toward us has been maintained," he says.

"Representatives of all of the city's communities came to participate with us in the memorial service we held for the synagogue 30 days after the fire," he says. "Many people came to console us, and there were those, mostly Christians but also a few Muslims, who offered to help us rebuild the synagogue. Even after we managed to save the Torah scrolls from the fire and we needed them to be guarded, there was one Muslim who volunteered to do that."

Former Marranos come out of hiding

Rabbi Elisha Sallas, who also came to take part in the Amiel conference, serves as the community rabbi of the Marranos in Belmont, Portugal.

It is, in fact, a community of the descendants of Marranos. Some 15 years ago, Rabbi Eliyahu Avichail discovered the community and made sure that all members underwent full ritual conversion to Judaism.

Like Asmouch, Sallas followed a circuitous route until he arrived in Belmont seven months ago. He was born in Chile, where he worked as an accountant. But then he decided to make a professional and spiritual change, so he immigrated to Israel in 1999. When he failed to make the transition in Israel as a tax adviser, "mostly because of the language," he moved from Ra'anana to Gush Etzion. He also studied at Jerusalem's Sephardi Beit Midrash, where he received rabbinical ordination.

To make money, he worked at a gas station in Gush Etzion. One day, Rabbi Eliyahu Birnbaum, the director of Amiel and a resident of the area, stopped for gas, and after speaking to Sallas, the rabbi accepted an offer to go to Belmont. Sallas did not move his family there, however, due to the issue of his children's education.

About 150 descendants of the Marranos are affiliated with the Belmont congregation, the only Marrano community in Portugal that has survived. Sallas says the community persevered due to its location on the border between Spain and Portugal. "When the Spanish Inquisition arose, they fled to Portugal, and when the Inquisition in Portugal arose, they fled to Spain. This is what allowed them to survive."

Until converting, community members observed Jewish customs in secret. "They married in church, but parallel to that they also held a ceremony at home that had a Jewish nature," Sallas says. "Among the Jewish holidays, they kept only Yom Kippur and Passover, but in their own special way, and they lit Sabbath candles. Each family, for example, observed Yom Kippur on a day of its own, because each of them had a different tradition respecting the day on which the holiday fell. They would light the Sabbath candles only after making sure that all the curtains were drawn due to the fears of an `evil spirit,' and then they would immediately extinguish them" (apparently a remnant of their fear, which has been long forgotten, over revealing the candles throughout the generations).

Today, the community observes the accepted Jewish customs according to Sephardi practice, but there are still traces of the ancient customs. "For example, when someone dies, the men say the afternoon and evening prayers at home during the seven days of mourning, as is customary, but before that, the women say an unfamiliar prayer, which apparently had been used by the Marranos," Sallas says. "After the seven days, they clean the house, take the deceased's clothing and wash them in hot water at the river, and then give them to one of the poor members of the community."

Sallas does not try stripping these customs from the community but encourages their preservation. "I am interested in having them preserve their unique identity. I also have a sense that inside their homes, without telling me, they observe other ancient customs."

One custom he is trying to wean them from is that of marrying only within the clan. "I very much want them to get to know other Jews, but it's hard to convince them," he says. "A few years ago, the Jewish Agency invited a boy and a girl from the community to Israel so they could meet mates here. In the end, after the visit, they returned to Portugal and married each other."

Voice of conscience

As the new year begins, I wish to comment, for once, on the messenger rather than the message. To me, Haaretz is the conscience of our nation. As Israelis become more and more entrenched in their role as occupiers; as we find more and more reasons to justify our callousness and indifference to the suffering of our neighbors; as we become experts in "dehumanizing" and more and more like our former tormentors (to the surprise and dismay of our few remaining friends), Haaretz puts its circulation at risk every day by forcing its readers to face the ugliness of our position and the consequences of supporting a government that includes "assassinations" as part of its daily agenda and has lost all sight of our old Jewish values. I don't know what moves you guys, but I just hope you'll keep it up!

Let them criticize Arafat, too

Is there not hypocrisy among the Palestinian protesters and Israeli "peace activists"? We have yet to see them surround Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat's headquarters and demand that he hand over the billions of dollars he stole from the Palestinian people, money earmarked to create jobs, housing, education, food and welfare programs. Neither do they protest the illegal lynching of Palestinian "conspirators" or the unethical way the Palestinian terrorists hide among their own people and use them as human shields.

It's difficult for Israeli and other "peace activists" to appear credible when they insist on making the conflict a one-sided issue. We have yet to see protesters create a media frenzy in Ramallah by demanding that Arafat stop sending PA terrorists to murder innocent Israelis, or that he stop the broadcast of Palestinian TV programs, school curricula, and public and religious speeches inciting violence and hatred against Jews. If they truly want peace for everyone, the "peace activists" need to start directing their energies and resources to demanding vital changes in Palestinian society, too.

In our interest

It should be clear to all of us that if we want a state where Jews are a majority, then it is in our interest to actually help create a viable, independent, separate Palestinian state, thus avoiding apartheid. How is it that the Likud Party and its supporters can not see this?

Make them pay

Regarding "IDF: Settlers can leave outposts or pay evacuation cost" by Amos Harel and Jonathan Lis, December 31

This is surely a long-awaited first step, but it doesn't go far enough. The settlers should pay for the dismantling of all illegal outposts, whether they cooperate with the evacuation or not. A new law is needed making anyone who attempts physically to prevent soldiers and police from carrying out the eviction, guilty of a criminal offense, which can carry a prison sentence. If we really mean to do it, let's do it right.

The real battle in The Hague
The trial in The Hague is providing the U.S. administration with an opportunity to influence Sharon. After the ruling, the case will return to UN headquarters in New York; and there, Israel will be in need of American assistance in order to bury the conclusions and to guarantee that they won't be translated into a hostile resolution in the UN Security Council.

Israel will be present at the discussion about the separation fence in the International Court of Justice in The Hague mainly in order to lose honorably. Nobody in Jerusalem has any illusions that Israel can come out ahead in the decision by the 15 learned judges who were asked to express their opinion regarding "the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying power, in the occupied Palestinian territory."

Israel is chronically isolated in international organizations, and always wavers between its desire for recognition and legitimacy, and its tendency to dismiss the "UM-Shmum" [a derogatory reference to the UN by Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion; UM is the Hebrew acronym for UN].

The same holds true in the case of the fence: The prime minister decided to respond to the claims of the Palestinians, and to present a detailed Israeli position to the court, with the help of a team of legal scholars and a very famous British attorney. At the same time, senior officials dismiss the move as "a joke," and say that at most, it will provide another argument for opponents of the fence.

But we are only consoling ourselves. In the absence of a political process, the trial in The Hague will lie at the heart of diplomatic activity, and it shouldn't be discounted. A similar opinion rendered in 1971 by the international court, which rejected the legality of the South African occupation of Namibia, was an important step along the road to sanctions and the toppling of the apartheid regime. There is no doubt that this is the goal of the Palestinians, who initiated the request to the court and won the backing of the UN General Assembly.

The real battle in The Hague will be conducted on two levels - the legal and the practical. The legal process is designed to strengthen the Palestinian demand to see the Green Line as a recognized international border, with every Israeli penetration beyond it constituting a violation of the law. Israel rejects this, claiming that the West Bank and Gaza Strip are "disputed territories," which were never under the control of another sovereign, and that the occupation is legal for reasons of self-defense.

International borders are not sacred; they express a balance of powers. The Green Line was drawn in 1949 as a temporary solution in the cease-fire agreements that ended the War of Independence. The agreements state that the line is not a precedent for a final political solution, and will not dictate the borders in the future. Several years later, when it confronted demands for concessions in the Galilee and the Negev, Israel claimed that the cease-fire lines "are the permanent borders, with both political and moral validity," and that they can be changed only in peace agreements.

After the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel went back to the limited interpretation, and considered the previous lines as nothing more than marks on a map. The anticipated decision in The Hague will severely undermine the Israeli claim.

On the practical level, Israel is having a hard time convincing anyone with its argument that the fence is "another means of fighting terrorism" and will not determine political borders - especially when Prime Minister Sharon speaks of "physical disengagement" from the Palestinians.

Officials in Jerusalem assess that the U.S. administration has come to terms with the present route of the fence, adjacent to the Green Line, and understands its necessity for security purposes. Criticism from Washington is shaky, and the cutback in loan guarantees was a minor punishment for Israel.

The problem as far as the Americans are concerned lies elsewhere: They vehemently reject Sharon's idea of an "eastern fence," and consider it an aggressive move to annex the Jordan Valley and the ridges that dominate it, while closing the Palestinians into a large holding pen. They have difficulty seeing why the project is necessary for security.

The trial in The Hague is providing the U.S. administration with an opportunity to influence Sharon. After the ruling, the case will return to UN headquarters in New York; and there, Israel will be in need of American assistance in order to bury the conclusions and to guarantee that they won't be translated into a hostile resolution in the UN Security Council.

Sharon's office believes that the United States will answer the call. It was opposed to the discussion in The Hague, and in any case is not enthusiastic about strengthening international institutions. But in diplomacy there are no free lunches - and we can assume that in exchange for removing the legal nuisance, Washington will demand that Israel give up the idea of the eastern fence.

Gov't sources: Qureia can't take steps needed to renew talks
Senior J'lem sources: Palestinian PM 'isn't capable of doing anything'; PA leaders discuss unilateral establishment of Palestinian state.
By Aluf Benn	and Nathan Guttman Haaretz Service, Agencies	| Jan. 8, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Senior government sources in Jerusalem on Saturday said that Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala) is incapable of creating the conditions required to renew peace negotiations, in particular in regard to security matters.

"He isn't capable of doing anything under any conditions," they said.

Contacts to coordinate a meeting between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Abu Ala are currently completely frozen. Dov Weisglass, head of the Prime Minister's Office, continues to hold phone conversations on occasion with his Palestinian counterpart, Hassan abu-Libda, but the talks contain little substantive material.

PA leaders discuss unilateral establishment of state Palestinian leaders on Saturday reasserted the right to unilaterally declare an independent state in the absence of a peace deal with Israel, responding to Israel's own threats of one-sided action.

The PLO Executive Committee, one of the Palestinians' key leadership bodies, met Friday night to discuss the ongoing conflict with Israel and reiterated the right to declare a state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Arab parts of Jerusalem.

But the Palestinians' path to statehood has come under question amid warnings by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon that he could give up on peace talks and draw a boundary that would leave the Palestinians with much less land than they seek.

The back-and-forth talk of unilateral action reflects frustration on both sides with more than three years of fighting and stalled peace talks.

On Saturday, Saleh Rafat, a member of the PLO committee, said Israel's actions will not prevent the Palestinians from declaring "an independent Palestinian state within the 1967 border." But there are no immediate plans to declare a state, Rafat said.

Cabinet minister Saeb Erekat also emphasized that a "two-state solution is the option of the Palestinian leadership."

An adviser to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on Friday dismissed statements by Palestinian Prime Minister Qureia that raised the possibility of a single Arab-Jewish state in Israel and the Palestinian territories, in the event that no progress is made by the two sides.

The Israeli official, Zalman Shoval, called the remarks by Qureia, also known as Abu Ala, an "empty threat."

"Mr. Abu Ala has threatened to call for a binational state, but he may just as well call for a Palestinian state on the moon," Shoval said. "This is an empty threat that Israel is obviously not going to think seriously about."

An adviser to Sharon, Dore Gold, said a hasty Palestinian declaration of statehood would lead to instability.

"There are no shortcuts to peace," Gold said. "The way forward to peace ... requires a dismantlement of terrorism and an unconditional cease-fire."

Powell: U.S. opposes one-state solution United States Secretary of States Colin Powell said Thursday that he opposes a one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and that the United States remains committed to the two state solution, in which an independent Palestinian state will border Israel.

Powell, speaking at a State Department press conference, expressed disappointment at the lack of progress in talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

Qureia said earlier on Thursday that Palestinians would pursue a binational state and demand the same rights as Israelis if Israel carried out its threat to absorb chunks of the West Bank.

Asked if Qureia's one-state idea was viable, Powell said: "No. We're committed to a two-state solution. I believe that's the only solution that will work: a state for the Palestinian people called Palestine and a Jewish state, state of Israel."

"I don't believe that we can accept a situation that results in anything that one might characterize as apartheid or Bantuism," he added.

"Mr. Sharon ... is looking for reliable partners he can work with and his plans that he has spent some time presenting recently suggest what he feels he might have to do if he doesn't have a reliable partner," Powell said. "What we are trying to do is to get that reliable partner to stand up and start acting."

Powell said he hoped Assistant Secretary of State William Burns, "can build a little momentum to get a little more pressure from Egyptians and others to place on the Palestinian Authority."

"They've got to get going and they have got to wrest authority away from Arafat that will allow (Qureia) to start taking action with respect to terror and violence," he added.

Qureia: Israel's unilateral moves are pushing us toward a one-state solution
Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia said yesterday that Palestinians would seek to forge a single bi-national state with Israel if Israel carried out its threat to absorb parts of the West Bank.
By Reuters	| Jan. 9, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia said yesterday that Palestinians would seek to forge a single bi-national state with Israel if Israel carried out its threat to absorb parts of the West Bank.

Qureia's comments underscored the Palestinians' sense of desperation in the face of comments made by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon that he would implement a unilateral plan, that includes taking over parts of the West Bank, if peacemaking efforts remain frozen.

Qureia said Sharon's unilateralism, including the building of the separation fence, could prompt Palestinians to abandon efforts for a two-state solution to the conflict.

"This is an apartheid solution to put the Palestinians in cantons," he said. "Who can accept this? We will go for a one-state solution... There's no other solution. We will not hesitate to defend the right of our people when we feel the very serious intention [of Israel] to destroy these rights."

Pressuring Israel

Some Palestinian intellectuals say the Palestinian Authority should make clear that, if necessary, it is prepared to dissolve itself in order to put pressure on Israel to make concessions.

Israel, they say, would then have to reassume the full financial and legal burden of caring for the Palestinian population, as it did from after the Six Day War in 1967 until the start of interim self-rule in 1994.

But Palestinian officials say that calling for a bi-national state would be used only as a last resort, since it would mean dropping longstanding aspirations for a state of their own.

Showing maps of the fence, Qureia said it was an attempt to "put Palestinians like chickens in cages. The wall is to unilaterally mark the borders, this is the intention behind the wall... It will kill the road map and kill the two-state vision," he said.

Qureia said he would not meet Sharon until he was assured it would yield progress toward restarting the road map. "If we go out from the meeting without results, the frustration will prevail more and more, and it will be a catastrophe."

Cry, our beloved country
The UN, an institution not highly thought of in Israel, resolved to bring the separation fence to the International Court of Justice in The Hague (ICJ), another institution sneered at in this country. This has already aroused surprising nervousness in Jerusalem's government corridors.

Perhaps, after all, the world will save Israel from itself. Perhaps Israel's real friends will increase the pressure on the government. Perhaps they will understand that, even in Israel, external pressure is not always bad, because it may be the last chance to bring Israel back on the straight and narrow and make it a more just state.

The last attempt is modest, at present, but bodes well. The UN, an institution not highly thought of in Israel, resolved to bring the separation fence to the International Court of Justice in The Hague (ICJ), another institution sneered at in this country. This has already aroused surprising nervousness in Jerusalem's government corridors. Where the outcry of the Palestinians and the protest of the extreme left failed, the UN succeeded. This is not bad news. Suddenly Jerusalem officials discovered the wrongs the fence was causing. After most of its construction was completed, incarcerating thousands of families in compounds without anyone caring, a feeling of discomfort arose in Jerusalem. Yosef Lapid even warned of turning Israel into South Africa in the eyes of the world.

Good morning, justice minister, but your warning is too late. South Africa has been here for a long time already, and this is how most states of the world see it. Still, better late than never, only it's a pity the justice minister needed The Hague threat to understand that the fence his government built is an apartheid fence.

Had he bothered to go and see with his own eyes the thousands of school children waiting every morning, in all weather, for the IDF or Border Police jeep to arrive and open the gate for them on their way to school, the farmers cut off from their fields, the patients kept away from their clinics, the villages locked and bolted and the sight of a town behind barbed wire, he would not have needed the threat from The Hague to understand the injustice. After the settlements, the fence is the next punishment to be forced on the Palestinians. Israel, as usual, ignored it.

South Africa was saved from itself and became a fair state, first and foremost because of international pressure exerted on its government. Had it not been for the economic sanctions and political isolation, perhaps apartheid would have lasted forever. Most of the fighters against apartheid saw the international pressure as a blessing and encouraged it. Regrettably, this applies to the Israeli occupation as well.

The pressure on apartheid South Africa began with a decision of the same ICJ the fence has now been brought before. From there, it's a short step to imposing economic sanctions and other boycotts, until the regime collapses and justice is established in the battered country. This could be the narrative of events in our case too. Anyone who fears for Israel's moral image should not be afraid of this.

Even without the wall, the Israeli occupation could be compared to South Africa's apartheid, even if the Israeli ideology is less despicable. Don't roads for Jews only, as most West Bank roads are today, justify the comparison? Aren't roadblocks distinguishing among people on the sole basis of origin racist?

It is regrettable that the fence reached The Hague. It is a pity Israel did not understand by itself that everyone may build a fence for his defense, but only on his own territory, not his neighbor's. Those who were supposed to raise a hue and cry against the fence that imprisoned people and usurped their land, kept mum. Those whose job it was to preserve the state's moral image and prevent what the fence is causing to tens of thousands of innocent people, betrayed their duty.

The media were not interested, the justice minister waited for The Hague, the attorney general gave everything the stamp of approval and the Supreme Court said not a word. Only the threat from The Hague managed to raise doubts.

Now the fence track around a few imprisoned villages is being modified, in an attempt to correct a little of the evil. What happened? Didn't the IDF know before that Hirbat Jabara would be fenced in from all directions, that Azun would perish behind the fence and that some of Joyous' houses would be cut off from the village? Didn't they look at the maps? Didn't they read the reports? Or the world newspapers?

It is sad that fear of the ICJ fell on this project of iniquity, rather than fear of the High Court of Justice in Jerusalem. Thus, The Hague was left as the last recourse for justice in Israel.

The hope that international institutions will rescue Israel from its evil doing is very problematic. But when the institutions of law and justice of the state fail, there is no recourse but to turn to the international one. Just like it would have been better had the whites in South Africa understood themselves that their regime was based on evil, it would have been better if those in power in Israel understood finally that our occupation regime is based on terrible evil that should have ended a long time ago.

When this does not happen, when 37 years go by and the occupation only becomes more brutal, when the Israeli consciousness is not being "seared" and does not internalize the enormity of the wickedness, there is no choice but to turn to the world for help. "Cry, the beloved country," wrote South African teacher Alan Paton in 1948 about his country's sick regime. The enlightened world cheered. But when the beloved country does not cry out itself, only curls inwardly in indifference, there is no choice but to turn to the world, so that it cries out instead.

PMO rejects Palestinian assertion on right to declare state
PLO body meets in wake of Sharon warning of unilateral Israeli action; J'lem sources: Qureia cannot take steps required to renew talks.
By Haaretz Staff	| Jan. 11, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The Prime Minister's Office on Sunday rejected a statement by the Palestinian leadership reasserting its right to unilaterally declare an independent state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem, Army Radio reported.

The report quoted sources in Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office as saying that the Palestinian Authority could not even manage the cities under its control, and that it was therefore impossible in the current situation to talk about the establishment of a Palestinian state.

The PLO Executive Committee, one of the key Palestinian leadership bodies, met Friday night in the wake of a recent warning by Sharon that Israel would take its own unilateral action should there be no advance in negotiations.

Sharon said that Israel could give up on peace talks and draw a boundary that would leave the Palestinians with much less land than they seek.

The back-and-forth talk of unilateral action reflects frustration on both sides with more than three years of fighting and stalled peace talks.

On Saturday, Saleh Rafat, a member of the PLO committee, said Israel's actions would not prevent the Palestinians from declaring "an independent Palestinian state within the 1967 border." But, he added, there are no immediate plans to declare a state.

Cabinet minister Saeb Erekat also emphasized that a "two-state solution is the option of the Palestinian leadership."

Dore Gold, an advisor to Sharon, said over the weekend that a hasty Palestinian declaration of statehood would lead to instability.

"There are no shortcuts to peace," Gold said. "The way forward to peace... requires a dismantlement of terrorism and an unconditional cease-fire."

Jerusalem sources: Qureia incapable of steps required to renew talks Senior government sources in Jerusalem on Saturday said that Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala) is incapable of creating the conditions required to renew peace negotiations, in particular in regard to security matters.

"He isn't capable of doing anything under any conditions," they said.

Contacts to coordinate a meeting between Sharon and Qureia are currently completely frozen. Dov Weisglass, Sharon's chief of staff, continues to hold phone conversations on occasion with his Palestinian counterpart, Hassan Abu-Libda, but the talks contain little substantive material.

An adviser to Sharon on Friday dismissed statements by Qureia that raised the possibility of a single Arab-Jewish state in Israel and the territories, in the event that no progress is made by the two sides.

The Israeli official, Zalman Shoval, called the remarks by Qureia, also known as Abu Ala, an "empty threat."

"Mr. Abu Ala has threatened to call for a binational state, but he may just as well call for a Palestinian state on the moon," Shoval said. "This is an empty threat that Israel is obviously not going to think seriously about."

Powell: U.S. opposes one-state solution U.S. Secretary of States Colin Powell said Thursday that he opposes a one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and that the United States remains committed to the two state solution, in which an independent Palestinian state will border Israel.

Powell, speaking at a State Department press conference, expressed disappointment at the lack of progress in talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

Qureia said earlier Thursday that Palestinians would pursue a binational state and demand the same rights as Israelis if Israel carried out its threat to absorb chunks of the West Bank.

Asked if Qureia's one-state idea was viable, Powell said: "No. We're committed to a two-state solution. I believe that's the only solution that will work: a state for the Palestinian people called Palestine and a Jewish state, state of Israel."

"I don't believe that we can accept a situation that results in anything that one might characterize as apartheid or Bantuism," he added.

"Mr. Sharon ... is looking for reliable partners he can work with and his plans that he has spent some time presenting recently suggest what he feels he might have to do if he doesn't have a reliable partner," Powell said. "What we are trying to do is to get that reliable partner to stand up and start acting."

Powell said he hoped U.S. Assistant Secretary of State William Burns, "can build a little momentum to get a little more pressure from Egyptians and others to place on the Palestinian Authority."

"They've got to get going and they have got to wrest authority away from Arafat that will allow [Qureia] to start taking action with respect to terror and violence," he added.

Report: Arafat pushing for Madrid-style peace conference
By Yoav Stern Haaretz Service, Agencies	Jan. 11, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat is pushing for a new international peace conference, similar to that held in Madrid in 1991, the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Kabas reported on Sunday.

The conference, which would probably take place in Cairo, would discuss a permanent-status agreement and would seek to end the cycle of violence between Israel and the Palestinians.

The paper quotes close sources to Arafat as saying that the chairman is holding intensive discussions with his top aides and plans to bring the initiative to the Palestine Liberation Organization's Central Committee for approval in the coming days. He is also expected to bring up the issue during an Arab summit in Tunis in March.

The initiative is an attempt to improve the harsh living conditions in the Palestinian territories.

Turkish officials have in the past offered to host such an international conference, there has also been talks in the past of holding such a parley once again in Madrid.

Survival
Sharon, instead of initiating a diplomatic breakthrough that would lead to an end to the conflict with the Palestinians, is focusing on survival. He wants to remain in power as long as possible, and at any price, in order to protect himself, his sons and his family's property from the criminal investigations being conducted against them.

The ministers could not believe their ears. Instead of discussing the problem of the Falashmura, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon began to relate how he visited Ethiopia in the 1960s and got stuck in the jungle in a jeep that would not start. He heard voices in the trees and the situation became tense, until, to his great fortune, a jeep carrying several Britons suddenly appeared and rescued him. They told him that the place was very close to a village whose inhabitants had a custom of giving a very special gift to brides on their wedding day - a man's testicles - and that just that day, the village was celebrating a big wedding.

The message: Sharon now knows only how to speak about himself.

Sharon stopped thinking about Israel and began thinking only about himself and his family a long time ago. Instead of initiating a diplomatic breakthrough that would lead to an end to the conflict with the Palestinians, he is focusing on survival. He wants to remain in power as long as possible, and at any price, in order to protect himself, his sons and his family's property from the criminal investigations being conducted against them.

The peace process and Israel's future do not interest him anymore. His tactic is, therefore, not to do anything, and certainly not to initiate anything, but rather to let the days pass, to procrastinate - in the hope that all the suspicions of bribery and fund-raising for shell companies will evaporate.

There are those who try to find the differences or similarities between the Herzliya speech and that in the Knesset this week; but they were both designed to achieve the same strategic goal - survival. The main thing is that the vote in the Knesset passed peacefully. The things he says are not important, because his government (with Shinui's backing) is investing more and more in construction and roads in the territories; and it is actions that are the determining factor.

Thus, Sharon succeeded in effectively delaying any diplomatic initiative, including the Saudi one of April, 2002, which did not mention the Palestinians right of return. And when Syrian President Bashar Assad speaks now of negotiations, Sharon adopts the response of Khartoum's "refusal front" - no, no and no.

Assad has to first halt the terror, then stop supporting Hezbollah; and finally, we must not forget the torture our soldiers endured in Syrian captivity (And what did they endure in Egypt? And what did their captives endure here? And why is this relevant at all?) - because Sharon is not even dreaming about moving from the Golan Heights. He simply does not want a diplomatic process, and is, therefore, turning Israel into a refusenik state that will live forever by the sword and will be considered a pariah among the family of nations.

On February 23, a trial will open at The Hague that may cause Israel to be accused of war crimes. This may prompt the United Nations to impose economic sanctions on Israel, similar to those imposed on South Africa's apartheid regime - and all because Sharon has decided to use the separation fence to annex territories, shedding and brutalizing, like some writhing snake whose role is to prevent any possibility of the establishment of a Palestinian state. Thus, the occupation will be perpetuated forever - thus also the war, the terror attacks and the social-economic crisis.

When it concerns the interests of his family, Sharon does not balk at anything. When Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presents Sharon with economic plans, Netanyahu is always rewarded with an apathetic response to every clause - except the ones regarding water, land and foreign workers for agriculture.

It has become difficult to follow the host of scandals associated with Sharon - from the bogus associations that illegally financed his election campaign for the leadership of the Likud, to the "loan" from Cyril Kern and the Greek Island affair.

This week, security company owner David Spector said that Sharon was involved up to his neck in the raising of funds for the associations - the opposite of Sharon's claim that he did not know and had not heard anything. This is the chosen mode of defense for the Sharon family: Send the boys in first, to cover for the father who is carrying the protective umbrella of the government.

It seems that after three years as prime minister, Sharon has exhausted his public agenda. He has no more strength. He is preoccupied mainly with himself. He cannot or does not want to get Israel out of the political, economic and social murk, so it would be better if he left the government.

Swedish envoy: We cannot constitutionally remove exhibit
By Yossi Melman Haaretz Service, Agencies	Jan. 17, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The Swedish government is considering issuing a conciliatory note to bring to an end the crisis in relations between the two countries resulting form the controversial art exhibit in Stockholm, according to sources in the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem and hints offered by Swedish Ambassador Robert Rydberg. Israeli Ambassador Zvi Mazel regarded the exhibit as a glorification of suicide bombers - and protested by deliberately vandalizing the installation's presentation.

Rydberg emphasized that his government had no legal recourse to get the installation removed from exhibit, due to stringent freedom of expression laws in Sweden.

The scandal broke out after Mazel turned off the lights aimed at an installation piece made by former Israeli Dror Feiler, now a Swedish citizen, and his Swedish wife Gunnar. The Swedes - and the artists - say the installation was meant to condemn terrorism, but Mazel, backed by the government in Jerusalem, said the Feiler installation, part of an art exhibit accompanying a prestigious international conference on genocide, glorified the bomber - and violated an prior agreement with the Israeli government that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would not be part of the conference.

Jerusalem, in any case, is as interested as Sweden in seeing the episode closed, and will be satisfied with an appropriately conciliatory statement by Sweden, to enable the Israeli delegation to attend the conference as planned.

Diplomatic sources in Israel and Sweden Sunday emphasized that Mazel, who was backed by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, will be told Monday at the Swedish Foreign Ministry that his behavior was "unacceptable," as a Swedish Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

During a meeting with Foreign Ministry Director General Yoav Biran and the deputy director general for Western Europe, Ran Kuriel, Rydberg heard an Israeli complaint about the installation and how its inclusion in the exhibit violated the agreement to keep the Middle East conflict out of the conference on genocide, which opens on January 26.

Rydberg expressed regret about the incident and hope that Israel does not boycott the event, and called the affair a "misunderstanding."

"The whole problem is by and large based on a misunderstanding, a misinterpretation of a piece of art which may very well be in bad taste," Rydberg said after meeting the Foreign Ministry officials.

During the meeting dozens of terror victims' relatives demonstrated near the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem, Israel Radio reported.

When Mazel pulled the plugs on the installation on Saturday night, Dror Feiler approached him angrily, shouting in Hebrew, "You're doing exactly what you do in Nablus. This is a free country and I can say what I want to say here, not like you in your apartheid country."

The diplomats Sunday worked on a formula to bring an end to the scandal. One possibility is a statement issued by the Swedish government rejecting any interpretation that its agreement to show the exhibit and installation was support for terrorists and emphasize its absolute rejection of such deeds, as well as expressing sorrow over the incident.

Despite the blunt statements of support from the prime minister and foreign minister, diplomatic sources in Jerusalem Sunday were not happy with what they called "the festival of support" for Mazel and his action. The sources said they worried Israeli diplomatic efforts to defend the government's policies toward the Palestinians and territories were adopting a strategy of "losing control," with diplomats dropping diplomatic niceties to adopt unusual and unconventional methods of protest that could harm the reputations of Israeli diplomats.

Rydberg: Artwork is example of bad taste "The piece is about a Palestinian woman having murdered innocent civilians. It mentions the names of the tragic Israeli victims in Haifa. It is not a justification of suicide bombings. It is, in my view, an example of bad taste, but I think the whole issue has been blown out of proportion," Rydberg said.

Click for text accompanying artwork

Mazel was unrepentant about damaging the "Snow White and the Madness of Truth" exhibit at Stockholm's Historical Museum. "My wife and I stood there and began to tremble," he told the Ynet site. "There was the terrorist, wearing perfect makeup and sailing placidly along the rivers of blood of my brothers and the families that were murdered."

The envoy told Haaretz that his protest was not spontaneous; he had planned the act after learning about the exhibit in the local press. He said he could not understand how an exhibition devoted to preventing genocide can feature a work that casts the murderer of 22 Israelis as Snow White. "In my eyes, that's not art; it's abominable," he said.

Curator of the Tel Aviv Museum, Doron Luria, said Sunday that he understood Mazel and that the artwork was an inferior piece of provocation. "The piece is simply not worth all of the excitementI sympathize completely with the ambassador's actions. There is no place for such an idiotic piece in Stockholm," Luria said.

Feiler told Army Radio Sunday morning that his artwork was misunderstood. "The display itself is against violence. It can be summed up by a biblical quote: 'He who spills human blood shall have his own blood spilled by man,' and this is exactly what we need to put an end to. The Israeli ambassador caused diplomatic and political damage to Israel, and since he is an intellectual midget, his actions were similar to those of a stall owner in a third world country," Feiler said.

Historical Museum Director Kristian Berg said that the exhibit will remain on display. "You can have your own view of what this piece of art is all about, but using violence is never, ever allowed, and it is never allowed to try to silence the artist," he said.

Israeli MK Ahmed Tibi (Hadash) attacked the Foreign Ministry on Saturday for defending what he called Mazel's "reprehensible act of bullying."

"The government that uses bulldozers in the territories, demolishes houses and uproots trees also relies on bullying in its diplomacy," Tibi said.

Public Security Minister Tzachi Hanegbi on Saturday said that the Israeli ambassador should be awarded a citation for intentionally damaging the artwork.

"If there is a situation in which an ambassador should act in an undiplomatic manner, this is it," the Likud minister said, adding that he was "proud of the ambassador."

Hanegbi said that Israel's ambassador to Sweden behaved as he did in order to shock public opinion and to emphasize the insanity in which a mass murderer is portrayed as a heroine.

"This is the ambassador's duty, and in [Sunday's] government meeting I will call for him to be awarded a special citation for his actions, even if they were extreme," the minister said.

French and foreign Muslims protest headscarf ban
By Reuters	| Jan. 17, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
PARIS - Thousands of veiled and bareheaded Muslim women flanked by their menfolk demonstrated in France, Britain and the Middle East on Saturday against a looming ban on Islamic headscarves in French state schools.

Chanting "the veil is my choice", up to 5,000 marched in Paris amid French and Islamic flags and banners denouncing the veil ban that French politicians hope will stem rising Islamic militancy among some of the country's five million Muslims.

Large demonstrations of several thousand each were held in Beirut and the Gaza Strip while smaller groups protested in London, Brussels, Bahrain, Bethlehem and Kashmir against the ban President Jacques Chirac and most French politicians favor.

"You're playing with fire, Mr. President," shouted Paris protest leader Mohamed Latreche amid rousing choruses of "Allah-o-akbar" (God is great). "We will never accept a law that violates our dignity and liberty."

France, which sees the ban on veils, Jewish skullcaps and large Christian crosses as a way to defend its strict separation of church and state, plans to debate the law in parliament in the coming weeks and impose it from next September.

The small number of schoolgirls who refuse to abandon their veils face expulsion from state schools once the law is passed.

The French Council of the Muslim Faith umbrella group urged Muslims not to march in Latreche's protest. There was confusion about the turnout with march organisers saying only 5,000 and the police - who had predicted up to 20,000 - saying 10,000.

In an impassioned speech to the crowd, Latreche - head of the small Party of French Muslims in Strasbourg - showed why many groups shun him by launching into a denunciation of Zionism as "an ideology of hate, racial discrimination and apartheid."

"Our religion demands this, God says we should wear it," Nafouanta, a Paris lycee pupil, said of her veil. Like most other protesters, she declined to give her family name. Several women behind her marched wrapped in the French tricolour flag.

"I am free to wear the veil or not," said Ilham, a bareheaded Muslim woman who came from Brussels for the march. "It's between me and God, but this is a personal liberty."

Elsewhere in France, 3,500 marched in Lille, 1,800 in Marseille, 1,500 in Mulhouse and hundreds in other cities, police and organisers said.

Lille university student Yamina Bouasla said: "This law aims to solve a problem that doesn't exist and will create insurmountable problems next September. It's stupid."

About 1,000 Muslim women waved placards and chanted slogans outside a government building in Brussels. In London, at least 700 people, chanting "Stop Chirac's racist war" and "Hijab is our right. Hijab is our freedom" rallied at the French embassy.

There were also protests in Jordan, Bahrain, the Gaza Strip and in Bethlehem, where about 100 Palestinian women waving Palestinian and Islamic flags marched to Manger Square - near the traditional birthplace of Jesus - to protest.

Scores of Kuwaiti Islamists, including legislators and religious leaders, protested outside parliament there. About 100 Kashmiri separatist women in head-to-toe black gowns protested in the Indian city of Srinagar.

The ban has divided opinion among France's five million Muslims. Dalil Boubakeur, moderate head of the French Council of the Muslim Faith, warned Muslims not to march and frighten voters two months before regional elections are held here.

Other Muslim groups, feeling unfairly targeted by Chirac's plan, have called for separate marches and other protests.

A Sikh group that pledged to join the Paris march to defend their turbans did not show up.

Israeli envoy refuses to apologize for art flap
By Yossi Melman Haaretz Service	Jan. 19, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Israel and Sweden stressed on Monday that they will maintain normal diplomatic relations following an incident in which the Israeli ambassador to Stockholm, Zvi Mazel, wrecked an art exhibit in a museum in Stockholm, that depicted a Palestinian suicide bomber as Snow White

Mazel was not reprimanded by the Swedish Foreign Ministry on Monday, but was asked to provide details of the last Friday's incident. At the end of the meeting Mazel said he did not regret his actions and refused to apologize for them, because he "acted on emotions, and could not have acted differently."

Both the Israeli and Swedish governments appeared anxious to put the incident behind them. The Swedish government considered issuing a conciliatory note, according to sources in the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem and from hints offered by Swedish Ambassador Robert Rydberg.

The Swedish foreign ministry said Sunday it still expects Mazel to participate in a symposium on genocide to be held Monday at the Stockholm museum where he vandalized the artwork.

Officials in Jerusalem said they would be be satisfied with an appropriately conciliatory statement by Sweden, and that this would enable the Israeli delegation to attend the conference as planned.

The scandal broke out after Mazel unplugged the spotlights around an exhibit by former Israeli Dror Feiler, now a Swedish citizen, and his Swedish wife Gunilla. Mazel was also caught on videotape shoving one of the spotlights into a pool filled with red-colored liquid on which a boat floated with a picture of Hanadi Jaradat, who killed 22 Israelis when she blew herself up in the Maxim restaurant in Haifa in October last year.

The Feilers, as well as Swedish officials, say the installation was meant to condemn terrorism.

But Mazel, backed by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, said the artwork glorified suicide bombers, and complained about the fact that it was part of an exhibition accompanying a prestigious international conference on genocide. He said this violated a prior agreement with the Israeli government that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would not be part of the conference.

Israeli embassy in Stockholm may be forced to leave premises On Monday morning, Mazel confirmed to Israel Radio that the owner of the building which currently houses the Stockholm embassy has asked the Israeli government to relocate it, citing concern for the security of other tenants.

Despite the blunt statements of support from the prime minister and foreign minister, diplomatic sources in Jerusalem on Sunday were not happy with what they called "the festival of support" for Mazel and his action.

Analysis / Why didn't they ask Arbel first?
The planned route of the barrier was almost universally condemned and embroiled Israel in international and legal disputes, and yet none of those involved in the construction of the West Bank fence thought to seek judicial approval in advance.

The construction of the West Bank separation fence constitutes one of the most important decisions made by Ariel Sharon during his term as prime minister, if not the most important one of all. The decision-making process on the issue of the fence was, however, plagued by every imaginable mistake. The most prominent experts in public administration would find it hard to think up such a chain of failures.

Sharon at first was skeptical at the concept of a fence dividing the land of Israel, and stalled its construction. Finally, numerous terror attacks and political pressure forced him to give the go ahead for the first stage of the barrier.

As time went by, Sharon fell in love with the project. The second stage of the fence was planned with a zigzagging route creating enclaves and meant to cater to the West Bank settlers. The planned route embroiled Israel in international and legal disputes, and the prime minister is now considering changes to the route of the fence, prompted by acting Attorney General Edna Arbel's recent warning that she would find it difficult to defend the current route of the barrier before the High Court of Justice.

Its simply hard to believe: the planners of the fence surely knew how to contact Edna Arbel and her colleagues at the State Prosecution. Why would they wait until a petition to the High Court of Justice was filed, rather than ensure ahead of time that the barrier's route had a sound legal backing? Why does Sharon appear to be acting only when under pressure, at the last moment? Why has Israel only launched a political and public relations campaign after the "apartheid wall" was almost universally condemned," the United States implemented a humiliating cut in loan guarantees and the International Court of Justice at The Hague set the stage for an internationally damaging "trial"?

One senior source in Jerusalem on Sunday explained: "No one could have predicted the intensity of the Palestinian opposition to the fence, the international criticism and the deficiencies discovered in the operation of the barrier. It is the benefit of hindsight." The source added that "not every administrative decision needs an advance authorization from the Attorney General."

The defense establishment is convinced that the fence was properly planned and was justified by security considerations. Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz is backing his men, leaving the prime minister to make the unpopular decision - from the Likud's perspective - of how close to the Green Line the fence will run. As far as Mofaz is concerned, the plan should not be changed. As for the plight of the Palestinians, the Ministry of Defense will have a new unit, a "fence ombudsman." Another bureaucratic encumbrance added to the project.

Sharon on Sunday acknowledged the distress the fence is causing the Palestinians, in spite of the security benefits it provides Israel. As expected, he stressed that any rethink of the fence's route would be in accordance with internal considerations only, and not as a result of Palestinian or international pressure.

This announcement satisfies the prime minister's internal needs, and in order to emerge unscathed from Tuesday's High Court hearing. The real decisions will be taken after the PM's bureau chief Dov Weisglass returns from talks in Washington at the end of the week.

Weisglass will try to coordinate the respective positions of Jerusalem and Washington in preparation for the upcoming hearing at The Hague, as a first step toward downplaying the negative conclusions expected to be handed by The Hague. The question is: What price will the Americans demand in return, and what changes will they ask Israel to make to the route of the fence.

Sweden will try to end art scandal with `statement'
By Yossi Melman	| Jan. 19, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The Swedish government is considering issuing a conciliatory note to bring to an end the crisis in relations between the two countries resulting form the controversial art exhibit in Stockholm, according to sources in the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem and hints offered by Swedish Ambassador Robert Rydberg. Israeli Ambassador Zvi Mazel regarded the exhibit as a glorification of suicide bombers - and protested by deliberately vandalizing the installation's presentation.

The scandal broke out after Mazel turned off the lights aimed at an installation piece made by former Israeli Dror Feiler, now a Swedish citizen, and his Swedish wife Gunnar. The Swedes - and the artists - say the installation was meant to condemn terrorism, but Mazel, backed by the government in Jerusalem, said the Feiler installation, part of an art exhibit accompanying a prestigious international conference on genocide, glorified the bomber - and violated an prior agreement with the Israeli government that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would not be part of the conference.

Jerusalem also wants the episode closed, and will be satisfied with an appropriately conciliatory statement by Sweden, to enable the Israeli delegation to attend the conference as planned.

Diplomatic sources in Israel and Sweden yesterday emphasized that Mazel, who was backed by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, will be told today at the Swedish Foreign Ministry that his behavior was "unacceptable," as a Swedish Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

During a meeting with Foreign Ministry Director General Yoav Biran and the deputy director general for Western Europe, Ran Kuriel, Swedish Ambassador Robert Rydberg heard an Israeli complaint about the installation and how its inclusion in the exhibit violated the agreement to keep the Middle East conflict out of the conference on genocide, which opens on January 26.

Rydberg expressed regret about the incident and hope that Israel does not boycott the event. He emphasized that his government had no legal recourse to get the installation removed from exhibit, due to stringent freedom of expression laws in Sweden.

When Mazel pulled the plugs on the installation on Saturday night, Dror Feiler approached him angrily, shouting in Hebrew, "You're doing exactly what you do in Nablus. This is a free country and I can say what I want to say here, not like you in your apartheid country."

The diplomats yesterday worked on a formula to bring an end to the scandal. One possibility is a statement issued by the Swedish government rejecting any interpretation that its agreement to show the exhibit and installation was support for terrorists and emphasize its absolute rejection of such deeds, as well as expressing sorrow over the incident.

Despite the blunt statements of support from the prime minister and foreign minister, diplomatic sources in Jerusalem yesterday were not happy with what they called "the festival of support" for Mazel and his action. The sources said they worried Israeli diplomatic efforts to defend the government's policies toward the Palestinians and territories were adopting a strategy of "losing control," with diplomats dropping diplomatic niceties to adopt unusual and unconventional methods of protest that could harm the reputations of Israeli diplomats.

Jewish schoolbus firebombed in eastern France

		 submit to reddit	
STRASBOURG - A van used as a schoolbus by a Jewish school in Strasbourg has been firebombed in what a community leader has called an apparent anti-Semitic attack, local police said on Tuesday.

The van was attacked on Monday before dawn, 24 hours after unidentified assailants pelted a nearby synagogue with stones during the night, they said. There was no sign who was behind the two incidents.

A local Jewish leader linked the two attacks to marches on Saturday protesting against a planned ban on Islamic veils in school led by an anti-Zionist Muslim leader from Strasbourg.

"What I notice in both cases is the context and the timing in connection with last Saturday's protest where violently anti-Semitic speeches were given," said Pierre Levy, regional representative of the CRIF umbrella group of French Jewish organizations.

Jewish groups say attacks on Jewish property have been rare in Strasbourg but anti-Semitic insults are common.

The Jewish human rights group Simon Wiesenthal Center and the Paris daily Le Monde on Monday both denounced Mohamed Latreche, organizer of the pro-headscarf protests, for a fiery speech he gave at the Paris demonstration. In his speech, Latreche denounced Jews and assailed Zionism as apartheid.

My affidavit to The Hague
Lately, I've been wondering what I would do if the International Court in The Hague, on its own initiative, asked for my opinion on the separation fence. I find these thoughts oppressive. Without a doubt, on the basis of the concepts that I know and accept, Sharon's fence is a crime against humanity. There is no other way to define it.

Lately, I've been wondering what I would do if the International Court in The Hague, on its own initiative, asked for my opinion on the separation fence. I find these thoughts oppressive. On the one hand, every human being with a conscience has to do everything he can to topple this bad fence. On the other hand, even those who, like me, feel the Sharon government is an Israeli tragedy, are usually also infected with the patriotic germ, which dissuades them from collaborating with outside parties in the struggle against the evils committed by the government of Israel.

The International Court does not have any authority to subpoena me against my will, of course. Nor is its moral jurisdiction on especially solid footing. However, our silence would not be considered moral, either - not in our own eyes, and not in those of others. What should I do?

When the idea of the fence was first raised, I hesitated about taking a stand, in either direction. For a while, I "fence straddled." The idea in itself is correct and effective, and no one is entitled to deny the citizens of Israel protection from terrorists. But I took into account the gloomy fact that it was not me who was going to build the fence and determine its route, but Ariel Sharon. And as I know him, his character and his plans, I presumed that this essential fence would come out crooked. If Sharon is able to take something straight and twist it out of shape, he will unquestionably do so. At the time, I even warned Haim Ramon and the other fence advocates that, when it was built, they would have a hard time recognizing their original intent, and that we would come to regret our support for it, just as many people have come to regret their support for various Sharon initiatives over the years, having always come out on the short end of the stick.

While engaged in my fence straddling, I was confronted by many fine people: if, as has already been proven, the fence prevents terrorist attacks and saves lives, how do you allow yourself to oppose it; and they were right, I had no ready response. And what would I say in the face of all the murdered victims of terrorism - that I am by nature suspicious, that Sharon doesn't deserve any trust, that this fence may begin with protection but ends with a brutal attack on Palestinians who have committed no sin, that the roots of the fence may be "separation" but that it ends in annexation? The terrorist attacks grew more frequent, the pressure grew more intense, and then I drafted the Meretz platform, exactly one year ago, writing the following:

"During the interim period and until the situation calms down, Meretz supports the accelerated construction of a complete, encompassing and sophisticated separation fence. This fence would be a protective measure against acts of terror. It is preferable for Israel that the route of the fence not include Palestinian population or territories. In addition, Meretz demands that during this period of time, the settlements on the other side of the fence and all of the illegal outposts be dismantled immediately. In the Gaza Strip, all of the settlements would be evacuated, as well as the Jewish settlement in Hebron, which is a recurring, dangerous focus of severe lawlessness."

In an accompanying article, I wrote, in the interests of greater clarification, that the fence should follow along the 1967 lines. I admit that even in my worst nightmares, I never imagined that Ariel Sharon would go so far as he has in his fencing efforts. Sharon is larger than our nightmares: not the `67 lines, not even anything that resembles `67, but an invasive eruption by a brute without inhibition or tether, one suited to serve as prime minister of South Africa in the blackest days of the apartheid that conceived the reprehensible Bantustans.

Now a Palestinian awakens in the morning, every morning, and sees the monstrous wall that separates him from members of his family, from his fields and orchards, from his business dealings; separates his children from their school, sees his destitute piece of land robbed from him, his world closed up, dark and devastated, and he certainly blames us, as well, who were a party to the despicable undertaking of building the fence. How can you explain to him that this is not the fence we intended, that we intended a completely different fence, and that our good intentions led to his hell. An apology is in order. It is stated in the Talmudic tractate of Gittin: "It was not the thief who stole, it was the hole that stole," and we will say, it is not the fence that is stealing the land and the basic human rights, but its route.

Without a doubt, on the basis of the concepts that I know and accept, Sharon's fence is a crime against humanity. There is no other way to define it. I will not make my way to the International Court in The Hague, due to the "disease of patriotism" from which we are unable to cure ourselves. But this is the written affidavit of a member of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, a former minister of education in the State of Israel, a Zionist without "post." My testimony is translated in this newspaper into English (an unpatriotic act), and if it is brought before the judges, I would not change it one iota. Maybe I will first bring it before the justices of our High Court of Justice. To this I sign my name.

The writer is an MK and the former chairman of Meretz.

France probes Muslim leader for anti-Semitic remarks
By Reuters	| Jan. 22, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
PARIS - French police are investigating whether a Muslim militant can be charged with racist incitement for comments that Jewish leaders have branded anti-Semitic, Justice Minister Dominique Perben said Thursday.

Mohamed Latreche, who led a Paris protest last Saturday against a planned ban on Muslim headscarves in state schools, branded Israel a racist country and equated Zionism with apartheid in a speech to the marchers.

He would have to appear before a judge if his comments, tapes of which police are now reviewing, are considered to be an incitement against Israel and Jews in general. Latreche also criticized several French Jewish journalists in his speech.

"I'm not going to let anything slip by, this man has to stop," Perben told Europe 1 radio. "Racism is an evil I don't want to see developing here."

Perben said President Jacques Chirac had given him clear orders to be tough on racist behavior "and I am applying them very firmly."

The minister also said another inquiry into possibly anti-Semitic remarks, by the black comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala who gave a Hitler salute on television while dressed as an orthodox Jew, would issue its conclusions very soon.

"These people have to know their behavior is inadmissible, that they cannot say what they seem to have said," he stated.

The CRIF umbrella group of French Jewish organizations said Latreche's speech to about 5,000 Muslims at the march was "violently anti-Semitic, anti-Zionist" and denied the reality of the genocide perpetrated against Jews by the Nazis.

Jewish groups have recently accused radical Muslims in Europe of spreading a "new anti-Semitism" fueled by hatred of Israel rather than the racist nationalism of the far-right.

Latreche, a fiery orator from Strasbourg who was hardly known before the Paris march, heads a group of a few hundred members called the Party of French Muslims. He rejects charges of anti-Semitism but says he is a militant anti-Zionist.

Arafat: Time running out for two-state solution
By Haaretz Staff	| Jan. 25, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, in an interview published yesterday in a British newspaper, said "time is running out for the two-state solution," and he blamed Israel's construction of the West Bank separation fence and its settlement policy.

Speaking to The Guardian, Arafat blamed Israel for the collapse of the government of his first prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas. They "didn't give him anything," Arafat told the paper. "No release of prisoners, nothing on the building of the wall, no lifting of the siege of the president."

Abbas quit his post late last year, and was replaced by Ahmed Qureia. The PA chairman declared, meanwhile, that he himself is indispensable.

"They know they can't replace me," he said. "We are not in Afghanistan - we are proud of our democracy."

Arafat also attacked Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's initiative for a unilateral Israeli pullout in the West Bank, saying such a move would not "solve their problem." He told the paper that the PA leadership was still "committed to peace," and repeated the frequent Palestinian call for international intervention in the region.

Palestinian cabinet minister Saeb Erekat told The Guardian that, "If the Israelis withdraw unilaterally, the Palestinian Authority will collapse."

"The two-state solution is being buried by an apartheid system of Palestinian Bantustans and walled city prisons," The Guardian quoted Erekat as saying.

Hamas official Abdel Aziz Rantisi and Islamic Jihad leader Nafiz Azzam told The Guardian that their groups, which have launched more than 100 suicide attacks against Israeli targets in the last three years, would be willing to accept the "temporary solution" of a Palestinian state in return for an end to their armed campaign that, according to Rantisi, "should be seen in terms of years."

One nurse for 4,700 people and the doctor faces a roadblock
The small village Umm a-Rihan, home to some 360 residents, has found itself part of the same fenced off enclave that features the main "district city," Bartaa Sharkiyya, whose population is 3,500.
By Amira Hass	| Feb. 3, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The small village Umm a-Rihan, home to some 360 residents, has found itself part of the same fenced off enclave that features the main "district city," Bartaa Sharkiyya, whose population is 3,500. The Palestinian Authority Health Ministry clinic at Bartaa can serve residents of Umm a-Rihan; but there is no paved road between these two localities.

Before the fence's construction, whenever residents from Umm a-Rihan needed urgent medical care, or wanted to consult a doctor, they went to a different clinic, north of their village, which can be reached via a paved road. The fence now obstructs access to this second clinic; and so residents from Umm a-Rihan travel on difficult dirt roads to get to Bartaa.

For pregnant women, the infirm elderly, those injured in accidents, and other patients this route is hardly a sound option, in medical terms; but it also happens to be the only way to go. On the other hand, the fence now separates residents of villages like Dhaher al Aabed and Akkab from the Bartaa clinic; before the wall's construction, they received medical care at the Bartaa facility.

The Bartaa clinic is open 8 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. A nurse from the village, and a doctor who comes from a different enclave created by the fence in the Tul Karm region, staff the clinic. The doctor must negotiate with Israeli soldiers at the northeast gate of his village, Nazlat Issa; then he has to travel across a road filled with temporary army roadblocks; finally, he must negotiate with another group of soldiers to get through a gate and enter the Bartaa enclave. It is impossible to gage precisely the extent to which the delays, and the frustration and anger which accumulate after the daily travel ordeal, influence his work.

All told, some 4,700 people live in the Bartaa area. The government clinic (the only one of its kind in the region) has a pharmacy and also offers counseling on health awareness. But medical specialists do not come to the clinic; it does not offer laboratory tests; nor does it offer family planning. Patients who are referred to advanced medical tests or treatment routines must cross through the separation fence barrier, and head east, to Jenin or Tul Karm. When care-seekers do make it through, it is only after interminable, nerve-racking delays. What holds true for villages within the Bartaa enclave, or those adjacent to it, is also true for residents of other enclaves that have been created, or which are to be created, by the construction of the separation fence.

The Health, Development, Information, and Policy Institute (HDIP), a non-governmental body, reviewed the present and future implications of the separation fence, in terms of health and access to medical services. The institute published the review's finding's last week. Summarizing these conclusions, HDIP director Mustafa Barghouti said that the "Apartheid Wall" (in his words) has destroyed the "normal coherence" of the Palestinian health system. This system was developed according to models devised by the World Health Organization: medical centers which provide basic care are distributed around a number of localities, and they are supported by a carefully planned referral system - patients are referred to larger clinics, which provide specialist medical services, and also to hospitals.

Most of the local clinics are government-run; some are operated by the UN Relief and Works Agency; others are run by non-government health networks.

Badly disrupted

This referral system has run aground. It has been badly disrupted by checkpoints and barriers set up by the Israel Defense Forces during the past three years on the West Bank; these roadblocks sever local Palestinian communities from large West Bank cities. According to data compiled in December 2003 by OCHA, the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, there have been 734 roadblocks of various types - 63 manned checkpoints, 456 ditches which obstruct the passage of vehicles, and also concrete walls and other encumbrances. Now, the preexisting damage done to the Palestinian health system has been aggravated by the establishment of the separation fence.

At the conclusion of the fence's first stage of construction, 26 clinics found themselves fenced off, in enclaves. Local residents, who are now cut-off from large medical centers that provide specialized care, find themselves more dependent on the local clinics. Conversely, this dependence on the local facilities accentuates the absence of expert physicians and specialized medical services. When construction of the fence is completed, the number of these isolated clinics will reach 71, the HDIP figures show. The problem will triple in scope.

Most of these local clinics lack laboratories. While most have pharmacies, these are generally open only in the morning. Not all of the clinics immunize small children. Many of the small localities in which the clinics are located are not connected to the electricity network. Electricity is supplied to such villages by generators; the generators do not run all day long. On occasion, fuel to run the generators doesn't make it to a clinic, owing to roadblocks and the fence. So the clinics cannot store serums used in immunization. The roadblocks and closed gates in the fence frequently prevent the timely immunization of infants. Clinics in northern areas of the West Bank are not equipped to deal with diabetes patients; and pediatricians, gynecologists and other specialists are nowhere to be found in the Qalqilyah region. South of Ramallah and in East Jerusalem, the separation fence will impede the access of 17,510 handicapped persons to specialized care, the HDIP report shows.

Field workers from the UN Relief and Works Agency report that due to obstructed access to maternity wards in hospitals in Jenin and Nablus, there has been in Bartaa (much to local women's chagrin) a trend of renewed reliance on midwives; there is no prospect of expert medical care being given in times of emergency to pregnant women, or to other types of patients. In most of the isolated clinics, the HDIP report shows, there are no family planning services; nor are means of birth control distributed. In other words, the fence harms, and will continue to harm, efforts made by Palestinian social-health organizations to encourage men and women to think carefully about the number of children they want to have.

In a survey conducted among 890 households in October 2003 by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, respondents rated the main obstacles which impede their access to medical services. Some 41.6 percent of respondents (73.7 percent west of the fence; 38.6 percent east of it) cited the distance from large medical centers; 42.6 percent (76.4 percent west of the fence as opposed to 39.4 percent east of it) referred to problems faced by medical teams in their attempts to reach the clinics; and 59.6 percent (69.3 percent west; 58.8 percent east) alluded to their inability to pay for medical services.

Roadblock of fear

The establishment of hundreds of checkpoints and barriers on the West Bank has lengthened distances to local or major medical centers for all. The constant encounter with soldiers (who ride in jeeps, tanks or armored personnel carriers on roads) has created a new sort of roadblock - a roadblock of fear. The internal closure enforced by the IDF has impaired the earning power of communities at large, and of each family; it has became harder for individuals and families to meet the rising costs of journeys to medical centers, and of medical treatment. People neglect medical problems, and seek treatment only when their ailments worsen. These dynamics are more extreme in the cases of those who live near the separation fence - so conclude many medical workers, including members of the Medical Relief Committees, a network of clinics (some of them mobile) which operates round-the-clock on the West Bank and Gaza Strip; Dr. Mustafa Barghouti is one of the Committees' directors.

Barghouti proposes that local clinics in "fence localities" be upgraded, meaning that their existing medical equipment would be improved, their physical facilities would be renovated, their operating hours would be extended, etc. In Barghouti's proposal, more emphasis would be given to training of health professionals, so that they would be less dependent upon physicians.

Upgrading of isolated clinics is a logical, urgent matter, from both humanitarian and medical standpoints. Such upgrading would not be logical economically, however. The rapidly disintegrating Palestinian Authority cannot shoulder such an economic burden. In all likelihood, the costs will once again be transferred to donor nations; most have expressed verbal criticism of the separation fence, yet their opposition has not, to date, brought about any change in the fence's route. It is reasonable to assume that the donor nations, and the humanitarian organizations which operate within them, will feel a sense of responsibility, and grasp that there is a need to intervene so as to alleviate somewhat the health crisis caused by the fence. Indeed, the donor nations might act in accord with Dr. Barghouti's recommendations. Yet the sort of upgrading which is proposed represents a form of international and Palestinian accommodation to realities created by the fence - as if Israel builds the destructive fence, and the international and Palestinian communities try to do something to fix the damage.

Barghouti is aware of this trap. He is also a political activist: he has served as a leader of the People's Party (formerly the Communist Party), and today he helps lead the "National Initiative," a political-social mobilization of forces designed to create a third power element in Palestinian society, between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. Presenting findings of the HDIP study last week to journalists and diplomats, he called on the international community to step up the struggle against the fence. But on a day when he met with delegates of the international community he was informed that the European Union, like the U.S., opposes the discussion of the fence at the International Court of Justice in the Hague.

Palestinians accuse UN of leaking documents on fence
By Reuters	| Feb. 4, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
UNITED NATIONS - The Palestinians accused United Nations staff on Tuesday of improperly leaking documents to Israel from an International Court of Justice case challenging Israel's West Bank separation fence.

Nasser al-Kidwa, the Palestinian UN envoy, called on the United Nations to investigate the allegations and punish anyone found to have leaked documents in the politically explosive case pending before the Hague-based UN court.

Al-Kidwa based his complaint on statements by Israeli Ambassador Dan Gillerman at a news conference last Friday.

Gillerman, in a rare swipe at Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said a UN filing in the barrier case showed a "bias ... that borders on the absurd" because it excluded Israeli views.

Al-Kidwa said the UN filing had not been made public at the time of Gillerman's press conference and court rules required that such materials be treated confidentially.

Israeli Deputy Ambassador Arye Mekel promptly dismissed al-Kidwa's charges as "very strange." The UN dossier was posted on the World Court's Web site (http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/imwp/imwpframe.htm) more than a week ago, and was available to all, he said.

But al-Kidwa insisted Gillerman had referred to material not on the Web site.

UN officials said they could not immediately sort out the charges and counter-charges.

The ICJ begins deliberations on February 23 on a UN General Assembly request to rule whether Israel is legally obliged to tear down the internationally criticized barrier.

Palestinians call it an "Apartheid Wall" designed to loop around Jewish settlements and seal a permanent hold on land Israel has occupied since the 1967 Middle East war.

But Israel says completed sections of razor wire and concrete are already keeping out suicide bombers like those who have killed hundreds of Israelis over the past three years.

While the Palestinians argue the court has the power to decide the case, Israel, backed by the United States, Britain and several other nations, has formally challenged its right to rule on the barrier's legality.

It's all about the `exodus from Gaza'
Palestinians have only one topic on their mind these days: Ariel Sharon's plan to evacuate Jewish settlements from the Gaza Strip.
By Amira Hass	| Feb. 9, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
GAZA - "No one will cry here over the departure of the Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip, but..." This is the sentence that sums up prevailing opinion in Gaza. The "but" holds within it a basic suspicion, without exception, of the motives of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, and suspicions over his hidden plans behind what he stated explicitly.

"The departure of the Jewish settlers (and not all of them, according to Israeli reports) from Gaza should be seen in the framework of Ariel Sharon's consistent, old master plan," says Jamal Zakout, an active participant in the Geneva Accord. He says this in the same breath with a statement that no one will mourn if "the 5,000 Israeli settlers who have for many long years been dictating an intolerable life for one-and-a-quarter million people will at long last leave our lands."

In Zakout's opinion, Sharon's master plan is aimed at wiping out any centralized Palestinian leadership: "That is, to wipe out the Palestinian national plan for independence and sovereignty, a plan that is based on a clear political stance for resolving the conflict. Sharon is not interested in a Palestinian leadership that has a logical plan for peace with Israel and that is able to advance and to fulfill this plan."

Although Zakout belongs to a tiny political organization - FIDA, the Palestinian Democratic Union, a leftist organization that at the beginning of the 1990s broke away from the Democratic Front, with its leader Yasser Abed Rabbo, and has been a partner in the Palestinian Authority since its establishment - when it comes to the renewed talk in Israel about leaving Gaza, he expresses aptly the opinion of many Palestinians, both in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank.

The suspicions over Sharon's intentions are not preventing people from discussing his declaration at every opportunity. As in Israel, Gazans are asking themselves to what extent the plan is connected to the police investigation of the funds the Sharon family received from tycoons. In any case, Zakout says, "Sharon has already succeeded. Instead of discussing the open scandals about his corrupt behavior, he has succeeded in twisting the headlines so that they will talk about the evacuation from Gaza and then about the referendum, yes or no." Zakout says Sharon has also succeeded "in confusing world public opinion: First of all, he is manipulating it in the publication of his plan, so that the isolation fence and the segregation that he is building in the West Bank will be forgotten. It is clear that Sharon is interested in strengthening his image on the eve of the deliberations at the International Court of Justice in The Hague on the matter of the fence. And sure enough, Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, is already talking to him and finding positive things in his plan."

People in Gaza found it hard to remember whether the Palestinian Authority has responded with an official position of its own: Someone thinks that Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat said the plan runs counter to the road map, another swears that he heard Ahmed Qureia, the Palestinian prime minister, welcoming it on one occasion and expressing suspicion on another. In any case, in the Gaza Strip, people prefer to follow the details of Sharon's plan as they are revealed hour after hour in the Israeli media, and prefer to know what Israelis are saying about the plan.

Two details that were reported a short time after Sharon's basic statement about removing Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip evoke suspicion over the prime minister's plans: the transfer of the settlers from Gaza to Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and leaving in tact three tiny settlements in place in the northern Gaza Strip, where the population is dense and desperate for every bit of available land. "Sharon intends to set up a ghetto in the Gaza Strip, and containers in the West Bank: the Ramallah container, the Hebron container, the Nablus container and so on," Zakout says with conviction. The great danger, Zakout fears, is that hidden behind publication of the plan is American agreement. That is, U.S. President George W. Bush's administration has already given, or will give, a green light to the plan's implementation.

"An Israeli exit from the settlements in the Gaza Strip is a strengthening of Sharon's colonialist settlement project, in a new way," Zakout says. "Perhaps there is an indirect admission here of the basic failure of the Israeli settlement plan in the Strip, but then Sharon will say that now the Palestinians do have a state, in Gaza. The process of expanding the settlements is proceeding energetically in the West Bank. Together with the separation fence to the west and the separation fence to the east that will cut the Jordan Valley off from the rest of the West Bank - he will annex about half of the Palestinian lands in the West Bank to Israel and prove to the world that there is no Palestinian leadership with which it is possible to speak. And the truth is that there is not, and there will not be any Palestinian leadership that will be partner to Sharon's plan."

On this point, there are those who suspect that Zakout is mistaken. The vagueness of Sharon's plan is fertile ground for inter-Palestinian suspicion, especially since this a particularly violent period (though not the first) in the intra-Fatah power struggle. The conflicts within Fatah are accompanied by mutual recriminations of "treachery" among all sides. For example, there are those who say that the followers of Mohammed Dahlan broke into Palestinian Police headquarters headed by Razi Jabali because the latter "cursed Dahlan;" that is, he declared that Dahlan was partner to all kinds of American-Israeli plots. In the shooting battle that developed at the police station, one young policeman was killed and others were injured.

According to people in Gaza, Dahlan, who is accepted by the Americans, was brought into discussions with them about bringing an international protective force into the region. There are those who link this with the rumor that U.S. Vice President Richard Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld have already given their blessing to Sharon's "exodus from Gaza" plan. And they still remember Sharon's past plans to anoint the village federations or to create a pro-Israeli regime in Lebanon. And they also remember the Oslo era, when senior Palestinians devoted their attention to their personal enrichment.

All of these facts and rumors come together in a suspicion-assumption that Sharon will look for, and find, local Palestinian barons, each of whom will control one of the enclaves that his plan will create, just so that their personal economic projects can flourish.

Zakout does not share these suspicions, if only because he is convinced that the Palestinian public in its entirety will oppose the Sharon plan. Military activists in the various organizations are already boasting that the planned "exodus from Gaza" is the direct result of the unceasing pressure they are applying to the Israel Defense Forces, and through them on Israeli society.

"Pulling out of Gaza alone, and not in the framework of withdrawal from all of the territories that were occupied in 1967, will not bring about an end to the conflict," Zakout says. "The Israelis must not deceive themselves and let Sharon lead them astray. On the contrary, this will only make Palestinian society more extreme and reinforce extremist political ideas that will bring the Palestinian political discourse and the two peoples back to the squares of the past," he says.

"In the end, Sharon's plan for a partial withdrawal in order to thwart Palestinian independence will be dangerous to the people in Israel. Israel will move from the stage of a colonialist nation to colonialist-apartheid nation. Peace with the Palestinian people will enable Israel to be welcomed in the region. The continuation of the conflict - that is, thwarting the chances in the short term for an independent state - will endanger Israel's existence in the medium and long terms."

The fence - racism vs. a response to racism
Two weeks before the hearing on the separation fence is scheduled to open in The Hague, a debate on the same subject will begin in the High Court of Justice.
By Yuval Yoaz	Feb. 9, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
"Indeed, the life of the Palestinians living along the seam line is not easy," writes attorney Michael Blass of the State Attorney's Office in response to the petitions against the construction of the separation fence. "However, it must not be forgotten that life on Gaza Road in Jerusalem is not easy either. Nor is it easy to conduct a normal lifestyle in the Maxim or Matza restaurants in Haifa. Sipping a cup of coffee in Moment cafe in Jerusalem can cost you your life."

In its response to the petitions filed by Hamoked Center for the Defense of the Individual and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), the state seeks to justify the erection of the separation fence with this blunt description. The weakness of this argument is that the petitioners are not complaining about the construction of the fence per se, but only about the route chosen - deep within the territory of the West Bank - a route that deviates considerably from the Green Line. This weakness is underscored repeatedly throughout the arguments presented by the state.

This morning, two weeks before the debate at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, three High Court justices, Aharon Barak, Yaakov Turkel and Edmond Levy, will convene to deliberate this very same issue. These are not the first petitions against the fence; numerous petitions have already been submitted and debated, and in some cases, decisions have been handed down, while others are still pending. However, the current petitions are the first ones to attack the decision to build the fence within the West Bank in principle, rather than specific local issues such as how many hours a particular gate will be open near a certain village or the separation of a farmer from his field.

Yesterday, a "senior political source" stated that the route of the fence would be moved to the west, in the direction of the Green Line, eliminating many of the loops around Palestinian villages. However, as far as the petitioners are concerned, this declaration is no reason to retract the petition. On the contrary, it serves as added incentive to continue with it.

On the one hand, the statement changes nothing on the legal level; declarations made by close associates of the prime minister carry no legal weight, compared to actions on the legal level, such as government decisions or the issuing of injunctions to appropriate land. On the other hand, the publication of this statement one day before the debate in the High Court of Justice is certainly no coincidence; and if so, conclude the petitioners, it is apparently only the legal involvement in the issue that is causing policy makers to change their positions.

The justices will be forced to decide on a series of questions related to various legal fields - from international law, human rights, reasonableness and proportionality, the laws related to warfare, to procedural matters and consideration of precedents. No fewer than seven questions will need to be answered in principle on the way to the decision on the legality of the separation fence:

1. Does the petition deal with a diplomatic/political or security issue?

As in the Israeli arguments in The Hague that focus considerable attention on the lack of authority of the court to debate the issue, in the debate before the High Court of Justice too, the state will make every effort to emphasize that the petition focuses on "a diplomatic/political" issue, and that according to the practice that has taken root, the court does not hand down decisions on subjects whose dominant nature is diplomatic or political, and whose legal aspect is secondary.

The fact that the petitioners are "public petitioners" rather than residents whose land or freedom of movement has been harmed by the fence, and the fact that the petition deals with "a subject that is on the government's agenda and relates to its international ties," leads to the conclusion that this is a diplomatic or political petition. On the other hand, the state has underscored repeatedly in its arguments that the considerations for the construction of the fence were of a security rather than political nature, and that the purpose of the fence is to protect the Israeli population from terror attacks.

Is it at all possible to separate the security argument from the political one? The state itself combines the two in its arguments when it determines that among the rationales for the construction of the fence is the thought that "if a settlement with the Palestinians that can guarantee quiet and security can be attained, the possibility that the separation obstacle will be dismantled should not be ruled out."

The petitioners, incidentally, are not making any special effort to hide the political nature of their argument: Any deviation of the route of the fence from the Green Line, maintain attorneys Avigdor Feldman and Michael Sefarad on behalf of Hamoked, was intended to bring settlements into the area west of the fence, thereby turning them into part of the State of Israel, "by means of creeping annexation."

2. Does an "armed confrontation" justify the construction of a fence deep within the territory of the West Bank?

In the three and half years of the intifada, the state has managed to establish a new definition for the legal status in the territories. Prior to this, it was accepted, by virtue of decisions by the High Court of Justice, that Israel has been holding onto the West Bank and Gaza Strip since 1967 in what is termed "belligerent occupation." However, in the Ajouri case of September 2002 that debated the legality of deportation from the West Bank to the Gaza Strip, the High Court of Justice adopted the designation "hostile confrontation."

In the view of the state, this term took root in international law during the 20th century to fill the vacuum created by the traditional laws of warfare pertaining to war between countries - laws, the state believes, that are inadequate to describe warfare between a state and a terrorist entity. The state quotes Security Council Resolution 1373 after the attack on the Twin Towers that recognized an attack by a terrorist organization as an "armed attack." According to the state's argument, a regime of a "hostile confrontation" enables it to act more forcefully to comply with its security needs.

"Closing territories for security reasons is an acceptable legal step in an area subject to belligerent occupation, especially at the height of an armed confrontation," writes the state.

3. Is there proper balance between property rights and freedom of movement, on the one hand, and the right to life, on the other?

Both Hamoked and ACRI dwell considerably on the harm the fence causes to basic human rights - property rights, freedom of movement, freedom of occupation, the right to livelihood, the right to family life of the Palestinian residents in the seam line area.

Regarding the matter of appropriation of Palestinian land, the petitioners quote Article 23 of the Hague Regulations, which states: "It is especially forbidden... to destroy or seize the enemy's property unless such destruction or seizure is imperatively demanded by the necessities of war."

The laws of belligerent occupation require that the occupier even concern itself with the livelihood and welfare of the residents of the occupied area.

The state maintains that these are relative, rather than absolute rights, the force of which is influenced by the fact that the given area, whose residents have chosen to launch an armed conflict against Israel, is subject to belligerent occupation.

"In a situation of an armed conflict, in which innocent Israelis are being murdered," says the state, "the imposition of restrictions on certain basic rights of Palestinian is a necessary evil." It is being done out of a desire to protect the right to life, because "it is the terror attacks that represent the forbidden violation of Israeli citizens' right to life."

4. Is apartheid a proper response to racism?

Declaring the seam line areas closed military zones - a declaration that does not apply to Israelis and Jews, but only to Palestinians - and the restrictions on movement and residence that arise from such a declaration create, according to the petitioners, a regime of "intolerable, illegal and immoral apartheid."

This, the petitioners argue is due to the distinction based on national background "that exploits security pretexts. In doing so, Israel joins the family of pariah states in the international community that distinguish between residents based on their national origins. This regime is patently illegal and per se, represents an international crime."

The response of the state to this claim is very original. Those who are tainted with racism, says the state, are the Palestinians, not Israel. "The said injunctions were issued because the Palestinians have carried out hundreds of murderous terror attacks of a clear racist nature against Israel and Israelis, and, consequently, only pure security consideration made the distinction between Palestinians and other people in the territories necessary."

5. Can a fence that has not yet been erected be invalidated?

The work on the construction of the first stage of the fence was completed for the most part by July 2003. The continuation of the route and the "secondary obstacles" are currently at various stages of construction or authorization. Even the petitioners agree that in certain planned sections - for example, the section between the villages of Al-Moutila and Te'assir - the land needed for the construction has not yet been appropriated. In this situation, maintains the state, the court has no grounds to intervene and decide on an issue that has not yet occured.

Even in those areas in which orders for the appropriation of land have been issued, says the state, the procedures that precede petitioning the High Court of Justice that are at the disposal of the owners of the land have not yet been exhausted, such as the submission of reservations to the Civil Administration.

This argument is part of the entire direction the state is trying to advance - that the principle of the construction of the fence should not be the subject of a court debate, but rather that the court should rule only in cases of local disputes and in individual petitions to correct any injustices that may have been created in certain places.

6. Has the fabric of life in the seam line area become a regime of permits?

Tens of thousands of Palestinians, claim the petitioners (about 5,500, says the state), are "imprisoned" in the area between stage 1 of the separation fence and the Green Line. Because that area has been declared a closed military zone, their daily lives have become a "regime of permits, a system of forms, documents and authorizations," as attorney Avner Pinchuk of ACRI says.

Every Palestinian living in the seam line area is required to obtain a permit to remain there, and those that want to enter the area to work, study or for family reasons are also required to obtain the proper authorization, which determines the route they may take within the "expanse," and from which they are forbidden to deviate.

The state justifies these strict restrictions on movement and entry into the seam line area with the great sensitivity of the area, in which there are no obstacles that can prevent those in it from entering the State of Israel.

"The intolerable ease with which Palestinians that decided to carry out acts of terror were able to enter Israeli population centers is what made the creation of a buffer area necessary," says the state.

7. Will the decision of the High Court of Justice serve as a yardstick for the expected ruling in The Hague?

Hamoked created the connection between the imminent debate in The Hague and the debate on the petitions in the High Court of Justice. After the date when the international panel of judges is slated to convene became known, Hamoked submitted a request for an urgent debate on the petition, so that it would precede the debate in The Hague.

"Before the ICJ debates the legality of the separation wall, on the matter of whether it constitutes a violation of the laws or war, whether this violation represents a war crime or crime against humanity, the highest Israeli court should debate the subject," the organization wrote.

Chief Justice Aharon Barak certainly knows that the the Israeli Supreme Court enjoys a great deal of prestige in international legal circles. If he is quick and hands down a ruling in the coming weeks, the ICJ in The Hague will not be able to ignore it.

The village against the fence
A serious-looking black dog, whose eyes looked almost hollow, freely crossed the naked strip of land west of the villages of Qibiya and Budrus, which stretches from the village of Rantis, about five kilometers to the north.
By Amira Hass	| Feb. 11, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
A serious-looking black dog, whose eyes looked almost hollow, freely crossed the naked strip of land west of the villages of Qibiya and Budrus, which stretches from the village of Rantis, about five kilometers to the north.

A young resident of Qibiya guiding the visitors among the olive groves and fruit orchards of his village, up to the route of the fence, hastened to cross the ditch that has already been dug on both sides of the route, and to disappear among the trees. It was soon clear why - an Israeli security vehicle was approaching from the north toward those walking on the exposed strip, as soon as it detected them.

The vehicle stopped and two men got out. One, the shorter and older, carrying a rifle, was from Kfar Yonah; the second was from a Bedouin community in the Galilee. The one with the rifle angrily demanded that the visitors who came on foot leave immediately, or he would call the police so they would explain, if you insist, that this is a closed military area, even if he had no papers to prove it. His friend, who served in the army for seven years and was discharged half a year ago, calmed things down before they heated up.

The one with the rifle asserted that the presence of cameras encourages people to come and demonstrate, and that's how the waves of riots begin. "Isn't it you, by your work, who are causing the waves of rioting?" he asked, and the question wasn't quite understood. What are you talking about, we are doing our work, explained the younger man. And of course I support the fence, so I won't explode with my family in a restaurant.

The "riots" the two were talking about are a series of demonstrations against the fence that have been held by the residents of Budrus for about a month. "We decided that unlike other places until now, where international peace activists conducted the battle against the fence and the Palestinians supported them, we, the residents of Budrus, would wage our own battle."

Those are the words of Ayad Murar, 42, a veteran Fatah activist, who with his brother Naim was among the founders of the popular committee in the village "for the struggle against the apartheid wall." The popular committee, he says, emphasized to the people that the battle against the bulldozers and the many soldiers and police who protect them must be conducted without violence.

Curfew and arrests

All residents answered the call to demonstrate - young and old, men and women. What began as a strike along the route of the fence reached a climax on December 30. Somebody saw a bulldozer approaching the olive grove. The speaker in the mosque quickly announced it, and everyone who was in the village ran westward, toward the grove.

School children ran out of the classrooms, books in hand. Tear gas, rubber bullets and blows did not stop the villagers, who dispersed and returned to stand or to sit in front of the soldiers and the police, on the ground. Eyewitnesses say that the female students sat in front of the many soldiers, who retreated to their jeeps. The appearance of several television cameras helped.

During the following days, the Israel Defense Forces imposed a curfew on the village in order to prevent the residents from going out to demonstrate. Mainly young men violated the curfew and walked to the olive grove, to prevent the bulldozers from doing their work. Up to this week, the bulldozers have not returned to work - after they already uprooted about 60 olive trees. The people of Budrus attribute this to their stubbornness and determination.

A few days after this demonstration, the IDF arrested Naim Murar. He was released on January 11, but didn't manage to be home for more than three days when the army came again to arrest him and his brother Ayad. The military prosecutor demanded that they be placed under administrative detention.

In the military court at the Ofer army base, the judge, Major Adrian Agassi, decided to release Ayad. "I found it proper to intervene in the decision of the military commander," ruled Agassi in his decision. "After all, we cannot allow the military commander to use his authority to order the administrative detention of a person only because of this activity [against the fence]. In my opinion, this is a mistaken decision that did not stem from clear security considerations."

But the judge decided to approve the decision of the military commander to place Naim Murar under administrative detention. As is customary in administrative detention, only the judge was allowed to peruse the classified documents given to him by members of the Shin Bet security services, and according to these documents, "the intelligence material attributes to him activity in support of terror, in the context of the Tanzim organization."

But in Budrus people are convinced that the second detention of Naim Murar - like that of eight other activists against the fence - is an attempt to dismantle the opposition in the village. From Budrus' threatened olive grove sounds of firing can be heard - sounds of training exercises. They come from the Adam military base, which is a few dozen meters to the west, 20-30 meters west of the Green Line.

In Budrus they believe that because of this army base, which is a few dozen meters from the Green Line, the route of the fence was pushed straight into the beautiful olive grove that they have been nurturing for decades. Budrus lost most of its lands in 1948 - many thousands of dunams, some count up to 20,000, remained on the western side of the Green Line.

Some land remained in the demilitarized zone, which both Israeli and Jordanian forces were forbidden to enter. Since 1967, say the villagers, the demilitarized zone has become Israeli, and they weren't allowed to return to work their land there as well.

The route that is planned according to the map of the Israeli security services looks as though it is right on the Green Line. But in reality, all the difference lies in several dozen meters east of the Green Line. Now, of the 5,000 dunams that remain to the approximately 1,400 residents of Budrus, they estimate that they will lose about one fifth.

Some of this land is being confiscated for the fence itself, part of the area of the village will remain behind the fence - between the fence and the Green Line. The villagers estimate that 3,000 olive trees, which cover an area of about 5,000 dunams, will be lost under the teeth of the bulldozers or will be trapped in areas where entry is forbidden.

They figure that the "fence" - namely, two ditches that will be dug on both sides of it, and the two barbed wire fences, and the electronic fence with the sensors, and the patrol roads between them, and the watchtowers - will almost touch some of the most western houses in the village, including the school.

Imprisoned enclave

The occupation and preparation of the land here, west of Kibiya and Budrus, are being carried out in the context of the second stage of the building of the security fence. According to the plan, and as long as it has not been decided or proved otherwise, in the context of this stage two Palestinian enclaves will be created west of Ramallah.

These are two out of 81 Palestinian enclaves that have been created and will be created all along the fence, which are discussed in the report by B'Tselem. Some will be between the fence and the Green Line, some in small "loops" created by the fence, and some will be the result of "secondary obstacles," as the army puts it.

Budrus is one of the nine Palestinian villages that will find themselves in an enclave with an area of 53.2 square kilometers. These villages include Luban al Gharabiyeh, Rantis, Shuqba, Qibiya, Shabtin, Budrus, Midya, Na'lin and Dir Kadis. The village of Midiya will be surrounded on all sides by the separation fence, as in a loop.

According to the map of the Israeli security services, one could have concluded immediately that an enclave would be created here. The routes of the western and eastern fences are the same color, as though there is no difference between them.

Military spokesman did in fact explain to members of the support unit of the Palestinian negotiating division that the eastern fence would not be similar to the western one, and would apparently be composed of what is called a "secondary obstacle" (a system of ditches and barbed wire fences) and an eastern gate on the roads to Ramallah and the villages surrounding it - which would be locked and blocked off only in case of security alerts. But in any case, this promise does not reassure the village residents, who know that they are losing thousands of dunams of their land.

In the past three years they have already had a taste of checkpoints that prevented their access to the neighboring villages or to the district center, Ramallah. And even if the gate or the gates in the eastern, "secondary" fence are open most of the time - in Rantis, Budrus and the other villages they point to the maps and to the new political geography that is being created before their eyes.

The two small Palestinian enclaves that are being created west of Ramallah leave two large settlement blocs outside of them, which cut deep into the Palestinian territory and are joined within Israel itself, until one can no longer see that there was a Green Line.

"That's why we are fighting against this fence," says Ayad Murar from his home, talking about this new geography. "It is part of our struggle for a peaceful solution to the conflict - the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel."

Between November and December 2003, military orders began to be posted in the Rantis, Budrus and other villages, regarding the "temporary" seizure of land (until December 2005) for military purposes. According to these orders, which are signed by the chief of Central Command Major General Moshe Kaplinsky, the width of the strips of land confiscated from the villages will range from 68 to 490 meters. The entire length of the (primary and secondary) fence that will surround the nine villages in the enclave - 32.2 kilometers.

Meanwhile, some of the residents of Budrus continue to sneak into Israel on foot, to make a living, mainly in construction. Others, who have lost their jobs in Israel in recent years, have found various jobs in the Ramallah area. But if they are closed within an enclave, they are liable to lose these places of work. Palestinian employers cannot withstand the frequent incidents of lateness caused by the blocks and the checkpoints.

"Come to live in Ramallah, or leave the job," they are told. Grocery store owners are feeling the difference. People come in infrequently, buy on credit, they buy only what is essential. It's hard to imagine what else will happen when the large olive grove is crushed beneath the teeth of the bulldozers or is swallowed up on the other side of the fence, and when it won't be possible to work in Israel at all any longer.

'The West criticizes Pakistan but leaves Israel alone'
The director-general of the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad talks frankly about her country's view of Israel.
By Yossi Melman	| Feb. 12, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
VIENNA - Reports in the Israeli press in recent months, to the effect that Pakistan is about to recognize Israel and renew diplomatic ties, amuse Shireen M. Mazari, director-general of the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad.

"This is far from the truth," says Mazari in an interview with Haaretz. "It is true that Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf generated public discourse, and the prevailing view is that Pakistan should at some time recognize Israel, but in the discussions held, the conclusion reached was that the timing is not right for it."

Mazari knows what she is talking about. Since 2000, she has headed the Institute of Strategic Studies, established 30 years ago. Its activities and research studies are independent but it is financed by Pakistan's Foreign Ministry. Prior to 2000, Mazari taught at Islamabad's Quaid-i-Azam University and worked as a journalist. She still writes a weekly column for The News, a Pakistani daily newspaper.

Mazari is considered to have a close relationship with the Musharaff government and is very familiar with the prevailing winds in her country's political-military establishment. Her proficiency in this area makes her a frequent guest at international seminars and conferences on strategic issues. Last week she participated in an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) seminar in Vienna, on "Innovative Approaches to Nuclear Non-Proliferation."

Mazari is quite opinionated and articulate, and her views reflect the stance of the Pakistani government, which in recent weeks has been subject to attacks in the international media for what is being called "Abdul Qadeer Khan's smuggling network."

The disclosures regarding the sale of nuclear equipment, knowledge and technology by Pakistani nuclear scientists, headed by Khan, to Iran, Libya and North Korea, were among the focuses of the seminar. In Haaretz's interview with Mazari she did not hesitate to relate to the matter of Pakistan's relations with Israel.

"After all, discussions and exchanges of views with Israelis in international forums, including the United Nations, as I'm doing here, have always been an inseparable part of our foreign policy."

Mazari says that the recent development in this sphere is that such discussions are no longer confined to hallway chats between diplomats and experts from Israel and Pakistan in major cities around the world, under the auspices of international conventions, but have spread to the public discourse in Pakistan itself.

Musharraf has commented at least twice in the past few months on the need to weigh the possibility of recognizing Israel. One occasion was before his visit to the United States last summer. The response in Israel was enthusiastic. Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom welcomed the initiative. Officials at the Foreign Ministry were asked to determine Musharraf's intentions, via their Pakistani counterparts, and some the Israeli media were already celebrating the establishment of diplomatic relations.

Then, when Musharraf's words were not followed up, particularly not with actions, Israel figured that Musharraf did not really mean it and had said what he said to ingratiate himself with the Jewish lobby in the U.S.

Mazari rejects both these notions. "He doesn't need to appease the Jewish lobby in the U.S. His position in Washington is solid, and he has very good relations with President Bush's administration. There are people in my country who think that these ties are too close."

What was behind that comment?

"There are certain elements in Pakistan who believe that we should recognize Israel and have diplomatic relations with her. Some of these elements argue that recognition does not necessarily mean friendship. Others support the idea in the hope that it would undermine Israeli-Indian relations. There are some who even believe that we could achieve military cooperation with Israel, and we would be able to buy weapons, but these are minority views.

"It is clear to me that Israel is unable to sell us advanced weapons because the U.S. would prohibit it, as she did with the sale of the Phalcon early warning aircraft to China, while at the same time the U.S. permits Israel to sell these aircrafts to India. The assumption that recognition of Israel would weaken the Israeli-Indian alliance is false. What's more, we ourselves are currently in the process of improving relations with India."

Does this mean that the considerations that motivated the Pakistani government not to recognize Israel just now are based on a strategic concept and other interests?

"No, on the contrary, the consideration is mainly in principle. We did not recognize the apartheid regime of South Africa, and we did not have relations with it. There is great support and sympathy in Pakistan for the Palestinian cause and it is not merely among the Muslim parties.

"This is support that is shared by all the political elite. It was in there even when we knew that Yasser Arafat was an ally of India. Thus the decision reached is accepted by most of our political and military establishment, and the view is that as long as there is no progress in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and a reduction of violence, we cannot recognize Israel. And when we do, it has to be in the framework of pan-Islamic policy, which will be formulated by the Organization of the Islamic Conference, in which Pakistan has a central role."

The impression in both Israel and the West is that Pakistan is one of the states in which the ideas of anti-Semitism are easily accepted.

"This is also an unsubstantiated assumption based on the misunderstanding of our society. Anti-Semitism is not widespread in Pakistan. We don't have a Jewish community. True, here and there there are marginal expressions of anti-Semitism, as there are in many societies in the world, not only among Muslim communities, but mainly in the Christian world. Most people in Pakistan, certainly the elite, the educated, know very well how to distinguish between Israel and Judaism. Criticism of Israel and Zionism cannot be defined as anti-Semitism. Even so, many in Pakistan do think that the Jewish lobby in the U.S. is very influential and does have close relations with the administration. But that is a fact, isn't it?"

Khan broke no laws

The frustration, the almost restrained anger in "the West that doesn't understand us" is leitmotif in the words of this executive director of the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad.

"The West is discriminating against us," says Mazari, referring to the nuclear black market scandal exposed in recent weeks, whose roots are in Pakistan. True, Pakistani scientists were involved in the smuggling network, but they were not alone. We are talking about an international network that included Europeans [a reference to businessmen from Germany, Holland and another European country, as well as from Dubai, Sri Lanka and Malaysia - Y.M.].

"And yet the international media is only talking about Pakistan. Here is another example of the double standard. Back in 2002, it was revealed that 82 companies, including British, American and European firms, were involved in smuggling operations of nuclear know-how and technology to Iraq, yet the UN Security Council omitted their names in its report. And what about Israel, which obtained nuclear weapons with the help of France and the West, and the world, particularly the U.S., is turning a blind eye?"

Still, Pakistani scientists, including the developer of your nuclear bomb played a central role in nuclear proliferation and helped Iran, Libya and North Korea reach the brink of producing nuclear weapons.

"Our scientists were only consultants. The materials were supplied by individuals from other countries. Pakistan as a state was not involved. Khan did not violate any domestic or international law. Pakistan is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, so from our political commitment point of view, we are not prohibited from doing it. Only in 2000 our export laws and regulations were modified.

"When he and others were involved in this in the 1980s and 1990s, there were no legal restrictions, and yet the Musharraf government was ready to make an extra effort and tightened export controls over nuclear material and equipment. It set up the National Command Authority to oversee nuclear weapons. Our nuclear program is under the full control of the military. And above all, the government did not hesitate to investigate Dr. Khan, who is a national hero in Pakistan, and put him under house arrest."

Mazari notes that there is harsh domestic criticism over this move, and a feeling that Musharraf is doing to Khan what the Americans did to Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, whom they used and then discarded.

(Oppenheimer is considered the father of the atom bomb and the key man in the Manhattan Project, which developed the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After the war doubts were raised about the project and Oppenheimer was suspected of being a Communist and denied his security clearance).

"Even so, instead of appreciation we are only being denounced by the West," continues Mazari. "It's because we are Muslims. The West is prejudiced against Muslims. That is why there is only talk of the Muslim terror. The IRA are Catholics, but there is no talk of Christian terror, only of the terror organization from Northern Ireland.

"It's the same with the Islamic bomb, while the nuclear bomb is ours, it's Pakistani, not Muslim. We paid a heavy price for developing it, in international sanctions and isolation by the world. For this reason we will not give it up, but we will also not transfer it to others."

Another exhibit for the Zionist Museum
Where rational considerations are concerned, nothing is more rational than evacuating a few thousands settlers living among more than a million and a half hostile Palestinians.

What attitude should a peace-seeking Israeli adopt toward the evacuation of settlements Ariel Sharon is planning in the Gaza Strip? This question troubles many people who support the removal of the settlements - the "main obstacle to peace," as we all know - yet who find themselves emotionally unable to to trust the Lebanon warmonger.

This dilemma goes beyond the superficial debate linking the Gaza withdrawal to the "depth of the criminal investigations" into Sharon's financial affairs. The initial question of whether this is just another media spin operation, or a serious plan with a realistic chance of being implemented, already has a convincing answer. The mere raising of the issue creates a new situation, simply because this declaration of willingness to evacuate settlements comes from the father of the settlements himself. This causes the ideological position of those who sanctify settlements to collapse, turning the entire matter into a question of cost-effectiveness, in which decisions are made based on rational considerations.

Where rational considerations are concerned, there is nothing more rational than to evacuate a few thousands settlers living among more than a million and a half hostile Palestinians. The argument that the evacuation will be interpreted as a victory for terror and therefore bolster it is merely masquerading as a rational one - in fact, it is a simplistic and generalized evaluation not supported by evidence.

As presented, Sharon's evacuation plan should win the support of all those that seek peace, because it apparently mimics the plans of the left that call for the dismantling of the settlements and separation from the Palestinians.

But a good measure of skepticism and caution is called for among those demonstrating exuberant support for the revolution the prime minister has undergone. But before that, those extolling the decline of the ideology of the settlements must also undergo an ideological revolution themselves and realize that "dismantling the settlements" is an ideology of the left, just as the setting up settlements is one of the right.

The truth is that the age of ideology has passed and the "establishing" of settlements, just like their "dismantling," is an anachronistic concept that should have no effect on the peace process other than as a symbol and a way to gain support from right and left.

Somewhere back in the late 1980's, the settlements crossed a critical threshold beyond which continued demographic and urban development was attained. The settlement leaders managed to establish a powerful political pressure group on both sides of the Green Line, creating a legal and physical infrastructure that led to the de facto annexation of the settlements to the state of Israel.

Since then, the number of settlements, and even the number of people living in them, has become irrelevant because the tools of Israeli domination have become perfected to the point that the distinction between "sovereign Israel" and "occupied territories" - and between the settlements of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip compared to Israeli towns - has become completely blurred.

Even the control over land has ceased to serve as a means for the construction of settlements, but has instead become a way to restrict the movement of the Palestinian population and rob it off its physical space. Most of the settlements, small or large, have continued to waste enormous public resources, based on the false claim that they are "a focus of ideological Zionist activity" and have security value.

Thirty-six years after the establishment of the first settlement, the "settlements," like the kibbutz and moshav, the "wall and tower settlements" and the draining of the Hula swamp, have become exhibits in the Zionist Museum. They have been replaced by "the fence" and its gates, the colorful checkpoints on the West Bank and the slave markets of the Erez checkpoint as the new symbols of Zionism.

Only in the circles of the liberal left and the ideological right are there still those that continue the traditional struggle "for and against the settlements," as if nothing has happened - after all, what could be easier than mouthing hackneyed slogans? Sharon identified both the reality that has prevailed over ideology and the public mood, and came out with his evacuation plan.

After it was made public, he promised the Americans that Israel would continue to supply electricity, water and the other services it currently provides to the Gaza Strip - in other words, the real control will remain in his hands and he will have the ability to choke the residents if they demonstrate too great a joy at the evacuation of settlements.

As usual, Sharon knows how to usurp the symbols of the left, while turning their meaning upside-down. That is what he did with the separation fence, turning it into an apartheid fence, and that is what he wants to do with the evacuation of settlements in Gaza, which will be used as an excuse to justify the annexation of parts of the West Bank - demanding something over here in return for the concessions he made over there.

What then should be the position of a peace-seeking Israeli? It should be a lack of faith in the plan of someone who merely wants to "shorten the lines" in order to continue the war to the point of oppressing the Palestinian enemy.

A careful distinction should be made between the "evacuation of settlements" as a step to attain peace, and their evacuation in order to improve Israel's tactical position. There must be a realization that "settlements" as a symbol no longer exists except in the hearts of an ideological minority on the left and on the right, and that consequently "evacuation" is meaningless except for those who seek to celebrate their defense or destruction.

And the most important point we must bear in mind is that unilateral steps - even if they involve the evacuation of settlements - cannot be a basis for understanding, but can only encourage the continuation of the bloody conflict. How easy it is to tempt the left with the heady scent of "removing the settlements."

Worse than anti-Semitism
Anyone who knows Israel even a little knows that of course the country is nothing how it is reported in some important newspapers, and that such lies contravene every rule of journalism. The reports in these papers ignore the complexities of its society and present Israel as a caricature.
By Amnon Rubinstein	Feb. 16, 2004 | 12:00 AM

In November 2003, Neil Mackay, one of the editors of the Scottish Sunday Herald, published an article in which he recycled claims made in some Arab circles - that Mossad agents in the United States knew in advance of the terror plot to attack the Twin Towers, and did nothing to prevent it. Up to now this insane accusation was limited to extremist Arab propagandists and neo-Nazis. The Glasgow newspaper found it proper to repeat this canard, without citing its source, as an expression of faith in its accuracy.

The article shocked Labor MP Jim Murphy and Lord Greville Janner, Jewish leaders who protested, asking the paper's editor to print a correction. The editor refused, saying the report was based on verified sources. In his letter to Lord Janner, the editor asked him not to fall into the trap of Ariel Sharon, by condemning everyone who disagrees with him as an anti-Semite, even though Janner's letter contained no such accusation.

As an example of Mackay's self righteousness, the paper's editor cited articles Mackay had written condemning anti-Semitism. He failed to mention, for some reason, that some of his best friends are Jews. The simplest way to answer the editor of the Sunday Herald is for the State of Israel to sue the paper for libel, which the Foreign Ministry is now considering.

But the problem is that the article in the Scottish newspaper is only one extreme example of the wild and hysterical attacks on Israel, and not only because of the occupation and the settlements. In such attacks, Israel is portrayed virulently, as a monstrous country capable not only of harming Palestinians, but of not preventing mass murder in New York if it serves its base interests.

Anyone who knows Israel even a little knows that of course the country is nothing how it is reported in some important newspapers, and that such lies contravene every rule of journalism. The reports in these papers ignore the complexities of its society and present Israel as a caricature - the same as appears in the Arab press, where every Israeli is a monster stomping on an unfortunate Arab.

Things reached the point where, during a conference on anti-Semitism organized by Minister Natan Sharansky two weeks ago, a Jewish delegate from Sweden expressed satisfaction over the incident in which the Israeli ambassador in Sweden damaged an exhibit he interpreted as praising the woman suicide bomber of Haifa's Maxim restaurant. He was pleased, he said, because through it many Swedes heard for the first time about terror against Israeli civilians.

Is there anti-Semitism in all of this? Anti-Semitism certainly aids writing villainously against Israel, but it doesn't explain everything. Something more serious may be afoot. Traditional anti-Semitism did not accept Jews in Christian society, but it usually did not negate their right, at least in principle, to separate existence. Before Kristallnacht - the night of broken glass in Germany - even the Nazis preached "Jews to Palestine."

The anti-Semitic tone of newspapers like the Sunday Herald negates the Jewish right to separate existence by delegitimizing the State of Israel, which is described - also with the assistance of Israeli academics - as a Nazi apartheid state.

The logical conclusion of the Sunday Herald's libelous article is that a democratic country that knows about a plan to commit mass murder in New York and does nothing to prevent it has no right at all to exist. This is worse than anti-Semitism.

This is negating the right of the Jewish people to self-determination. When such views are accompanied by a rise in anti-Semitism, it takes us back as Jews to dark days.

U.S., European countries to boycott ICJ fence hearings
By News Agencies	| Feb. 17, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The United States and most European countries will not appear at the International Court of Justice to press their arguments on the legality of the Israeli barrier in the Palestinian territories, a diplomat said Wednesday.

Thirteen countries, along with The Palestinian Authority, Arab League and Organization of Islamic States will participate when the UN court convenes on Monday to hear oral arguments, the diplomat told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The number was far fewer than the 44 UN member countries that submitted written briefs of their position to the court.

The countries scheduled to speak before the 15 judges are Jordan, Algeria, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Cuba, Belize, South Africa, Madagascar, Senegal, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia, the diplomat said.

Britain's Foreign Office said it had lodged a written submission with the court on January 30 but would not be making an oral statement next week. Britain has condemned the building of the fence on occupied Palestinian land but believes it is inappropriate for the court to examine the legality of the barrier "without the consent of both parties."

"It is our view that the building of a fence on occupied Palestinian land is unlawful but that it is not appropriate for the court to take action without the consent of both parties," said a spokeswoman, on customary condition of anonymity.

Court spokesman Boris Heim declined to comment on the list. An announcement was due to be released later Wednesday, he said.

Red Cross: West Bank barrier violates int'l law The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Wednesday that Israel's controversial West Bank barrier violates international humanitarian law because it cuts across Palestinian land.

It said the barrier - a network of metal fences and concrete walls - bars thousands of Palestinians stranded on its western side from adequate access to basic services like water, health care and education.

"The ICRC's opinion is that the West Bank barrier, in as far as its route deviates from the 'Green Line' into occupied territory, is contrary to IHL (international humanitarian law)," a statement from the body's Geneva headquarters said.

The statement also called on the Israeli government - which says the measure aims at keeping out suicide bombers who have killed hundreds of its citizens - "not to plan, construct or maintain this Barrier within occupied (Palestinian) territory."

In a prompt reaction, Israel's ambassador in Geneva Ya'akov Levy said the ICRC's statement "could compromise the neutral stance" essential for the body - which monitors global pacts on humanitarian issues in war and post-war situations.

"There is a danger that the position presented by the ICRC will be turned into a political tool against Israel's measures of self-defense...," Levy declared.

Israel is facing hearings on the barrier at the International Court of Justice in the Hague next week after a request by the United Nations General Assembly for a non-binding opinion on whether it is legally obliged to tear it down.

Humane treatment obligations The ICRC said problems created by the barrier "clearly demonstrate that it runs counter to Israel's obligation ....to ensure the humane treatment and well-being of the civilian population living under its occupation."

It added: "The measures taken by the Israeli authorities linked to the construction of the Barrier in occupied territory go far beyond what is permissible for an occupying power under international humanitarian law."

The ICRC said it recognized the right of Israel - which says the barrier is meant to stop suicide bombers and has already thwarted dozens of attacks - to take measures to defend the security of its own population.

And ICRC official Balthasar Staehelin said that if the barrier were moved back to the Green Line - the boundary before Israel seized the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East War - "that would solve many of the problems as far as we are concerned."

Staehelin said the statement followed careful study by ICRC representatives in the area for 18 months of the effects of the barrier - which cuts a wide swathe round Israeli settlements on the West Bank - on ordinary Palestinians.

It also followed one month of discussion with the Israeli authorities on the organization's concerns. "We hope this statement will give greater impetus to the dialogue, which we want to continue."

Palestinian communities were effectively cut off from the society to which they belong and the barrier also gave rise "to widespread appropriation of Palestinian property and extensive damage to or destruction of buildings and farmland.

Lapid: Israel could gain more by going to ICJ hearing Israel would have gained more from attending next week's World Court hearings on the West Bank separation fence than by deciding to stay away, Justice Minister Yosef Lapid told Reuters on Tuesday.

The Hague-based International Court of Justice begins hearings on February 23 to rule on the legality of the obstacle of wire and concrete that Israel says keeps out suicide bombers, but Palestinians call a land grab.

"This is basically a worldwide tribunal where your opinions should be broadcast and reported everywhere in the world," said Lapid. "If you do not put up an argument you will not have publicity for your views."

Israel questions the court's right to rule on the barrier and is backed in this position by the United States and European Union - though they criticize a route that takes it deep into the West Bank around settlements.

Israel sent a position paper to the court ahead of the hearings, but decided not to participate further.

Lapid said that even if Israel was not represented at the hearings: "We may support demonstrations against what we consider is a move in support of terror, the whole Hague procedure."

He reiterated a call for the route of the barrier to be moved closer to the 1967 Green Line border.

Officials say the route could shift to make it easier to sell to Washington and ease Palestinian living conditions. They have not suggested cuts as big as the 200 km (125 miles) that Lapid wants lopped off the planned 728 km (452 mile) route.

"We should not interfere with the right of Palestinian farmers to work their land, with the ability of children in villages to reach their schools, with the everyday normal life of Palestinians in the West Bank," Lapid said.

Palestinians say the real aim of the barrier is to set a de-facto border that would deny them the viable state they seek in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Lapid said Israel needed to head off the possibility that the Palestinians could try to win international approval for the same kind of boycott tactics that helped end South Africa's apartheid regime.

"What the Palestinians are striving for is to have a condemnation from The Hague court which they then want to use in the United Nations General Assembly in order to create some sort of boycott against either Israeli goods or Israeli institutions or Israeli representatives," Lapid said.

Too late for two-state? (part 3)
By Yossi Alpher	Feb. 20, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The slippery slope Israel's slippery slope toward the demise of the two-state solution is not a one-way street. Nothing seems to be irreversible in the Israel-Arab conflict.

We recall that after the Oslo DOP was signed in September 1993, many key actors and observers pronounced the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and a two-state solution "irreversible." The past three years have demonstrated just how mistaken they were. Hence we must be cautious in defining that virtual red line of geography, demography, hostility, politics and lack of leadership, beyond which a two-state solution appears to be irretrievable. Certainly the mainstream on both sides has not given up on the idea.

Yet unless Israelis can convincingly demonstrate a state-level capacity to roll back the settlement movement, and Palestinians can prove a capability of stopping violence and respecting the Jewish nature of Israel, and unless the two peoples get better leadership, the two-state solution is liable to be seen in historic perspective as a very brief episode in the tragic annals of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - despite the support of a broad majority of Israelis and Palestinians. Once it is off the agenda, the two sides' options will be bleak indeed.

The slippery slope is liable to, and in some ways already does, look something like this:

As chances for a two-state solution fade, Palestinians living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, now a growing majority, will call for the emergence of a single democratic state ("one man, one vote"). At some point the PLO will officially renounce its 1988 decision accepting UNGA Resolution 181, dissolve the Palestinian Authority, and revert to an open demand for a one-state solution.

An overwhelming majority of Israeli Jews will reject this option, insofar as it would constitute the end of the Zionist dream that unites them. Even most of the relatively few non-Zionist Israeli Jews (mainly from the ultra-orthodox sector) will in any case have no faith in the capacity of a Palestinian Arab majority to maintain their minority rights.

Here it must be noted that it is not easy for the PLO to dissolve the Palestinian Authority, due to vested interests - salaries for over 100,000 government and security officials, and positions of power and influence. Such a step means renewed full occupation by Israel and the launching of a decades-long new struggle that will not necessarily succeed. It will not be taken lightly.

The Israeli mainstream majority has already begun to respond to this threat, by advocating unilateral measures: withdrawal from the densely populated mountain heartland of the West Bank and from the Gaza Strip, dismantlement of the settlements there and creation of de-facto security borders. The settlers and the hard right oppose this option and threaten civil strife.

Based on their political record thus far and their overall dynamism and militancy, the settlers may succeed in deterring the majority. By the time the Israeli mainstream becomes frightened enough to seriously contemplate enforcing unilateral withdrawal - rather than merely "voting" for it in opinion polls - the settler opposition will be even stronger.

In the best case, the settlers and the hard right will agree to compromise with the mainstream and endorse a unilateral partition scheme that may involve the removal of some settlements, but will in fact seek to compel the Palestinians to acquiesce in a system of semi-autonomous enclaves surrounded by "security" fences and by the remaining settlements.

This corresponds with the ideas for limited unilateral redeployment currently being discussed by PM Sharon and others on the right: move a few settlements, fence in the Palestinian areas if possible, and declare them to be a state. Conceivably, unilateral acts in this direction will precede the first phase noted above, i.e., Palestinian renunciation of a two-state solution. Either way, Israel will remain "Jewish," but hardly democratic, while Palestinians will press their opposition to an unfair and imposed settlement that in no way approximates a viable two-state solution.

At this point, only a radical dismantling of the settlements in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank mountain heartland and an open willingness to negotiate transfer to Palestinian sovereignty (within the framework of an eventual two-state solution agreed with a realistic Palestinian leadership) of the Jordan Valley and East Jerusalem might still save the two-state solution. But this is still not likely to be doable politically, in view of the settlers' political influence on the dominant Israeli right. And at some point it will no longer interest the majority of Palestinians.

Under these circumstances, violence between Arabs and Jews will escalate. Because with Palestinian advocacy of a single-state solution the Green Line loses its significance for Palestinians, the violence will spread to the Arab community inside Israel. Increasingly extreme measures will be advocated and invoked by both sides.

Some Israelis, confronted with a concerted Palestinian demand for Israel to cease to be a Jewish state in order ostensibly to be a democratic one, might possibly opt for far uglier modes of struggle than those employed thus far, including forced concentration of Palestinians - perhaps including Israeli Arabs - in autonomous enclaves and/or "transfer."

The surrounding Arab countries, which succeeded in sitting out two Palestinian uprisings, or intifadas, in recent decades, will find it difficult to avoid active intervention - as will the international community. The Arabs, the US and the European Union may confront a far bloodier and more disruptive ethnic conflict on the shores of the Mediterranean than any witnessed in the past 50 years.

And there will be further damage to the cohesiveness of the Jewish people, as a large portion of the Jewish Diaspora may now seek to reduce its Jewish identity in order to disassociate itself from what gradually will be seen internationally - justifiably or not in objective terms, it will no longer matter - as an apartheid state, struggling against a legitimate liberation movement.

Conclusion We are confronted, then, with a South African scenario without a South African solution: a future of strife and warfare between a minority Jewish regime and a majority Arab population - but without recourse to the solution of a single unified state. Many Israelis on the left and the right, most Diaspora Jews and indeed most supporters of Israel, though fully aware where we are heading, shudder at the use of terms like "apartheid state" and "South Africanization of the conflict."

After all, Palestinians and their supporters have been trying for decades to make Israel fit the South African scenario in ways that are markedly inaccurate and inappropriate. There are significant differences - historical, racial, political - between the course of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict thus far and that of apartheid South Africa.

It is, after all, the Palestinians, not the Israelis, who between 1936 and 2000 repeatedly rejected reasonable two-state partition proposals. It is Palestinian terrorism more than any other factor that has obliged Israel to pave bypass roads, build fences, set up roadblocks and require Palestinians to obtain passes in order to move from one Palestinian city to another. Besides, few South Africans ever envisaged or advocated a two-state solution for their conflict.

Yet the South African apartheid model is liable to become the closest approximation in international parlance to the reality that awaits us at the bottom of the slippery slope, if we do not very soon find a solution. Ostensibly there are a number of ways to do this.

Two options - a negotiated two-state solution and unilateral Israeli withdrawal to realistic boundaries that facilitate further negotiations - have been mentioned already, in a pessimistic vein. In order for one or both to come to pass, they appear to require either a major change of heart on the part of the ideological settlers with their messianic dedication - recognition that they themselves are leading Israel toward disaster, albeit in the name of the loftiest Zionist motives - or the emergence of an Israeli government both capable of and not deterred from initiating a major confrontation with the hard line settlers, comparable at least to the 1948 "Altalena affair."

(In June 1948, then-prime minister David Ben-Gurion gave orders to open fire from the shores of Tel Aviv on the Altalena, a ship planning to unload arms for the dissident Irgun Tzvai Leumi, led by Menachem Begin. The ship was sunk and several Irgun members killed. Ben-Gurion's decision, which involved the killing of fellow Jews, is generally credited with ensuring that Begin and his followers integrated into the nascent State of Israel's army and polity rather than opposing them, thereby saving Israel from a hopeless civil war.) As we have shown, neither of these developments appears likely.

A third possibility is an internationally imposed two-state solution and/or imposed unilateral Israeli withdrawal. Only Washington could lead such an initiative. For this even to be contemplated, the United States would have to conclude that avoidance of a "South Africa on the Mediterranean" scenario was a matter of its highest self-interest.

Either the administration of the day would have to undertake to risk heavy pressure from American Jewish and right wing Christian sources, possibly backed by the Israeli government, or at least the American Jewish mainstream lobby would have to abandon its knee-jerk acquiescence in Israel's settlement policy and actively back US coercion vis-a-vis Israel on this issue.

Since neither of these possibilities appears likely in the near term either, it behooves the relevant policy planners in Washington, Brussels and Cairo to at least begin exploring alternatives of more robust conflict management: both to look for short-term measures that might help sustain the two-state solution for a while longer, in the hopes that one or more of the current parameters of deadlock will change, and to examine ways to somehow reduce the damage projected onto the region by a South Africa-style conflict.

In this regard, the international community has a vested interest in encouraging the government of Israel to continue to build a political security fence - but only if it follows the Green Line.

While a Green Line fence may not bring down the settlements beyond it, it does potentially lay an additional foundation for a viable two-state solution. The U.S. and others would also be well advised to urge Israel to dismantle settlements unilaterally. But it must also caution Sharon's or any other Israeli government not to see in such acts "political" solutions that preclude open negotiations with the PLO on all issues, territorial and otherwise.

The growing demographic-geographic threat to Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state is of strategic proportions. There is something cruelly paradoxical in its emergence at a time when most of the strategic threats Israel has faced over the years have been somewhat mitigated.

The Bush administration's post-9/11 campaign against Islamic radical terrorism and WMD proliferation in the Middle East has, at least from Israel's standpoint, reduced these threats, insofar as for the first time they are being actively targeted not only by Israel but by a very powerful ally as well. And the U.S. occupation of Iraq and destruction of its army, whatever their negative consequences, have radically reduced the threat of conventional warfare against Israel by a hostile Arab coalition.

Unlike these external strategic threats, it is within Israel's exclusive power to deal with the demographic-geographic threat, if not by rescuing the two-state solution (for which the PLO as currently configured is a problematic and perhaps doubtful partner), then by unilaterally withdrawing to a realistic political line that leaves negotiation options open.

Neither of these options, nor for that matter an imposed two-state scheme, is likely to completely end the violence and hostility; indeed, in some ways they may temporarily compound it. But they will give Jewish and democratic Israel a fighting chance to survive and prosper, however problematic its immediate neighborhood.

This is Israel's most pressing strategic challenge. Sadly, at present, it does not seem up to the task. The potential consequences are awful. Hence the approaching years should be understood as a time of national emergency for the Jewish people.

Oxford legal experts take aim at the fence
Scholars at Oxford University say the security measures that Israel is adopting to defend itself violate international law.
By Yuval Yoaz	Feb. 23, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
"In its current form, Israel's construction of the separation Barrier in the Occupied Territories violates both international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Israel has not presented any compelling justification on security grounds for the Barrier as it is currently being constructed, and the Barrier imposes unnecessary and disproportionate restrictions on the human rights of the Palestinians."

That is the unequivocal conclusion underlying the legal opinion prepared by OXPIL (Oxford Public Interest Lawyers), experts in international law from Oxford University in England, who were asked about the "legal implications" of the construction of the separation fence by Israel in the West Bank. The opinion, which reached Haaretz and is being published here for the first time, is a useful tool for prophesying the results of the proceedings beginning today on exactly the same question, in the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

It is surprising to find that the document, which is 57 pages long, was prepared at the request of an Israeli organization. It was requested by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), which has two petitions on the issue of the separation fence pending in the High Court of Justice. One of the petitions relates to the construction of the fence within the area of the West Bank, and thus the creation of a new regime in the "seam line area" that is based on permits. It is awaiting the decision of the High Court as to whether to issue a temporary injunction and whether to expand the judicial panel that is discussing it.

ACRI refuses to link the Oxford opinion, which was completed and submitted to the organization last week, to the proceedings in The Hague, saying it was ordered half a year ago, months before the decision by the United Nations General Assembly to involve the legal scholars at The Hague in the issue. However, completely by coincidence, the subject of the document was defined in the very same words as was the subject of the proceedings in The Hague.

"We asked for the legal opinion because we wanted to have a clear legal basis regarding the legality of the separation fence, according to international law," explains attorney Dana Alexander, the head of the legal department at ACRI, "but there is no attempt here to tie the discussions in the High Court to those in The Hague. Even the petitions that we have already submitted relate to the legality of the fence according to international law, although our arguments relate to the legality of the fence in terms of undermining human rights. The question of the legality of the fence in terms of international law is broader, and deals with additional issues, with which we as a human rights organization are not involved."

The OXPIL group consists of about 20 legal scholars, most of them members of the Faculty of Law at Oxford University, and some of them postgraduate students. The group, with legal scholars from various countries - including some Israelis - works pro bono in the field of international law, at the request of various bodies. ACRI claims that the initiative for writing the opinion about the separation fence came from England. "Just when their request arrived, we had begun to work on the petitions on the subject of the separation fence, and therefore we thought it proper to get the opinion from them. I don't think that they can be suspected of any a priori anti-Israel tendency. We don't consider this as intervention by foreign groups. This is not foreign law, but international law, and after all, even Israel recognizes the fact that it applies to the occupied territories in one way or another," says Alexander.

Means and legal obligations

The document prepared in Oxford attempts to analyze from a dispassionate legal point of view, leaving politics aside, the "degree to which the Barrier conforms to Israel's obligations in the area of international human law and in the area of international human rights law."

In order not to be suspected of hostility toward Israel, the formulators of the document even make an effort to use a term which the Israeli government uses in order to describe the fence - "the separation barrier." The scholars explain that their opinion "does not include any discussion of the acceptability of the request by the UN General Assembly to the International Court of Justice in the Hague to submit an opinion on the subject of the construction of the Barrier," but only a discussion of its construction.

The analysis is done on two planes. One is international humanitarian law, which relates to protection of a population under an occupying regime. The relevant documents, which are a kind of "international law" on the subject, are the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and the Hague Regulations of 1907. The scholars are in dispute on the question of Israel's position, but it is generally assumed that Israel recognizes that the Hague Regulations apply to the territories, and does not recognize the binding application of the Geneva Convention.

The second plane is the area of human rights in the more general context, which is anchored in conventions that do not deal specifically with states of war and occupation. For example, the convention relating to civil and political rights, and the convention relating to economic, social and cultural rights, both from 1966; Israel is a signatory to these conventions and even ratified them, but does not recognize their validity in the occupied territories.

"Israel is entitled to defend its territory, and its military and administrative functions in the Occupied Territories, from militant or terrorist attacks," begins the documents. "However, any security measures must be in strict conformity with Israel's obligations under international law. As Chief Justice Barak of the Israeli Supreme Court stated in the Ajuri case [in September 2002], `Israel is fighting a difficult war against terror. It is a war carried out within the law and with the tools the law makes available.' Israel's activities in the Occupied Territories are subject to both international humanitarian law and international human rights law."

According to the opinion, "Israel is bound by the Hague Regulations and the Fourth Geneva Convention 1949, in all the Occupied Territories. The West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem constitute Occupied Territories under international humanitarian law. No derogation is permissible from humanitarian law, even in times of public emergency.

"The existing and planned route of the Barrier, the operation of the gates, and the adjacent closed military zones (between the Barrier and the 1949 Armistice Line [Green Line], are not necessary or proportionate measures of control and security according to the Fourth Geneva Convention...."the security objectives it seeks to serve ... could be achieved through alternative, less detrimental means."

Neither necessary nor proportionate

The document determines that "the route of the Barrier deviates from the Green Line to protect Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories," an argument that Israel does not deny. "Israeli civilian settlements in the Occupied Territories violate... the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as numerous UN Security Council resolutions. Israel may not unlawfully use the security powers of the Fourth Geneva Convention to protect unlawful Israeli settlements.

"Israel's requisition of Palestinian property to construct the Barrier violates the prohibition on the confiscation of private property in Occupied Territory (Hague Regulations, reg. 46). A state of hostilities does not currently exist which would permit Israel to destroy or seize property for imperative military reasons in war." The construction on public land is also a violation of the Geneva Convention.

Humanitarian law relating to a civilian population in occupied territory also prohibits the denial of medical treatment, employment, food supplies and prohibits collective punishment. The construction of the barrier, according to the document, leads to a violation of all these prohibitions, and even the prohibition against forcible transfer of residents. "The seizure of Palestinian property and demolition of houses, arbitrary refusals of residency permits in closed military zones, and irregular gate openings may result in the direct or constructive forcible transfer of Palestinians ... potentially amounting to a war crime ..."

Regarding the conventions relating to human rights, the OXPIL group states that "Israel's obligations under international human rights treaties, and under customary law, are engaged wherever Israel exercises effective control over territory, including over non-sovereign Occupied Territory .... Where limitations on human rights are permitted on security grounds, they must be strictly necessary and proportionate to meet the security threat. The construction of a Barrier chiefly inside the Occupied Territories is neither necessary nor proportionate in response to the threat to Israel .... The [Palestinian] economic crisis is partially due to existing Israeli restrictions on Palestinian freedom of movement."

The opinion paper enumerates a series of violations of civil and political rights caused by the construction of the fence. "There is strong evidence that the Barrier unjustifiably violates Palestinian human rights to: freedom of movement; freedom from arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, family and home; freedom of peaceful assembly; freedom of religion; rights of minorities; and rights of due process.

"The Barrier may increase the likelihood of unjustifiable violations of the right to liberty and security of person and freedom from arbitrary detention, as well as freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."

The document levels implied criticism at Israel's Supreme Court: "Israeli military tribunals and domestic courts do not provide effective remedies to Palestinians for violations of rights resulting from the construction of the Barrier, property requisition orders, permits in closed military zones, and the establishment of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories.

"There is strong evidence that the Barrier unjustifiably violates Palestinian human rights to: work and make a living; an adequate standard of living, food and housing; physical and mental health; education; and participation in cultural life ... The Barrier discriminates against Palestinians on prohibited grounds, and may amount to a violation of the international customary prohibition on apartheid ...."

Finally, the OXPIL opinion states, "The Barrier is inconsistent with the right of Palestinians to self-determination. In this regard, the Barrier is inconsistent with Israel's obligations as usufructuary in Occupied Territories under humanitarian law. The Barrier violates Israel's duty under the Interim Agreement 1995 [between Israel and the Palestinian Authority] to preserve the `integrity and status' of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as `a single territorial unit' pending final status."

Palestinians protest fence; Arafat: no peace while wall stands
By Amos Harel	and Yair Ettinger Haaretz Service, Agencies	| Feb. 23, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Six Border Police troops were wounded Monday afternoon in clashes with anti-fence protestors in Abu Dis, on the outskirts of East Jerusalem. One of the wounded sustained moderate injuries, while the others all had light wounds.

The troops responded by firing percussion and tear gas grenades.

Thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip marched in protest against Israel's separation barrier Monday, and in some locations were pushed back by Israel Defense Forces soldiers and Border Police troops firing tear gas.

Palestinian schools and government offices let out early for the marches, which coincided with world court hearings on the legality of the barrier.

Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia led a rally in his hometown of Abu Dis, and told the crowd that barriers such as the one separating Abu Dis from Jerusalem cannot guarantee security for Israel and would only breed discontent.

"If you want peace, the path is known," he said, addressing Israelis. "If you prefer violence, the path is known as well."

Earlier Monday, Yasser Arafat, speaking on live television less than an hour before the International Court of Justice was to hear arguments on legality of the West Bank barrier, urged Palestinians to "make their voices heard" to the court.

The Palestinian Authority chairman urged Palestinians and "forces of peace in Israel" to make their voices heard in protest aginst "this wall of expansion and annexation."

IDF troops in a West Bank village fired tear gas at some 2,500 Palestinians demonstrating as the court began its hearings, witnesses said.

They said the Palestinians were chanting "Allahu Akbar" (God is Great) as soldiers used tear gas to drive them back from a section of the barrier in the village of Deir Ghsun near Tul Karm close to the border with Israel.

Around 100 Palestinians were overcome by inhalation of the gas and fell to the ground, while others began throwing stones at soldiers, according to a Reuters journalist at the scene.

The IDF had no immediate comment. But it had deployed soldiers in force along the 180 km (110 miles) of the barrier built so far after Palestinians vowed rallies along its route to mark the International Court of Justice hearing in The Hague.

Palestinians contended before the court that the barrier is an illegal bid to annex land they seek for a viable state since it veers well into West Bank territory and takes in settlements.

Israel says the barrier is a temporary security measure to keep out Palestinian suicide bombers. It was boycotting the hearing, saying the World Court was not competent to pronounce on what it saw as a "politically motivated issue".

Israeli Arabs to demonstrate against wall Israeli Arab political movements were also preparing Monday for demonstrations against the separation fence. Protests and rallies were expected during the day in 10 Arab localities in Israel.

Lawyers and jurists were planning to demonstrate Monday opposite the section of fence completed several days ago between the Israeli town of Baka al-Garbiyeh and the Palestinian village of Nazlat Issa.

The protest is organized by the umbrella organization for Arab NGOs in Israel. The Supreme Follow Up Committee of Arab citizens will also participate in the protest.

The Hadash-Ta'al party - which has three of its MKs in The Hague to participate in public relations efforts against the fence - will participate in a demonstration opposite the U.S. consulate in East Jerusalem, and will also conduct rallies in Tel Aviv, Haifa, Nazareth, Shfaram, Arabeh, Sakhnin, Taibeh, Umm al-Fahm and Kafr Yassif.

In his comments, Arafat rejected Israel's position that the barrier is a temporary bulwark meant to keep out suicide bombers and not a new border, saying it was designed to thwart a future Palestinian state by encroaching well into Palestinian territory.

"No security and no peace can ever prevail between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, and even in the whole region in the shadow of this ... expansionist and racist segregation wall," he said in a speech televised worldwide.

Reading from a prepared text in his Muqata headquarters in Ramallah, he said, of the barrier, which he called "this apartheid wall":

"This is another Berlin Wall... aimed at swallowing 58 percent of our [West Bank] and transforming our towns and villages... into isolated ghettos illegally controlled by occupation settlements and prevent us from establishing our Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.

"The wall has [already] transformed our towns and cities and villages into prisons and collective detention camps," he said.

Protest marches against the barrier were planned across the West Bank and Gaza Strip later Monday.

Israel says the barrier is a last line of defense against suicide bombers, who have killed 463 people in 110 attacks in more than three years of fighting.

On Sunday, a Palestinian bomber killed eight Israelis and wounded dozens on a Jerusalem bus.

The Palestinians argue that the barrier is a land grab, and demand it be taken down, or re-routed to follow the pre-1967 war Green Line border.

Palestinians charge separation fence is for land annexation, not security
Today, the second of three days of hearings at the International Court of Justice in The Hague on the legality of the separation fence inside Palestinian territory, will be taken up with arguments from Belize, Cuba, Indonesia, and Jordan in the morning, and from Madagascar, Malaysia and Senegal in the afternoon.

THE HAGUE - Today, the second of three days of hearings at the International Court of Justice in The Hague on the legality of the separation fence inside Palestinian territory, will be taken up with arguments from Belize, Cuba, Indonesia, and Jordan in the morning, and from Madagascar, Malaysia and Senegal in the afternoon.

Israel is not making an oral presentation to the court to avoid acknowledging the court's jurisdiction on the issue. The Palestinian high-level delegation dominated yesterday's hearing, led by Nasser al-Kidwa, their permanent observer at the United Nations, whoo made the main presentation. In a three-hour session he argued that the barrier would "render a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict practically impossible."

He said a ruling against the fence could pave the way for international sanctions against Israel and he hoped a non-binding ruling by the court could lead to the same kind of international action that followed the court's 1971 opinion on South Africa, which led to sanctions against the apartheid state.

He said that if completed according to its currently planned route, the fence would leave Palestinians isolated in enclaves in only half of the West Bank.

Israel, which is boycotting the hearings, says the fence aims to stop Palestinian suicide bombers from infiltrating its towns and cities. Al Kidwa called it a bid to annex land, not provide security. "If Israel wanted to build a security fence it could have built an 80-meter high fence on the Green Line and not an 8-meter fence," he said. "It wouldn't have done anything for coexistence but at least its legality would not have been in doubt."

Al-Kidwa told the 15 justices on the panel: "The wall is not about security. It is about entrenching the occupation and the de facto annexation of large areas of Palestinian land. This wall, if completed, will leave the Palestinian people with only half of the West Bank within isolated, non-contiguous, walled enclaves."

After al-Kidwa, Stephanie Khouri made her presentation, dryly noting that the fence has 37 gates and only half were working, and that it is made up of barbed wire, trenches, and an electrified fence with automatic sensors.

A similar presentation she made to U.S. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice last year persuaded the Americans to oppose the fence on its current routing. The Palestinians are saying inside the court and out that they have no objections to Israel building a fence on the Green Line or on Israeli territory.

It is placing it inside Palestinian territory, often separating Palestinians from their farms, schools, and relatives, that they object to. Also speaking on behalf of the Palestinians was Professor James Crawford, head of the international law department at the University of Cambridge.

They were followed by legal arguments presented by Professor Ron Lowe of Oxford University. In the afternoon, the court also heard arguments from representatives of Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh and South Africa.

Outside the court, battles for public opinion also raged. The Hague's police, not used to angry demonstrations, issued parade and rally licenses to ensure that opposing sides stayed separated.

Israelis and their supporters, which included hundreds of pro-Israel Dutch Christians, marched in the morning, carrying posters of the 927 victims of Palestinian terror attacks.

Only 25 pro-Palestinian demonstrators were allowed to counter-rally. In the afternoon, the numbers changed, with the Palestinians holding their large rally and a small contingent of pro-Israelis facing them. The same arrangement will be enforced today and tomorrow.

Although attending the hearings as an observer, Israel is not pleading any case before the court except for a written brief arguing that the court has no jurisdiction on the issue.

"The Palestinians' real aim has been to try to get Israel in the dock of the International Court of Justice, to stand there and point at Israel and say you are an outlaw state," said Alan Baker, legal adviser to the Foreign Ministry. "This is something no Israeli government was prepared to tolerate."

In a 135-page submission, Israel said the court should have declined the United Nations General Assembly request for an opinion on the barrier out of "judicial propriety."

The statement also accused the General Assembly of showing anti-Israeli bias in its request. The barrier "relates to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and it would be substantially equivalent to deciding that dispute", it said, adding no state was obliged to allow its disputes to be submitted to judicial settlement without its consent. Furthermore, intervention by the court would impair efforts to resume negotiations between the sides and revive the road map.

The December 8 General Assembly resolution "reflects the gravest prejudice and imbalance," the statement charged. The resolution requested the court's opinion about a non-violent measure designed to prevent terrorist attacks, but made no mention of the suicide bombings which led Israel to build the barrier in the first place, it argued, calling this a "travesty."

The General Assembly, Israel argued, can only request an opinion from the ICJ if the Security Council failed to act, which was not the case, because the Council had endorsed the road map less than three weeks before the Assembly resolution was passed.

"The advisory opinion request would see the Court trespass in the complex Israeli-Palestinian conflict," the submission said. "`Palestine' does not come to the Court with clean hands. The process is tainted. It is an abuse of the advisory opinion procedure."

The United States and members of the European Union declined to attend the hearings, saying the court did not have authority to rule on an issue that should be settled by negotiations between the two sides.

But they and other Western countries that objected to the court hearing are themselves firmly opposed to the fence. British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw explicitly called the fence "unlawful" yesterday "wherever it encroaches on Palestinian territory."

After the three-hour Palestinian arguments, South Africa called on the 15-justice panel to rule the fence as illegal as South Africa's occupation of Namibia was illegal. In 1971 the international court ruled against apartheid South Africa's occupation of Namibia, paving the way for UN imposed sanctions.

Protesting by turns

Representatives of ZAKA victims' identification organization arrived early in the morning with the wreckage of Bus 19, which was blown up in a suicide attack in Jerusalem last month, killing 21 people. The shell of the bus was placed outside the court as part of a mass demonstration in support of Israel.

Protesters include terror victims, ZAKA representatives, solidarity delegations from Europe and more than 1,000 students from Israel, Britain, France, Germany, Holland and Poland. At the same time, the Christians for Israel organization was to stage a quiet rally through the streets of the city bearing pictures of 927 terror victims.

"This is a day that will live in infamy," a kippa-wearing American protester shouted outside the court, using the words of president Franklin Roosevelt after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The Palestinians were given a permit to stage a counter demonstration in the morning, with 25 activists only.

A second Palestinian demonstration was held in the afternoon, with the participation of Palestinian Authority ministers Saeb Erekat and Nabil Sha'ath, as well as MKs Mohammed Barake, Ahmed Tibi and Issam Makhoul of Hadash, Palestinians affected by the fence, and support groups from Europe. The Palestinians put up a symbolic fence outside the court gates.

Israeli activists had a permit to stage a similar small counter demonstration. Most members of the Israeli delegation, including 18 terror victims, arrived in The Hague on Sunday. Arnold Roth, who lost his daughter, Malka, in the attack on the Sbarro restaurant in Jerusalem, said the terror victims were in The Hague to express support for the fence that was likely to prevent further terror attacks.

Police arrest 14 at illegal demo in Tel Aviv
By Arnon Regular, Yair EttingerRoni Singer	Feb. 24, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Palestinians held coordinated protests - occasionally assaulted by Israeli tear gas - throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip yesterday.

"This fence will not bring security to Israel," Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia warned at a rally in his home town of Abu Dis. "It destroys the principle of a two-state solution and makes Palestinians' lives a hell."

The rally, attended by public figures and activists from various Palestinian organizations including Fatah, and school children, was held yesterday afternoon on the Palestinian side of the separation fence that slices through what was once seen as the administration capital of a future Palestinian state.

The theme of the rally - relentless protests against the fence, until it is dismantled - was echoed across the West Bank yesterday, as part of what the Palestinian Authority referred to as "a national day of opposition to the fence."

Television and radio stations operated carried special broadcasts, and the PA organized the largest mobilization of demonstrators since Israel intimated last year it was planning to assassinate Yasser Arafat.

Yesterday, while the parties at International Court of Justice at The Hague were making their legal arguments, the Palestinian Authority was making its case to the Palestinian people.

In the words of one senior PA official, "The fence will not bring security to Israel, in any conceivable way. The separation fence will not prevent suicide bombers entering Israel, and will itself become a target for Palestinian resistance against Israel - both military and political."

The official also warned that, "while Israel concentrates on the damage to Palestinian relations that the Jerusalem bus bombing caused, the demonstrations will prove that the fence does not answer Israel's security needs. The Jerusalem bombing was carried out by Fatah, and the message is the same as the central message of the Palestinian leadership - that the military struggle against the fence will continue alongside the public campaign."

At around 11 o'clock yesterday morning, Arafat's address in Ramallah gave the cue for demonstrations across the West Bank. "On this day of the hearing in the international court," said the Palestinian leader, "the whole world should pay attention to the unprecedented human tragedy that is being inflicted on our people because of the occupation."

"This is another Berlin Wall," Arafat added. "Peace will not be achieved between the two peoples and in the entire region in the presence of the wall of annexation, expansion and apartheid." Arafat urged Palestinians across the West Bank and Gaza Strip to "make their voices heard" to the international court.

Arafat's speech launched the protests, and the violent clashes with security forces. Among those participating in the rally at Abu Dis were Israeli and international peace activists and Arab Knesset members. On the Israeli side of the fence, the burned-out shell of Bus 14 had been stationed.

On the Palestinian side, Border Police and IDF troops had taken up positions, in an attempt to prevent the demonstrators reaching the fence. Within minutes, Palestinian youths began hurling rocks at the troops, who responded by firing tear gas canisters. There were similar scenes across the Palestinian territories, in towns and cities adjacent to the fence, as well as in Nablus and the Gaza Strip, which do not border on the fence.

In Nablus, protesters constructed an 2.5-meter high cardboard mockup of a concrete section of the fence. Then men wearing construction helmets and wielding hammers joined masked militants swinging rifles in knocking down the cardboard barrier. In Gaza, they burned another mock wall in effigy, and in Hebron, they burned Israeli flags.

There were also clashes in A-Ram, on the northern outskirts of Jerusalem, at a demonstration attended by Akram Sabri, the mufti of Jerusalem. In Bethlehem, some 2,000 schoolchildren, activists and Christian religious leaders descended on the area near Rachel's Tomb, where the IDF has a permanent presence.

Here two, there were clashes between protesters and soldiers. North of Tul Karm, six Border Police and 10 Palestinians were injured during clashes.

In East Jerusalem, protesters mounted a vigil outside the U.S. embassy, and Fatah activists attempted, unsuccessfully, to organize a protest march and protest strike on Salah a-Din Street, East Jerusalem's main thoroughfare. Police arrested three of the activists. A few hundred people demonstrated in front of Sharon's house yesterday night in Jerusalem, demanding that the barrier be removed.

Less than a dozen protests and vigils, organized by Israeli Arab political parties and NGOs, were held inside Israel, but only a few hundred people bothered to participate. In Nazareth, two people were arrested for displaying the Palestinian flag.

The protests are expected to continue over the coming days. The armed wings of Hamas and Fatah yesterday published flyers, in which they said that the thrust of their operations in the coming days would be aimed against the fence itself, to prove that it does not answer Israel's security needs.

Today at The Hague

Morning

l Delegations from Belize, Cuba, Indonesia and Jordan present their arguments to the court.

l Terror victims association, Israeli and European students protest outside the Peace Palace.

Afternoon

l Terror victims' association, Israeli and European students protest outside the Peace Palace.

Police arrested yesterday 14 demonstrators at an unauthorized rally in Tel Aviv against the separation fence. The demonstration, which was not sanctioned in advance by the police, was held outside the Defense Ministry complex on Kaplan Street. According to police, the protesters blocked the road, causing severe traffic congestion. The officer in charge of the operation said 14 people were arrested for disturbing the peace and assaulting police officers.

Arab world rallies in support of Palestinians
By The Associated Press	| Feb. 24, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
In small but colorful protests, people across the Arab world demonstrated yesterday against the construction of the West Bank separation fence.

"We oppose the racist wall!" chanted about 125 protesters in the center of Cairo, where opposition parties and activists came together to mark the start of hearings on the barrier at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands.

About 2,000 Palestinians marched through the refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh in southern Lebanon, carrying pictures of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who described the barrier Monday as "another Berlin Wall."

In Damascus, courts fell silent for an hour as the Syrian Bar Association called a stoppage in solidarity with the Palestinian objections to the barrier. Some 80 Syrians and Palestinians staged a sit-in in front of the European Commission offices.

In Beirut, about 500 Palestinian students sat waving Palestinian and Lebanese flags outside United Nations House. They also held placards with slogans such as "No, to the racist wall" and "Bush + Sharon = terrorism," referring to U.S. President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.

The protesters handed in a letter addressed to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan that said the barrier was "not more than a deformed copy of the Berlin Wall and a repeat of the apartheid regime which governed South Africa."

In the Egyptian capital, a ring of about 350 riot police with black helmets and long truncheons confined the demonstrators to a corner of Tahrir Square. One protester laid out a display of photos of Palestinians climbing the unfinished barrier or throwing a bundle of goods to a friend on the other side.

`Sharon, you villain'

The protesters took turns at the megaphone, leading the crowd in chants such as "Sharon, you villain, we will drag you by the chain!"

An Egyptian kindergarten teacher who took part in the protest said the barrier was cutting Palestinians off from their own land.

"It's like somebody is building a wall inside your own home and taking your bathroom and kitchen," said Iman Badawi.

Farouq el-Ashri, the senior member of the Nasserite party at the protest, said the Egyptian government had given insufficient support to the Palestinians on the wall issue.

"We know all the Arab governments are too weak to face this problem, especially because of the backing of the American government for the Israeli government," el-Ashri said.

He said the organizers - his party, the left wing Tagammu Party and smaller groups - had not asked for permission to stage the protest. The police tolerated it as the government wanted to "make a show" of democracy, el-Ashri said.

In Amman, Jordan, more than 100 people protested for an hour in front of the U.N. offices. The demonstrators - mostly members of left wing and nationalist parties - shouted slogans such as: "Oh, giant Palestinians, wake up and destroy the wall."

U.S. has lost its moral right to preach
Look who's preaching to Israel: Last Wednesday, the U.S. State Department released its annual report on the state of human rights around the world. The chapter devoted to Israel makes the usual detailed and gloomy reading.
By Gideon Levy	| Feb. 29, 2004 | 12:00 AM

Look who's preaching to Israel: Last Wednesday, the U.S. State Department released its annual report on the state of human rights around the world. The chapter devoted to Israel makes the usual detailed and gloomy reading. Washington is critical of all the ills of the occupation, about which the human rights organizations and Israel have long since raised a hue and cry. On the one hand, it will now be hard to claim here that criticism of Israel emanates only from those who hate the country; now even its great friend is pointing a finger of accusation at the administrative detentions (arrest without trial), the mass demolition of houses, the light finger on the trigger, the targeted assassinations, the torture by the Shin Bet security service (which hasn't stopped, according to the report), the deprivation of freedom of movement, the uprooting of trees, and the discrimination against Israel's Arab citizens. From this partial point of view, the report is important.

The other side, however, is that the United States has by its own hand lost its moral right to preach to any country in connection with human rights. To begin with, since 1976, no fewer than 820 people - 35 percent of them blacks - have been executed in the United States. About 43.6 million Americans don't have medical insurance, among them about 8.5 million children. That in itself should stop the U.S. from speaking in the name of justice.

Second, the State Department, which authored the report, represents a state that tramples human rights more than most others. The policeman of the world is naked, especially after Sept. 11, 2001, when security in the United States became - as it is in Israel - a supreme value above all others. In the United States, exactly as in Israel, human rights have become a nuisance, an obstacle to security. According to the organization Human Rights Watch, the United States arrested about 1,000 people after the attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, crassly violating their legal rights.

A country that is holding 660 Afghan detainees at Guantanamo without trial and depriving them of basic rights is in no position to criticize administrative detentions carried out by other countries. A country that is holding members of the Iraqi political leadership in detention without trial, far from view, is in no position to complain about the conditions of detention in the prisons of other countries. And a country that is maintaining a tough military occupation regime in Iraq doesn't have the right to fulminate against a different occupation regime, however cruel it may be, in the Palestinian territories.

Before drawing up the report on the state of human rights around the world, those responsible for the document should have taken action to bring about the immediate dismantlement of the prison at Guantanamo and the release or bringing to trial of the detainees who have been held there for well over two years in disgraceful conditions. Where did the authors of the report find the brazenness to declare that conditions in the detention camps of the Israel Defense Forces don't meet international standards? Do they meet such standards at Guantanamo? The conditions in our detention camps are, indeed, disgraceful, but the United States is not the one to say so. If Israel were to publish a report on the state of human rights in the world, the document would generate bitter scorn. The only thing separating Israel's moral right to issue such a report from the right of the United States to do so is the power of the latter - it has no moral primacy.

As for the situation in Israel: The United States bears direct responsibility for the violations of human rights in this country. If Washington truly wanted to, it could put an end to them, just as it could have long since brought the entire Israeli occupation to an end. Just as it was able to get the separation fence moved, the United States could have, if it wished, forced Israel to stop the targeted assassinations and the demolition of homes and the use of the method of administrative detention. A nod from the president of the United States and Jerusalem would immediately change its unrestrained rules of engagement. A signal from the White House, and the IDF would dismantle the checkpoints that are intended to harass the population and the Palestinians would be able to move freely on their roads.

The Israeli prime minister, we should remember, is extremely anxious to please the United States. However, the Americans take no advantage of this fact when it comes to upholding human rights. So its preaching not only lacks moral authority, it is also void of content. Instead, it provides the defenders of the Israeli occupation with justification. Every criticism of the situation in Israel is met with the reaction: What do you want from us? Look at the Americans. And, indeed, when the United States runs roughshod over human rights, many around the world, including Israel, allow themselves to behave similarly.

The leader of the free world is today imposing a dark regime in a number of spheres, both domestically and internationally, behavior that is deeply at odds with its enlightened image and its world role as a preacher. This is bad news for the world, maybe even worse than the immoral portrait of Israel that emerges from the report.

A country that launched pernicious wars of occupation, such as it did in Iraq and Afghanistan, cannot be a beacon of justice. A country that is making use, in Iraq, of veterans of the most brutal assassination units of the apartheid regime in South Africa - as the Jewish-American weekly Forward reported this week - has no moral right to talk about human rights.

From Durban to The Hague
A direct line connects Durban of September 2001 to the deliberations of the International Court of Justice in The Hague last week. It is part of the new Palestinian/Arab strategy: to transform Israel into the latest version of the apartheid regime in South Africa, and in so doing, to isolate and boycott it.

A direct line connects Durban of September 2001 to the deliberations of the International Court of Justice in The Hague last week. It is part of the new Palestinian/Arab strategy: to transform Israel into the latest version of the apartheid regime in South Africa, and in so doing, to isolate and boycott it. This was the reason it was important at the time for the Arabs to take advantage of the fact that the World Conference Against Racism took place in Durban, South Africa, just as important as the participation of a South African representative in the parade of witnesses against Israel in the The Hague.

In the face of this strategy, increasingly taking over the public discourse in the Western world as well, Israel makes do with defensive maneuvers. It tries to draft jurists and explainers to prove the difference between the Israeli presence in the territories and the character of that apartheid regime. It emphasizes the principle of self-defense inherent in the separation fence. And when it does attack Palestinian terror, it does so only as a response to Palestinian claims, and then only in arenas into which it is dragged by the Palestinians.

Due to a (justifiable) lack of faith in the character of the institutions of the international community and in any chance the Israeli position might have there, Israel has avoided bringing up its own proposals for condemning Palestinian terror. The concern is that the act itself will bestow Israeli legitimization on those institutions when they adopt anti-Israel stances.

Just a few months ago Israel did dare, for the first time in 28 years, to submit a proposal of its own to one of the UN human rights commissions. It was a rather anemic proposal about the right of Israeli children to live free of terror. The result was predictable: Israel was forced to withdraw the proposal after the Arab countries (led by Egypt) made so many changes in it that it was rendered it meaningless.

But in the face of the systematic effort of the Palestinians and the Arab and Muslim world to put Israel in the international docket, defensive maneuvers are no longer enough. An active Israeli initiative must hit anti-Israel political activity in its softest underbelly: the absurd situation whereby, time and time again, an automatic majority of countries with no semblance of protecting human rights is able to place Israel at the top of the international table of countries violating human rights.

Israel must lead a drive to demand that only democratic nations with a certain threshold in terms of human rights protection be members of the international community's human rights institutions. These institutions include the International Court of Justice in The Hague, among whose judges this week were representatives of countries known for their enlightened human rights policies, such as China (which supplied the chairman of the panel of judges) and Egypt.

The leaders of such an initiative must arm themselves with patience and non-Jewish Western supporters. At first it will be met with disbelief in its viability, if not with harsh criticism. But experience shows that consistency with regard to a position that has its own internal logic can help, even if in the beginning it seems hopeless.

Most importantly, even if this position is not actually adopted, the campaign around it will raise the public and moral status of the decisions taken by those international bodies. Just as one of the great advantages of the Israel Defense Forces' anti-terror offensives is that the terrorists are then forced them to focus on defending themselves, it is reasonable to assume that mounting an offensive, especially if it does not come only from Israelis, against the image of the humanitarian institutions of the international community, will force them to devote at least some of their energies to apologetics with regard to their inclusion of non-democratic countries. It will also force them to consider with greater care the issues they take up and the decisions they make.

Community says charges `concocted' to intimidate Arab sector
By Yair Ettinger	| Mar. 5, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Arab spokesmen, including opponents of the Sons of the Village movement, said yesterday that the arrest of Mejad and Mohammed Kna'ane is a case of hounding a legitimate political movement.

There is near consensus among Arab-Israeli leadership that the security establishment and the state are concocting false accusations against political activists, primarily from the radical wing, to send a message to the Arab public.

Yesterday's announcement of the arrest of the Kna'ane brothers reminded the Arab community of the indictment and trial of Sheikh Ra'ed Salah and four members of the Islamic Movement, who have been held for 10 months, and the recent arrest of two members of the Balad movement, Assan and Sirhan Athamla.

The chairman of the Higher Arab Monitoring Committee, Shauki Khatib, is convinced that the charges against the Kna'anes are "political." He said there is a connection between a series of recent attacks against Arab residents of Haifa, that was revealed yesterday, and the arrest of the Kna'ane brothers, which is intended "to prove the delegitimization of the Arab population and its leadership, hoping to stain the Arab population."

After the arrest of Sheikh Ra'ed, a forum comprising non-profit organizations and Arab political movements, the National Committee for the Defense of Al-Aqsa Prisoners, was created and organized a number of demonstrations. The forum announced yesterday that it is changing its name to the Committee for the Defense of Freedoms, and will focus on informing those abroad about the Israeli leadership's "political chase" of Arab citizens.

The Sons of the Village movement announced yesterday that the arrests and "fabricated charges are part of a growing attack by the apartheid racist rulers against the Arab population."

The task of the ethicist
Contrary to the view espoused by the philosopher Asa Kasher ("Those who cry with one eye," Haaretz, Feb. 29), the occupation is not a matter of a Palestinian "narrative." The occupation is not a story of one side or a story of another side. The occupation is a fact.

Contrary to the view espoused by the philosopher Asa Kasher ("Those who cry with one eye," Haaretz, Feb. 29), the occupation is not a matter of a Palestinian "narrative." The occupation is not a story of one side or a story of another side. The occupation is a fact.

For nearly two-thirds of its existence, Israel has chosen to be an occupying power. The heart of the matter, the "problem," is its choice to hold on to Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip as occupied territories. Moreover, Israel chose not only military occupation but moved a million of its ethnic citizens into the territories and thereby turned it into an apartheid zone. The Jewish ethnic group has civil rights, the others do not. Occupation and apartheid are never ethical.

The reality that Israel has chosen for nearly two-thirds of its existence is not compatible with an ethical humanist world, but with the status of the "ger toshav" - the "resident stranger" - the precept regarding the existence of non-Jews in the Holy Land as despised subjects with no rights, and not as citizens. Even if the ethicist has embraced this approach, there is no reason for him to drag ethics into it.

Even for those who believe in the divine Israeli hold on extensive territories - which must be in Israel's hands, even those between the Euphrates and the Tigris - only one somewhat legitimate path is open, which is to grant civil rights to all the strangers residing in the coveted area. Having failed to do this, Israel was obliged to leave the area immediately. Either full citizenship or withdrawal. There is and never was a third ethical path. Israel chose not to do this. Even in "unified" Jerusalem, the non-Jews did not receive citizenship, only permanent residency. "Resident strangers."

It's not a matter of quantity. The occupation is not justified in absolute terms. Not as a security means, either. An occupation with apartheid cannot exist for even one day, even one hour; certainly not for 37 years.

So thoroughly has the occupation corrupted Kasher, apparently, that from where he sits the "left" seems to him to think that the end of the occupation means the end of terrorism. As though the hypothetical left, too, must be afflicted with an ethnic-based utilitarian morality - as though occupation must be stopped only so others will leave us alone, and not because the occupation is not ethically possible.

In this connection, the Israeli left has, indeed, gone astray, but differently. The root of the moral problem lies in the slogan "territories for peace," which had its genesis during the period of the negotiations with Egypt. Sinai is, indeed, territory; but Judea, Samaria and Gaza are not "territories." Some 3.5 million Palestinians live there. The Israeli ethnic ear hears the Palestinian extortion latent in the slogan: We will be given peace only if we get out of the territories. However, the real extortion here is the reverse of this. Until the Palestinians don't agree to peace, and on our terms, we will continue to occupy them, and by means of an occupation accompanied by ethnic apartheid.

Yes, leaving the territories will also contribute to Israeli ethnic security. Yes, the "enlightened" world of occupation, nongranting of civil rights and the creation of a regime in which the Jews have rights and others don't, preceded the first intifada by 20 years. But that's not the point. Even as a means of security, there was not and never will be ethical justification for the occupation.

What, then, is the ethicist to do, and especially one who is in charge, from his perspective, of the unchanging military ethical values? What is the ethicist who advises the Israel Defense (!) Forces to do? There is only one thing for the ethicist to do. To make it clear to the chiefs of the army that, ethically, they must demand from the country's leaders the immediate termination of the abnormal and unethical situation of occupation and apartheid.

Once that situation has ceased to exist, even technical matters, which are so important to Kasher, will become simpler. The terrorist will no longer be intermixed with the State of Israel. Citizens and noncitizens will no longer live in physical proximity that privatizes terrorism, and the warplanes will not be sent into territory for which Israel is responsible.

The so-called ethicist, who instead of calling for the end of the occupation has chosen a different route and offers "ethical" technical advise to the occupation, is going far beyond his professional field and appears to be entering the world of a "priest anointed for war," whose mission is to direct Israel in the wars of commandment of its holy conquests.

In a debate on the Camp David Agreement in the Knesset, Menachem Begin tweaked Moshe Shamir, the writer. We know you are not a historian, he said to Shamir, but not a historian on such a scale? True, Kasher's world is familiar to a large public, but still, not a philosopher on such a scale?

The writer is the author of "The Messiah's Donkey."

From Gaza to Yad Eliyahu
It's safe to assume that when the cabinet weighed the pros and cons of assassinating Hamas' Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, little consideration was given to Israel's fragile status in the arena of international sport.

It's safe to assume that when the cabinet weighed the pros and cons of assassinating Hamas' Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, little consideration was given to Israel's fragile status in the arena of international sport. Power-brokers in world sport are not sympathetic to Israel's continued occupation of the Palestinian territories, and they roundly ignore what could be taken as mitigating circumstances.

Since World War II, international sporting associations generally, and ones in Europe in particular, have faithfully conformed to political stances taken by the Common Market nations and later by the European Union. In following this policy, the associations have purported to take the high moral ground. Thus, for four-and-a-half decades they joined the boycott against South Africa, in response to its system of apartheid.

In 1992, 10 days before the European Cup soccer competition, Yugoslavia was expelled from the tournament due to its civil war. Still, this policy of political correctness has had its limits, as is demonstrated by sports associations' habit of overlooking Russia's actions in Chechnya.

In the mid-'70s, Israel was disqualified from Asia's sport associations. Then, after wandering between the continents, its sporting associations were invited to Europe as a goodwill gesture in 1992. Today the Europeans never miss a chance to make clear that unless Israel significantly changes its policies toward the Palestinians, a way will be found to harm Israel's basic rights.

At first, this stance does not reflect European sports associations as a whole, and is instead an attitude displayed by soccer and basketball clubs from Italy and Spain. In actual fact, however, Israel is barred from hosting competitions in 27 of the 28 branches of organized sport in Europe (basketball is the lone exception). This week it became clear that European basketball has joined the boycott. Pamesa Valencia did not show for a European League game, and the fate of Final Four games in Tel Aviv hangs in the balance.

Terror poses a threat throughout Europe. Organizers of the Athens Olympics, scheduled for this summer, do not know how to deal with the Chechen threat to Russia, or Kurdish threats to Greece (resulting from Greece's involvement in Ocalan's extradition to Turkey). Europe does not want to deal with Palestinian terror; it has enough on its hands already, dealing with threats posed by militant Islamic groups.

Israel's government has yet to come to grips with this reality. Whoever believes that the involvement of Education, Culture and Sport Minister Limor Livnat will do something to change the general trend is mistaken. Europe's sporting institutions recoil from such ministerial meddling, especially when it comes from those who assassinate in the morning, and then in the evening send letters imploring, "Don't harm us."

Israeli sport organizers are now being met with polite smiles, and adamant refusals. The convenient excuse that Israel is unsafe dovetails perfectly with Europe's political stance with regard to the dispute in this region.

In itself, the definition as to what constitutes a "safe site" for sports can prompt ridicule, in light (for example) of circumstances in Madrid. Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has in the past threatened to dismiss any manager who doesn't take forthright action to forestall losses. "I don't like cowards," he declared. But when his one of his country's clubs refused to come to Israel for a match against Hapoel Tel Aviv in the UEFA Cup quarterfinals, he did nothing to intervene. Milan's official explanation was fear.

U.S. lawyer files lawsuit over sales of art seized by Nazis
By The Associated Press	| Apr. 1, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
VIENNA - Using a musty bank vault as a backdrop, a prominent American lawyer announced Thursday he was filing a $1 billion lawsuit on behalf of Holocaust victims whose precious artworks were stolen by the Nazis and sold off after World War II.

Edward D. Fagan, a New York-based attorney who has fought for reparations for American blacks who are descendants of slaves and for victims of South Africa's apartheid system, said the suit would be filed later Thursday in U.S. District Court in New York.

The suit, brought by a new group calling itself the Association of Holocaust Victims for the Restitution of Artwork and Masterpieces, calls on two leading Austrian banks, the Austrian government and Sotheby's auction house to return paintings and other works allegedly sold without the permission of their original Jewish owners.

"Not one painting has been restored - not one," Fagan said, contending the missing artworks include paintings by Monet, Cezanne, Delacroix and other Impressionist masters. "These victims are suing to recover their property."

The plaintiffs, who were not identified by name, were said to include several dozen families, mostly Jews, from Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary, Germany, Israel, Poland, Switzerland, the United States and other countries.

Their suit, alleging "the systematic theft of great artwork, masterpieces and collections," seeks between $100 million and $1 billion in damages if the artworks - valued at between $2 million and $5 million apiece - cannot be returned.

"We would like the paintings back, but the likelihood is not so good," Fagan said.

At a press conference in a Vienna cafe, Fagan showed reporters a sketch he said was drawn by an unidentified former employee of Bank Austria/Creditanstalt, purportedly showing the location of a secret vault concealed beneath a trap door that once contained priceless paintings unclaimed after the war.

He then led several dozen journalists on a walk to the bank's nearby headquarters, where flustered officials agreed to unlock the cellar and open several vaults. None contained anything more than old books and dusty boxes of documents and files.

Nonplussed, Fagan said he never expected to see artworks, which he contended were sold off by Sotheby's and other auction houses with the complicity of Bank Austria/Creditanstalt, Erste Bank and the Austrian government, which he said issued export licenses allowing the works to leave the country.

The works' rightful owners, he said, were mostly Jews who perished in the Holocaust.

Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, one year before the war began in Europe.

"We are accusing the banks of engaging in the trafficking of stolen Holocaust artwork," Fagan said. "It's not sufficient to say, 'We don't have anything.' A New York court is going to say, 'Well, you've got something - show me."' The 16-page lawsuit alleges that the banks "developed systems and schemes through which they collected, took title to and/or profited from artwork ... which the defendant Austrian banks knew, had reason to know and/or upon the exercise of reasonable diligence could have discovered were stolen from Holocaust victims."

Bank Austria, which recently merged with Creditanstalt, paid $45 million in 1999 to settle a lawsuit brought by Fagan on behalf of Jews whose gold and other financial assets were stolen by the Nazis and allegedly fell into the bank's hands after the war.

Spokesman Peter Thier said the bank was eager to cooperate in any way and show it does not possess artworks or other valuables seized by the Nazis. He said the bank was working closely with an independent historical commission set up in the mid-1990s to handle claims by victims of Nazi looting.

"We have no problem with exposing the truth. We want to be as transparent as possible," Thier said, conceding that if proof exists that the bank was involved in illegal sales of artwork, "it would be a catastrophe."

Fagan said the 1999 suit did not cover artwork, which he insisted was "intentionally excluded" by Austrian officials.

"Either we were defrauded in the prior cases or they simply forgot about this," he said. "But tell me: How in God's name do you forget about a vault?"

A respected Austrian newspaper, Der Standard, reported Thursday that one of the disputed masterpieces is "Mount Sinai," an oil by El Greco that surfaced a decade ago at an open market in Vienna, only to disappear until it was auctioned by Sotheby's for $5 million five years ago.

Fagan said he was pressing the Austrian government for a list of export licenses issued for all paintings that left the country between 1945 and 1998. He told The Associated Press he also was in contact with the U.S. Justice Department and the White House about possible involvement.

We're from the UN

"Ithrew the newspaper in the first trash basket I saw. The entire front page, as well as two other pages, was about the entertainer Dieudonne. When will they stop already with this saga?" wrote a Liberation reader in a letter to the editor in early March. The editors responded to her request and lowered the profile of this story, but the editor emphasized: "One may regret this dispute, but it exists." What exactly is it all about?

This is another debate - certainly not the last - on the issue of an artist's freedom of expression versus the exploitation of this freedom to disseminate anti-Semitic statements. In recent years, another component has entered into this debate: Do harsh condemnations of Zionism, the State of Israel, its policies and leaders constitute anti-Semitic defamation, or are they liable to be perceived as such?

The latest round in France started last December 1. Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala, who is best known as Dieudonne ("God provides"), was a guest on Marc-Olivier Fogiel's aptly named television program "On Ne Peut Pas Plaire a Tout le Monde" (You Can't Please Everybody") on France 3, a public channel. He burst into the studio in a uniform, wearing an ultra-Orthodox hat and sidelocks, and made a stiff-armed Nazi salute, saying "IsraHeil." He later called upon the viewers to join "the Axis of Good: the American-Zionist Axis."

The station received hundreds of messages denouncing this performance, but the host did not react immediately. The following day, Fogiel apologized, but the comedian was unrepentant: "I'm not sorry for what I did," Dieudonne told French journalists, who reported at length about the new scandal. The Anti-Defamation League also submitted a complaint about racist slander.

Some time later, the entertainer struck again. In an interview with the Journal du Dimanche, he blamed the "Jewish leagues" with disturbing a performance he gave in Lyon. "They are all slave traders who turned to banking or the entertainment business and now to terror activities." In his view, CRIF, the Jewish umbrella organization in France, is nothing more than a "mafia organization." But he still insisted that he is not an anti-Semite. How could this be possible? he asks. After all, he himself is black (his father is from Cameroon) and he has battled racism all his life.

Of the three large newspapers in France, only one - the right-wing Le Figaro, which is usually balanced in its reporting on Israel - confined itself to brief reports on the developments in the affair. But on its Web site, it devoted a forum to the question of "Is it permissible to joke about everything?" Only a few readers joined the forum.

On the other hand, the two other newspapers, Le Monde and Liberation, which are identified with the left and are very critical of Israel's policies, published articles for and against, and reported feverishly on the affair. Indeed, the problem this case presented was their problem as well: Is it possible to separate a denunciation of Israel, which became a sort of moral obligation, from anti-Semitism?

The major newspapers cannot be charged with being anti-Semitic. They are very careful not to make mistakes and will not allow any malicious articles to appear in their pages. They report often on attacks against Jews and Jewish institutions, thoroughly condemning these attacks. Le Figaro published a long interview with President Moshe Katsav at the end of February, entitled "France is not anti-Semitic" - a pronouncement Katsav made during his visit to Paris. Le Monde warned against "removing the taboo" on anti-Semitism in French society, but said at the same time that it was "desirable and necessary" to criticize Sharon's policies, and that there is nothing anti-Semitic in this criticism.

The Dieudonne case, therefore, is directly related to the internal debate that is apparently being conducted within these newspapers: How far is it possible to go in criticizing Israel without being exposed to the charge that such criticism presents an anti-Semitic tone of demonization or encourages the hatred of Jews?

This story did not end with the comedian's wretched performance on television and the reactions it engendered, which were mostly negative. Dieudonne was forced to cancel a number of his one-man shows, especially at the famed Olympia Hall in Paris, because of the numerous threats he received via telephone and fax. The owners of the hall, in consultation with the police, decided that the performances could not be held due security considerations.

On February 20, several hundred people gathered outside the Olympia to protest against the attack against the freedom of artistic expression. Dieudonne delivered a speech there and presented himself as a "defender of the blacks." In an interview with the Europe 1 radio station, he said: "They are prohibiting me from working. It is very difficult today to criticize Israel. This is a fact. You cannot do it. I'm not anti-Semitic. I'm not a racist." He explained to a newspaper reporter that he has a problem with Israel because it "gave complete support for the apartheid regime in South Africa."

Le Monde and Liberation gave wide coverage to the demonstration, and again published articles about the comedian's career (including his bid for the French parliament several years ago). These two newspapers also published letters to the editor that expressed a variety of interesting views on the Dieudonne affair.

A number of well-known entertainers in France expressed reservations about Dieudonne, saying that he acted foolishly and in a confusing and megalomaniac way. His former partner, the Jewish comedian Elie Semoun, published a personal letter to his friend in Liberation. (The duo separated in 1997 after achieving great success, especially with their skit "Cohen and Bokassa," in which the comedians cast racist aspersions on one another.)

Semoun wrote in his letter: "You are not the same Dieudonne I knew - talent is not an excuse for everything and there are short sentences that are incendiary." This response came several days after a long letter from Dieudonne's mother, a sociologist, which denounced the "Judeo-centrism" of "extremist Zionist groups." She admitted in the letter that her son's television performance "was not successful in its form, but not because of its content."

What was the role of the newspapers this time? In general, they acted like UN observers, publishing responses for and against the cancellation of Dieudonne's performances. Unlike the clear stance they took against the television incident, they avoided stating an opinion in the debate on freedom of speech. The Jewish philosopher Alain Finkielkraut denounced those who had made the anonymous threats that led to the cancellation of the shows, noting that they had succeeded in turning Dieudonne into a "martyr." Liberation's acerbic media critic, Daniel Schneidermann, concurred: "Dieudonne and Mel Gibson were censored in France because they attacked the Jews: This is the message you'll hear from the anti-Semitic monster with 1,000 ears - the one that still believes, for example, that the Jews in the Twin Towers received advance notice of the attack."

In summary, an anti-Semitic comedian - perhaps a fool, but certainly full of hatred - wants to continue his public performances. People who were hurt by his words demand that he not be allowed to perform and threaten to disrupt the show. The performances are canceled due to fears of public disorder. Who are these people issuing these threats? Jews, apparently. "Extremist Jews" who undoubtedly support the criminal policies of General Sharon. These bad people, who attack freedom of expression, thus influence the authorities and have free rein to do what they wish in France. They are the ones who are wrong.

Have the French newspapers contributed to this inference through their reporting? And if so, did they do this with malicious intention? Or is this interpretation just another expression of "historic Judeo-centrism?"

The writer is an Israeli television journalist.

The battle on America's campuses
Despite the feeling that anti-Israel sentiment is increasing at U.S. universities, it is unclear who's winning the war of words that has been waged there since the start of the intifada
By Nathan Guttman	| Apr. 4, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
WASHINGTON - A cream pie tossed in the face of an Israeli minister can sometimes express the distinction between a stormy ideological struggle of students and an outburst of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic protest. This is what Jewish campus activists learned during the past year, as Minister Natan Sharansky completed a tour of American universities. The cream pie (purchased from a kosher bakery!) that was thrown at Sharansky as he walked onto the stage at Rutgers University in New Jersey last September marked a significant turning point in the battle for the campuses. Sharansky returned shaken by his visit to the United States. "It was a battlefield," he said about his experience in newspaper articles he wrote. "This is truly frightening," he added, describing the campuses as a hothouse for anti-Israeli sentiment and calling on Jewish students to wake up and fight back.

More than six months later, the pie thrower, Abe Greenhouse, looks back a bit surprised on the storm he created. He says he simply wanted "to draw attention to the fact that Sharansky, in his actions as a cabinet member, caused a significant regression in the peace process." He adds that he is not anti-Israeli, does not support demonstrations and is even considering moving to Israel in the future.

The Sharansky incident directed considerable attention to what is happening on American campuses. The Jewish activists say that the minister overreacted. If anything has changed at American universities during the past few years, they say, it has actually been a strengthening of Jews and Israel supporters. However, it is difficult to ignore the many demonstrations and incidents that make the lives of Jewish supporters of Israel on campuses a little less pleasant. Sometimes they have to pass through a "checkpoint" erected by pro-Palestinian activists to demonstrate the hardships Israel imposes on the residents of the territories. Other times they may come up against a large "wall" placed in the middle of the campus to protest the separation fence Israel is building in the West Bank. And more than once they have heard lecturers speak about "Zionist colonialism" or "the genocide Israel is conducting in the territories."

Rutgers University in New Jersey is a good example of the hardcore anti-Israeli approach in college campuses. The pie tossed at Sharansky may have been a freak event, but the statements of pro-Palestinian activists on campus create considerable discomfort among Jews and supporters of Israel.

Charlotte Kates is the head of a Palestine solidarity group at Rutgers. She believes with all her heart that Israel has no right to exist. In her view, Israel is an apartheid state, with a racist and colonialist character. An article she wrote expressing these views, generated protest demonstrations by Jewish activists on campus. "I don't think there is anything anti-Semitic in opposing racism and apartheid," Kates explains. "It is manipulative and repulsive to say that this is anti-Semitism, because Zionism is racism and opposing racism is the same as opposing anti-Semitism."

Paula Rizzuto, another member of the Palestine solidarity group at Rutgers, argues that the charges of anti-Semitism are merely an attempt to muzzle the pro-Palestinian activists. "We feel that the university administration is giving in to Zionist pressure and suppressing us," she says.

The Jewish leadership in the United States regards these sort of statements, like the signs hung by the Rutgers solidarity group calling for "A Palestinian state from the river to the sea," as a classic example of the new anti-Semitism. Denial of the Jewish state's right to exist, support for its destruction and double standards toward the Jews and their actions are the main components of this phenomenon.

On the first day of the deliberations in The Hague on the separation fence in February, Kates and her friends in the Rutgers solidarity organization erected a "mock" wall on one of the designated "free speech" areas of campus. They hung Palestinian flags and distributed manifestos against Israel's policies and the separation fence. In the evening, they screened a video photographed by an activist from the International Solidarity Movement who had participated in demonstrations against the fence on site in the West Bank. On the last evening before spring break, they held a gathering called Intifada Cafe with hip-hop artists singing political songs in support of the Palestinian struggle.

The Rutgers activists perhaps represent the extreme margins of the pro-Palestinian movement on campuses. When they asked to host the last annual conference of the solidarity movement, it became apparent that the central stream of Palestine supporters on campuses feels uncomfortable with the non-recognition of Israel's right to exist. In the end, there was a split in the movement and two parallel conferences were held - one at Rutgers and the other at Ohio State University. (Kates blames the split on "Zionist forces" that tried to sabotage the conference from the very start.)

No longer taboo

Anti-Israel activism on campus has changed in recent years. In the past, the struggle was led by foreign students from Arab and Muslim countries. But now white Americans are taking the lead on many campuses. For them, Zionism is simply a case of racism. Anti-Israeli talk on campus today draws a straight line between Israel and colonialism, American imperialism, the oppression of minorities and South African apartheid. The Palestinians, on the other hand, are the dark-skinned natives who are being exploited and oppressed. This is why Gary Tobin, a prominent Jewish researcher in San Francisco, has recommended that the State of Israel stop sending middle-aged white men to present Israel's case on campuses. Instead, he says, Israel should send dark-skinned Sephardim in order to counter the charges of racism leveled against Israel.

There are currently about 65,000 students from Arab countries studying at American universities. According to Jewish sources, these students comprise the "foot soldiers" for the struggle, while the Americans, or Arab-Americans, are the leaders of the anti-Israeli activities. Most of the pro-Palestinian student organizations also take pride in having prominent Jewish activists who oppose Israel's policies in the territories.

"We are no longer dealing with the blunt anti-Semitism that we saw in the past," says William Rothschild, associate national director of education at the Anti-Defamation League. "It's no longer a case of here they tore off a mezuzah, there they wrote graffiti saying `dirty Jew.' Now we are seeing political anti-Semitism."

Another Jewish source argues that the campus movements opposing Israel are, in fact, not anti-Semitic, but that some of the members of these movements - extreme leftists and Muslim extremists - do not see all expressions of anti-Semitism as taboo.

Jonathan Kessler of AIPAC (American Israel Political Action Committee) says that Jews also make imprecise use of the term anti-Semitism. "Everyone gets all excited from one swastika that one idiot painted, but there is also anti-Semitism used as a political tool by the anti-Israeli groups, which aims to keep people from supporting Israel." Thus, for example, when the newspaper of Illinois University writes, "the Jews control America," the goal is actually to dissuade Jews from getting involved in politics and the public debate.

Swastika, checkpoint and jihad

Not everyone regards anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist expressions, blatant as they may be, as evidence of anti-Semitism on campuses. Avraham Infeld, president of the Hillel organization, says that most of the activity that he and his staff witness is directed against the policies of the Israeli government and not against the state's right to exist. "I can't call this anti-Semitism," he says. Infeld, who wears a kippa and is the first Israeli chosen to head the organization, says that Jewish students are sometimes frightened by anti-Israeli statements and see them as anti-Semitic. As evidence, he presented research data showing that 30 percent of Jews on campuses say there is anti-Semitism at their universities, but only 5 percent say they have personally encountered anti-Semitism. On the other hand, the statistics compiled by the Anti-Defamation League show a steady rise in expressions of anti-Semitism on American campuses in recent years.

The problem is apparently one of definition. Lists of anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic incidents pile up on the desk of Jewish campus organizations every week. Some of these incidents are clearly anti-Semitic and some are blatantly anti-Israel, while others fall into the category of the new, or political, anti-Semitism.

Here is a random sample of incidents: at the University of California at Riverside, an exhibition included signs drawing an equation between a swastika and Star of David; at Wooster College in Ohio, a guest lecturer spoke about the Protocols of the Elders of Zion as if they were real documents; at the American University in Washington, a checkpoint was built on campus and students were forced to go around it; at UCLA, a guest lecturer spoke of jihad; at University of Indiana's law school, many flags are displayed, including the Palestinian flag, but Israel's flag is absent; at Contra Costa College in California, a series of lectures were given by anti-Israeli speakers; at Northwestern in Illinois, swastikas were painted throughout the campus nine times during the past year. And the list continues.

Indeed, there is almost no major campus that has not experienced some incidents directed against Israel or Jews. But not all campuses are the same. Anti-Israel activity is most prominent at those known as bastions of the left or those with large concentrations of Arab students.

While Rutgers in New Jersey is the scene of broad anti-Israeli activity, the University of Maryland is an example of a campus where Israel supporters rule. Some 6,000 Jewish students study at Maryland and Jewish organization on campus is strong. Stories of campus anti-Semitism are foreign to them. The local branch of AIPAC is active on campus and the students can be seen strolling the campus in T-shirts proclaiming support for Israel (a gift of a local Jewish philanthropist). The star of the women's basketball team, Shay Doron, is an Israeli and her fans come to games with Israeli flags. "We're lucky," says Ilana Kieffer, a student at the university. "We're lucky because there is no pro-Palestinian threat, and because we're big and strong."

But even in this pro-Israel stronghold in Maryland some incidents occur. Last month, a freshman student declared in class that he does not agree that his taxes will be used to finance Israel's activities. He then turned to a Jewish student sitting next to him and told her: "Israel should not exist. I wish all the Jews would die." The teaching assistant who was running the class called for a recess and the Jewish students filed out of the classroom shaken by the incident. With the intervention of the Hillel organization, the student was asked to apologize for what he said and he did so in front of the entire class.

They're not soldiers

But the central question on campuses today is how to respond. Is it best to follow Sharansky's call and fight against the anti-Israel expressions on campus, or is it better to ignore them and not be dragged into provocations? The students at the University of Maryland say that while the focus should be on positive initiatives, the arena should not be left to the Palestinians. Thus, for example, when Palestine supporters on campus organized an anti-Israel rally outside the building where United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan was speaking, the Jews quickly assembled dozens of activists for a pro-Israel counter-rally.

"That's not the way to win," says AIPAC's Jonathan Kessler, who has spent most of his professional life training young Jewish leaders. "Whoever thinks you need to argue with them doesn't understand American society. It's idiotic to respond to every theatrical act of anti-Zionism." In Kessler's view, the only way to win is to ignore the activities of the pro-Palestinians and focus on strengthening the friendship between the U.S. and Israel. "The problem isn't with one guy who throws a pie at Sharansky's face. The problem is with the alarmed response to it," he says.

Hillel's Avraham Infeld concurs with this approach: "The State of Israel expects the Jewish student to be a soldier in the battle. This is an unjustified expectation that demonstrates a lack of understanding."

In fact, many of the Jewish students are not at all interested in the battle being waged. About 280,000 Jews are studying this year at universities in the U.S. and only about one-third of them are connected with Jewish or pro-Israel organizations. Infeld blames this on the system of Jewish education in the U.S. that gives the message that Judaism is something you are involved in only up until your bar mitzvah. After the age of 13, the study of Judaism and Israel is neglected to the point of being almost nonexistent. Thus, tens of thousands of Jewish students arrive at American universities with no connection to the Jewish community and with no interest in joining efforts to support Israel's cause.

So, who's winning?

Most activists agree that despite the impression that Israel is being defeated and that Jewish students are under assault, the opposite is true. Dozens of campuses throughout the U.S. have signed up thousands of students on petitions of support for Israel, and pro-Israel activists have been elected in recent months to key positions at many universities. In fact, the public discourse at campuses leans in Israel's favor.

Those with long-term experience in this area explain that the impression that the Arabs have gained the upper hand stems from the fact that pro-Palestinian activities dropped off in the 1990s following the Oslo Accords. Now that these activities have returned to their previous level, they seem more frightening. In fact, Jewish activists note, opponents of Israel have been active on campuses for over 50 years, including both ultra-liberal professors and Arab student activists.

Nonetheless, the friendship between Israel and the U.S. grows stronger from year to year. The large student organizations have all adopted pro-Israel resolutions and Israel's opponents, as vocal as they may be, do not enjoy the same numerical support. The battle is apparently far from over, but besides some unpleasantries, Israel and the Jews can definitely withstand it.

Studies sponsored by the Saudis

The situation is more complicated when it comes to university faculty. Dana Kalfas, a Jewish student at the University of Maryland, tells about an international relations class in which the lecturer spoke about the United Nations and said the following about Israel: "We don't know how many people are being slaughtered there, it's an apartheid state." Hanan Weisman, another Maryland student, participated in a class in ethnic music in which the lecturer declared that Israel is a colonialist, occupying power.

Research conducted by the Institute for Jewish and Community Research in San Francisco, whose findings are published here for the first time, indicates that the attitude of faculty members to the Middle East conflict constitutes the main problem facing Jews and supporters of Israel in the United States.

"Anti-Israelism is a rooted ideology in the education system and it is crucial to deal with it now," says institute president Gary Tobin after two years of monitoring universities and schools in the United States. According to Tobin, the situation in the U.S. today is similar to that of Europe 30 years ago and which led Europe to eventually adopt anti-Israel positions.

The study found that the American curriculum on the Middle East, from middle school through university, is largely based on learning materials originating from Arab countries and that institutes for Middle East studies are financed by Arab states and Muslim entities whose main goal is to delegitimize Israel. "This is an organized campaign to buy the hearts of the American students," Tobin says. The impact of this campaign is already apparent, Tobin explains. The study found that among young Americans of ages 14-21, the use of stereotypes and prejudices against Jews had increased and that the trend of improved attitudes toward Jews (which began at the end of World War II) had been halted.

Unlike the arguments on campus between supporters and opponents of Israel, in which the Jewish students fell free to speak their minds, it is difficult for them to confront a lecturer or professor who espouses anti-Israeli theories. Dana Kalfas of the University of Maryland says that when an anthropology lecturer denounced Israel for bringing Diaspora Jews to settle in the Palestinian territories, she remained quiet. "After all, it's a big class, and he is a senior professor, so I didn't feel comfortable to say what I feel."

Gary Tobin argues in his new study that the Arab agenda has taken over the American curriculum and that despite the fact that Jews are among the largest contributors to universities, they are unaware of what is happening there and are not careful about using their money appropriately. Thus, school teachers are using learning materials funded by the Saudi Aramco company that describe how the Jews expelled the Palestinians and no one is providing materials to counter this claim. "The fact that schools and universities can be in such discord to the feelings of the American public, is something that we have to deal with," he says, noting that he is aware that his call could be misinterpreted as an invitation for government interference in academic freedom. "The real interference in academic freedom is using propaganda material instead of true research," he says in preemptive defense.

To forgive and to remember
Contrary to its name, `Love,' Toni Morrison's new novel, describes hatred in a world where women are the weakest link. A conversation with the Nobel Prize laureate on memory and reconciliation, peace and revenge, survival skills and ghosts.
By Shiri Lev-Ari	| Apr. 11, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
NEW YORK - No. 240 is located on a very neglected street, in the southern part of Manhattan. In its size and its splendor, the building stands out on the rather dirty industrial block planted between Chinatown and Soho. Two black lion statues adorn the building's exterior, and upon entering, there are colorful carpets, wide stairwells and two doormen speaking very quietly between themselves. Does Ms. Morrison live here? "Yes, absolutely," replies one of them. Apartment 6D is opened by a woman in a blue kerchief, her gray-white hair gathered beneath it. She is large, slow-moving, chain-smoking; her deep, hoarse and resounding voice fills the room.

She offers her hand to be shaken, and then ascends heavily to the second floor to conclude a phone conversation. "My son is hospitalized, he doesn't feel well," she sighs, sitting in the large armchair. "I'm worried. I'll go visit him later." She lowers the volume of the music playing in the background - a CD of world music. Statues and African masks and a lot of wood furniture are scattered all around. A high chair stands next to a wooden reading stand, surrounded by many books. Despite the building's grand facade, the apartment itself is simple, functional, not particularly large, not ostentatious: It has no large windows overlooking all of Manahattan, and no newfangled electronic gadgets.

This is the home of Toni Morrison, the African-American writer who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993, author of the book "Beloved," for which she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. Morrison has a special status in America. The first black woman writer to win a Nobel Prize, she showed millions of readers the world over the disastrous meaning of slavery in the lives of blacks in America, and her bestselling books are studied in schools and researched in universities. Morrison, who over the years has turned into a spokeswoman of race and gender, today enjoys celebrity status. Her good friend is popular television presenter Oprah Winfrey, who produced "Beloved" as a film. Morrison's 70th birthday party was attended by such personalities as Hillary Clinton and Kofi Annan. People look up to her, read her regularly, await her next book.

Reservations about the war

It is therefore not surprising to find her behaving like a celebrity. She won't devote more than an hour to a newspaper interview, because in an hour a driver in a shiny black car will be waiting for her downstairs to take her to a lunch date. She agreed to this one hour only after demanding information about the interviewer, and after reading several of the questions, to decide whether it was worth the effort.

In her living room she confirms that the interview is taking place in honor of her new book, "Love," which was published in the United States last October and will soon be published in Hebrew. Despite its name, the novel depicts hatred. In March 2004, when New York is the scene of protest demonstrations against the war in Iraq, and the city is still very much influenced by the trauma of 9/11, discussion of the subject seems more pertinent than ever. And in fact, Morrison talks about hatred and love in social and political contexts as well.

About a year ago, Morrison expressed reservations about the war. "When there are no political means, only the bullet remains," she said at the time in an interview. Today she says, "My feeling is that cultures and nations that are clashing - they're doing the easiest thing. Murder and killing is the easiest thing to do. The language of reconciliation, the language of peace, is understood as not having the strength, as not sexy, not adventuresome, not strong. The language of war - Churchill, all the poetry, the epics and sagas are about war and death and honor and so on. Maybe it had to be that way to get people to go and fight and die. But it looks to me that the language of Gandhi, of Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela - is the real language of humanity. It's understood by those who want to live in peace. It's the strongest language. That language got us to the civil rights movement. It called upon the best parts of other people. It's demanding the best parts of ourselves."

From slavery to freedom

For Morrison, the past is never over. Dead people and ghosts are permanent features in her novels. This is most evident in "Beloved," which tells about a mother who murdered her baby daughter as a last act of independence before the child is taken into slavery as well, but her ghost returns and arises from the dead. This murder comes up again in the opera written by Morrison based on the true story of Margaret Garner, which will soon be performed.

Doesn't there come a time when one should forget the past so that it won't continue to dominate humanity? "`Beloved' represents a brutal past that was not confronted in the literature. Sethe is very busy forgetting the past. There is a very big danger in being clutched by the past, and there is a big danger in escaping it. The job is to look at the past and take from it what is useful to go forward. Not to ignore it, not to be entrapped by it, but to use one's intelligence and instincts for progress. And try not to repeat it - you already know what it's like. Just don't do it. I understand it was extremely important to the first and second generations of freed ex-slaves not to dwell on the past, it would just paralyze them. And so they did not pass on these stories. But the third, fourth and fifth generations needed to learn about the past in order to go on."

Morrison warns against restoring the past. "Forgive and remember is more my slogan. My model for that is South Africa. The whole notion of speaking to your torturer or your killer, hearing them confess, and then not requiring punishment, is a brand new example of human enterprise. I've seen some of these things take place. What do you want? To get them punished? Do you want justice? The other way of reacting - which is forgive and remember - does this service to the dead. But don't repeat it by killing. I always thought the death penalty is not useful. People who murder routinely get used to it, they become more and more interested in death, and also interested in their own death. So you can't really punish them by killing them."

Morrison sees the transition from slavery to freedom, which blacks and Jews have in common, as a kind of common fate. Her book "Beloved," dedicated to the "Sixty million and more" (a reference to the number of slaves who died during the Atlantic crossing from Africa to America) implies an association with the memory of the Holocaust. She says that black Americans and Jewish Americans share "a very close and intimate fate, there were moments when people talked about black anti-Semitism. That relationship is so close I suppose it's not a good idea to take it for granted." Morrison says that the conflict that took place several years ago between Jews and blacks in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn is an exception, since the blacks involved in the conflict were from the West Indies - they were not veteran African-Americans. She adds that she doesn't even know whether any pure blacks remain in the United States, and says that there may be only 50 people in the entire country without any mixed blood.

A writer thanks to her divorce

Morrison, 73, divides her time between her Manhattan apartment and her house on the Hudson River, in New York's Rockland County. (The house burned down about 10 years ago, and has since been rebuilt.) She is divorced and the mother of two sons, Ford, an architect, and Slade, an artist. When she was 27 years old she married Jamaican architect Harold Morrison, whom she divorced after six years, when she was pregnant with their second son. She once said in an interview that had there been no divorce, she wouldn't have become a writer but would have continued being a wife, and would have drowned her frustration by reading books. She has never remarried; in interviews she has said that several times she was about to get married, but "something stupid" prevented her from doing so.

She was born in 1931 in Lorain, Ohio as Chloe Wofford. At the age of 12 she was baptized, and added the middle name Anthony. In college her friend called her by her nickname, Toni, which has remained with her since then. After finishing high school she enrolled in Howard University in Washington, D.C., a prestigious black college ("I wanted to be surrounded by black intellectuals," she once said). In 1953 she went on to Cornell University, where she studied for her master's degree in American literature and wrote her doctoral dissertation on alienation in the works of William Faulkner and Virginia Woolf. In 1964 she began to work as an editor at Random House, and edited quite a number of books that later served as a basis for black studies, gender studies and post-colonialist studies. Since 1989 she has been teaching at Princeton - literature, African-American studies and creative writing.

Between her work as an editor and caring for her young children, Morrison used every free moment to write. Her first book, "The Bluest Eye," about a black girl who dreams of having blue eyes, was published in 1970, when Morrison was 39. After it came "Sula," "The Song of Solomon," "Tar Baby," and in 1987, "Beloved." Later she wrote "Jazz," "Paradise," and a book of essays, "Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Image," in which she defined white identity as a separate category formed in contrast to the black man. She has also written children's books, poetry, a play, a musical and an opera.

Morrison has no objection to labels, such as a "woman writer" or a "black writer." On the contrary, these are identities that enrich her, she says. She is in favor of affirmative action ("If the door is open you go in it; if you can't stand it they will put you out"). She leaves feminism to white women. In her writing she doesn't spare criticism of African-American society. She describes the class differences and the hierarchy of color in black society, murders, rapes, abuse and the breakup of the family unit. Her critics find her writing to be overly didactic, and too full of politics and social viewpoints. When she won the Nobel Prize some claimed that she had received it for reasons of political correctness and because of her race and gender, rather than for literary reasons. Morrison is sensitive to the subject: "It's important, the money is fabulous, but let's go on," she said in an interview several months ago.

Feminine power

Her new novel, "Love," tells the story of Bill Cosey, a middle-aged black man, who runs a hotel and resort for wealthy blacks during the first half of the 20th century. Cosey is a complex figure: He is charming and charismatic, but he operates out of perverted urges; he has a black identity, but he adopts the whites' rules, first and foremost by being bourgeois. His original sin, which causes his downfall and the disintegration of his family, is his marriage, after the death of his wife, to an 11-year-old girl, his granddaughter's best friend. From that moment, his child wife and his granddaughter become bitter enemies, and the love and friendship between them is abruptly terminated.

In the book, Morrison portrays the unfortunate manner in which social struggles clash with one another. In the war for black rights, for example, the women are harmed. In one of the scenes in the book, a civil rights worker rapes a young woman volunteer, but society doesn't punish him, in order not to undermine male brotherhood. The same is true of Bill Cosey's attempt to save an 11-year-old girl from a life of poverty: One hand builds up and the other destroys.

Will every social struggle to help one group of people necessarily harm another group? Morrison: "It's a symptom of all the social struggles: You fight, you win, and then what do you do? The thing to do when you win is to free somebody else. That's what freedom is about. It's easy to betray freedom, to become just interested in riches, acquisitions, power. Trying to remain a complex human being with all those temptations and also to hold other people's hands. After you get your freedom you open your hand."

The women in the book are the weakest social link. But she says it must be remembered that they are the ones who give Bill Cosey his power, and only toward the end do they understand that they helped him to invent himself. "The fight, the struggle, is for more freedom, not less. Bill Cosey represents that part of the black community that has flourished under an apartheid situation. They had a trapped clientele, the black lawyers, the black doctors, and they were ambivalent about the black civil rights movement, because its success would make it possible for their clients and their patients to go elsewhere. So there will be no neighborhood, because in those days the professional blacks lived next door to less wealthy blacks. There was a community, but after civil rights, blacks could be wherever they wished. So there is a class conflict, which I hope is parallel to the class differences between Christine and Heed in the novel."

How much free will does she give her characters? How much does she believe in free will? Morrison says that for her, a happy ending is when the characters in the book learn something they didn't know before, a kind of painful knowledge, a difficult blessing. They only seem to lose, but actually they win, because they learn something. "I think my imagination is stimulated by duress, how human beings manage under duress. For me their survival is extraordinary, this ability to do things, to tell themselves stories and lies, be creative about this, be insistent about that. If they figure out what the truth is - that's worth their life."

Showing the same heaviness with which she opened the door for me, Morrison gets out of the armchair. She has to go out for lunch, they're waiting for her. She stands in front of the mirror, straightens her blue kerchief, piles a few books, pamphlets and papers under her arm, and goes out to the hall. She locks the door while the elevator comes. Is she writing anything these days? She is, as a matter of fact, because there's a subject that looks interesting to her now, she answers briefly and doesn't continue.

ANC heads to another victory in South African polls
By Reuters	| Apr. 15, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's ruling African National Congress headed for another victory on Thursday as results trickled in from the country's third democratic elections since the end of apartheid.

The ANC looked certain to capitalize on its enduring appeal as the party that ended white rule in the continent's biggest economy, with a win taken for granted in Wednesday's vote.

The only questions were whether it would get the two-thirds parliamentary majority required to alter the constitution, and extend its control to all nine provincial governments.

The poll seemed to go smoothly overall but rival parties traded allegations of fraud and intimidation in KwaZulu-Natal where the ANC hopes to wrest control of the provincial government from the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).

Hundreds of troops were sent to hotspots and officials said some of the 20,000 police deployed in the province would help escort ballot boxes to the regional electoral office.

At a polling station in Umlazi, a KwaZulu-Natal township deeply polarized between IFP and ANC supporters, armed police escorted electoral officials away from a hostile crowd in the evening, Independent Electoral Commission officials said.

Police said they arrested 43 armed former soldiers on Tuesday night in the province's main city Durban as they apparently met to discuss plans to disrupt voting. They were charged with holding an illegal meeting and planning to disturb the peace.

With results in from just 2.5 percent of almost 17,000 polling stations, the ANC was leading with nearly 64 percent of votes. In second place with 22.35 percent was the Democratic Alliance, which hopes to consolidate its position as the main opposition party after getting less than 10 percent in 1999.

But analysts said those trends could change.

Long lines of people - one in Cape Town stretched for 3 km (2 miles) - waited for hours to vote, and polling was extended into the night in many polling stations to allow hundreds still queuing at the 9 p.m. (1900 GMT) cut-off to cast their ballots.

Some of the 20 million registered voters were prepared to queue up to 10 hours, confirming South Africans still cherish the right to vote 10 years after Nelson Mandela first swept the ANC to power in multiracial elections.

"I would like to vote but I've been waiting since nine o'clock this morning," said Obed Mlalatse, in his late 40s, as he waited on Wednesday evening to vote in Diepsloot, a ghetto of makeshift shacks outside the business capital Johannesburg.

"It's not good and we're getting a bit tired."

But with so few results in, it was unclear whether turnout would reach the 89 percent notched up in the last elections in 1999, when the ANC won just over 66 percent of the vote.

Voters were casting two ballots each, one for the national parliament and one for provincial assemblies.

The ANC remains overwhelmingly dominant in the absence of any party that rivals its appeal to black voters.

The former liberation movement hopes to win the only two provinces it does not control outright and grab a bigger majority despite chronic poverty, a 40 percent jobless rate and the scourge of AIDS affecting one in nine South Africans.

South Africa's ruling ANC heads for biggest win
By Reuters	| Apr. 15, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
PRETORIA - The ruling African National Congress steamed towards victory in South Africa's election on Thursday, with declared results showing it on course for the biggest win since it toppled apartheid 10 years ago.

Ballots counted from half the country's 17,000 voting stations showed the ANC winning 68.42 percent of the vote against the total 66.35 percent it scored in 1999 and the 63 percent which made Nelson Mandela president in 1994.

Political analysts said the former liberation movement was now virtually guaranteed a two-thirds majority in parliament, which would allow it to amend the constitution at will.

"Our prediction is the ANC should be at around 69 percent," said Hans Ittmann of the Center for Scientific and Industrial Research, noting that many traditional ANC strongholds had not yet reported results.

But the ruling party was battling for two key provinces and faced a strengthening challenge from the Democratic Alliance (DA), which campaigned on South Africa's huge problems with AIDS, crime and unemployment after a decade of ANC rule.

The DA, a largely white party which has sought to cement its position as the official opposition, almost doubled its support from the 1999 elections with a total of 14.86 percent of the national vote, according to results so far.

The main loser appeared to be the New National Party, heir to the grouping that built apartheid, which was at just two percent against almost seven percent in 1999.

"The NNP have caused their own death...they're on the way out," said Patricia de Lille, whose new Independent Democrat party picked up some of the votes among the NNP's remaining base of mixed-race voters.

ANC excited at results "We are excited about the results so far," ANC spokesman Smuts Ngonyama said. "The hurricane is beginning to blow. It's blowing in our favour."

The ANC, now led by President Thabo Mbeki, appeared strong across the country with results putting it ahead in all nine provinces - albeit in some cases by small margins. Early national turnout estimates were about 74 percent.

This was below the huge 89 percent in the last poll in 1999 but showed a continuing enthusiasm for multiracial democracy. Wednesday's vote appeared smooth despite scattered accusations of intimidation and fraud in traditional hotspots and tension in the battleground province of KwaZulu-Natal.

The Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) launched its first challenge to Wednesday's vote in the province, a move analysts said could raise tensions further in a region which has a long history of political bloodshed.

"It may well be that we would not accept the election results if we believe electoral fraud and cheating have been sufficient to undermine the entire process," said IFP national spokesman Musa Zondi.

Battle for Zulu heartland A heavy security presence kept a lid on political tensions in KwaZulu-Natal, where the IFP is fighting to keep the only provincial government under its control.

Officials dispatched some 240 soldiers to the Zulu heartland to rescue 30 ANC agents after they were threatened by IFP supporters during the vote count.

The ANC hopes to capture the governments of both KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape -- the only two of the nine provinces it does not already directly control. But in both cases results suggested coalitions could take power.

KwaZulu-Natal lagged the rest of the country in reporting results, but the race appeared extremely tight. With 38 percent of the polling stations reporting, the ANC was ahead with almost 42 percent of the vote against 38 percent for the IFP.

The DA, which is in an electoral alliance with the IFP, scored 11.44 percent -- a trend which, if sustained, could see the IFP-DA in control of the province.

In Western Cape, with more than 60 percent of polling stations reporting, the ANC was at 40.24 percent against the DA's 31.59.

The New National Party, which now runs the province in coalition with the ANC, was polling at 10 percent and ANC officials said they expected the coalition to continue.

Not so black and white

Regarding "Creating a Bantustan in Gaza," by Akiva Eldar, Haaretz, April 16

Eldar's article is nothing more than an example of intellectual laziness. He cannot make his argument against Sharon's disengagement plan on its merits so he resorts to emotive words and factual inaccuracies.

Fact: the homelands were only for blacks, not coloreds. In contrast to Eldar's assertion that the homelands were one of the last inventions of the white government, they were first established under the 1951 Bantu Authorities Act. In the 1960s, they became operational and were the ideological fulfillment of the apartheid slogan of "separate but equal."

The Israeli government did not officially recognize the independence of the homelands. The idea that bridges and tunnels were also a South African precedent is illogical. South Africa is 60 times larger than Israel, including Gaza and the West Bank. Most of the homelands were made up of disconnected land areas, some of which were hundreds of kilometers apart. It would not have been feasible to build bridges and tunnels linking these areas.

Any rebellions in the homelands played a limited role in ending white rule. Within the 87 percent of South Africa that was meant to be white, Blacks were an overwhelming majority and it was their uprisings that brought an end to apartheid.

The South African media regularly paints Israel's actions as worse than apartheid. There are letters, articles, talk shows where Israel is accused of currently carrying out genocide and ethnic cleansing. On this basis, the South African media rationalizes (if not justifies) all Palestinian violence.

Eldar's analysis will be used as further evidence to justify the South African media consensus that Israel as a Jewish state has no right to exist within any borders and that the only solution to this conflict is a binational state.

A welcome first step

Regarding the text of the withdrawal plan, Haaretz, April 16

Withdrawal from Gaza would certainly be a positive move - a step in the right direction toward withdrawal from all of the occupied territories. While unilateral withdrawal will not bring peace - namely, an end to the conflict - it might end some of the acute nature of the conflict generated by the direct control over 1 million Palestinians in Gaza.

However, there should be no illusions that Sharon's disengagement plan will constitute an end to the occupation of Gaza - as stated in Section II A2 of the plan: "As a result, there will be no basis for the claim that the Gaza Strip is occupied territory."

As long as Israel maintains control of all entrances and exits, namely the airspace, sea access, and land borders, the territory may be autonomously run by a Palestinian authority, but it is still occupied.

Add to this the continued Israeli military presence in part of the territory (the Philadelphi Route) and the dictate that "no foreign security presence" be permitted in the Strip, and you have further signs of Israel's unilaterally dictated control over what can or cannot be done.

A totally unilateral step that relinquishes responsibility for governing inside the territory, while nonetheless maintaining control over the Gaza Strip as a whole, cannot release Israel from its responsibilities as the occupying power under the Fourth Geneva Convention.

An end to the occupation can only be defined by third party control or by genuine Palestinian control (sovereignty) over the territory, including entry, exit, circumstances inside, foreign relations and the like. Only then will the Palestinians be the sovereign.

Withdrawal from Gaza, therefore, is a welcome event if seen as a first step toward the end of occupation altogether, but it is only a limited first step. It should create no illusions about the need to continue to press for the evacuation of all the territories and a genuine end to the occupation, which can bring us peace only if the conditions, borders and the like are ultimately legitimized by a freely negotiated settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. The prime minister should not throw sand in our eyes through some dubious claim that he is ending even part of the occupation - however promising the step itself may be.

Israel's greatest ambassador

Regarding "Unchanging Principles," Editorial, Haaretz April 16

Haaretz richly deserves its reflective editorial of self-congratulation, an editorial as redolent of integrity and excellence, and especially ordinary human decency, as the paper itself and its proud tradition. In its resolve to avoid hatred and polarization and extremism, propaganda and oversimplification, Haaretz continues to set a rarely matched and unsurpassed international standard.

Conservative critics occasionally carp that Haaretz feeds the world food for criticism of the country, missing the obvious fact that this is what distinguishes Haaretz from the old Communist Party paper Pravda and a "braver and newer world" full of propagandistic and sycophantic newspapers.

Even more, Haaretz is a constant reminder to foreigners of Israel's open society and many of its other great cultural and social assets. While often a messenger of "bad news" to the world (reported with honesty and integrity), in so doing Haaretz becomes a constant reminder to critics and potential critics that Israeli culture at its best has a conscience that is second-to-none. Haaretz becomes a standing exhibit of this fact - and so much else that "is right about Israel." And in reminding us of this, it becomes one of the best goodwill ambassadors to the world that Israel has ever had.

We'll take whatever the Americans allow
If the United States really and truly wanted to prevent Israel from undertaking the long adventure of tragically taking over the territories of the West Bank and Gaza, it could have done so easily. But it never did.
By Yitzhak Laor	| Apr. 21, 2004 | 12:00 AM

During the decades of the occupation, the dovish camp has learned to summarize its position regarding annexation with the dogma, "The Americans won't allow it." Even the settler right has tended to believe that dogma, and decided to identify it with "fear of the powerful gentile" so familiar from the Diaspora, and such. But that belief has been in stark contradiction to the facts.

Since the 1970 Rogers Plan, no American administration, before or after elections, in a second term or not, has ever intended to halt the Israeli annexation of the last of the land available to the Palestinians to establish their own state. When the U.S. wanted to pressure Israel - for example, in the case of the withdrawal from Sinai in 1975 - it applied a "reassessment" and Israel folded in a flash. If the United States really and truly wanted to prevent Israel from undertaking the long adventure of tragically taking over the territories of the West Bank and Gaza, it could have done so easily. But it never did.

The Americans, according to this baseless theory, opposed the Jerusalem Law - those who legislated the law heard warnings day in and day out about a clash with "our greatest friend in the West"; that's what happened with the Golan annexation, the establishment of the settlements and particularly the invasion of Lebanon. Things reached the level that, at the height of the collapse in Lebanon in 1983, those in the know wondered about the "green light" that Ariel Sharon either got or did not get a year earlier from Alexander Haig, secretary of state in the Reagan administration during the early part of the war. The withdrawal from the Shouf Mountains, delayed despite Israel Defense Forces demands because of American opposition, could have been a launching board for at least an intellectual debate. Nothing like that happened. The fantasy over the equation America equals peace efforts continued to be an inseparable element in the division between "hawks" and "doves." Both sides found their allies in Washington.

In his book about the 1967 war (a book full of hatred for Levi Eshkol and Abba Eban), the British Jewish journalist Jon Kimche described the failure of this dovish concept and how it worked on the eve of that war. He reported how then-Mossad chief Meir Amit ran up and down Washington's corridors of power behind Eban's back in the spring of 1967, hinting to the American establishment that Eban's attempts to offer a way out of the imbroglio without going to war against Egypt was not acceptable to the Israeli defense establishment. While that description has been confirmed by Amit and other Israelis, the example hasn't changed. The Americans want two things: peace and a strong Israel.

That's all very nice, if one remembers that the American administration is concerned about the welfare of a number of interested parties inside the United States, sometimes through the use of peace rhetoric and out of unlimited support for the Israeli war machine, which does not contradict the American interests in the region, or the interests of the American defense industry. Thus, we reach Sharon's "great success" with President Bush. The American president allowed the Israeli right to sooner or later annex large chunks of the West Bank. What was called "minor border corrections" until the era of Ehud Barak has become "land percentages," and behind those percentages is the assumption that Israel does not have the strength to demand of itself what it demands of the Palestinians - a civil war. Now Bush's promise has arrived as some great achievement for the coming years: the map of Israel has changed, the "national divide" will be postponed. But what about the conflict with the Palestinians?

The difference between us and Bush and his advisers is the price that we will pay here for the crime of missing the historic opportunity to divide the country. Israel, according to the Bush vision and those who enjoy his support in the settlements, will live in a deepening process of apartheid, with all its security justifications ("everything is temporary, until peace arrives"). Those who think the country will remain quiet for 40 years just because the Americans agree that keeping Beit El is part of the basic condition for the security of Israeli lives, should remember how the blood flowed like rivers in all those parts of the world where a pax Americana reigned, and not only in Southeast Asia (where it was possible to blame the Communists) but also in Latin America - a purely American playground. Now, the Middle East has joined the pax Americana, meanwhile, from Baghdad to Tel Aviv. As Dante wrote on the gates of hell: "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."

Founding a binational state
When U.S. President George W. Bush indulged in references about an historic event as he defined the separation plan, he wasn't exaggerating, even if it is not clear that he grasped the implications of his words regarding the future of the Jewish state.

When U.S. President George W. Bush indulged in references about an historic event as he defined the separation plan, he wasn't exaggerating, even if it is not clear that he grasped the implications of his words regarding the future of the Jewish state. Nor did the Palestinians err when they compared his declaration to the Balfour Declaration, even if they perhaps failed to grasp that the statement is liable to have implications yet more grave than the 1917 pledge, and will compel a substantive strategic change in their struggle. And Ariel Sharon - crowned by victory and convinced that he has unveiled a daring new initiative which will foil all schemes - will be surprised to discover that in Washington he was pushed into embracing an accelerated process of founding the State of Israel as a binational state based on Apartheid.

What's the connection between, on the one hand, the end of the conquest in the Gaza Strip and the dismantling of settlements, and the establishment of a binational state, on the other hand? After all, the goal of disengagement is to improve the demographic situation by removing a million and a half Palestinians from Israeli control and thereby reducing the danger that the country will cease to be a Jewish state. The surprising fact is that this "conceptual transfer" is accepted by the Israeli left, which continues to believe in anachronistic slogans about the "end of the conquest" and the "dismantling of settlements."

The report about a tacit agreement being reached between Peace Now and Sharon's aides - Peace Now will suspend the "evacuate settlements, choose life" campaign so as not to harm public relations efforts for Sharon's separation plan - illustrates the profoundly confused state of public discourse. As the left sees it, the confinement of one and a half million persons in a huge holding pen fulfills the ideal of putting an end to the occupation, and furnishes some relief about how "we are not responsible."

Similarly, when, in South Africa, a failed attempt was made to solve demographic problems by creating "homelands for the blacks," liberals originally supported the idea, and even a portion of the international community viewed the measure as a step toward "decolonization." But after a short time it became clear that the ploy was designed to confer legitimacy to the expulsion of blacks, and their uprooting. The Bantustans collapsed, demands for civil equality intensified, and the world mobilized for the defeat of Apartheid.

The Bantustan model for Gaza, as depicted in the disengagement plan, is a model that Sharon plans to copy on the West Bank. His announcement that he will not start to disengage before construction on the fence is completed along a route that will include all settlement blocs (in keeping with Benjamin Netanyahu's demand), underscores the continuity of the Bantustan concept. The fence creates three Bantustans on the West Bank: first, Jenin-Nablus; second, Bethlehem-Hebron; and third, Ramallah. This is the real link between the Gaza and West Bank plans - the link is not what those politicians who will provide a "security net" for Sharon in a Knesset no confidence votes call "the precedent of the dismantling of settlements."

And thus, with breathtaking daring, Sharon submits a plan which appears to promise the existence of a "Jewish democratic state" via "separation," "the end of the conquest," the "dismantling of settlements" - and also the imprisonment of some three million Palestinians in Bantustans. This is an "interim plan" which is meant to last forever. The plan will last, however, only as long as the illusion that "separation" is a means to end the dispute is sustained.

But the day will come when believers in this illusion will realize that "separation" is a means to oppress and dominate, and then they will mobilize to dismantle the Apartheid apparatus. The last ones who will consent to abandon the ideal of "separation" and uphold rights will be the Palestinians; but, to some extent, Sharon's separation plan, and Bush's declaration, will provoke them.

In this way, Sharon's rhetorical victory is sown with the seeds of its own destruction. The Bantustan plan is now in swing; and the scenario which Sharon so badly wanted to avoid will unfold.

A Jerusalem quartet in Auckland
The Mossad passport affair is making waves in New Zealand - but not much permanent damage.
By Chemi Shalev	Apr. 23, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
AUCKLAND, New Zealand - On Wednesday evening there was an anti-Israel demonstration in Auckland at the entrance to the auditorium of the old city hall, where there was a concert by the Jerusalem Quartet, an Israeli chamber ensemble that is now doing a performance tour in New Zealand.

In order to increase interest in the demonstration, its organizers, the Committee for Palestine, linked the "Israeli oppression in the territories" to the affair of the Mossad security service passports that last week engaged the media and public opinion here. But not more than 20 people showed up to demonstrate, all of them veteran radical left activists, and passersby on the street, as well as the audience that came for the performance, looked at them with indifference mingled with scorn. "Everyone here is apathetic," grumbled one disappointed woman who had come to demonstrate.

The arrest of Eli Kara and Uri Kelman, the flight of Zev Barkan and the continuing search for "the fourth man" - who apparently is not an Israeli - are indeed providing good material for newspaper headlines and cafe chitchat, but they are not exercising the New Zealand public enough to bring demonstrators out in droves.

The material is that of a spy novel, a James Bond-type drama with more than a dash of klutzy comedy, an entertainment for the masses that perhaps is annoying the New Zealanders at the level of principle but is not succeeding in rippling their everyday placidity.

"Far from the madding crowd" is a key phrase in understanding the soul of the New Zealanders, and also for interpreting their independent foreign policy and the separatism of their government. The isolated islands, at a distance of three hours' flight time from the "nearest neighbor," Australia, are an ideal place of refuge, where the magical landscapes and the serene inhabitants cast a spell, even on the thousands of Israeli backpackers who visit New Zealand every year.

"This is the securest place in the world," says Prof. Steve Hoadley of Auckland University, "which accordingly also produces the most idealistic foreign policy, and there are those who say the most naive, in the entire international community."

For the past 20 years, for example, the government of New Zealand has been refusing to allow nuclear submarines or ships carrying nuclear weapons to dock at the country's ports. As a result of this, American warships have had to stop calling at New Zealand's ports, and the Americans neither forgive nor forget.

New Zealand's position has rendered meaningless the security treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States (ANZUS), which was signed at the beginning of the 1950s in the shadow of the Korean War and is creating constant tension between Washington and Wellington. Recently, the Americans informed New Zealand that only the reversal of the decision on the matter of the docking of the ships can lead to the opening of negotiations on a free trade agreement, which the New Zealanders so desire, especially since Australia has signed a similar treaty.

Another example, even more bizarre in Israeli eyes, is Prime Minister Helen Clark's decision last year to mothball New Zealand's entire air force, so that the country will remain without any military ability to defend its air space.

"If terrorists hijack a plane and want to crash it into the Sky Tower in Auckland, where there are hundreds of people," says Professor Dov Bing of Waikato University, "the government of New Zealand will have to beg the Australian air force to send a fighter plane to intercept the hijacked aircraft."

The basic values of New Zealand's foreign policy are made up of code words that are the nightmare of the average Israeli diplomat. The New Zealanders, and particularly the ruling Labor party, believe in human rights, international law, international organizations and multilateral solutions. They dislike "aggressive" states and especially their leaders, so Israel's Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and United States President George W. Bush, for example, are at the bottom of the barrel with respect to public affection.

The New Zealanders reserve their pragmatism, their realpolitik, mainly for the rivals of the United States in the international arena. For example, China, as everyone knows, does not serve as a model for human rights, but this does not hinder the Wellington government from aiming to sign the first trade agreement of its kind with Beijing. Iran is also not exactly a paragon as far as observation of international law is concerned, but New Zealand has bold diplomatic and trade relation with it.

Although Australia and New Zealand are often perceived as a single entity, their paths in matters of foreign relations and defense diverged some time ago, and a certain tension has even developed between the two states. Beyond the simple fact that in Canberra a right-wing government is in power and in Wellington a left-wing one, it must not be forgotten that Australia is a far larger country and its strategic aims are designed accordingly.

New Zealand tends to retain diplomatic fealty to Britain, whereas Australia has cast its lot mainly with the United States. New Zealand continues to believe in international organizations - ever since it supported the League of Nations and supported conciliation with the Nazis in the mid-1930s - whereas Australia, together with the U.S., has developed a more reserved attitude toward the United Nations.

A quick look at the globe can also explain the differences: Indonesia, which is considered the largest potential source of unrest in this part of the world, is close to Australia, yet still very far from New Zealand.

Prof. Bing - a Jew of Dutch origins who has spent a few years in Israel - believes that in addition, internal political factors are now playing a key role in the shaping of New Zealand's foreign policy. The Clark government, he says, is following an ostensibly liberal and conservative economic policy, as opposed to the traditional ideological position of the left wing of the Labor Party, and in order to "buy quiet" within the party, Clark is allowing radical elements to influence foreign policy. These radicals spent their university days in the 1970s in tempestuous demonstrations against the Vietnam War, or a decade later in the violent struggle against New Zealand's relations with the apartheid regime in South Africa. Now they are "picking on" Israel as the current ultimate evil.

Bing is also convinced that the government has "blown up" the Mossad passport affair - in part through leaks to the New Zealand Herald - in order to divert attention from its embroilment in the affair of the transfer of offshore rights to the members of the Maori tribe. The way the government has dealt with the offshore rights has earned increasing criticism in public opinion, and the opposition National Party has begun to rejoice, to the extent of a forecast that there will be a reversal in the elections slated to be held next year.

And indeed, the fraught internal relations with the Maori people are the key to understanding the soul of New Zealand, because the development of relations between "whites" and "natives" in New Zealand has been fundamentally different from what happened in America and Australia.

In the middle of the 19th century the Maoris ("the normal people" in the Maori language) conducted a bloody war against the British "invaders," but unlike the American Indians, who were massacred and driven into compounds, and in contrast to the Australian Aborigines, who surrendered without a fight - the Maoris conducted splendid battles and inflicted many defeats on the British army that had come to put down the rebellion. Although in the end the Maoris could not withstand the military and technological abilities of the British, their courage and tactical resourcefulness aroused a great deal of respect among the victors, and attitudes toward the natives developed accordingly.

For this reason, the New Zealand Wars, as they are called here, did not end with the utter defeat of the natives, but rather with an agreement between the sides. The Waikato Treaty, which was signed in 1840, made the Maoris full citizens of New Zealand and granted them, ostensibly, equal rights. It is considered a founding event in the life of the people of New Zealand and to this day dealing with it has shaped the internal relations inside the country and has also influenced its foreign policy.

The British immigrants did not stick to the conditions laid down in the treaty they had signed, especially with respect to the Maoris' rights to their lands. In the 19th century the Maori nation, which originally numbered about a million souls, was heading for annihilation. The main factor in the dwindling of their numbers was the diseases that the immigrants had brought with them. In 1896 there were only 40,000 Maoris in all of New Zealand. Since then the living conditions have improved, the Maoris have developed resistance to the European diseases and in the last century their number has increased tenfold.

The demographic increase was accompanied by the revival of the Maori fighting spirit, which reached its apex in the 1970s and led to extensive riots in protest against the denial of Maori rights. In the wake of the riots a special commission was established, whose role was to regularize the Waikato Treaty, after a delay of nearly 150 years.

Since then, New Zealanders have made a real effort to rectify the injustice that was caused. Anyone who visits the country for the first time is surprised to see how strongly the Maori presence is felt, in part because the Maori language is an official language, and appears on all signs, in all public places and even in the local bookshops (a cartoon in a local newspaper this week showed the entrance to Mossad headquarters. The sentry at the gate asks the person who has come to give the password, and the answer is "Kia ora" - "Hello" in Maori).

The rate of "mixed" marriages between whites and Maoris has been rising steadily and New Zealand defines itself as a bicultural country, not to say binational.

Clark's left-wing government is considered to have gone very far, perhaps even too far, in its "politically correct" policy towards the Maoris, and therefore the "right-wing" opposition (which is not at all rightist by any criterion that prevails in Europe or the United States) has gained in strength.

Nevertheless, the basic attitude of New Zealanders to the local natives and the sense of guilt for the historic injustice that was done to them shape their worldview in international contexts as well. These influence, among other things, the attitude toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and arouse sympathy in them for the Palestinian "natives."

Prof. Bing notes, however, that public opinion in New Zealand is far more sympathetic toward Israel than the other side. This coming Monday, the country will mark ANZAC Memorial Day, in remembrance of the joint Australian and New Zealander army that participated in the two World Wars.

According to Bing, the public in New Zealand attributes profound significance to this day. In World War I, one third of the New Zealander men between the ages of 20 and 40 were killed. In World War II New Zealand also lost proportionally more soldiers than any other Western country.

Bing believes that the battle heritage of New Zealand's soldiers, who played a key role in the war against Rommel's army in North Africa, is still alive today among large portions of the public, is passed along from father to son and is translated, among other things, into a basic sympathy for Israel.

Bing says that the government would have also made a scandal of the passport affair if it had been a matter of Egyptian or Pakistani agents, for example. Since it involves Israeli agents, the affair is more interesting - both because of the prominence given to Israel in the media and because of the Mossad's battle aura.

If the two governments have an interest in ending the story quietly, it will not leave a lasting mark on the relations between Israel and New Zealand. But local political considerations, together with the moral, some say moralistic, nature of the New Zealanders, could turn the affair into a sore that will not heal for quite some time.

Post-Zionism didn't die, it's badly injured
Like historian Tom Segev, Dr. Uri Ram, a senior lecturer in the Behavioral Sciences Department of Haifa University, considers post-Zionism to be a climate rather than an ideology.
By Dalia Shehori	| Apr. 28, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Like historian Tom Segev, Dr. Uri Ram, a senior lecturer in the Behavioral Sciences Department of Haifa University, considers post-Zionism to be a climate rather than an ideology. But unlike Segev, who last week told Haaretz the intifada had killed post-Zionism, Ram believes that not only is it not dead, it is in its infancy or maybe just fetal.

He says: "Post-Zionism is the opposite of dead. It's true only few people bear the title `post-Zionist,' but the post-Zionist situation is much broader than that." In his opinion, post-Zionism is a social phenomenon that has infiltrated deeply and now has many intellectual, cultural and artistic expressions. It exists in many areas of life, in the non-ideological viewpoint of many Israelis.

Ram says that in Israeli universities there is today "a critical mass of researchers who are postmodern, postcolonial, post-Zionist, post-Marxist. In effect, something has been created in Israel that could be called `the post-Zionist bookshelf,' which is of course smaller than the so-called `Jewish bookshelf,' but is definitely a respectable one already."

In the draft of an article entitled "Post-Zionism at the age of 10: Disappearance or dissemination?" Ram writes that since the beginning of the post-Zionist discourse, universities have invested a great deal of effort in the debate with post-Zionism and in refuting it. He says "80 percent of historians are involved in this debate and it may be that discussion of the collapse of post-Zionism (after the failure of Camp David and the outbreak of the second intifada) has been too hasty." He believes post-Zionism, "which is now hidden under the clouds of terrorism and explosions and despair, is once again becoming a real option."

Post versus neo

Ram sees a battle being waged over the redefinition of collective identity in Israel between post-Zionism and neo-Zionism. "Post-Zionism is citizen-oriented (supporting equal rights, and in that sense favoring a state of all its citizens within the boundaries of the Green Line), universal and global. Neo-Zionism is particularist, tribal, Jewish, ethnic nationalist, fundamentalist, and even fascist on the fringe." Post-Zionism, admits Ram, is today at a low ebb against neo-Zionism - the right-wing, post-Zionist stream of the settlers - which has the upper hand.

Ram believes, however, that this is a temporary situation, a swing of the pendulum, and that post-Zionism will return in a big way. One reason is that the problems that it deals with - the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the debate about a Jewish and democratic state - have not disappeared. If Segev believes that this debate doesn't interest anyone today, Ram's opinion is that not only does the debate exist, it is even likely to reach a point of decision soon, since "this is the principal watershed in Israeli society."

According to post-Zionism, says Ram, "a Jewish and democratic state can no longer exist, because it is an internal contradiction that cannot be resolved." Therefore, he says, "the state will have to decide whether it is democratic or Jewish."

Neo-Zionism is represented in Israel by the National Religious Party, the settlers, the parties of the extreme right and large parts of the Likud and Shas. "We are seeing the return, in a big way, of the nationalist-religious discourse, and even of unabashed racism and colonialism," says Ram.

"This is a process that has been going on since the murder of Rabin and the failed governments of Netanyahu, Barak and Sharon, the second intifada and 9/11 in the United States." The presence of the Arab citizens of the country, who comprise about one fifth of the population, within the civic society, is likely to force Israel to make a decision on the issue of their rights. "If it doesn't want to become a Jewish apartheid state, it will have to become a democratic, civic and pluralistic state."

Ram, 54, defines himself as a socialist post-Zionist, and he is optimistic about the future of post-Zionism, although "the way things look now, it's hard to glimpse any light" at the end of the tunnel. "Since the murder of Rabin we have had regimes leading us from one catastrophe to the next." One thing he accuses Israel of is that although the conflict with the Palestinians is limited and can be solved by territorial compromise, Israel "is deliberately attempting to create a conflict for itself with the entire Muslim world. It is gleefully subscribing to the concept of a clash of civilizations. Sharon's regime is turning us into the forefront of this colossal conflict."

Well connected

Is there a connection between his political opinions and his academic work? Of course, says Ram. His political viewpoint, he says, is anchored in the analysis of the social situation and of political history, which he carries out as a sociologist. The idea that it is impossible to separate the ideology of the researcher from the subject of his research is often heard as a criticism of post-Zionism.

Ram doesn't consider that a bad thing. Quite the opposite, he claims there is always a connection between the academic work of the researcher and his opinions, and the claim that there is presumably such a thing as objective social sciences is a "science-oriented" claim that stems from a mistaken understanding.

Ram believes that two major destructive phenomena, which have not been sufficiently researched, are occurring simultaneously in Israeli society. One is the development of what he calls a neo-colonial political regime, which is expressed in the patterns of occupation, dispossession and oppression of the Palestinians, as well as in the pattern of prolonged built-in discrimination against Israel's Arab citizens.

This, he says, is a consequence of neo-Zionism, which is encouraging the creation of an apartheid regime toward the Arab minority in Israel and toward the Palestinians in the territories. He says that "the entire process of the prolonged occupation, the settlements and militarization creates a violent, unequal situation, which endangers the continuation of democracy in Israel, insofar as it exists."

The second phenomenon is the development of a neo-liberal social regime, which is creating class differences in Israel that are among the most drastic in the Western world. "That is the dark side of neo-liberalism," says Ram, "in the sense that there is a process here of discarding collective solidarity. One aspect of it is civic equality, which should be welcomed, but the other aspect is an attack on the welfare state, and that is a very problematic aspect."

Ram argues "the social sciences and humanities are not doing enough to sound the warning bell and to flash warning lights regarding the dangers both of social inequality and of apartheid."

On the Couch / Being `boxless' can even be fun
By Jerrold Kessel	| Apr. 30, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
In the years that followed World War II the most famous and perhaps best loved BBC voice belonged to John Arlott, one of the great sports commentators of all time. A man blessed with the most mellifluous tones at a time when Woody Allen might have said radio was king and television but a nasty blip on the horizon.

Arlott, who liked to dabble in wine, once confessed a real addiction. Wherever his commentating duties had taken him, around Britain or no matter how far abroad, his craving was never satisfied until he could get in his clutches a copy of a British Sunday paper.

What John desperately needed to know was how his beloved Reading (pronounced Redding), then in the old Division Three South (roughly the equivalent of Israel's Liga bet south II), had fared the previous afternoon. All serious soccer then kicked off at 3 P.M. on Saturday afternoons - no staged times to suit television, or to beat the hooligans to the pubs.

Arlott recounted that no matter how fancy or exotic a place his duties had taken him to, his mood all through until the following Saturday afternoon was dominated by whether Reading had won or lost. Sadly long departed from this world, John must be intrigued to be watching Reading, then a woeful team, battling to sneak a play-off place in the First Division, which may yet see them miraculously competing next season with the likes of Arsenal or Man. Utd.

No matter how sophisticated any of us imagine we are, there's a good deal of the same "little boy" spirit in all of us.

Come now, I say - as I duck catcalls of "sexist," isn't this truly one arena in which boys and girls differ: how many women do you know who care about the sports team they supported as children?

At a recent golf competition at Caesarea, I found myself paired with a newcomer to the ancient game, who hailed originally from Jerusalem, though he now lives half in London and half in Herzliya. Chatting on the tee soon brought out that pervasive Arlott syndrome - in this case with regard to Betar, even though, he conceded, he hadn't actually watched them in the flesh for more than two decades.

I confess a problem in maintaining the Arlott approach in its purest sense. Happily, Johannesburg has been through so many sporting and other upheavals that it's difficult to compare the Manning Rangers in the current South African league with the old black-and-white Rangers from downtown Mayfair. `Black-and-white' in this context refers to the color of the Rangers jerseys, or in American parlance their uniforms, not to any racial affiliation which was then so important to the authorities. (Though the Rangers management once succeeded, to our enormous delight, in including for a couple of seasons in its squad a player of "mixed race." Dear Percy Owen, a terrific old-fashioned center forward, eluded not only opposing defenses but the disgusting Apartheid "morality squad" that forbade playing "across color lines."

All around, the joy of retaining loyalties has become a pressing and an ever-more elusive pursuit. So many childhood clubs all over the world have succumbed to the weight of heavy money, scorning fans and showing contempt of tradition, and worst of all, physically transferring - like the Dodgers did from Brooklyn to LA or Wimbledon FC last year from south London to Milton Keynes.

Not to mention the problematics for a sports addict in this age of persistent travel. This retreat into nostalgia is a response to double trauma; the first blow was when my hotel, on a short trip abroad, didn't have satellite coverage of the Champions Cup, and then the double whammy - home renovations that caused an unplugging of all customary TV sporting delights.

It's forced me to concede something I thought I never would - just how much of a life-saver the Internet is. I got the Porto v Deportivo nil-nil and was able to revel in the fact that I hadn't missed a single thing without even waiting like a salivating puppy, Arlott-like, for the morning paper.

And, after all, wasn't the Maccabi Final Four game on the radio? Though the only voice that's ever matched the mighty Arlott - that of the incomparable Gideon Hod - has long been relegated by Kol Yisrael from courtside to classical musical memories.

How sad that our media-mad generation suffers from disposable habits.

Withdrawing forward
IDF officers were left scratching their heads about the political leadership's intentions: Is the plan really to pull out of the Gaza Strip, or does Israel intend to tighten its control of the area?

Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz toured the Kissufim road last Wednesday, following the murder of the Hatuel family. At the end of his visit, he ordered the Israel Defense Forces to construct a separation fence along the road. The next day, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon appeared before European Union ambassadors and announced that he stands by his disengagement plan, and is currently reviewing ways to implement it. IDF officers were left scratching their heads about the political leadership's intentions: Is the plan really to pull out of the Gaza Strip, or does Israel intend to tighten its control of the area?

The costs entailed in constructing a security fence along the road leading into the Gaza Strip - the very area from which Sharon says he intends to withdraw - are the easy part of the quandary that currently paralyzes the prime minister. Soon parents will ask Sharon why their children are risking their lives, and perhaps sacrificing them, to defend settlers who are slated for evacuation. Why shouldn't the withdrawal process be accelerated? Why shouldn't the political changes required to make the separation plan a reality be carried out?

Sharon doesn't have any choice: He must define his chosen political objective. Once he has done that, he must cobble together the government he needs to attain his goal.

When he established the current government, he opted for the right-wing National Religious Party and National Union Party. In so doing, he made a statement about his policy direction. After less than a year, he switched gears, placing the disengagement plan at the center of his agenda. This new objective is at odds with the coalition he established, and he will never be able to erase this gap by relying on verbal acrobatics. When the government meets this morning to discuss the plan (which was theoretically scrapped last week as a result of the Likud referendum), it will have to choose between one of two options: Either the cabinet can play the role of the clown in a meaningless performance, or it can try seriously to formulate a policy position that it will be unable to accept in the end.

The alliance between the NRP, National Union, and the lion's share of the Likud (on the one hand), and Sharon and Yosef Lapid (on the other hand) is no longer possible, assuming the prime minister and the justice minister really intend to implement the disengagement plan. Should Sharon carry out concrete steps to go ahead with his plan, he will encounter a barrage of criticism in the Knesset, which will make clear to him, and the world at large, how badly bruised he has become in the political arena. Should he merely pretend that he intends to carry out his initiative, his credibility will be tarnished in the eyes of President Bush, and also in the eyes of Israeli mothers who send their sons to fight for an area their prime minister says Israel should leave.

Moreover, the government will have shirked its responsibility if it does not honestly discuss the future of Israel's control in the territories. Minister Tzipi Livni initiated this process of genuine reckoning during a Likud party meeting last week when she asked her colleagues whether they are willing to continue trying to hold on to all settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Other ministers should follow her lead, and ponder this question. The ministers should consider the stance now taken by heads of Israel's security system who hope, on the one hand, to bring the current conflict to an end, while waiting, on the other hand, for a clear strategic policy directive to be delivered by the political leadership. Members of the IDF General Staff and the national security council believe a Palestinian state will not emerge in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, even if Israel pulls out of all these territories. This being the view of security officials, what's the point of the disengagement plan? What's the political alternative: a binational state, Apartheid, transfer?

The upholding of official positions about the dispute and its solution is a heavy price paid by Israel, and it results from the political leadership's obstinate refusal to abandon outdated policy positions. No doubt, deep in their hearts the prime minister and some of his cabinet colleagues, and also top security officials, realize the time has come to discuss the dispute in sober, practical terms, which relate to the persistent Palestinian struggle against the occupation. To engage such a reckoning requires courage.

Nelson Mandela buries his first wife
By Reuters	| May 9, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
JOHANNESBURG - Former South African President Nelson Mandela buried his first wife Evelyn yesterday, nearly half a century after the couple split up.

Mandela and his third wife, Graca Machel, attended the funeral in Johannesburg, along with Mandela's second wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, SAfm national radio reported.

Mandela married Evelyn Mase in 1944, the year he co-founded the African National Congress Youth League. The couple had a daughter and two sons, as well as another daughter who died at a few months old.

The marriage broke up, partly under the strain of Mandela's devotion to the anti-apartheid cause, and the couple divorced in 1957.

Evelyn spent much of her later years working as a Jehovah's Witness missionary. She kept the name Mandela, but in the late 1990s she married retired Soweto businessman Simon Rakeepile.

She died on April 30 at age 82 after a respiratory illness.

Rafah missile strike prompts widespread condemnation
By Haaretz Service	and News Agencies	| May 19, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The White House early Thursday rebuked Israel over its military actions in the Gaza Strip, saying they do not "serve the purposes of peace and security."

"While we believe that Israel has the right to act to defend itself and its citizens, we do not see that its operations in Gaza in the last few days serve the purposes of peace and security," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said in a written statement.

"They have worsened the humanitarian situation and resulted in confrontations between Israeli forces and Palestinians, and have not, we believe, enhanced Israel's security," he added.

U.S. President George Bush on Wednesday urged "restraint" by Israel and Palestinians. "I continue to urge restraint," Bush told reporters following a Cabinet meeting in the Roosevelt Room. "It is essential that people respect innocent life in order for us to achieve peace."

U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said late on Wednesday that Israel`s actions in Gaza would make it more difficult for the U.S. to move the peace process forward.

Powell spoke by telephone to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's bureau chief Dov Weisglass and to Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom. Powell said he planned to also talk to Palestinian leaders.

"Israel has explained it was not a planned act," Powell told reporters at the State Department. "Nevertheless, it does not assist us in trying to move forward."

The United Nations' special human rights envoy for the West Bank and Gaza Strip said Wednesday that the Rafah strikes were war crimes and a violation of humanitarian law, and that the Security Council should consider imposing an arms embargo against Israel just as it had against the apartheid regime in South Africa in 1977.

"These actions constitute...war crimes...They also amount to collective punishment which violates both humanitarian law and international human rights law," said South African law professor John Dugard in a statement.

"The special rapporteur calls on the Security Council to take appropriate action to stop the violence, if necessary by the imposition of a mandatory arms embargo," he added.

The European Union slammed Wednesday's attack as "completely disproportionate" and as showing "a reckless disregard for human life".

In one of his strongest condemnations yet of recent Israeli actions against Palestinians, Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen, speaking on behalf of the EU presidency, cited initial reports suggesting many children were among the casualties.

"It is clear that today's action was completely disproportionate to any threat faced by the Israeli military and that Israeli forces showed a reckless disregard for human life," he said in a statement.

"The targeting of innocent children in a conflict of this kind must always be condemned," he said. "The killing of children does not serve any legitimate cause and degrades any purpose which it purports to advance."

Opposition MKs on Wednesday demanded that the IDF immediately suspend its operation in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip following the deadly attack.

Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia condemned Israeli action in the Gaza Strip and called for a cease-fire, but said the Israeli government showed no desire for peace.

Qureia said, after meeting Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero in Madrid, that "peace needs an immediate cease-fire, needs compliance with United Nations resolutions and needs good intentions from both sides".

"These crimes committed daily against our people... show there exists no desire for peace on the part of this Israeli government," Qureia said.

Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat called the attack as a 'genocide'. "This is a war crime. This is genocide. A crime that has been committed against civilians who were out demonstrating peacefully... What is required is an immediate cessation of the assault, the punishing of those responsible and the sending of international forces," he said Wednesday.

The Knesset was in session when news of the missile strike broke.

Shinui chairman Yosef Lapid described the incident as a human tragedy and political tragedy, caused by the IDF's presence in the Gaza Strip. "Written all over this tragedy is the fact that this situation cannot go on," Lapid said.

MK Mohammed Barakeh (Hadash) termed the Rafah missile strike a "massacre" and called for international intervention.

Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz and Chief of Staff Moshe Ya'alon should face an international tribunal, MK Azmi Bishara (Balad) said, adding that they should be forced to explain their actions.

MK Ahmed Tibi (Hadash) said that the defense minister, chief of staff and the pilot who fired the missiles should all be put on trial. Tibi got so upset at the news of the events in Rafah, he had to be examined by the Knesset resident doctor.

MK Yuli Tamir (Labor) said that the operation in Rafah should be halted immediately, before it turns into another Lebanon.

Meretz MK Ran Cohen called on the IDF to stop the killing and get out of Rafah.

Fellow Meretz MK, Roman Bronfman said that the army does not discern between protesters and terrorists.

Another Meretz MK, Avshalom Vilan, said the order to fire on the protesters was illegal, while fellow party member Zahava Gal-On said the soldiers should have refused to carry out the order.

MK Yuval Steinitz (Likud) said the events were "tragic" but one must remember that the Palestinians frequently send civilians into dangerous areas on purpose.

The Palestinian Authority called on the United Nations Security Council to take sanctions against Israel, and to decide on measures against Israel in Wednesday evening's session to discuss three resolutions calling on Israel to halt the operation.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair called the Rafah operation "unacceptable and wrong" while Moscow slammed what it called a "disproportionate use of force."

The forgotten fruits of peace
Without much fanfare, two warships from India anchored this week in Haifa port. The Mysore destroyer and the Godavri frigate came to demonstrate friendship, and for a meeting with Israel's navy; their arrival is another show of close relations between Israel and India.
By Aluf Benn	| May 27, 2004 | 12:00 AM

Without much fanfare, two warships from India anchored this week in Haifa port. The Mysore destroyer and the Godavri frigate came to demonstrate friendship, and for a meeting with Israel's navy; their arrival is another show of close relations between Israel and India, relations that reached a peak last year when Israel's prime minister visited New Delhi, and when the Phalcon airborne reconnaissance system was sold to India's air force. Trade in civilian goods between the two countries topped $1.5 billion over the year.

These budding relations with India reinforce a point that is usually forgotten in arguments in Israel about the pros and cons of the peace process. Both the right and the left are prone to quarrel about the question of whether the Oslo Accords opened the gates of redemption or heralded a national disaster; and these arguments focus on the number of casualties in terror attacks. They ignore the large benefit Israel reaped from the process, apart from the question of relations with Arabs. The Madrid Conference and the Oslo process did not resolve the dispute with the Palestinians, but they vastly transformed Israel's international status. The days in which the Palestine Liberation Organization maintained more embassies around the world than Israel did are long gone. Japanese cars and McDonald's, items that were once ruled out by the Arab boycott, are now part of Israel's landscape.

The most important dividends of the peace process were the agreement with Jordan and established relations with India and Turkey. The three countries became strategic allies with Israel, and the last two countries became magnets for tourism. True, the relations stem from a convergence of interests; but it is the peace process that toppled barriers impeding these relations. Israel's defense industries, which suffered a blow when the apartheid regime in South Africa collapsed, won new markets. The Israel Defense Forces found new areas for training, and Israel's intelligence network expanded.

Israel has managed to preserve these peace dividends during the intifada. A chain reaction of severed ties, which occurred during the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War, did not repeat itself.

These special relations, however, currently face a test. The test has become tougher following the Rafah operation, as the agonizing of the Turkish prime minister indicated on Tuesday.

Elections this month in India restored the Congress Party to power; it has a tradition of neutrality on the Arab-Israeli dispute; and immediately after the elections, voices in New Delhi were heard talking about a "balanced" approach in the Middle East. The Times of India wrote that ideological affinity between Ariel Sharon and India's outgoing right-wing government, which was based upon "Islam-phobia," has come to an end; relations are now to be based purely on "enlightened national interest," wrote the newspaper.

India's Ambassador to Israel, Ramindar Jassal, does not anticipate major changes. He says that his country's policy is one of continuity in foreign relations, and that relations with Israel enjoy widespread backing in parliament. Similar reports have been relayed from Israel's embassy in New Delhi. After all, the Congress Party established relations with Israel in 1992, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh played a role as finance minister in this diplomatic initiative.

Israeli security officials believe that India will not pull out of existing arms deals. The question is whether it will continue to give preference to deals with Israel, a country which is considered a reliable source of advanced technology and which (unlike other states) did not enforce an embargo on New Delhi in times of tension. Will Israel continue to greet Israelis with open arms? Visits by Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Olmert, scheduled for next November, will test this question.

Israeli officials hope that their counterparts in India, and in Turkey will give higher priority to their their security needs and their recoiling from terror than to Palestinian suffering and will adhere to their belief that relations with Israel help them in Washington. But there are pressures that complicate matters. Turkey's Islamic government sharply criticizes IDF activities in the territories; simultaneously, it sends reassurances to Jerusalem that nothing will impinge on its relations with Israel. Widely publicized, controversial actions such as the IDF operation in Rafah make it harder for Turkey to persist with this policy, and the same undoubtedly holds true with respect to India.

Israeli officials would be wise to keep these factors in mind, and ponder the state of their country's strategic alliances before they reach decisions on the next such IDF operation.

The Bottom Line / Counting the cost - ours
It is difficult to quantify the economic damage caused by the Rafah operation, but it appears the price is both heavy and long term. There are companies and people who won't want commercial relations with Israel anymore, there are tourists who will prefer other countries, and there are investors who will simply be too embarrassed to invest here.

Israel Defense Forces left Rafah in the middle of the week, and Operation Rainbow came to an end. Some serious soul searching must be done in the moral arena, against the 56 homes destroyed, 53 dead (IDF figures), streets dug up, electricity facilities toppled, water and sewage pipes crushed, and hundreds of refugees left homeless. The military efficacy math will be done by the IDF. But the operation also had an economic aspect worthy of consideration.

The harsh pictures from Rafah that were broadcast into every home in the U.S. and Europe, substantially damaged Israel's image. The entire world saw tank shells fired into a civilian demonstration, walls riddled with shrapnel, families sitting in the ruins of their former homes, small children carrying bundles on their back. There was the old lady who led Justice Minister Yosef Lapid to say "the old woman searching through the rubble reminded me of my grandmother," and everyone know where Lapid's grandmother ended her days.

The European Union's foreign ministers issued a condemnation calling on Israel to immediately stop disproportionate destruction of houses in violation of international law. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell criticized the house destructions that would "lead to the uprooting of citizens". Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan harshly criticized the IDF actions in Rafah, calling them "state-sanctioned terror" while his foreign minister said the country is considering recalling its ambassador for "consultations".

It is true in the cynical world in which we live, most is controlled by interested parties. But sometimes, in extreme circumstances, moral considerations encroach on economic life, evidenced by the impact of the global economic boycott of South Africa that toppled the apartheid regime.

At last week World Economic Conference in Jordan, on the shores of the Dead Sea, the level of hatred for Israel reached a peak. Not just among Arabs, but among Europeans and academics. One of them said that the moment Amnesty International determines that Israel carries out war crimes, then every decent corporation in the West has a problem maintaining commercial relations with Israel.

A group of shareholders at Caterpillar (Jews and Catholics), recently organized to pressure the company management not to sell any more bulldozers to Israel, since the destruction of houses runs counter to the company's goals.

At universities in the West, the demand to sever academic and scientific relations with Israel and its institutions is strengthening, and academics carry great weight in public opinion.

It is difficult to quantify the economic damage caused by the Rafah operation, but it appears the price is both heavy and long term. There are companies and people who won't want commercial relations with Israel anymore, there are tourists who will prefer other countries, and there are investors who will simply be too embarrassed to invest here.

But Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu aren't bothered by any of that. They have Arafat, and he has already been declared guilty.

The man who unmasked the Likud
In dismantling the Jewish settlements in Sinai, more than 20 years ago, Sharon gave the signal for the split in the Likud and the establishment of the Tehiya party headed by the withdrawal opponents, Yuval Ne'eman and Geula Cohen. His plan to dismantle the Gush Katif settlements will sooner or later lead to another split in the party.

Even as these lines are being written, when Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is staking his political life on his plan for disengagement from the Gaza Strip and northern Samaria (in the West Bank), no one knows where the prime minister is heading. Has the champion of the Jewish settlements in the territories, the person who 27 years ago promised that by the year 2000 at least 2 million Jews would be living in the occupied territories decided that there is no alternative but to revise his geographic vision and adjust it to the demographic reality? And perhaps the plan is nothing but a deception, whose entire purpose is to slough off, at the price of a relatively modest amount of real estate, nearly a million and a half Palestinians and perpetuate Israel's control of all the territories. There are those, among them senior government ministers from Sharon's own party, who are clinging to the belief that the birth of this move is in the sin of the Greek island.

Whatever Sharon's intentions concerning peace agreements might be, and whatever the results of this last move of his, the danse macabre around the disengagement plan has already made a public contribution of unparalleled importance. Sharon's hasty decision to enlist the support of president of the United States for a half-baked plan, his attempt to force the Likud ministers to ignore the results of the Likud members' referendum and finally the political haggling over a diplomatic-security plan are not a model of proper government. However, it was worth paying this price in order to remove the mask that for years now has concealed the true face of the Likud.

Sharon has done for the peace camp the work that Labor Party Chairman MK Shimon Peres has not wanted to do and that Yahad Chairman former MK Yossi Beilin has not succeeded in doing. The prime minister has proved that in the Likud leadership there is not sufficient support for what he calls "painful concessions," even when it involves the evacuation of Jewish settlements in the territories that are located outside "the settlement blocs." Those ministers and Knesset members who are opposed to conceding territories without a quid pro quo are just as stridently opposed to any negotiations with the Palestinians about security arrangements in the Gaza Strip. To Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Michael Ratzon's call for discussing the disputed issues with the leadership of the Palestinian Authority, there has not been a peep in reply on the part of Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Sharon's vain efforts to pad his plan with international guarantees and to surround it with a separation fence indicate that the disagreement in the Likud is not a tempest in an empty teacup. Not to his political benefit, the prime minister has forced its ideological moment of truth on the Likud. Sharon would not be gambling on his political future if he did not believe, mistakenly, like many Likud voters, that most of his colleagues in the party leadership have also concluded that there is no peace with all the territories. Like them, he has learned the hard way that the top leadership of the Likud is not even ripe for a Bantustan plan in the style of South Africa in the days of apartheid.

In dismantling the Jewish settlements in Sinai, more than 20 years ago, Sharon gave the signal for the split in the Likud and the establishment of the Tehiya party headed by the opponents to the withdrawal, Yuval Ne'eman and Geula Cohen. His plan to dismantle the settlements in Gush Katif will sooner or later lead to another split in the party. The Likud in its current format has reached the end of the road, and not specifically because of all the ill will that has flowed in recent days between Sharon and Netanyahu, who is in a hurry to get back into the Prime Minister's Bureau.

The personal rift is a by-product of the ideological rift. Minister without Portfolio Uzi Landau and Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin are Revisionists, not opportunists. If Netanyahu "reverts to his bad habits" and signs agreements like the Hebron agreement and the Wye Agreement, he will find them, along with the people of the "Land of Israel front," on the opposing side. Facing them, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry and Trade Ehud Olmert and Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz have nothing to look for in the same party, not only because of, and not even mainly because of, the political reckonings. They cannot take back their statements regarding the disengagement from the Gaza Strip and from territories in the West Bank. Once they have left, or have been discarded like Yitzhak Mordecai and Dan Meridor, the Likud will be disengaged from the mask of a center party, and at long last the voter will be able to tell right from left.

Belize fires pro-Israel envoy
By Nathan Guttman	| May 31, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
WASHINGTON - A diplomat in the embassy of Belize in Washington was suspended a month ago for publishing articles in his home press criticizing his government's pro-Palestinian policy.

Trevor Vernon was a counselor in the embassy. A month ago he was told he was suspended immediately and was required to remove personal items from his office and return his key to the building.

Vernon had published articles in the Belize press, condemning his government's decision to dispatch a delegation to the International Court of Justice at the Hague to help make a case against the separation fence.

In one article, Vernon said his government was wrong in becoming involved in the Middle East conflict and Belize should not be involved on the issue. Belize has a small Arab community but both the prime minister and foreign minister are sons of Palestinian immigrants and since they came to power Belize has followed an active pro-Palestinian policy.

"I knew I'd lose my job," Vernon says of the articles, "but I did it because our foreign policy is driven by a Palestinian agenda. This harms the international status of Belize and distorts its foreign policy."

The Belize press has attacked Israel for being an ally of apartheid South Africa and for its close relationship with neighboring Guatemala, with which Belize has a long-running border dispute.

BBC's Mideast maven treads bias tightwire
Israel's criticism of the BBC's coverage led to the appointment of Malcolm Balen, who is examiningits editorial policy on the Middle East conflict.
By Sharon Sadeh	May 31, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
LONDON - Pictures of children who were wounded in Rafah by Israel Defense Forces fire dominated news broadcasts in Britain and elsewhere around the world last week. The editors at the BBC World Service and at BBC News 24 (which broadcasts only in Britain) reported nonstop on the IDF actions, with an emphasis on the harm to the civilian population.

Information specialists at Israel's Foreign Ministry followed the reports closely. As the most important media organization in the United Kingdom, the British Broadcasting Corporation influences hundreds of other media organizations worldwide. Malcolm Balen, who in November was appointed senior editorial adviser to the BBC management, also followed the reports. Balen, who in effect serves as an ombudsman for Middle East matters, deals with complaints about the broadcasting corporation's reports on such subjects and is formulating an evaluation of editing procedures. In October he is slated to present his conclusive and comprehensive report to Mark Thompson, the new director general of the BBC, to Mark Byford, the acting director general of the BBC, who heads the World Service, and to Richard Sambrook, director of news at the BBC.

"I am not here as an extra layer of editorial supervision on a minute by minute, day-to- day basis. What I do is a long-term editorial review, and by definition, the review is retrospective, rather than a look at day-to-day output. The truth is, in any editorial job, you are so tied up with your program and deadline, that you simply do not have the time to stand back and look at the coverage as a whole," says Balen.

"Nobody has the time in a journalistic job to trace the course of a single story in an organization as large as the BBC, which is what I was appointed to do. I can concentrate on a single story and look at all sorts of angles and aspects. I can join the dots together, [determine] what the coverage feels like, what the tone is like - crucially, what the content is like, what the balance is like."

It is difficult to estimate the importance that the BBC management attributes to Balen's appointment. This is an appointment that is unprecedented in the history of the corporation, but judging by the location of his office, about a 10-minute walk from the lobby of BBC's White City headquarters in London, it appears that the management has done its best to keep him out of sight. However, he was given compensation; instead of a humdrum view of office buildings, his window overlooks a splendid garden.

"When I got this room I was told that the view is one of the best, but when I actually got here, I was not that impressed," he says with a smile. "In my previous job I could see St. Paul's Cathedral and the Thames." As for the importance of his role, he promises that contrary to the fears of various elements in Israel, his report will not gather dust. "I will find it extraordinary if the BBC had brought me in, at some expense to the license-payer, just to ignore what I have to say," he avers.

Renewed conflict

"The Middle East policeman," as Balen is dubbed in the corridors of White City, held editorial positions at the BBC for 15 years and most recently served as head of news at the independent ITV television corporation. Government sources argued that his appointment reflects the BBC's submission to pressures applied by Israel following the broadcast a year and two months ago of Olenka Frankiel's film "Israel's Secret Weapon," about Mordecai Vanunu and Israel's nuclear policy. Balen's appointment put an end to the crisis, and in Israel it was seen as an indirect admission by the BBC of its blunders.

This was not how they saw things at the BBC. According to Balen, at the time of his appointment, "several things were going on; there was the non-cooperation policy by the Israeli government; widely, there was discontent both among British Jewish community and Israeli viewers and on the Arab side as well. A decision was taken that it was about time the BBC will take stock of what it has been doing."

The arrest of independent journalist Peter Hounam by the Shin Bet security service last week in Israel could breach an opening for renewed conflict between Israel and the BBC. Hounam, who 18 years ago published a controversial interview with Vanunu in The Sunday Times, has been engaged in preparing a new program for the BBC about the man who disclosed Israel's nuclear secrets to the world. The program, "Israel's Nuclear Whistleblower," was broadcast last night. Balen had not been contacted by representatives of Israel or of the Jewish community in Britain in advance of the program. "I am not aware that it has made relations any more difficult; when it is transmitted, it clearly will cause frictions, but lots of programs in lots of areas cause friction, not just with Israel but with other countries," he notes.

Even before the Hounam affair, Balen was surprised by the depth of the rift between the sides.

"I know there is a widespread belief, and it quite shocked me on taking this job, that if the BBC get something wrong, or the nuances are misplaced, there is now a virtually automatic assumption that the BBC had done that because it is biased against Israel, or worse, anti-Semitic," he says. "It is very difficult for sections of the audience to accept that it the BBC got something wrong - it is maybe because it got it wrong, and not because it is biased. This situation polarized the debate and it is very difficult to get the editorial debate back on pragmatic level."

Balen complains of Israel's sometimes using "megaphone diplomacy," which he says thwarts any possibility of dialogue. He offers as an example the leak of a letter sent by Minister without Portfolio Natan Sharansky, who is responsible for Diaspora affairs, sent to the BBC. In the letter, which was sent about two months ago, Sharansky claimed that a report on Hussam Abdu, a Palestinian youth who was caught at the Hawara roadblock wearing an explosive belt, was marked by an anti-Semitic bias.

"The letter," says Balen, "was leaked to the media and became a public debate, [concerning] whether the BBC is anti-Semitic, based on this single report. Rather, it should have been a private debate about the editorial content of that report. Now, any viewer and any listener is perfectly entitled to ask questions about our coverage, but once it comes associated with allegations of anti-Semitism based on an individual report, the BBC could have done nothing else but to rebut that claim and defend itself robustly. We are so far removed from what should be the case, which is a pragmatic, sensible debate, where the two sides can understand each other better. I now get calls from government officials in Israel and they are legitimate, sensible editorial conversations, which is the way we should have a debate. I indeed think that the tension has calmed down a bit in the last few months."

The director of Israel's Government Press Office, Danny Seaman, who is usually one of the BBC's most vocal critics, concurs and has told Haaretz that, "relations between Israel and the BBC improved in recent months, since the appointment of Malcolm Balen. I especially appreciated their professional coverage of the IDF's operations in Rafah. It was balanced and factual as expected from the BBC."

Balen intends to examine the question of whether the BBC is biased against Israel, but in this interview, he hints that his stance on this is negative. "It is difficult for those serving as journalists in the BBC to understand how they can be accused of bias ... people who work in broadcasting know that unlike newspapers, there are so many people involved in the construction of a report or a program that have to jump a number of different hurdles if you are a conspiracy theorist and you want to say that people were actually conspiring to make a report biased. But I have to ask whether the BBC is systemically biased."

"Terrorists" no, "militants" yes

Balen's job parameters, despite their limited scope and the fact that the position was instituted for one year only, is indicative of an attempt on the part of the BBC to rid itself of its arrogant and alienated image. The main question, which Balen is not prepared to answer at this stage, is whether he intends to call into question the basic assumptions that underlie the editorial considerations regarding reports from the Middle East, among them not using terminology that is likely to anger Arab viewers.

Someone who has experienced this personally is senior broadcaster Robert Kilroy-Silk, whose talk show was canceled four months ago after he published an article in which he expressed criticism of the Arab states. According to him, he was fired "because I was telling the truth about repressive Arab regimes - and the BBC is dominated by political correctness."

Sharing this view is Rod Liddle, former editor of the BBC radio's flagship news program "Today," who harshly criticized the way the BBC covers the Middle East. In an article he published in May, 2003 in the British political weekly, The Spectator, under the headline, "Why is the BBC so scared of the truth," he wrote that the BBC's attitude was "the result of institutionalized political correctness, every bit as corrupting as institutionalized racism." Liddle lambasted BBC correspondent Niall Dickson, who had ended a report on the suicide bombing by a pair of British Islamic terrorists at Tel Aviv's Mike's Place with the totally unsubstantiated assertion that the vast majority of British Muslims are strongly opposed to such attacks.

"How do you know?" Liddle wrote. "You asked them all? You haven't, have you? You sort of hope it's true. It's an article of faith that we have to believe such things, so bung it in at the end of the report ..."

According to Liddle, the BBC is in thrall to an outlook whereby "Whatever happens, Muslim people in Britain mustn't be offended by whatever news is reported; ergo, don't report anything that might offend them. Or, if you do, sweeten it with shibboleths like `most Muslim people don't think like this, actually,' even if you haven't a clue whether they do or don't."

This was the case last week, too, with respect to the report on the arrest of fundamentalist preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri, who is wanted by the United States on suspicion of terror activities. The BBC correspondent said in his report that "his views do not reflect those of the vast majority of the Muslim community in Britain."

Balen refuses to comment on Liddle's criticism and is prepared only to say in response that, "Rod has made an interesting living since he stopped being a BBC editor, making all sorts of comments about the BBC, and he is very entertaining, but doesn't always reflect the truth."

On the substance of the issue, Balen adds: "The BBC is committed to impartial reporting, and the report has to use certain terminology that does not look as if it is taking a position; you have to find a neutral word."

Thus, for example, the BBC encountered a dilemma on the issue of the separation fence: whether to use the term coined by Israel, "fence," or the Palestinians' term: "the apartheid wall." After lengthy deliberations, the instruction was issued to use the word "barrier." ("We came up with that word, so it probably pleases neither of the sides, but it doesn't offend them either," says Balen.)

The issue of the separation fence is dwarfed by the internal debate that is going on in the BBC about the use of the term "terror." At the BBC they refrain from using this word in connection with the attacks inside Israel, and they call the terrorists "militants." However, this policy is not consistent: Not only is it applied solely on the BBC channels that are not broadcast inside Britain, but the prohibition is implemented only in the Israeli-Palestinian context and concerning Iraq.

"Personally," says Balen, "I think there is a particular difficulty over the use of the word `terrorist.' It is one thing to avoid using the word `terrorist' in the Middle East, it is quite another thing if people spot an inconsistency ... So this is something the BBC will have to think through, either of a consistent use or a consistent non-use of the word. It cannot appear to be facing in two directions at once."

Balen rejects the accusation that the BBC, as a British media organization, has to use the definitions of the British government, which sees the Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and others as terrorist organizations: "The BBC has to make up its own mind; it exists as a broadcasting organization and as such it cannot be told what to do from the outside. You have got to have editorial independence, subject to accountability procedures. As a private thought, let's say that if a bomb goes off, it is an act of terror, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the organization who planted it is a 100 percent terrorist organization. Maybe it has some aims that some people may think are legitimate."

"Intellectual tyranny"

Do these principles, which are applied in the name of journalistic ethics, serve in fact to cover up a biased outlook? In the Jewish community in Britain they believe that this is indeed the case. Trevor Asserson, a London-based Jewish solicitor, who has done an independent evaluation of the BBC, and Melanie Phillips, a journalist with The Daily Mail, have come out against what they define as "intellectual tyranny" that characterizes the corporation's editorial system and castrates any possibility of a constructive debate or a balanced presentation of the positions of the two sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

According to them, the BBC reflects a picture that is entirely black and white: a strong, occupying power facing a weak and oppressed population. However, Asserson does not believe that there is an anti-Israeli conspiracy and rejects outright the claim that the people at the BBC are tainted by anti-Semitism. He says that the BBC is not a uniform and monolithic organization, but rather a collective of talented individuals who reflect an anti-Israeli tendency that is "part of an anti-Establishment, anti-government and anti-American orientation that reflects the views of the European intelligentsia."

Balen does not reject this claim, but according to him this tendency is not the exclusive province of the BBC. "It is perfectly possible that journalism, not just broadcasting journalism, but journalism in general, attracts people of a liberal persuasion, maybe a left-leaning persuasion, but probably a liberal persuasion, and the BBC, quite possibly, is not unlike any other organization in this respect; it just happens to be larger. Therefore I will ask some questions: Are the BBC editorial processes such that people are capable, whatever their private views, of forming a totally separate, neutral professional judgment, or do their backgrounds affect their professional judgment?"

At present Balen insists upon rejecting one key accusation. The BBC, he says, is not anti-Semitic. "I heard several times in the past few months during meetings with Anglo-Jewry figures and elsewhere that `Jews are news.' This is an insulting remark, which suggests that the real interest in Israel or the Jewish community is somehow bent on some sort of malicious intent, bordering on anti-Semitic; nothing can be further from the truth, and it is also factually wrong. The BBC devotes to the Middle East, Israel included, less than people think, based on a seven-month review of coverage on the "10 O'Clock News," our flagship program. There was actually relatively little coverage of the Middle East.

"It is obvious, for cultural, historical and geo-political reasons, that the Middle East has always been in the center of a lot of news coverage, and I also think there is no one person in the BBC who would not fight in a trench against anti-Semitism. Now, to answer questions about that requires answers to a huge number of questions: Is criticism of Israel's government anti-Semitic? What is anti-Semitism? This debate removes us from the challenges of editorial grounds on which I want to center the debate. I want to concentrate on much more pragmatic grounds of what the BBC coverage is actually like, how it is perceived in Israel, and what the balance is between a properly questioning journalistic attitude and being unduly skeptical."

When Balen is asked about the BBC's focus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as compared to the small number of correspondents and reports covering the neighboring Arab countries, he says the reason is that, "Israel is an easy place to work in journalistic terms; it is accessible. Unlike Syria, for instance, where even a simple assignment can take a few weeks to prepare, just to get the permission into the country, work around under supervision and then to try getting out. It is easier to work in a democracy like Israel, but do we reflect that in our reports? Do journalists reflect enough that you can ask the sort of questions of politicians in Israel that you can ask in the UK?"

Asked whether posing these questions is not an attempt to shake up time-honored practices at the corporation, Balen responds: "Perhaps the BBC will have to consider whether it should change priorities and procedures upon which its journalists have trained for years."

Dutch design competition focuses on Arab village of Ein Hud
This coming Sunday, June 6, the De Balie Center for Culture and Politics in Amsterdam will officially announce an international conceptual competition for an outline plan for the Arab village of Ein Hud.
By Esther Zandberg	| Jun. 2, 2004 | 12:00 AM

This coming Sunday, June 6, the De Balie Center for Culture and Politics in Amsterdam will officially announce an international conceptual competition for an outline plan for the Arab village of Ein Hud. The residents of this settlement, situated in the Carmel coast region, fled or were evicted from the nearby village of Ein Hod, which went on to become an artists' colony. The village of Ein Hod was not recognized by the state, and lacked proper infrastructure and living conditions. All construction in the village was considered illegal and designated for demolition. The design competition is being announced on the date on which the Six-Day War broke out.

About 10 years ago, Ein Hud was granted state recognition that its residents coveted, and an outline plan was prepared, which was supposed to permit construction and development. But even now, after the Interior Ministry has approved the outline plan, the village is still not able to properly develop in accordance with its needs. In its original form, the Ein Hud outline plan included 170 dunams (42 acres) in the Carmel Forests National Park, comparable to the area of Ein Hod, but the relevant planning committees cut the land allocation by half. For comparison's sake, the average amount of land per capita in Ein Hod is approximately four dunams, as opposed to only one-third of a dunam in Ein Hud, even though most of the village residents are farmers.

The area designated for construction in Ein Hud is only half of the area covered by the plan. This is insufficient even for some of the residents' needs, and does not set aside any land for employment or reserves for future expansion. Entrants in the conceptual competition will be asked to propose a suitable counter-plan to the official outline plan.

The competition is an initiative of the Dutch organization FAST (Foundation for Achieving a Seamless Territory), which was set up and promoted by Israeli architect Malkit Shoshan, who lives in Holland, and in collaboration with the Association of Forty of unrecognized villages, which advocates recognition of unrecognized Arab villages in Israel.

The association's chairman and a resident of Ein Hud, Mohammed Abu al-Hayje, represented the village in the discussions leading up to the outline plan, and was involved in the planning process. But after the plan was so drastically cut, for what he believes are political reasons, he found that it was not the plan for which he had hoped, and Hayje is about to petition the High Court. He welcomes the conceptual competition initiated by Shoshan, and believes that it will help his petition, and aid in the formulation of a feasible alternative plan.

Mike Turner, the Jerusalem architect who drew up the official plan for Ein Hud, also has his reservations about its revised version. However, he says: "The agreement with the Ein Hud people was that it was preferable to accept what the planning committees were giving and apply for an extension later on than to reject the plan out of hand."

Turner was unwilling to cooperate with the competition in Holland. "I was not able to understand who is behind it, and in any event we want to improve and correct, not just sit on the sidelines and preach morality."

The competition is part of a project called "One Land, Two Systems - Beyond the division lines in Israeli spatial planning," initiated by FAST. The project aims to raise public awareness of the unrecognized Arab villages and the "spatial apartheid that rules in planning in Israel in general."

"The situation is reflected in part by the construction of the separation fence and the Trans-Israel Highway, which will also be included in the project," says Shoshan. The project also seeks, says the organizers, "to serve as a test case for similar conflicts in other places." The project includes architects and academics from Israel and Holland, and is supported by the Netherlands Architecture Institute, the Voice of Another Jew organization from Holland, the Israeli Committee Against Housing Demolition and others.

With the announcement of the competition, public debate will be held on the use of planning for political objectives (not only in Israel). Participants will include Ole Bouman, the editor of the Dutch architecture journal "Archis"; Stefano Boeri, editor of the Italian architecture monthly "Domus"; Oren Yiftahel, the chairman of the Geography Department at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev; Professor Sandy Kedar of the Law Faculty of University of Haifa; and architect Eyal Weizman.

Even though Israel is the appropriate place for a critical conceptual project of this sort, Shoshan says the atmosphere in Holland is more comfortable, due to both the support of the Dutch government for architectural debate and research, and the greater possibility of raising financing for the project. Its organizers believe that in Holland, their activities will generate a bigger international echo than it would in Israel.

Powell warns against division of West Bank into 'bantustans'
By Haaretz Service	and agencies	| Jun. 7, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell has cautioned against division of the West Bank into "bantustans," declaring that a future Palestinian state must be built of contiguous areas.

"In the West Bank, you've got to have a coherent, contiguous land, which, joined with Gaza, would constitute the state of Palestine," Powell told CNN television from France, where he accompanied President George W. Bush during celebrations of the 60th anniversary of D-Day.

Bush and French President Jacques Chirac discussed developments in the Middle East during their talks in Paris Saturday. The secretary of state said the outline of a future Palestinian state came up during these talks, and the US president supported the idea of the West Bank's contiguity.

"He was making the point that you can't have a bunch of little bantustans or the whole West Bank chopped up into non-coherent, non-contiguous pieces and say this is an acceptable state," Powell said.

Bantustans were tribal states declared independent by the white minority government of South Africa during the 1970s in the hope of staving off the collapse of the apartheid system.

Bush has said it was "unrealistic" to expect Israel to quit larger West Bank settlement blocs and that Palestinian refugees should not expect to return to homes lost when Israel was created in 1948.

The comment, made during a recent Sharon visit to Washington, was greeted warmly in Israel but with anger iby many Arab leaders, prompting charges of US complicity with Israel.

Haaretz journalist Hass awarded Anna Lindh award
By Anat Balint	and Haaretz Correspondent	| Jun. 19, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Haaretz journalist Amira Hass on Friday was awarded the Anna Lindh award, created in memory of the slain Swedish foreign minister. Hass was the first recipient of the award.

The $33,000 prize will be awarded annually by the Anna Lindh Memorial Fund to an individual, organization, or project that operates in Lindh's spirit. Lindh was stabbed to death in Stockholm in September.

Hass, who lives in Ramallah, was cited for her "courageous reporting" from the West Bank and Gaza, which "contributes to a better understanding of Palestinian life under Israeli occupation."

"By informing the Israeli public about everyday life in Palestine, she helps create conditions for a meaningful dialogue," the citations stated.

Hass said she was accepting the prize with mixed feelings. "The irony has not escaped my attention: Here I find myself benefiting from a bloody conflict, from the reality of an on-going ruthless Israeli occupation and an apartheid sort of domination that my state, Israel, excercises over the Palestinians," Hass said.

"I benefit from the fact that I report about and from the midst of a shattered Palestinian society, which became infamous and marginalized because of the suicide bombers and the cult of death it has been producing, a society which has so many varieted, rich and wise voices but fails to make them heard and allows for two kinds mainly to dominate: that of victimhood and that of religious fanaticism," Hass added.

Dear Mr. Bo Holmberg, Dear members of the board, dear guests and friends.

The composition of the first sentence of any article or a feature is for me the most difficult, sometimes even agonizing. It's doubly difficult now for me to locate the most suitable first words in this ceremony. After all, this ceremony should have never taken place, the memorial fund never been established, as the life and career and plans of Annah Lindh should have continued normally, should have not been cut so cruelly and abruptly by a murderer.

How then can I express my words of thanks, for the encouragement and appreciation your award represents, while each of you wishes it never had to be announced and given? So it's almost needless to explain why I stand here with mixed feelings. Moreover, there are three other reasons for the mixed feelings I have, when I stand here, accepting with gratitude your generous award. The irony has not escaped my attention: Here I find myself benefiting from a bloody conflict, from the reality of an on-going ruthless Israeli occupation and an apartheid sort of domination that my state, Israel, excercises over the Palestinians, a domination which robs them of their chances of free human development, and endangers the normal future of my people, the Israelis.

I benefit from the fact that I report about and from the midst of a shattered Palestinian society, which became infamous and marginalized because of the suicide bombers and the cult of death it has been producing, a society which has so many varieted, rich and wise voices but fails to make them heard and allows for two kinds mainly to dominate: that of victimhood and that of religious fanaticism. I benefit, then, from a miserable situation.

Another reason for my mixed feelings stems from a bitter awareness that my reports and articles are noticed, widely read and truly comprehended in the outside world much more than among the Israelis. A colleague of mine, whose views are closer to the popular and official Israeli version of the conflict, is candid and cynical. He told me just recently that the more does the "outside" readership welcome me, the more marginal and irrelevant I am considered at home. It's not that I am concerned with popularity or lack thereof. I am troubled that my words - and the words of quite a few other Israeli reporters, social and political critics and activists are not reaching their natural address. A third reason is a related sense of frustration that I experience especially in the last few weeks. Again, it's personal frustration and a collective one, at the same time.

A debate within the Israeli community of Intelligence has reached the media, especially thanks to my Haaretz colleage , Akiva Eldar. It's the debate around the truthfulness or falsehood of the Israeli explanations on the causes of the present round of bloody conflict, since September 2000.

The official Israeli version, propagated by the political echelons around the former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak of Labor, and adopted by a great part of the Israeli Jews, ran as follows: Arafat planned, initiated and orchestrated the armed conflict from the start; Arafat did not accept the generous offers of Barak at Camp David, Camp David talks reached a deadlock because of Palestinian insistence to demand the Right of Return of all Palestinian refugees; Arafat is anyway aiming at the gradual destruction of the state of Israel ; from the start of the present Intifada Palestinians resorted to using arms against the Israeli soldiers; Palestinians who were killed were killed in armed clashes between the two parties. Each such statement, which was actually accepted, if not presented, as a purely objective fact, has been contradicted and challenged by articles and reports published by Israeli papers.

I well remember an article which the Israeli political scientist, Menahem Klein, published in Haaretz. By the way he is a religious Jew who teaches at Bar Ilan university, and he participated in negotiations over Jerusalem. It was a few weeks after the outbreak of the Intifada. He offered the solidly logical argument, that had Arafat really secretly plotted to eventually destroy the State of Israel, he would have accepted Barak's offers at Camp David, and proceeded from there, gradually, to his final goal. Arafat, wrote Klein, could not accept Barak's offer as a final deal, because he genuinely clinged to the two states solution, along the borders of June the 4th, 1967. An exceptionally poignant writer, is Bet Michael - another observant Jew, who has a weekly column at Yediot Aharonot, which enjoys the largest circulation in Israel.

What he derives from Judaism and Jewish thought is a deeply moral logic. Sometime during the first year of the current bloodshed he commented about the military and the intelligence boasting that their assessments about Arafat and Arafat's plan to escalate the bloodshed had proven correct. If I am not mistaken, he referred directly to the present Chief of Staff, Moshe Yaalon. He wrote the unforgettable sentence: "He [yaalon] did not foresee the future. He created this future".

Dani Rubinshtein, also of Haaretz, who has been reporting about Palestinians and the occupied territories since the early seventies, added his impression, analysis and information about the spontaneous character of the uprising, about Arafat's wish to resume negotiations and lack of control over the street. Tireless Eldar kept bringing information - from highly positioned Israeli and diplomatic sources - that refuted the official presentation, or should I say now myths. Palestinian activists were interviewed by several Israeli writers. Marwan Barghuti, now in prison, was interviewed, among others, by Gideon Levi of Haaretz and Yigal Sarna of Yediot Aharonot. He - and others - reiterated their support of the two states solution, he insisted the Intifada started spontaneously. he reminded the Israelis that during the previous years Palestinans had warned over and over again that by failing to progress with withdrawals, by the continued construction of settlements etc. Israel was pushing the Palestinians to a new revolt.

Ben Kaspit, of Maariv - maybe the most loyalist Israeli daily in Hebrew published a year after the outbreak of the uprising a huge article, where he analyzed the military conduct. Among other issues, political and military, he studied the conduct of the army from day one. He referred to the astronomical number of bullets that the Israeli soldiers used from the start, in no proportion to the quantity and quality of arms that the Palestinian did. In other words - one could conclude that the escalation > was triggered by an excessive Israeli use of power. This list is long. I was part of it. I reported from the field: from the first demonstrations in Ramallah and Gaza, where hundreds or thousands of people marched to Israeli military positions: some tens of youngsters threw stones, the many stood near by - chanting slogans, chatting, discussing the corruption and uneffecitveness of the Palestinian authority. And from distant positions, the Israeli soldiers were shooting live bullets, wounding and killing. The soldiers obeyed their officers' orders, who in their turn acted upon the clear political directive and assurance from above - at the time of the Labor rule.

From the third day, Palestinian and Israeli human rights health organization commented that the number of injuries in the upper parts of the body was a proof that the order was to kill. They also claimed that the army is targeting children. I published their commentary in one of my early reports. An interview I held with an Israeli sharpshooter confirmed these claims.

Amnesty International had a very good and urgent study about the events: it commented that the clashes started when Palestinian civilians marched in protest towards "symbolic sites" of the Israeli occupation - military positions, mostly near the Israeli colonies. I published a summary of their report, which concluded that the army inflammed the atmosphere by using excessive use of deadly power. It would take days to cite the reports from the field - by me and others -that refuted the Israeli official military presentation of events. If you check the archives, you'll find them. True, all the papers, including Haaretz, and more so the radio and TV channels, didn't give such reports the prominence that the official versions received. But whoever wanted to get a broad picture and more facts - could have done so. Yet people comment today to the debate and its content as if they were exposed now to totally new facts.

My frustration could sound vane: so early on did I offer facts that now, three and two and almost four years after are taken as common knowledge, proven by important officials and commentators. Well, I AM vane. I don't shy at saying that I published > those facts very early . But my frustration is about the wasted lives, the blood that might have not be shed, the destruction that followed. If only people concluded early enough that their army and politicians added tons of fuel to the flames, that they treated a tiny match-fire as fire in a forest. So you understand my mixed feelings. My frustration did not start in Sept. 2000. Long before then I used my advantage, as living among Palestinians, and offered facts which contradicted the common assumption that a peace process was going on and that every one was and should be happy. I referred to Israel's policies on the ground, which were at stark contrast with concept of peace: such as settlements, such as the developing policy of closure, which is the Israeli version of the apartheid pass system.

I had interviews with Palestinians intellectuals who warned that the situation was volatile, at the brink of an explosion. I made sure to publish it. I could not guarantee that it would be read. Even less could I guarantee for the logical conclusions to be drawn. For example, that Israel was not working in order to make peace, but in order to win the Peace: that is, to use the negotiations period as an opportunity to expand the settlements and guarantee an enfeebled, unviable Palestinian State. My experience and frustration allowed me to consolidate my concepts about Journalism. Journalism's main task is to monitor Power, to locate Domination and to follow its characteristics and effects on the people, to observe the relations developing between Power and the Subjugated. Even between these two ends there is always a dialogue, an exchange of behaviors, opinions, emotions, habits, influences. Power is never a one-track, one direction action. In schools teachers and the education system as a whole are the center of Power, but aren't students playing with them a game of shifting places? Still, men hold the positions of Power in our societies, but aren't they required to permanently alter their forms of domination because of women's conscious demand or implicit aspiration for equality and permanent sense of dissatisfaction?

In class relations between the employed and the employee the permanent conversation between the two unequal parties is being expressed in a thousand forms: not just strikes or negotiations, raise of salaries or cuts, but by flattery to the boss and sabotage, laziness and telling of lies or jokes, bringing psychologists to spy or offering > benefits and weekend excursions. Monitoring Power is a voluntarily-adopted mission of journalism, I believe, in a centuries-old development of the media and its social contract with the society in which journalists operate. It's not the only role - but it is the most important one.

I believe the mission of journalism is to scrutinize the actions of Power: not to overlook the dialogical relations, and yet to question the motives of those in power and their acts : because they'd do anything possible to retain power and deepen it, because they hold the means to perpetuate the false equation between the ruler's good and the public's good, or portray their Power as God-sent and natural. By monitoring Power, the media is contributing to the dialogue between the sides. They are not equal, not symmetrical, and still they converse. The media reports about this conversation, but it also participates in it, by the very publication. It mediates information and by doing so it helps developing the dialogue. And the media should do the impossible: scrutinize itself as to what extend it silences or not the voice of the disadvantageous party in the dialogical relations. Going back to the Israeli-Palestinian angle, Israel is the Holder of Power. No doubt about that. Which does not imply that the Palestinians have lacked or lack initiative, responsibility, share or influence on the state of affairs. Here, the Israeli media is in a tricky double position: It should monitor Power, that is Israeli occupation. But as an Israeli foundation, it's part of Power. It's part of and represents the dominating society, which has an interest to prolong and eternalize its privileges vis-a-vis the Palestinians: here are some of these privileges: control over water supplies, control over land, determining demographic processes, containing the pace of development of the Other in order to secure Jewish hegemony. But the Israeli media is indeed free: nobody threatens us - our lives, our jobs - if we follow the first commandment of journalism at the expense of our objective position as part of Power. It's not that facts were not presented to the Israeli public, early enough, by various journalists.

Haaretz esp. and for many years was carefully monitoring and scrutinizing Israeli power. But facts have melted away, evaporated within the natural process of socialization. By socialization I mean the imitation of each other, the adoption of believes and concepts which infiltrate from up down, but then circle around as the independent fruit of autonomous and individual contemplation and knowledge. By socialization I refer to the thin line between the fabrication of a consensus and the consensus created naturally between people of common ethnic origin, or religious.

We, Israeli journalists who cover the Power relations between Israel and the Palestinians, are caught then in the interplay between our freedom of expression and our natural identification with the society which keeps the center of Power. It's not censorship, it's not direct official intimidation that marginalyzes our facts or silences us, at times. It's the deafening noise that the process of socialization creates. By socialization I refer to the need to safeguard ones privileges - be they as miserable as the privileges of Israelis who live in poor, under- developed cities and neighborhoods. The common ethnic and religious origin and the natural pursuit of comfort explain why 66% of Israeli Jews say they are not affected by reports on the suffering of Palestinians whose houses were demolished. A similar rate of Israeli Jews believe that the Separation fence is inflicting a negligible damage to Palestinians. And they refer to this dreadful set of fortifications which breaks Palestinian territory and society into disconnected isolated enclaves; so many facts were published about it. Also the facts about these scandalous merciless figures were published. In Haaretz.

Also ending is difficult. I thought of several endings for this presentation, and could not make up my mind about any. After all, it's a thank you speech. And indeed, I am grateful for your generosity. It, in its turn, allows me to be generous with some friends in Gaza and Rafah. I owe them so much of my understanding of the Palestinian society and the Israeli occupation, the understanding that you defined as "courageous journalism".

Holocaust lawyers sue Germany for $18b over stolen art
By Reuters	| Jun. 24, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
BERLIN - A group of lawyers filed an $18 billion lawsuit against Germany yesterday alleging the country that perpetrated the Holocaust was now retaining stolen artworks from its victims.

Prominent U.S. lawyer, Edward Fagan, said he had filed a suit in a New York District Court on behalf of the Association of Holocaust Victims for Restitution of Artwork and Masterpieces (AHVRAM) against the German Finance Ministry.

Standing outside the ministry, Fagan told journalists he would present the government with evidence that after World War II, it had conspired to store, transport, withhold or dispose of at least 2,000 artworks stolen from Holocaust victims.

"We are here because the theft started here, the expropriations started here, the continued wrongful retention of property started here," said Fagan.

During the Holocaust, Jewish households across occupied Europe were systematically looted for their artworks. AHVRAM's lawyers allege Germany withheld profits made from the works it still holds, including paintings by Monet and Rembrandt.

The group said that Germany had retained works on the grounds it had not found living heirs, but Fagan said in that case, the country should sell the works and give the money to Holocaust victims as has been done in Austria.

The Finance Ministry said in a statement that since the end of World War II more than one million artworks had been returned to their owners or heirs. It said it still owned works insured for a total of 60 million euro.

The flamboyant U.S. lawyer, who became known for his role in promoting Holocaust-related claims and has also stirred controversy with a slew of multi-billion dollar apartheid lawsuits, said the $18 billion claim has a "punishment value."

"What we are saying is: `Give the paintings back and by the way, you should be punished for what you did.' Governments should not do this," he said, adding he would turn over the damages to victims of the Nazis.

Fagan said he was hopeful Germany would meet AHVRAM's demands. He indicated he also planned to file lawsuits against Austria, France and the United States for retaining stolen art.

Best known for landing a $1.25 billion settlement from Swiss banks on behalf of Holocaust survivors, Fagan has been accused of raising his clients' expectations to unrealistic levels.

MK Bishara on hunger strike to protest against W. Bank fence

Israeli Arab MK Azmi Bishara (Balad) launched a hunger strike on Sunday to protest against Israel's construction of the West Bank separation fence and the hardship it is causing Palestinians.

Dozens of protesters, including members of the Palestinian parliament joined Bishara in a tent near a section of the barrier being built on the edge of East Jerusalem.

"I'm trying to attract local, Arab and world attention to the apartheid wall that is being built in Palestine, and to the crime that is being committed against the Palestinians in Jerusalem by building this wall that separates it from the West Bank villages near it," Bishara told Reuters.

Israel said on Wednesday it would reroute part of the disputed barrier after the High Court of Justice ordered the government to make changes that would minimize hardship to the Palestinians.

In 10 days the International Court of Justice in The Hague is expected to issue an advisory ruling on the barrier's legality as requested by the United Nations.

What really influences the High Court
There's no way to know what really influenced the High Court justices when they decided last week to cancel 30 kilometers of the separation fence route that cuts through Palestinian areas northwest of Jerusalem. The naked facts presented to them in the petition by Mohammed Dahle? Or the voices around the facts?

There's no way to know what really influenced the High Court justices when they decided last week to cancel 30 kilometers of the separation fence route that cuts through Palestinian areas northwest of Jerusalem. The naked facts presented to them in the petition by Mohammed Dahle? Or the voices around the facts, like the upcoming decision by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, or the photographs of elderly people clutching at trees and boulders while young soldiers scatter them with tear gas.

We've grown up and know that judges, even justices of the highest court in the land, are not disconnected from their surroundings. The legal processing of the facts that are delivered to them is never done in laboratory conditions. They watch TV, maybe even the BBC. Hague, shmague, but as justices at the international level they have to deal with the possibly legal arguments of that court. Maybe Sharon's conclusion, that their ruling presents Israel in all its glory as a democratic state, also guided their decision. But they are also private individuals, who know that their judgments will be examined in legal publications and international conferences.

Therefore it is impossible to know the weight of each consideration - the pure facts on the one hand and the events around them on the other. Several petitions against the fence's northern route were presented in the past by other lawyers. Dahle himself tried, through an appeal to the legal committee, to change the route in Kafr Aqab, whose residents are Jerusalemites but who are imprisoned behind the wall and the Qalandiya checkpoint. The petitioners were all rebuffed. Maybe the facts that were presented convinced the justices that the proper balance between security needs and Palestinian human rights was properly maintained.

But it is also possible to assume that the criteria for "reasonable harm" are what changed over the past year because of the "environmental" elements of the mounting demonstrations and protests, the international media attention to the matter, and The Hague. Every demonstration, every protest, every organized tour along the fence including the tours organized by the Peres Center or the supporters of the Geneva initiative, every appearance by the women of MachsomWatch at a locked gate in the separation fence created a noisy focus in Israeli society. It was noise in the silence of the uniform consensus. No matter how marginal, how distant, how remote, every noisy focus creates small ripples of public attention, and the ripples expand and broaden. Some are bound to have reached the awareness of the justices.

In recent months those noisy focal points have strengthened and multiplied in waves. More elements in Israeli society have begun to ask questions about the route. The justices of the High Court may not have questioned the necessity of the fence nor demanded that Israel build it on the Green Line, on Israeli land instead of Palestinian land. They only related to the harm caused by the fence to individuals, and not to the harm done to their rights as a collective and to the physical infrastructure of their sovereignty.

Nonetheless, given the current forces at play, the positive significance of the decision cannot be disregarded, both with regard to the residents of the petitioning villages and to the chances of success for the campaign against the route in the future. The decision, even though it cannot satisfy those who really are opposed to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, is a signal that popular struggles can bear some fruit.

Joint Israeli-Palestinian protests and joint Jewish-Arab actions create in Israel particularly loud "noise." Every anarchist risking being shot by an Israeli soldier has parents and cousins; every activist at MachsomWatch has relatives and colleagues at work; every architect from Bamakom, the non-profit organization that provided expert counsel to the petitioners regarding the route of the fence, has a partner and contractors with whom he or she works. Thus broadens the circle of Israeli cognizance of the impossible reality created by the separation barrier. Thus broadens the recognition that there is no "proportionality" to it. Thus changes the environment in which the justices operate.

That's why it was particularly sad to discover in the weekly E-mail message of "the system against the apartheid wall" - a grassroots Palestinian operation - that in their report on the June 26 protest against the separation wall at A Ram, which the police dispersed using extraordinary amounts of force, there was no mention that in addition to the Palestinian demonstrators from the neighborhood affected by the wall there were quite a few Israelis.

It was not the first demonstration attended by Israelis, and Israelis are deeply involved in several ongoing activities against the separation barrier - and not only protests and demonstrations. The exclusion of Israelis can be presented in a negative light: In Israeli society, people are ready to listen to Jewish Israeli arguments (particularly when presented by people with military records) about the Israeli harm being done to the rights of the Palestinians, but they are not ready to listen to Palestinians.

Was it anti-colonialist aversion that made the Israeli participation in the demonstration disappear? After all, this can be presented in a positive light: The joint protest has broken lines that separated people on national and ethnic grounds and created different circles of consensus. The joint protest has brought universal values to the front of the stage, values that military-technologist terminology and ideologies of blood and land are trying to bury.

Sharon to convene ministers Sunday to discuss ICJ ruling
UN General Assembly to meet at end of week to discuss ruling stating that West Bank separation fence is illegal
By Shlomo Shamir Haaretz Service, Agencies	Jul. 9, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is to convene Sunday a special ministerial consultation on the International Court of Justice ruling that the West Bank separation fence is illegal and the implications of the ruling on Israel.

Attorney General Menachem Mazuz and Justice Ministry officials are to attend the meeting, the radio said. Justice Minister Yosef Lapid said on Friday that Israel will not follow the ICJ ruling on the fence.

The United Nations General Assembly is expected to hold an emergency meeting on Thursday or Friday to discuss the ICJ ruling.

Nasser Al-Kidwa, the Palestinian observer to the UN, is expected to submit a draft resolution to Arab members affirming the ICJ ruling against the fence ahead of the meeting.

The deputy chief of Israel's UN mission Arye Mekel said Saturday that Israel has started intensive talks with the Europeans to try to get them not to support any General Assembly resolution on the fence.

During the General Assembly vote in December on the decision to have the ICJ give its opinion on the legality of the barrier, the European Union abstained, saying that the ICJ was not the appropriate forum to discuss Israel's barrier.

The Palestinians later intend to take their case to the 15-nation Security Council, where the United States last October vetoed a resolution that sought to bar Israel from extending the security barrier into the West Bank.

The court ruled Thursday that the fence violated international law, must be torn down, and that Palestinians harmed by it must be compensated by Israel.

The assembly resolution is expected to ask UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to report on Israel's implementation of the International Court's decision, Arab envoys said.

"The General Assembly now will be called upon to look into this matter," Yahya Mahmassani, the ambassador from the League of Arab States told reporters.

Resolutions in the 191 member-assembly are not binding but can have international impact. The only UN body with the power to impose sanction is the Security Council.

However, sources in Jerusalem said that Washington promised Israel that the U.S. would prevent any attempt to impose Security Council sanctions against Israel, Israel Radio reported Saturday. The U.S., being one of five permanent members of the council, enjoys the power to veto any resolution presented and passed by council members.

In a response to the ruling of the International Court of Justice on the West Bank separation fence, Israel said Friday that the court had failed to address the issue of "Palestinian terror" in determining that the barrier is illegal.

"It fails to address the essence of the problem and the very reason for building the fence - Palestinian terror," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said at a news briefing Friday.

The key to resolving the conflict in the Middle East won't be found in The Hague or in Manhattan, but in Ramallah or Gaza, where terror originates, the spokesman said.

Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom said on Saturday that Israel has asked Washington to intervene to prevent any Security Council resolution.

"I believe that after all the rancor dies, this resolution will find its place in the garbage can of history. The court has made an unjust ruling denying Israel its right of self-defense," said Ra'anan Gissin, a senior advisor to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.

"This is a dark day for the international court of justice and the international legal system," Dan Gillerman, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, said Friday. "It is shocking and appalling that in all 60-plus pages of the opinion, the court failed to address the essence of the problem and the very reason for building the fence - the indiscriminate and murderous campaign of terror that Israelis are facing," he said.

Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also condemned the ruling as unjust.

"What's going to happen now. This is going to go to the UN General Assembly," Netanyahu said. "They can decide anything there. They can say that the earth is flat. It won't make it legal, it won't make it true and it won't make it just."

President Moshe Katsav said the court was wrong in assuming the fence constituted a permanent border and told Israel Radio Friday that there would be no problem to remove or reroute the fence to a border which would be mutually agreed upon during future negotiations with the Palestinians.

Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat hailed the ruling as a victory for his people.

"This is an excellent decision. We thank the court in The Hague," Arafat told reporters from his compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah. "This is a victory for the Palestinian people and for all the free peoples of the world."

Though the ruling is only advisory Arafat compared it to the international will that led to the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. "This wall will be removed to build our own state," Arafat said.

The International Court "decided clearly today that this racist wall is illegal to the root and Israel should stop building it and take down what has already been built of this wall. We welcome this decision," Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia said.

"This is a historic day and a historic decision," he said.

The Hamas militant group hailed the court's decision, saying it "proves that Israel is just a renegade entity that violates all international laws and resolutions."

"The ruling is clear evidence that this raping entity is a reason for the troubles and terrorism in the region and shows that this entity (Israel) is trying all the time to create atmospheres of wars and tensions," a leaflet by the group said.

The "apartheid wall represents the real picture of the Zionist entity that lives the illusion of security and hiding all the time behind walls, lookout posts and heavily protected installations," it added.

The ICJ ruling on the legality of the West Bank separation fence states that the fence contravenes international law, that it must be dismantled, and that compensation must be paid to the Palestinian owners of property confiscated for its construction.

Lapid said Israel would honor only its own court rulings, such as the June 30 High Court of Justice ruling ordering the defense establishment to reroute a 30-kilometer stretch of the separation fence northwest of Jerusalem. The High Court held that the fence was a security barrier rather than a political one, but that Israel must balance security considerations against the needs of local residents.

"Now, of course, there is the limitation the High Court of Justice imposed in Israel, and we will comply with our High Court decisions, and not with the panel of European Union nations, which are not exactly suspected of excessive sympathy for Israel," Lapid told Army Radio.

"Now, of course, there is the limitation the High Court of Justice imposed in Israel, and we will comply with our High Court decisions, rather than those of the International Court of Justice," Lapid told Army Radio. Lapid said that the ICJ decision was expected. "This was a decision made by countries whose stance was known, and is therefore irrelevant to Israel," Lapid said.

Palestinians will seek UN sanctions against Israel, a senior Palestinian official said.

"The next step is to approach the UN General Assembly and Security Council to adopt resolutions that will isolate and punish Israel. As of today Israel should be viewed as an outlaw state," said Nabil Abu Rudeineh, senior adviser to Arafat.

"We hope the United States today will see to it that they will work to have Israel comply with the (court's) resolution," Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb Erekat said.

Ahead of the ruling, IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Moshe Ya'alon said Friday that international legislation on matters concerning war are outdated and irrelevant. According to Ya'alon, the use of civilians in a combat zone necessitates the building of the fence, and that in most sections, the fence allows for complete prevention of attacks.

"The Palestinians recruit seemingly enlightened individuals to condemn Israel, but the fence provides the best security for Israeli citizens," Ya'alon said at a conference in Tel Aviv on Friday.

"It's a great decision. We are thrilled. It very clearly delegitimizes the wall and demands that it be pulled down," said Jamal Juma, coordinator of a Palestinian group called The Anti-apartheid Wall Campaign.

On Friday morning the Israeli-Arab Hadash party submitted a no-confidence motion to the government in the wake of reports of the ruling against the fence.

Faction head MK Mohammed Barakeh said Israel could not ignore the ICJ ruling, or else it will continue to be an international pariah, Army Radio reported.

Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom was to hold a meeting with ministry officials Friday afternoon to discuss an Israel reaction to the ruling, and Sharon will be holding meetings on the issue on Sunday, according to Army Radio.

Government spokesman Avi Pazner said Israel will be ready to discuss the fence route after implementing the disengagement plan, Israel Radio reported.

The state and the vision
We must remember that the suffering of the Palestinians who live under Israeli occupation is as desperate as was that of the Jews of Europe in the late 19th century, when Herzl sought a solution for their distress. The future of the Jewish state is linked to the future of the Palestinian nation that lives alongside and within it, and the logical and ethical solution for that cannot be found in a vision, but by bringing about a change in reality.

Even after 100 years, the vision of Theodor (Benjamin Ze'ev) Herzl seems to suit the taste of Israelis better than any political or diplomatic platform written since. Herzl wanted a country that would be like all the other countries, even dreamt of a Switzerland of the Middle East. He admired Europeanism, although he didn't succeed in being assimilated into it far enough to feel at home. He considered the "new Jew" - a modern, liberal, self-confident, secular fighter, free of the burden of his past - to be his heart's desire, and the solution for all the problems of the humiliated nation in the Diaspora.

Like many of the intelligentsia of his time, Herzl was a colonialist at heart, a missionary of European progress, and he thought Jewish settlement in the Middle East, like British settlement in Africa, could only be to the advantage of the natives, advancing them toward enlightenment. Fifty years before the Holocaust, Herzl arrived at the conclusion that only a separate and independent Jewish state could free the world from hatred of the Jews, and free the Jews from unremitting persecution.

Despite his great frustration that the Europeans rejected him and people like him, he admired European education and liberalism, and wanted to emulate them and to adopt them as a model for the future Jewish state. In doing so, Herzl drew criticism from Jews like Ahad Haam - Asher Ginsberg, the leading proponent of "cultural Zionism" - who were displeased by his detachment from Jewish heritage. Herzl's political Zionism succeeded beyond expectations. Even today the idea of an ingathering of the exiles in a modern nation state, a state that in time of need was capable of absorbing another million new immigrants from Russia into a population of five million, seems to have lost none of its attraction.

The desire to establish a "little Europe" in Israel has also remained relevant, perhaps even more so than in the past, with the European Union outlining a more egalitarian and peace-loving way of life. It is true that Herzl didn't draw most of his political inspiration from Jewish heritage. The irrationality and messianism that spread in the new Jewish state would certainly have been alien to him. There is no doubt he, like many members of his generation, did not anticipate a clash between two national movements fighting over the Land of Israel.

His and others' vision of Zion ignored the Palestinians, while the Palestinians in turn ignored the need to compromise to enable peaceful coexistence. On the 100th anniversary of Herzl's death, we should indeed admire him for his vision. But we must also not be afraid to state that 21st century Zionism will not survive if the new interpretation of the "Jewish state" is an apartheid state that rules over the Palestinians against their will. We must remember that the suffering of the Palestinians who live under Israeli occupation is as desperate as was that of the Jews of Europe in the late 19th century, when Herzl sought a solution for their distress.

The future of the Jewish state is linked to the future of the Palestinian nation that lives alongside and within it, and the logical and ethical solution for that cannot be found in a vision, but by bringing about a change in reality.

Palestinians rejoice at fence decision

Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat hailed the ruling of the International Court of Justice against Israel's construction of the security fence as a victory for his people yesterday.

Arab wall of silence surrounds the fence
Are there Israeli Arabs who support separation?
By Yair Ettinger	| Jul. 11, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Last Monday afternoon, the third day of protests, the sun beat mercilessly down on the tent in the A-Ram neighborhood of north Jerusalem. Under the burning yellow oilcloth, adjacent to the A-Razi Cultural Center, sat dozens of activists and their visitors. Some of them wore armbands that read "hunger strike" in Arabic. The high-pitched strains of Palestinian nationalist songs filled the heavy air.

Without much effort, the hunger strike and anti-separation fence protest tent organized by MK Azmi Bishara, leader of Balad (National Democratic Alliance), took off and attracted a great deal of attention. Fatah members, representatives of the Palestinian parliament, members of the A-Ram local council and Israeli leftists joined the protesters.

Hundreds came to meet them, among them Arabs from the central Israeli Arab towns of the Triangle, Baka al-Garbiyeh, Taibeh, and Tira. To the chagrin of the organizers, a delegation of students from the anti-Zionist Neturei Karta Yeshiva also showed up, and sat in the tent with a large sign that read "stop the Nazi ghetto wall."

The Palestinian and world media covered the protest extensively - the Israeli Knesset member nourished only with mineral water and salt, was perceived as a hero. "Give them a hand," he beamed, referring to a group of children from a summer camp in the Palestinian village of Anata standing in line to greet him.

"I won't stop. This is serious," Bishara declared. "I am going all the way." His goal is neither to spur on what he calls the "toppling of the apartheid being fostered in the country," nor to stop the building of the fence.

"The goal is to bring pressure on the Israeli government from the world and from Israeli society, to move the people in Jerusalem, to balance the weight of Prime Minister [Ariel] Sharon. The whole world is dealing with the question if he is leaving Gaza or not, but the main thing is happening here, division and separation."

In the period between the High Court of Justice ruling on the routing of the fence and the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague on the entire project, the fence has once again become a hot political-media issue. But Jamal Jum'ah, the coordinator of the Palestinian campaign "against the apartheid fence" and one of some 25 people who joined the hunger strike during the week, has become convinced that the anti-fence protest tent in A-Ram is not a case of an Arab political movement from Israel has been drafted into the efforts against the fence on a one-time basis.

"We have noticed recently that there is much more interest among the Arab Israeli community in solidarity activities with us. People are asking what they can do," he said. "From now, matters will start to move ahead. People will begin to recognize that the fence hurts the on-going relations and culture of Palestinians on both sides of the fence, as one people.

No-show demos

There is no denying that relations between Israeli Arabs and Palestinians are at a critical juncture, largely because of the fence. This is one of the reasons that Arab lawyers from Israel are leading the legal team fighting against the fence and that a number of Arab Knesset members, like Mohammed Barakeh and Ahmed Tibi (Hadash-Ta'al), are regular fixtures at anti-fence demonstrations. But strangely, while Arab MKs are commenting to the media, joining the hunger strike and submitting no-confidence motion in the cabinet after the Hague court ruling, from the Israeli Arab street the fence appears mainly a Palestinian problem. It has been standing tall in Wadi Ara for a year already, shaking the regional economy and family ties - but apart from two small demonstrations in Baka al-Garbiyeh in February, no Arab demonstrations, petitions or protests were initiated.

"The most amazing thing is that people in the Wadi Ara villages did not protest," an Arab MK noted sadly. "It was very difficult to get people to come out against the fence," he admitted.

Jewish and Arab activists in the anti-fence protest movement are critical of the Arab political movements. "We expect them (the Arab communities in Israel) to be much better organized," said Jum'ah. "There should be more campaigns to raise awareness, groups should come here and start touring the wall, let them see the situation, let them express solidarity."

Hulud Badawi, a field researcher for the ACRI (Association of Civil Rights in Israel) estimates the number of Israeli Arab anti-fence activists at no more than 100. Many of them, like her, are identified with the Arab parties and join in activities of Palestinian organizations or Israeli leftist groups - Arab Jewish groups like "Anarchists against the Fence," "Ta'ayush," (Israeli Arabs and Jews for Coexistence and Partnership), and the Women's Coalition for Peace.

"But the Palestinians from the territories are deeply disappointed that Palestinians from Israel are not fighting together with them against the wrong being done them," says Badawi. "This [disappointment] does not stem from a feeling of abandonment, but from the realization that the fence will have implications for the Palestinians of Israel, that it is designing a new history for the entire Palestinian people, a second naqbah - the Palestinian name for the establishment of Israel. They are still waiting. We activists are much appreciated. When I come to a demonstration and say I'm from Nazareth, I always get such a smile, a smile of hope. People want to see more and more."

There is more than one answer to the question as to why protest among Israel's Arab population is weak and hesitant, or in fact non-existent: a leadership crisis in Arab society, and comatose political activism in general, the sense of despair and apathy, and resistance of many Israeli Arabs, since the events of October 2000, to going out to demonstrate or express a nationalist stand.

"The main problem is the consensus in Israeli society, both on the left and the right, about the fence," explains MK Ahmed Tibi. "Anyone who is disconnected from Palestinian suffering over the fence is being dragged along behind the idea the Israelis are being stuffed with, including Israeli Arabs, that the fence is a magic solution that will being about an end to the conflict. This is false magic, it's an illusion, and some of the Israeli Arabs have fallen for it."

It is interesting that there is no place for supporters of the fence in open political dialogue. "The separation fence is racist," "the apartheid wall, " and "the second naqbah" are terms seen often seen on the manifestos of the Higher Arab Monitoring Committee, political bureau and in newspaper articles that were published before and after the Hague ruling. These strong words are more than lip service. All through the intifada, Israeli Arabs have witnessed the suffering of their brothers east of the Green Line and felt their pain.

This sense of solidarity is explained by some using the model of the Jews of the Diaspora and the Jews in Israel. If Jews living far from Israel can feel the distress of their brothers here, how should Israeli Arabs feel, sometimes only meters away from Palestinian villages.

Pro-fence Arabs

The fence aroused no Israeli Arab protest even when its northern segment was built during 2002-03, cutting off these towns from adjacent Palestinian communities with which they had maintained natural and immediate relations for 36 years.

How did it happen that only a few dozen Israeli Arabs protested the fence, while Israeli Arab contractors participated in its construction? How did it happen that in some places, under pressure from Arab local councils, the fence was routed eastward, at the expense of Palestinian lands?

Are there Israeli Arabs who support separation? On condition of anonymity, one well-known Arab public figure, a resident of the Triangle, was willing to speak.

"It's true that the Arab public wants a peace agreement, but beyond the political dimension, 99 percent of the Arabs in Israel believe that the fence is a positive thing. It has blocked all illegal attempts [by Palestinians] to enter Israel, and has cut down on robberies and other crimes. The economy is flourishing; millions that were invested in the Palestinian towns are now invested in Wadi Ara. And don't forget that the Arab public is different from the Palestinians. The Arab public has a different pattern of life."

This public figure is not alone. "People say `good riddance,'" according to a journalist who lives in Umm al-Fahm. Between anonymous speakers on the one hand and Tibi and Bishara on the other, it is difficult to identify a single "Arab stand" on separation.

There is only one individual who openly expressed qualified support of the fence - Sheikh Hashem Abd a-Rahman, mayor of Umm al-Fahm. In January, a-Rahman told Haaretz that since the portion of the fence opposite his town went up a few months before, "residents are sleeping peacefully, they feel more secure. People aren't passing through their houses and their fields, they are not blowing up anything and not endangering the residents."

His stand is complicated. He supports the fence only if it passes along the Green Line, and only if arrangements are made for Palestinian passage through it. Like many others in Umm al-Fahm, located on the seam line, Abd a-Rahman is disturbed by the damage caused to his town and its image during the intifada, because of terrorists from Jenin who passed through it on their way to carry out attacks in Israel.

The city's good name was maligned to such an extent that residents started using false addresses. "No fence can cut me off from my people," says the sheikh, "but I want also want security, I also want peace. Since the government put up the fence, you haven't head one case of an attacker that came through Umm al-Fahm."

Similar statements can be heard on the street in Umm al-Fahm or in nearby Kafr Kara, but Sheikh Hashem's saying it caused a public earthquake. From his prison cell, Sheikh Raed Salah, the leader of the Northern Islamic Movement, rushed to publish an article condemning the fence. Sheikh Hashem is on his own for the present.

Jamal Jum'ah never heard that there are Israeli Arabs who support the fence. When he hears the quotes, he has trouble hiding his disappointment. "I think that this is largely lack of information," he excuses it at first, but then he begins to get angry.

"This is not right. I feel bad when I hear such things. This is a selfish point of view. Where is the point of view of the other? Does the speaker know what the fence means for the Palestinians? How much destruction it causes, how it oppresses them, takes away their land and their resources? The lives of the Palestinians are being destroyed. They are the ones who will live in a ghetto. I don't think he will sleep peacefully after this happens."

Jewish minority, Arab majority? Two states or one?
Jul. 11, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The two-state solution was once widely seen as the inevitable destination of Mideast peace efforts. But the collapse of the Oslo process, unending violence between the sides, and the ever-narrowing demographic gap between Jews and Arabs between the Jordan River and Mediterranean, have raised profound questions about the viability and longevity of the two-state solution.

The new reality has also sparked debate, especially among Palestinians, over the idea of a single, bi-national state for Jews and Arabs.

The Israeli left warns that if settlement construction continues and Israel retains the territories, the country will slide into an apartheid-like reality in which a Jewish minority rules over an Arab majority. The result, they contend: the end of a democratic, Jewish state.

Some on the right in Israel respond that Palestinians can be afforded voting rights in Jordan. Others take issue with demographic predictions, arguing that Israel can and should keep the territories.

Does the disengagement plan work in favor or against a two state solution? If the sides cannot create independent states living side by side, what are the best alternatives? Are current demographic trends irreversible, or could other latent trends develop to arrest or reverse them?

Haifa Arabs want junior high shut down
The Arab Parents Forum in Haifa yesterday announced protest action against the Education Ministry because of its refusal to abolish the Arab junior high school in Haifa for the coming school year.
By David Ratner	Jul. 13, 2004 | 12:00 AM

The Arab Parents Forum in Haifa yesterday announced protest action against the Education Ministry because of its refusal to abolish the Arab junior high school in Haifa for the coming school year.

Though the Dovrat Commission has recommended abolishing junior high schools nationwide, the ministry intends to implement this recommendation only starting in September 2005.

The forum announced that for the coming year, it will not register Arab children at the city's only Arab junior high, Al Muntabi. Instead, Arab pupils will be registered at the Jewish schools in their neighborhoods.

Haifa city hall, which has supported the Arab Parents Forum's demand that Al Muntabi be shut down, said yesterday that it "welcomes the decision" by the forum. But the ministry does not intend to let the parents follow through with their protest.

Aharon Zavida, the Education Ministry's district chief, said yesterday that school registration districts were set in Haifa in 1959 and it is the city that determines the districts. While Jewish pupils are linked to their schools by geography, meaning the schools in their district, Arab pupils are registered "district-wide," Zavida said. He added that the even if the municipality cooperates with the Arab Parents Forum and allows them to register their children at Jewish schools in their neighborhoods, he, as the ministry's district director, will not allow this, and he has the authority to prevent a change in school registration districts.

The Arab school system in Haifa is split between high-quality private schools, attended by some 61 percent of the city's Arab children, and the Arab state schools, to which the other 39 percent, mostly Muslim, go. The state schools are considered failures, both in terms of the level of academics and because of the violence in the school yards. In seventh grade, graduates of elementary schools are bused in from throughout the city to the one Arab junior high. Graduates are then sent to the only public Arab high school in the city, Shizaf.

The Arab Parents Forum wants most eighth graders to go directly to Shizaf, except for pupils with learning disabilities, who should be sent to a new school for those with such problems. "Zavida's response means apartheid," complained Yasser Mansour, chairman of the Arab Parents Forum. He told Haaretz: "It is unacceptable that two families, Arab and Jewish, can live in the same building in the city, and the Jewish family will send its children to a junior high according to geography, but the Arab family has to send their children to a distant school by bus, without the Arabs having the choice of moving their children to schools closer to home. We will go to court against the Education Ministry, if necessary."

How low can you go?
The portrayal of Labor as joining the government out of some uncontrollable urge is disconcerting, to say the least. Sharon is the one who needs Labor if he wants to get anything done - because he doesn't have a majority in his own government and his own party to carry out the disengagement plan.

If I weren't so hesitant about using undiplomatic language in a newspaper, I would call this piece "Ego-maniacs - get lost!" At a time when the deteriorating global standing of this country calls for some tough decision-making, the current government, to the glee of some of its members, is steadily losing the power to make such decisions.

Sharon, who led the Likud to a landslide victory in the elections, is suddenly discovering that with all his dramatic efforts to pull the country out of the bog of occupation, he has lost control of his party. The specter of a handful of fanatics intent on dictating the national agenda and driving Israel to collective suicide should send shivers down the spines of all supporters of disengagement.

The ill winds are blowing mainly from the Likud camp. This is the epicenter of the crisis and the source of all the taunts, insults and backbiting. Some of these guys are so worried about losing their portfolio you'd think it was part of their bodies. Some of them are playing a double game - voting for disengagement but not planning to support its implementation. Some of them have remembered all of a sudden that they want the ultra-Orthodox to be in the government, the better to wreck things for Peres, or alternately, they want Shinui out.

But Peres himself has no objection to United Torah Judaism being part of a unity government. "If Shinui got along with the NRP, it'll manage with UTJ," he says. The battle of the Likud ministers and MKs against the establishment of a unity government, for totally egocentric reasons, makes you wonder: How low can you go? Where, oh where, has that thing called national responsibility gone? What ever happened to the days when Gahal leaders Menachem Begin and Yosef Sapir could sit for two whole years in a "national unity government," without portfolios or petty nit-picking?

The portrayal of Labor as joining the government out of some uncontrollable urge is disconcerting, to say the least. Sharon is the one who needs Labor if he wants to get anything done - because he doesn't have a majority in his own government and his own party to carry out the disengagement plan. The wild insurgence of some Likud activists, who are sitting in the Knesset thanks to him, has not left him much choice. The election threat is not realistic anymore. Sharon could end up in a match against Bibi with a cheering section of 61 anti-disengagement MKs. And if that happens, it's good-bye elections, good-bye Sharon and hello Netanyahu. The man who was kicked out of office by a sweeping majority the likes of which Israel has never known, will be back in the roost.

As the political cauldron bubbles with gossip, backbiting, underhanded maneuvers, politicians busy saving their own asses, and other delights of running a nation, Israel has become a target of international condemnation and ostracism on all issues and in all languages. It has been branded a county that practices apartheid, violates human rights, and kills children and cripples in wheelchairs.

As the demographic threat slowly becomes a reality, immigration to Israel has all but ground to a halt. Jews in distress from South Africa and Argentina have turned up their noses at settling here, and the Russians, too, prefer Europe and America. Is it worth losing these potential immigrants to save the hides of a few thousand settlers, in whose defense some of our finest soldiers are being killed?

Peres and Sharon have met on more occasions than we know of, and the relationship hasn't always been trusting. But this time, Peres is convinced Sharon realizes Israel will never be secure as long as 1.4 million Palestinians in Gaza are kept hostage by a few thousand settlers. He believes Sharon is serious about disengagement and evacuating the settlements. But he also knows Sharon can't do it without a unity government that includes Labor.

Peres, global-minded as always, says there are three statistics that matter in the Middle East today: It is home to 8 percent of the world's population; it accounts for 2 percent of the world's economy; and it is responsible for 65 percent of the world's terrorism. We cannot afford to reach the point where the world jumps on us for not helping to drain the swamp.

The media are busy with trivia: who's screwing whom, who's outfoxing whom. But Sharon, acting on the wishes of the Israeli public, is determined to move ahead. He needs Labor not only to insure himself a political majority but for international credibility. A country that has lost so much of its luster since aspiring to be a light unto the nations needs more than a bunch of clowns to regain a semblance of resolve and self-respect.

MK urges debate on Arab schools after Haaretz expos?
By David Ratner	Jul. 16, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
MK Mohammed Barakeh (Hadash) submitted an urgent request yesterday for a Knesset debate on the state of Arab schools in Haifa, following this week's article in Haaretz about a struggle by Arab parents to eliminate the city's state-run Arab junior high school.

The Arab Parents Forum announced that because of the school's low standard, they prefer to register pupils at state Jewish schools in their neighborhoods. The Education Ministry's district chief, Aharon Zavida, told Haaretz on Wednesday that he won't approve a massive transfer of Arab students to Jewish schools, even if they live in proximity to those, because he views the Arab junior high as "a separate registration area."

The Forum termed Zavida's statement "apartheid." The Mossawa Advocacy Center for Arab Citizens of Israel said it is illegal to prevent Arabs from freely registering for state schools in their neighborhood and announced it would go to court if the Education Ministry persists in its refusal.

MKs Roman Bronfman (Yahad) and Eitan Cabel (Labor) will join Barakeh's request, to be reviewed Monday by the Knesset Presidium.

A force called Mandela
"Ani Nakhon Lamut" ("I Am Prepared To Die") by Nelson Mandela, translated into Hebrew by Liora Wasserman, Nahar, 70 pages, NIS 42.
By Alon Liel	Jul. 16, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
More than 40 years have passed since Nelson Mandela delivered his speech defending himself before the South African court that sent him to prison to serve a life sentence. Yet his words are so relevant even today that the Israeli publishing house Nahar has seen fit - and justifiably so - to print them in Hebrew together with commentary and explanations. The central issue in that speech has certainly not lost any of its significance: Is political violence legitimate? This issue is relevant to both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the international context, especially in light of recent events in occupied Iraq.

In his profound and moving speech before the Pretoria Supreme Court in April 1964, Mandela argues that there are situations in which political violence is legitimate. His stormy life clearly attests to the fact that the use of force that he initiated in South Africa dramatically altered the course of events there and helped bring about the downfall of the country's apartheid regime. In extreme situations, claims Mandela, force is the last resort available to the victim but, when it is used, it must be monitored and controlled. This is unquestionably a complex, sensitive issue that raises questions that have not yet been resolved.

In his defense speech, Mandela offers the reasons for what appears today to be the most important decision in his life: a shift from a 50-year-old, nonviolent and unsuccessful political struggle to the use of force. The background to his decision consisted, of course, of the injustices of the apartheid system and the immense suffering undergone by his people. Apparently, Mandela does not really believe that he has much of a chance of persuading his judge, who is part of the apartheid system. Thus, his speech is addressed to the world and to future generations; his words, in effect, are also addressed to Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King (who was still alive when the speech was delivered), his spiritual "fathers" who taught him the philosophy of nonviolence that he ultimately decided to abandon.

For whites, too

Mandela made some very difficult decisions throughout his struggle against apartheid: the severing of ties with the aristocracy of his tribe and his decision to join the struggle against apartheid; the inclusion of whites in the African National Congress (ANC); the call for the imposition of sanctions on his own homeland; the launching of talks with the apartheid regime while he was still serving his prison sentence; the creation of a national unity government following his release from prison; and, finally, his decision to step down as president of South Africa, even though he still had the energy to continue his political career.

However, his most difficult and dramatic decision was made in 1961, when he decided to lead the blacks of South Africa in a violent struggle. The event that led him to alter his position so drastically was the 1960 massacre in the town of Sharpeville, when the apartheid army opened fire and killed 69 black demonstrators. Most of them were shot in the back as they joined others fleeing the police bullets.

Concerning the shift to the use of force, Mandela writes that it would be preferable for his movement to "guide" the violence according to principles aimed at saving human lives. If that sort of initiative is not taken, he reasoned, he and his movement might find themselves left behind in the struggle for a new South Africa, and be dragged after a political movement that might not be run under their leadership. He states that he was authorized to establish a military organization and that he and his organization would be taking a new path. He also notes the irony that, although he had never been a soldier, never participated in a battle and never fired a shot at an enemy, he must now create an army.

Throughout the entire struggle, Mandela felt he was fighting not just for the blacks of South Africa, but for the country's whites as well. In his eyes, the struggle was in the best long-range interests of both oppressor and oppressed, and he was convinced that the downfall of racism would benefit both sides. He did not regard every manifestation of violence as terrorism. The controlled violence he instituted in South Africa seems almost like child's play in contrast with the horrible events that have occurred in Israel over the past three decades.

Mandela speaks of a violence that does not lead to the loss of human life, something that seems almost like science fiction from our Middle Eastern perspective. He instructs his troops never to plan in advance to injure or kill human beings. Even in the course of an operation, his soldiers are under strict orders not to kill or even physically harm anyone. In fact, most of the offensives launched by the Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation, or MK for short), the black liberation army of South Africa, were low-key attacks on public buildings and strategic targets that symbolized apartheid. Although some people did die in the attacks, these deaths were the exception to the rule. Mandela exercised almost total control of the height of the flames, even from his prison cell.

Appalled by the PLO

During my term of ambassadorship to South Africa, I talked about political violence with "Tokyo" Skawala, one of the prominent younger leaders of the MK and, later, the ANC. He is today a leading member of South Africa's business community. Skawala relates that, in the 1970s, members of the MK and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) trained together at the same camps in what was once the Communist Bloc and in southern Lebanon, and engaged in many conversations about the level of violence. Skawala recalls how angry he and his colleagues in the MK were when Palestinians took hostages and killed schoolchildren. He and his colleagues repeatedly told the members of the PLO that they were blackening the name of struggles for national liberation. The MK trainees were appalled by the cruelty of the PLO.

As everyone knows, these conversations had no impact on the Palestinians, who maintained and even ratcheted up the level of violence of their operations, moving on from skyjackings to the bombing of buses and suicide bombings in crowded public areas. The Palestinians saw no relevance in Mandela's doctrine of controlled violence and it is regrettable that, in his more mature years, Mandela, who has received such universal praise, has not seen fit to reiterate in Palestinian forums what his warriors angrily told Palestinian militants 30 years ago.

"I Am Prepared to Die" is first and foremost a lesson in visionary leadership, the kind that flourishes in a major crisis. The Palestinian people has not yet found such a mega-charismatic leader as Nelson Mandela; however, Palestinian suffering will not continue forever. Judging from the South African experience, the eroding and bloody suffering of an entire nation ultimately connects with a great leader who will bring the suffering to an end. A wise, cool-headed leader, who will appear one of these days, will know how to lead the Palestinian people to the right path of action and will know how to liberate it from its suffering. We must realize that everyone will benefit from the emergence of a Palestinian Nelson Mandela, whose wisdom will always triumph over emotion and who will openly declare that the liberation of the Palestinians will benefit both nations.

Israel as well needs a leader capable of understanding the hearts and souls of both warring sides. An Israeli Nelson Mandela must be able to convince the Israeli public that, as long as the Palestinians are not free, we will also be the prisoners of the dispute. Such a leader will have to be capable of explaining to us that if we oppose the Palestinians' right to liberty, their victory, when it arrives, will be our defeat.

"I Am Prepared to Die" is one of the most important and most courageous speeches ever delivered in the 20th century. Granted, the speech did not spare Mandela a long prison term or the destruction of his private life. Nonetheless, it presented him, before both the South African public and the world, as a politician with a clearly defined platform and with supreme leadership abilities. In an era when Joseph Trumpeldor's famous and often quoted phrase, "It is good to die for our country," is now the subject of a controversy here in Israel, it is extremely important that a book like "I Am Prepared to Die" should be read by both Israeli and Palestinian adolescents. Just reading it can reduce the level of violence between the two nations.

"I Am Prepared to Die" is the precise opposite of "A Guide for Suicide Bombers," and it is also the precise opposite of incitement to violence. The book is an important guide to life, liberty and fraternity.

"Black Justice: The South African Upheaval" by Dr. Alon Liel, Israel's first ambassador to a democratic South Africa, has been published in Tel Aviv by Hakibbutz Hameuchad.

Points of friction
Public and legal discussions of the separation fence all mainly focus on the route, the exact positioning of the barriers and walls that are supposed to bring security to Israel's citizens. There is very little talk about the crossing points.

Public and legal discussions of the separation fence all mainly focus on the route, the exact positioning of the barriers and walls that are supposed to bring security to Israel's citizens. There is very little talk about the crossing points in the fence. Where are they? Who will use them and what procedures will this entail? How will the location and organization of the fence crossing points affect the lives of Israeli and Palestinian residents who use them?

There are economic, social, political and security issues involved here. The various reports that have been released mention some 40 planned crossings along the length of the fence. Some already exist, some will be located in familiar places where there are now roadblocks, and some are already under construction. There are no specific plans for all of them, mainly because the final route of the fence has yet to be determined. But there is at least one area, in northeast Jerusalem, about which it may be said that planners are at a loss for what to do. They simply don't know how they will be able to arrange the transfer of people and merchandise between the two sides in a reasonable way.

A new study by the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies, by Kobi Michael and Amnon Ramon, voices a clear warning: the crossings in the Jerusalem area may become an acute problem. Long lines and large crowds will focus international attention on the sites and worsen the economic situation of the Palestinian population on both sides of the fence.

According to data gathered from various sources, the separation fence will have four kinds of crossings. The first one, and perhaps the most important one, is a cargo terminal. This is a crossing points for goods, not people, much like the existing one at the Karni checkpoint in the Gaza Strip. In other words, here trucks, Israeli and Palestinian, do not cross the border, but goods are transferred from one vehicle to another using what is known as the "back-to-back" method. Responsibility for and operation of these cargo terminals is in the hands of the Israel Airports Authority and the Ministry of Transportation.

Five cargo terminals are planned: the al-Jalameh terminal north of Jenin, which already exists; Sha'ar Efraim, adjacent to Tul Karm, in an advanced stage of construction; the Atarot terminal northeast of Jerusalem, in the planning stage; the Mizmoriya terminal in southern Jerusalem, adjacent to the Har Homa neighborhood, on the outskirts of Bethlehem and Beit Sahur, in the planning stage; and the Tarqumiya terminal in western Mount Hebron, which already exists. Three of these crossings are located on the border of the Green Line (Jalameh, Sha'ar Efraim and Tarqumiya); the other two are located in West Bank territory annexed to Israel along with East Jerusalem. The cargo terminals will also have facilities nearby for the transfer of construction materials and gasoline, which do not pass through the usual terminals.

The other type of crossing is for Israeli vehicles, through which Jewish residents of the territories and anyone else with Israeli identity cards (not including East Jerusalem Arabs) will pass. Israelis passing through these points will travel in cars, as distinguished from the parallel facility intended for Palestinians. Very few vehicles with license plates from the territories will approach these crossings. Those regularly traversing them (primarily Jewish residents of the territories) will be able to obtain an electronic card that will allow rapid passage of the car and passengers with hardly any inspection.

The crossing points for Israeli vehicles will be located at Mehola in the northern Jordan Valley; next to Baka al-Garbiyeh, to serve residents of Hermesh and Mevo Dotan; next to the town of Faroun, on the edge of Tul Karm, for residents of Avnei Hefetz and Einav; next to Alfei Menashe south of Qalqilyah, to allow contact with the settlements southwest of Nablus (it is still unclear what the arrangements will be here; they depend on the route of the fence in the vicinity of Ariel); next to Elkana on the Trans-Samaria Highway; next to Rantis and Beit Arye, for the communities of Halamish, Ateret and Talmonim, west of Ramallah; next to Kiryat Sefer, adjacent to Modi'in, to serve Nili and Na'aleh; next to Maccabim and next to Beit Horon, on Highway No. 443, which leads to Givat Ze'ev and Jerusalem. There will be additional crossing points for Israelis in Gush Etzion and Mount Hebron.

The third type of crossing is intended for Palestinians. In the West Bank, there is almost total separation of Israeli and Palestinian vehicular traffic. Some refer to this as "the apartheid road system": These are roads, which Palestinians are prohibited from driving on, to prevent them from setting up ambushes for Israeli travelers. Sometimes one hears soldiers and officers using another, despicable term: "sterile roads." The crossing points for Palestinians are located in many cases close to, and in some cases, right next to the crossing points for Israelis - but they are totally separate. Inspection of Palestinians at these points takes a long time, sometimes hours, and therefore they usually have no choice, but to cross on foot and leave their cars behind.

It is possible to add to these crossings a fourth type. They are the "agricultural gates" intended to serve Palestinian farmers at designated hours, depending on the season. These most problematic crossings for Palestinians will be in the vicinity of Jerusalem, especially in the northeastern part of the city - at Qalandiyah, for example. The number of people seeking to traverse them each day will be very large.

According to Palestinian estimates, there are tens of thousands of passersby throughout the day, including close to 20,000 students, all of whom want to cross between 7 and 8 A.M. It is impossible to conduct a security check on all of them. At the Erez checkpoint in the Gaza Strip, when 5,000-10,000 workers had to cross each morning, some would arrive as early as 1 or 2 A.M., so that they could get to the other side by 5 A.M. What will happen if something goes wrong at the checkpoint, someone goes wild or attempts to perpetrate an attack, or if there are reports that a terrorist is trying to cross? Will officials close the crossing and paralyze the lives of the 230,000 Jerusalem Arabs?

After the High Court of Justice ruling on the route of the fence from Maccabim to Givat Ze'ev, the question arises of how it is even possible to build fences and security walls within the populated neighborhoods of East Jerusalem - and at the same time maintain a normal semblance of life in the area. The obvious answer is: It is impossible.

Colonel (res.) Shaul Arieli, who specializes in the issue of the separation fence and is active in the effort by the Council for Peace and Security to change its route, estimates that a huge investment of hundreds of millions of shekels will be needed to build suitable control points for Arabs in Jerusalem - and even then, there is no guarantee that it will solve the problem.

When discussing the section of the fence that runs near the Green Line, the separation is between Israelis and Palestinians. But in the Jerusalem region, more than in other places, the separation is actually between Palestinians and Palestinians. In this case, the security contribution of the fence is inherently questionable and when so many Palestinians will have to pass through the crossings each day in such conditions, it's hard to conceive of procedures that will be reasonable and effective.

Israel to sideline EU after UN vote on security fence
Israel made clear to senior European officials at United Nations headquarters yesterday that "it will be very difficult in the future to include the EU as a party in efforts to advance the peace process," after the European Union joined the sweeping majority that passed an extreme resolution on the separation fence.

NEW YORK - Israel made clear to senior European officials at United Nations headquarters yesterday that "it will be very difficult in the future to include the EU as a party in efforts to advance the peace process," after the European Union joined the sweeping majority that passed an extreme resolution on the separation fence.

In a round of talks with EU representatives, Israeli diplomats stated that "the atmosphere created at the UN following passage of a one-sided resolution makes it doubtful that the EU, UN, and Quartet will be able to play the role of honest broker."

Israel said that by backing the resolution, "EU countries ignored even Israel's right to defend itself. How can Israel place its future in your hands?"

The new United States ambassador to the UN, John Danforth, declared the resolution "utterly one-sided," since it "refrains from mentioning the threat of terror hovering over Israel."

Danforth added that the resolution "is part of a long series of one-sided resolutions passed by the assembly, and which contributed nothing to advancing peace in the Middle East."

Several European ambassadors tried to assuage Israel's anger. "We succeeded in balancing the wording of the resolution," a senior European diplomat told an Israeli colleague.

Senior EU officials also pledged that "we won't support additional measures that [Nasser] al-Kidwa is planning," referring to the PLO observer to the UN.

The resolution submitted by the Arab group passed Tuesday by a wide margin, with 150 member nations in favor, 6 against, and 10 abstaining. The six voting against were the U.S., Israel, Australia, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau.

A resolution passed by the assembly is non-binding and has mostly symbolic significance. However from Israel's standpoint, this is a severe resolution through which the PLO is striving to create the basis for intensifying Israel's isolation and sanctions against it, like those imposed on South Africa under apartheid.

Furthermore, on the matter of the separation fence, the UN assembly will now wield what diplomats yesterday called "a whip dangled in front of Israel," to be lifted whenever the Palestinians see fit.

Diplomats and commentators in New York speculated that al-Kidwa will not call upon the Security Council to convene before US elections in November, but will request in September that the emergency session of the assembly reconvene to discuss Israel's ongoing refusal to comply with Tuesday's resolution.

The vote's tally was interpreted as a stinging diplomatic blow to Israel. By contrast, the fact that the majority included nations that are deemed quality members was seen as an impressive diplomatic achievement by al-Kidwa.

In recent days, al-Kidwa orchestrated a focused and exceptionally skilled diplomatic effort behind the scenes, particularly vis-a-vis EU nations, which resulted in one of the most pro-Palestinian votes in UN history.

Veteran commentators observed that Israel also engaged in energetic diplomatic activity to reduce the extent of the expected majority and to increase the number of abstentions.

Diplomatic sources singled out efforts by Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom, who met with European counterparts until the last minute to persuade them to abstain. Shalom "said harsh things" to them, according to sources, and was especially forceful during a meeting Tuesday with the Dutch foreign minister, who is the current EU president.

A mere hour before the vote, EU ambassadors agreed that their 25 members would abstain, and the Dutch ambassador even rushed to inform al-Kidwa of this decision. At the last moment, however, France backed by Sweden blocked a final decision to abstain and pushed fellow members to support the resolution.

"It was the French connection that delivered Europeans' support for the resolution," a Western diplomat who wished to remain anonymous told Haaretz yesterday. "In behind-the-scene negotiations over the wording of the resolution, it was sometimes hard to distinguish between the eagerness of the PLO observer al-Kidwa and that displayed by French Ambassador [Jean-Marc de la] Sabliere," the diplomat added.

Commentators in New York said France's position might have been influenced by their fury over Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's call for French Jews to move to Israel.

EU officials explained their vote by citing al-Kidwa's last minute consent to modify the wording by adding a clause demanding that the Palestinians "take visible measures to stop and prevent individuals or organizations from planning or carrying out violent acts."

For the sake of balance, another clause demanded that Israel "refrain from taking steps that undermine trust - including deportation and counter-offensives against civilians - and cease

illegal acts of killing."

Presbyterians divest themselves from Israel
The church will boycott Israeli products and U.S. firms investing here.
By Nathan Guttman	| Jul. 22, 2004 | 12:00 AM |   1
		 submit to reddit	
WASHINGTON - The Presbyterian Church's 216th General Assembly caught American Jewish organizations off guard and by surprise. The Presbyterians have never concealed their criticism of Israeli policies in the territories, but years of dialogue between Jews and Presbyterians had created an impression of an understanding between the communities.

Hence U.S. Jewish leaders were astonished to find that the Presbyterian Church has adopted the most censorious decisions ever embraced by any Christian denomination in the United States against Israel.

The Presbyterian Church has three million American members and is one of the strongest denominations in the country. This time it did more than issue declarations condemning Israel's occupation of the territories. In a precedent setting decision, it took practical steps to halt investments in Israel, and to discourage contacts with companies that do business in Israel.

Divestment decisions regarding Israel have in the past three years been reached by academic and research bodies in the U.S., but these have mostly been small institutions with limited economic clout. Their calls for divestment have had a marginal economic impact. Now, for the first time, a significant religious entity that controls large sums of money and commands the beliefs of millions of followers has called for the imposition of economic sanctions on Israel.

"By reaching this decision we want to make sure that we are not investing in activities of the kind we are trying to prevent. We see so much violence, and we want to assure ourselves that we have nothing to do with it," said Jay Rock, coordinator for Interfaith Relations at the Presbyterian church. Rock said the new divestment policy is motivated by more than a desire to insulate and detach Presbyterians from the violent Israeli-Palestinian dispute - his church also has an affirmative desire to "make our voice heard about the direction of Israeli policy."

The Presbyterian General Assembly convenes once every two years. The recent meeting was held in Richmond, Virginia. As is customary, a human rights survey was presented at the assembly and the report accused Israel of human rights violations in the territories.

The divestment proposal was forwarded by a Presbyterian delegate from Florida. The assembly's Peacemaking Committee confirmed the proposal, and brought it to the floor of the assembly plenum for a vote. The decision to divest from Israel was passed by a resounding majority of 431 to 62.

Tracking Caterpillar

Israeli delegates were not invited to speak at the Presbyterian General Assembly. Rev. Mitri Raheb, from Bethlehem, appeared before the delegates. This Bethlehem cleric urged the Presbyterians to sever economic ties with Israel. He singled out the tractor manufacturer Caterpillar, saying its products are used to raze Palestinian houses on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Sources in the Presbyterian Church said this week that they do not know whether their church has investments in Caterpillar.

The Presbyterian decision is economically significant. Well-informed sources say the Presbyterian Church commands more than seven billion dollars worth of financial instruments and pension funds. Most of this money is invested in companies and now, in keeping with the divestment decision, Presbyterian delegates will review each company's records to ascertain whether it has ties with Israel.

According to the General Assembly decision, any company which earns more than $1 million annually as a result of investments in Israel, or which invests more than $1 million a year in Israel, will be entered on a blacklist prepared for the church's leaders - the Presbyterians are likely to divest from any company that appears on this list.

While the Presbyterian decision's likely economic impact is not negligible, the American Jewish community is more concerned about the principle inherent in the policy. "This is a new phase of aggressive behavior in the expression of their feelings toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," said Rabbi Gary Bretton-Granatoor, Interfaith Director for the Anti-Defamation League.

He said that while the ADL and other American Jewish organizations maintain contacts with the Presbyterian church, the denomination's leaders did not inform the American Jewish leadership about preparations for the divestment policy - nor did the Presbyterians give the organized American Jewish community a chance to respond to the developments at their General Assembly.

Along with ADL National Director Abraham Foxman, Rabbi Bretton-Granatoor sent a strongly worded letter to the leader of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S., Dr. Clifton Kirkpatrick, saying that they feel hurt by the General Assembly's divestment decision. They criticized the Presbyterians for drawing a comparison between the situation in Israel and former apartheid South Africa. The letter also attacked a call by the Presbyterians for an end to construction of the separation fence.

Despite the Presbyterian divestment decision in Richmond, many American Jewish leaders point out that there has been productive cooperation with this church, particularly in the realm of human rights. "Up to 1967 they were Israel's best friends, because they always support the underdog," says Bretton-Granatoor. "After that they started seeing Israel as a superpower."

Directed divestment

In the aftermath of the storm over the divestment decision, the Presbyterian church plans to issue a clarifying statement soon, saying that it will not boycott every company that has investments in Israel, or earns profits from business with Israel.

The intention is to provide boycott exemptions to companies or entities which deal in education, social welfare and construction in Israel. The Presbyterians want to direct the divestment policy toward "companies that might cause damage and hurt the peace process," as Jay Rock phrases it.

In parallel, an effort will be made to mend breaches with the Jewish community. Up to now, American Jewish professionals complain, Presbyterian replies to objections about the new divestment policy have been evasive and unsatisfactory.

"We need to engage and think together how these two communities, which both want to bring peace to the region, can think together about ways to do it," says Rock. He said: "It's clear that tension exists right now, but I hope that an opportunity for dialogue will emerge from this."

Yet, the thrust of statements made by Rock's counterpart, ADL Interfaith director Bretton-Granatoor, casts doubt on this hope of future dialogue. "It is accepted that reasonable people will ask questions and be critical - but they have proposed drastic measures and a blanket approach, without trying to balance or consult with the other side," Bretton-Granatoor says.

Unlike other denominations in the U.S., the Presbyterian church does not have a mass membership. Yet it is considered a highly influential church, largely because its members include people with clout in spheres such as politics and economics.

In recent years, the pro-Israel community in America has come to rely increasingly on the support of the Evangelical church, which has a mass following of some 50 million believers and whose leaders are outspoken proponents of Israel's right to occupy the territories, at least until the Second Coming. This "Christian Zionism" approach was criticized at the Presbyterian General Assembly which concluded that it has no clear theological foundation.

Will the Presbyterian decision encourage other denominations to adopt divestment policies? American Jewish leaders do not seem concerned about such a falling of dominoes. The Catholic Church, the largest Christian group in the U.S. and the world, is currently drawing closer to Israel. Various Protestant denominations in the U.S. periodically criticize Israeli policies in the territories but do not seem to have divestment decisions on their agenda.

Another decision reached by the Presbyterian General Assembly has little to do with Israel, but has incensed the American Jewish community. By a 260 to 233 vote, the assembly authorized continued funding and support for the Avodat Yisrael church in Philadelphia, which tries to convert Jews to Christianity.

Jewish activists have in the past demanded that this missionary group, which describes its purposes as "messianic," desist from its activities - they have objected that Avodat Yisrael uses duplicitous tactics - among other things, allegedly posing as a Jewish institution.

FM: EU vote encourages PA to avoid fighting terror
By The Associated Press	and Shlomo Shamir Haaretz Service	| Jul. 22, 2004 | 12:00 AM

Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom said Thursday that this week's European vote supporting a UN General Assembly resolution against the separation fence encourages the Palestinians to continue avoiding their obligation to fight terrorism.

He made the comments during a joint press conference in Tel Aviv with European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana after meeting with him for an hour.

Click here to join a discussion on the fence.

"The government and people of Israel are deeply disappointed by Europe's decision to vote with the Palestinians and against the fence," Shalom said.

"The EU should be engaged in promoting Palestinian reform in Gaza and Ramallah, not Palestinian manipulation in the UN," the foreign minister said, adding that Europe's vote "encourages the Palestinians to continue their evasion of responsibility" on fighting terror.

"Of course, it's necessary to support the UN and its principles, but not to permit a cynical use of the UN," Shalom said.

Solana, meanwhile, said the West Bank separation fence violates international law, and dismissed the contention that Europe is anti-Israel.

"A country has the right to build a fence on its own territory, but we believe the route of this fence is contrary to international law," Solana said at the press conference.

He said he knows the fence has saved lives, but that it could also have saved lives if it had been constructed within the Green Line. "No single European country is against Israel," Solana said.

Solana's comments came just two days after the European Union infuriated Israeli leaders by supporting the General Assembly resolution calling on Israel to tear down the fence in compliance with the International Court of Justice ruling issued earlier this month.

Earlier Thursday, an Israeli official said Israel had decided to give Solana an especially "difficult and cold reception" during his visit to Tel Aviv.

Although Shalom met with Solana as planned, scheduled meetings and photo opportunities involving Solana and other government officials have been canceled.

Solana is on a four-day regional tour to Israel, Jordan and Egypt, but he will not visit the Palestinian Authority.

Israel made clear to senior European officials at United Nations headquarters Wednesday that "it will be very difficult in the future to include the EU as a party in efforts to advance the peace process," after the European Union joined the sweeping majority that passed a General Assembly resolution condemning the West Bank separation fence.

Senior Israeli and EU officials met Thursday in Tel Aviv to discuss the matter after the Foreign Ministry summoned European ambassadors for consultations, lambasting the EU for supporting the United Nations resolution.

Foreign Ministry director-general Ilan Biran summoned the ambassadors to express Israel's displeasure over the European position on the fence, the ministry said in a statement.

The European Union vote shows it is "willing to pay the price of the basic principles of justice and morality and raises doubts about the European Union's ability to contribute constructively to the advance of the peace process," the statement said.

The European support "even encourages Palestinian terrorism," according to the statement.

Under the resolution passed Tuesday, the General Assembly demands that Israel comply with the ruling of the International Court of Justice that the fence built on Palestinian land was illegal and should be torn down. The resolution also demands that Israel pay reparations for damages caused by construction of the barrier.

In a round of talks with EU representatives, Israeli diplomats said Wednesday that "the atmosphere created at the UN following passage of a one-sided resolution makes it doubtful that the EU, UN and Quartet will be able to play the role of honest broker."

Israel said that by backing the resolution, "EU countries ignored even Israel's right to defend itself. How can Israel place its future in your hands?"

But Labor Party chairman Shimon Peres said Thursday that Israel should tone down its criticism of the resolution, saying countries around the world had begun a quiet boycott of Israeli products, Israel Radio reported.

Meanwhile, the new United States ambassador to the UN, John Danforth, declared the resolution "utterly one-sided," since it "refrains from mentioning the threat of terror hovering over Israel."

Danforth added that the resolution "is part of a long series of one-sided resolutions passed by the assembly, and which contributed nothing to advancing peace in the Middle East."

Several European ambassadors tried to assuage Israel's anger. "We succeeded in balancing the wording of the resolution," a senior European diplomat told an Israeli colleague.

Senior EU officials also pledged that "we won't support additional measures that [Nasser] al-Kidwa is planning," referring to the PLO observer to the UN.

The resolution submitted by the Arab group passed Tuesday by a wide margin, with 150 member nations in favor, 6 against, and 10 abstaining. The six voting against were the U.S., Israel, Australia, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau.

A resolution passed by the assembly is non-binding and has mostly symbolic significance. However, from Israel's standpoint, this is a severe resolution through which the PLO is striving to create the basis for intensifying Israel's isolation and sanctions against it, like those imposed on South Africa under apartheid.

Furthermore, on the matter of the separation fence, the UN assembly will now wield what diplomats Wednesday called "a whip dangled in front of Israel," to be lifted whenever the Palestinians see fit.

Diplomats and commentators in New York speculated that al-Kidwa will not call upon the Security Council to convene before US elections in November, but will request in September that the emergency session of the assembly reconvene to discuss Israel's ongoing refusal to comply with Tuesday's resolution.

The vote's tally was interpreted as a stinging diplomatic blow to Israel. By contrast, the fact that the majority included nations that are deemed quality members was seen as an impressive diplomatic achievement by al-Kidwa.

In recent days, al-Kidwa orchestrated a focused and exceptionally skilled diplomatic effort behind the scenes, particularly vis-a-vis EU nations, which resulted in one of the most pro-Palestinian votes in UN history.

Veteran commentators observed that Israel also engaged in energetic diplomatic activity to reduce the extent of the expected majority and to increase the number of abstentions.

Diplomatic sources singled out efforts by Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom, who met with European counterparts until the last minute to persuade them to abstain. Shalom "said harsh things" to them, according to sources, and was especially forceful during a meeting Tuesday with the Dutch foreign minister, who is the current EU president.

A mere hour before the vote, EU ambassadors agreed that their 25 members would abstain, and the Dutch ambassador even rushed to inform al-Kidwa of this decision. At the last moment, however, France backed by Sweden blocked a final decision to abstain and pushed fellow members to support the resolution.

"It was the French connection that delivered Europeans' support for the resolution," a Western diplomat who wished to remain anonymous told Haaretz on Wednesday. "In behind-the-scene negotiations over the wording of the resolution, it was sometimes hard to distinguish between the eagerness of the PLO observer al-Kidwa and that displayed by French Ambassador [Jean-Marc de la] Sabliere," the diplomat added.

Commentators in New York said France's position might have been influenced by their fury over Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's call for French Jews to move to Israel.

EU officials explained their vote by citing al-Kidwa's last minute consent to modify the wording by adding a clause demanding that the Palestinians "take visible measures to stop and prevent individuals or organizations from planning or carrying out violent acts."

For the sake of balance, another clause demanded that Israel "refrain from taking steps that undermine trust - including deportation and counter-offensives against civilians - and cease illegal acts of killing."

Solana: UN vote on fence was 'victory of EU policy'
EU foreign policy chief tells Haaretz that vote proves joint, homogenous foreign policy possible even after EU's enlargement.

European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana sees last week's vote by the Europeans on a United Nations resolution on the West Bank separation fence as the victory of the coherence and efficiency of Europe's foreign and defense policy.

In an interview with Haaretz, Solana said that "the vote proves that a joint, homogenous foreign policy is possible even after the EU's enlargement, with the addition in May of 10 states from east and central Europe. In our vote, we presented joint superior values and policy lines, which we intend to promote internationally."

The resolution submitted by the Arab group passed Tuesday by a wide margin, with 150 member nations in favor, 6 against, and 10 abstaining. The six voting against were the U.S., Israel, Australia, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau.

A resolution passed by the assembly is non-binding and has mostly symbolic significance. However from Israel's standpoint, this is a severe resolution through which the PLO is striving to create the basis for intensifying Israel's isolation and sanctions against it, like those imposed on South Africa under apartheid.

Solana dismisses the arguments that the EU states were influenced in the vote by France's vindictiveness. "One could understand that the French were hurt by Sharon's call for French Jews to immigrate to Israel, but that had nothing to do with the vote in the UN. To say that shows a basic lack of understanding of the union's mechanism," he states.

"The fact that no European state abstained from the vote derives from the fact that the EU is a political union." To demonstrate, Solana - a physics professor - says, "the EU is not a rabble of states. It is a sort of molecule with joint electrons. These enable all of us to act together and make binding political decisions."

Solana notes that the states that hope to join the EU in the future - like Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania and the Balkans - joined the European consensus in the UN vote as though it were self-evident. "The significance of the vote is in protecting the UN's multilateral values. We attribute supreme importance to the UN's three basic elements - the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Court - and believe the organization must play a more significant and important role."

The silent majority must speak
Do we dare hope that the Jewish majority will come to its senses and once again view the attitude toward Arabs as a national challenge, a test of its humanism; will it return to its sources - the Declaration of Independence and the founders of Zionism, who at least declared that they were striving for a humane Jewish country?

Quite a lot has been written in Israeli newspapers against the Knesset's passage of a legislative amendment that prevents Palestinians from the territories from becoming naturalized citizens, thereby severely restricting the freedom of Arab citizens to marry. Many also came out in opposition to other expressions of racism against Arabs - both on the part of political parties and public bodies and on the part of Jewish citizens. Many didn't buy the security excuse that the government and its faithful followers tried to sell to the public to justify displays of racism.

These condemnations are important not only for Arab ears, but also, primarily, for a Jewish conscience. They inspire appreciation in every humane person.

But that is not enough. The Knesset passed the racist law by a crushing majority, and the Attorney General, who is supposed to stand guard and block any racist phenomenon, took it upon himself to minimize the damage inflicted by the law without harming its essence. Shinui, the party that is the standard bearer for liberal values, folded and abstained from voting. The people's elected representatives defended the law with gusto.

This is merely one of the expressions of racism that are multiplying in Israeli society. The Education Ministry bans Arab students in Haifa from enrolling at the city's state schools because they are reserved for Jews only. TV's Channel 2 runs a promo for a segment on disabled Arab children being thrown out of their special-ed school in Hadera. And the ink is still wet on results of a Haifa University survey that found that some 60 percent of Jews believe the government should encourage Arabs to leave the country (just two years ago the rate of support for transfer was 31 percent).

These figures, and many like them, send a clear message to Arabs in Israel: "Your existence is in jeopardy." Existence is something you fight for. You don't remain silent. You don't sit idly by.

It's no secret that Israeli Arabs are greatly conflicted today over the question of how to run this war. Some are contemplating an appeal to the United Nations and recruiting international solidarity, in the wake of which Israel would become a target for condemnations and boycotts like the apartheid regime in South Africa. Some are contemplating a grassroots struggle - strikes, demonstrations that could lead who knows where, but somewhere unlikely to be to the credit of Israel or its Arab citizens.

There are some, however, who are contemplating a comprehensive, joint Jewish-Arab struggle, not only against these phenomena, but in general to promote the creation of a country that is sane, tolerant, egalitarian, similar to developed countries throughout the world. It's hard to tell which camp will prevail. Among Israeli Arabs, there is no dearth of sincere and justified anger. There are plenty of blusterers. There is no shortage of reasons to justify any reaction in their eyes. The question is, how will the Jewish majority in the State of Israel treat this struggle? Its stances, built up and nurtured by Israeli governments over 55 years, today encourage the government not only to absolve itself from its commitment to equality, but to intensify discrimination and racism. The law that forces an Israeli Arab to choose between his homeland and the Palestinian woman he loves is one example among many.

How will the Jewish majority react to the Arabs' fight against these phenomena? Will it act as other peoples have acted in the history of the Jewish people? Will it be drawn in by the illusion that the deterioration of the struggle with Israel's Arabs provides an opportunity to carry out the transfer plan? Or do we dare hope that the Jewish majority will come to its senses and once again view the attitude toward Arabs as a national challenge, a test of its humanism; will return to its sources - the Declaration of Independence and the founders of Zionism, who at least declared that they were striving for a humane Jewish country, a true democracy.

`It's a myth that we are anti-Israel'
South Africa's new ambassador in Tel Aviv says he's serious about rebuilding the relationship between the two countries, but says the onus is on Israel.
By Peter Hirschberg	Aug. 2, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Major General Fumanekile Gqiba unhesitatingly confesses he had absolutely no desire to come to Israel. He was ready, he says, "to go anywhere in the world, but not Israel."

The preference of the new South African ambassador has nothing to do with the fact that some of "the technology used by the apartheid regime was supplied by Israel." Nor, that he "rubbed shoulders" with the Palestinians as "comrades in the liberation movement" when he was in exile.

After 30 years of struggling to free his own country of white minority rule, the chaplain general of the South African defense forces, who was picked by President Thabo Mbeki as his country's new ambassador to Israel, did not want to land up in another conflict-ridden region. "I wanted to relax. I thought these conflict situations for me were over. I've done my time. I wanted to be like any ordinary ambassador - relaxing, enjoying life with your family. But," he grins, "as a disciplined member of the ANC, I said `I'll give it a go.' And here I am."

This undiplomatic admission is not a momentary slip of the tongue. The diminutive, straight-talking former commander in Umkhonto We Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the armed wing of the African National Congress, is not fettered by the carefully constructed utterances of career diplomats cautious not to offend. He has been dispatched by his president to build a new relationship with Israel, but the government of Israel, he emphasizes, should not "question our relationship with the Palestinians" and must remember that Israel was once "part and parcel of the old regime [in South Africa]. They supported them until the last. So they cannot overnight expect us to be kissing their cheeks. We have to build the relationship. And it's a two-way thing. We are serious about building this relationship, which was damaged by them, not by us."

His views on the West Bank separation fence, disengagement, Yasser Arafat and on young Israelis who refuse to serve in the territories are equally candid. But he is unwaveringly critical too, when quizzed about the manner in which the Palestinians are waging their struggle.

Gqiba's appointment - he submitted his credentials in late July - is meant to signal South Africa's desire to play a role in helping unlock the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and a recognition that this means engaging the government in power, even if it is headed by the Likud. Unlike his predecessors, who were all members of the diplomatic corps in the old South Africa, Gqiba is a member of the ruling ANC with credentials in the liberation struggle. In other words, an insider.

The new ambassador's access to the president and the foreign minister, says one South African official, shows "we are taking the crisis seriously and we think we will be able to help. This conflict will continue to create lots of tension between us, but the new ambassador will be good in helping to manage these tensions. His military background will enable him to understand the talk about security concerns. We have sent a clear signal to the Israelis. Now, will they respond positively?"

Israeli officials don't seem pressed to respond at all. It is Gqiba, they say, who must prove his country is able to see beyond its historical relationship with the Palestinians.

South Africa, they add, often sponsors resolutions critical of Israel at the UN. It also submitted an opinion on the separation fence to the International Court of Justice asserting that the barrier was a disproportionate response to "occasional and irregular attacks by lone operators."

When Yitzhak Rabin was leading the Oslo process in the mid-1990s, relations with the ANC, which had just won the first non-racial election in South Africa, improved dramatically. But since the start of the second intifada, in September 2000, and the ascendance of Ariel Sharon, relations have been frosty.

Sharon and Mbeki have met at least once, in Washington, but the meeting failed to produce any chemistry. Since Sharon took office over three years ago, not a single minister in his government has made an official visit to South Africa. Neither has a South African minister made an official visit to Israel during this period. The Israelis who have traveled to South Africa as guests of the government have been mainly left-wing politicians and peace activists. (Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is scheduled to become the first minister in the Sharon government to visit South Africa, in October.)

Sitting in his office on the 16th floor of Dizengoff Tower in Tel Aviv, flanked by a gray-bearded Mbeki peering out of a frame on the wall and a South African flag, Gqiba announces that his government wants to engage the right-wing government of Ariel Sharon. "I always say revolutions have stages," he says. "We feel we need to move further now. We want to talk to Sharon. This is the next stage. I expect more ministers to come here. I'm working on this. It's a myth that we are anti-Israel. We want to prove we're not. We want to share our experience with Israel. We are not going to impose. We're not saying `Do this because we did it.' We want to be partners with them toward the goal of peace."

But, he adds, it must be remembered that "we were once a liberation movement. We rubbed shoulders with the Palestinians. They were our comrades in the liberation movement. And that relationship is still there. It is our moral duty to continue with that. But our relationship with the Palestinians is a strategic one that ultimately will benefit the State of Israel."

`Never kill civilians'

For all his empathy with the Palestinians, and the role he played in his own armed struggle, Gqiba rebukes the Palestinians for the manner in which they are waging theirs. "Today, we are the only country, on moral grounds, which is able to say to the Palestinians, `You guys, we don't think your strategy of using suicide bombers is justified.' It is terrorism. It is not accepted by international law. It has nothing to do with the military code. We have said this openly. We don't support suicide bombings. We are clear on this.

"The military aspect of the struggle cannot become an end in itself. It has to be a means to a political goal. Whatever we did on the military side was to force the regime toward the ultimate goal - the political one, of negotiation. That's where the difference is. We were led by politicians. Not the military leading the struggle. The military element must not become an end in itself ... For the Palestinians, the military element has become the thing. The Palestinians need to pause. Every bomb that kills civilians is counterproductive [for them]. It undermines them. At this point, they should say, `We need to sit down. We need to talk.'"

During its campaign against the white government, the ANC directed its armed actions almost exclusively at military and infrastructure targets. The number of civilian casualties in armed operations was very low. "We were told, `Never, never kill civilians.' We used to say, `If you do, you will face a firing squad.' That's how we understood it. The aim was political and not military mobilization. With the Palestinians, the military dimension has become too dominant. Their targets are wrong. You cannot target civilians. We cannot support that."

What about striking at Israeli military targets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip?

Gqiba: "I don't want to be part and parcel of this war. I don't want to be involved. I want to end it. If the two sides do decide to fight, then it must be military versus military. It must not be against civilians.

"I have a young daughter and a young son here. When they go to any restaurant I want them to feel free. Not to be afraid of bombs. But at the same time the State of Israel should not target civilians. Collective punishment is totally unacceptable. How do you destroy a whole family. You destroy houses just because one person there belongs to the liberation movement, is a guerrilla. They're creating enemies. Both sides have lost the moral high ground. It's an eye for an eye. It's madness and they have to stop it."

Drawing again on the South African experience, Gqiba raps Israel for isolating Yasser Arafat. "If you want peace in this part of the world you need to talk to the Palestinians as equal partners. Don't talk to them as juniors. And you don't impose leaders. Everybody [here] hates Arafat. But we want to warn them, that this is exactly what the racist regime [in South Africa] used to say. They couldn't talk to Mandela because he was a terrorist. In the end, they were forced to talk to him. As long as Arafat is the elected leader, as long as he is accepted by the Palestinians, you must talk to him."

Many Israelis believe Arafat is no longer a partner because he is not prepared to make the compromises necessary for a two-state solution. That his ultimate goal is to wipe out the State of Israel.

"People are criticizing the PA, but Arafat is still part of the leadership. He has been elected by the people there. Let them go to elections and elect a new leader. But at this point in time Arafat is the leader and the Israeli state should not try to marginalize him. He is a prisoner. How do you ask a prisoner to take charge of security? It is better to negotiate with the devil you know. Arafat is part of the solution, not of the problem ... He recognizes the State of Israel. They must empower him."

Israelis say that if only there were a Palestinian Mandela, there would have been peace by now. What do you think?

"But the Palestinians are saying he [Arafat] is their Mandela. Let the people speak. Don't impose. If the people say tomorrow they don't want him, okay. The apartheid regime imposed the homeland leaders and it didn't work. Some Israeli leaders argue that when Arafat goes he will be replaced by more moderate leaders. That's what the white racist regime thought [about us]."

`Why the apartheid wall?'

Certainly not a man given to Delphic formulations, Gqiba does however sidestep one question in the almost two-hour interview - about parallels between Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and apartheid South Africa. "I'm on a learning curve. I would only like to comment on that when I've thoroughly studied the situation. I only know Tel Aviv and Jerusalem," he says.

"But," he adds, as if an internal alarm has been suddenly tripped by this momentary reticence, "the idea of a Greater Israel isn't going to work. It means you have to conquer somebody's land. It will never work. There must be clearly defined borders."

Gqiba converses easily. Sitting on the edge of a leather chair throughout the interview, he talks with his hands, fists clenched sometimes like a boxer, as he outlines his position. His informality is incongruous in the plush, official surroundings of the ambassador's office - enhanced by the wood-paneling on the walls and the panoramic, rooftop view of Tel Aviv, toward the ocean. Before the interview begins, his 12-year-old son sits flicking through the channels on the television set in the office as his father talks on the phone to South Africa, trying to convince someone high up in the country's telecommunications conglomerate, Telkom, to attend a conference in Israel. Throughout the interview, Gqiba's son sits in the ambassador's chair, behind his large wooden desk. By the end of the interview, he is fast asleep, his head resting on the desktop.

Born in 1951 in Langa, a township in Cape Town, Gqiba joined the ANC in 1970 and became a member of its military wing in 1972. He refuses to divulge the type of actions he undertook, saying only, with a chuckle, that they were well documented by the security services of the old regime.

During a visit to Lesotho in the 1980s, where his command was based, Gqiba was arrested by the local government, which was a South African proxy. He was held and tortured for 42 days. "The South Africans wanted us, but the United Nations intervened and we were allowed to leave for Lusaka, where the ANC had its headquarters in exile."

An Anglican priest by training, Gqiba established the religious desk of the ANC in exile and regularly visited the movement's military bases in Angola, Tanzania and Uganda. He returned to South Africa in 1993, just before the ANC came to power. In 1998, he became the chaplain general of the South African National Defense Forces.

In South Africa there is a still marginal, but growing voice - among NGOs and in some intellectual circles - calling on the government to reevaluate its support for a two-state solution to the conflict in the Middle East. An article, penned by a Jewish South African and published recently in the influential Business Day, argued that in South Africa, as in Israel, "there was an attempt to portray our divisions as a conflict between two nations which could be solved only if they were separated. But here, the resistance would have none of it, insisting on an inclusive society in which the rights of all are recognized. All of which makes our government's continued support for separation as a solution all the more puzzling."

Gqiba says he is unmoved by those sounding the death knell of the two-state idea. His government still supports this solution and has been told by Palestinian leaders that they do too. "Who are we to come and say we want a one-state solution. We want to support what the people on the ground have accepted. It would be total arrogance for us to say how it should be done ... We said South Africa belongs to all who live in it - black and white. But our solution might not be applicable in other countries. We're not going to say, `If we did it, why can't you do it?'"

Gqiba might express support for the two-state model, but he is distinctly unenthusiastic about two other Israeli measures aimed at divorcing the two peoples: the separation fence and the disengagement plan, at least the unilateral version espoused by Sharon. He wants to see Israel exit Gaza, but says its departure should be negotiated with the Palestinians. "Israel is not supposed to be there. These are Palestinian lands. So, it's a good move to get out. But they should consult the people affected."

He is riled by the fence, which is often referred to in the South African media as the "apartheid wall." If it makes Israelis feel safer, he might accept it, but "why don't they build it in their own territory?

"We are talking here about cousins. I don't know why the cousins should be out to destroy each other. In South Africa the struggle was clear - against the white racist enemy. I've been here three weeks and up to this point I can't distinguish between a Jew and an Arab. They're cousins. Why should the cousins have an apartheid wall. It's like the Berlin Wall. It separates families. But let's say it's temporary, then why doesn't Israel build it on its own land. The bottom line is that we cannot accept it."

Many in the ANC have viewed Zionism as a colonial movement. Do you?

"Now that I'm in Israel I will need to understand further and then I'll be able to comment. If Zionism means discrimination against others, I'll have problems with that. But if Zionism has nothing to do with discrimination, I might support it. Anything that is exclusive I have serious problems with. But if it's inclusive I don't.

"The State of Israel is here to stay. So the Jewish authorities should not try to exaggerate the threat. They need to reach out to friends. The friends will stand with them. Rather than going into the laager like the Boers. There is no threat, but they like to exaggerate it to get some sympathy. But nobody will destroy the State of Israel. Nobody has the capacity to do that."

In South Africa there was an effective anti-conscription campaign, led by young Whites who refused to serve in the military because they opposed minority rule. What is your view of Israeli soldiers who refuse to serve in the West Bank and Gaza?

How do you send soldiers into occupied areas to continue suppressing the people ... Some of these [Israeli] youngsters are sent there to do this work of collective punishment. It's totally unacceptable. I sympathize with them and I understand why they don't do that.

Do you have a relationship with the South African Jewish community?

"For two weeks before I came, I met with leaders of the Jewish community. The people [in the community] who used to call us terrorists have moved aside. Now you have young leaders. You have people with a vision.

"If you go back in our history, our heroes were Jewish people. [Former head of the South African Communist Party] Joe Slovo. The current minister of intelligence, Ronnie Kasrils. These people were part of the struggle. [Chief Justice] Arthur Chaskalson, [Supreme Court Justice] Albie Sachs. And they were branded as terrorists by their own people."

Religion was not at the heart of the struggle in South Africa. That is not the case here in the Middle East.

I go to church on Sundays. I'm looking for a church here. I am not a fundamentalist. I'm flexible because I know God is universal. I will worship in any religious place. I am prepared to go to a synagogue. If I'm invited to a mosque, I will go and pray there. My background from the liberation movement is to be accommodative.

"Priests played a central role in initiating the ANC. All ANC gatherings open with a prayer. More than 80 percent of our people are religious, but they are not fundamentalist. During the struggle, all the religions were able to find each other.

"Ours was a political struggle, not a religious one. But central people were highly religious. Here the foundation is religious. Whenever religion is central to the struggle, it's difficult to control. There's hatred, hatred, hatred. It's very dangerous, because people want to prove that their God is superior."

You talk of a political culture that was accommodative, inclusive. That's not the case in the Middle East.

"Here I think there is a winner-takes-all culture. We don't believe in that. You need to sit down. Again. As equal partners. Without preconditions. And you must talk, talk, talk. And then be prepared to compromise. There is no absolute position."

IDF: `Apartheid' comparison on road policies unfair
Senior Israel Defense Forces sources yesterday rejected an accusation from a human rights group that Israel's policies on roads and highways in the West Bank are reminiscent of the apartheid regime in South Africa.

Senior Israel Defense Forces sources yesterday rejected an accusation from a human rights group that Israel's policies on roads and highways in the West Bank are reminiscent of the apartheid regime in South Africa.

B'Tselem, the Israeli group that monitors human rights in the territories, called the transportation policies imposed on Palestinians in the West Bank "the reign of forbidden roads."

"The right of West Bank residents to use certain roads emanates from ethnicity," the report said, adding that "the transportation policies are a direct result of specific instructions provided to soldiers in the field."

The report's authors noted that, as opposed to South African policies, the IDF dared not document such practices in writing.

A senior IDF officer who reviewed the report said, however, that it appeared to him as if B'Tselem based its conclusions on data gathered two years ago and that facts on the ground have since changed.

The report appears to blatantly ignore the changes of the past year, other IDF sources said.

For example, they said, the sieges on most towns in the West Bank, with the exception of Nablus, were lifted almost a year ago.

In the past few months, the IDF removed dozens of unmanned dirt roadblocks and cut down the number of manned roadblocks, they added.

According to figures released by the coordinator of activities in the territories, the unmanned roadblocks were cut from 215 to 110, while there are now 14 manned checkpoints instead of 26.

B'Tselem talks of 41 roadblocks, 13 of them in Hebron, but the roadblocks in Hebron are mainly around the Jewish settlement there and the IDF considers them gates to the settlement and not roadblocks.

The town that is still suffering the most from roadblocks is Nablus, because of the large number of warnings about planned suicide bombings emanating from there.

On the other hand, the three roadblocks that used to be on the Palestinian side of Jenin have been removed and only one roadblock, number 250, remains between the northern exit from that town and the separation fence, they said.

What made it possible to remove many of the roadblocks was that the fence was set up and the security situation improved, the sources said, adding that the report ignores this.

Now, for the first time in almost three years, the Palestinians can travel between the northern and southern sections of the West Bank, even though there are hold-ups at certain points, they added.

According to senior B'Tselem researcher Najib Abu-Rokaya, when he asked a soldier why Palestinians were forbidden to drive on a certain road, he was told the specific road was a "sterile highway."

One of the differences between the Israeli policies in the territories and South Africa's former policies is that Israel cites security concerns while executing its policies.

The security services say that closing roads to Palestinian traffic prevents terror attacks on those roads and in Israel, but, B'Tselem said, this is nevertheless illegal.

In addition, said B'Tselem officials, closing roads to all Palestinians "constitutes a policy that indiscriminately harms all Palestinians, and therefore infringes on human rights and is a violation of international law."

In the name of Zionist values
The settlers are retreading the path they have followed ever since they founded the very first settlement - a series of errors, lies and violations of the law, in order to impose their messianic way on the State of Israel and the whole Israeli public.
By David Zonshein	Aug. 10, 2004 | 12:00 AM

I refused to serve in the territories after more than 10 years as an officer in an elite Israel Defense Forces unit. I refused to serve in the territories after hundreds of days of service in the territories, as a soldier and a commander, and after I had been an active partner in the destructive policy that has crushed any value in which I was educated and turned me into an active partner in harming the security of the state.

I refused in the name of the Zionist values and the values of the army in which I had been educated.

A decisive majority of the public already recognizes the need to end the occupation. Even the prime minister and the defense minister from the Likud recognize this. After four blood-drenched years, even the army has retracted its position and recognizes that there is no military solution to the terror and violence.

On the other hand, steps to end the occupation are nowhere in sight. The settlers do everything to prevent the political echelons from carrying out evacuations and from withdrawing the army from the territories. The government is unable to remove even the handful of "illegal" outposts.

Compared to them, the left has become an enthusiastic supporter of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. He is still tormented by the fear that he will not be considered a patriot and makes sure to denounce refusals to serve by members of the left. The left does not understand that the refusal stems from true patriotism, from the need to save the Jewish state, democracy, the army and Zionism.

About two and a half years ago, when we founded the Courage to Refuse movement, some of our detractors claimed that our refusal would eventually lead to a similar refusal by right-wing soldiers to evacuate outposts and settlements. On August 5 Alexander Jacobson wrote in his article in Haaretz, "When the debate over the duty of people in uniform to obey comes up during the evacuation of the settlements, what will be said by those who turned the political refuseniks of the left into cultural heroes?"

This is another dive into the honey trap that the right has been setting for the left for a whole generation - as if every refusal is alike and every ethic is equal. We will not fall into that trap. The refusal of the 620 fighters who refuse to serve in the territories is profoundly different from the refusal of the settlers to evacuate the settlements. The refusenik movement of fighters who refuse to serve in the territories is a movement of individuals who independently reached the painful recognition that they could no longer violate the dictates of their conscience.

Unlike the settlers, the officers who refuse to serve in the territories have no rabbi and no leader and not even a public figure or political power that will stand behind them. This in stark contrast to the political refusal movement on the right, which has not yet risen but already has shepherds - rabbis, public figures and politicians - calling for mass refusal.

What's more, our refusal carries a heavy price - serving time in jail and the social sanctions that we accept with understanding in order to prevent the looming disaster. In contrast, the refusal of the right is accepted as an act of heroism among the right, while the army and the defense minister try to find any possible way to relieve right-wing soldiers from the task.

Our refusal is intended to prevent acts that fall into the realm of war crimes, collective punishments against civilians who have nothing to do with the fighting. We decided to refuse after we saw how much the occupation and the punishment of the whole civilian population harms security and does not serve it.

The settlers are doing everything to entrench their rule over occupied land over which the State of Israel never recognized sovereignty. They are undermining the Zionist vision of the Jewish state - trying to bring about an apartheid state, in which a Jewish minority rules over an Arab majority deprived of basic civil rights.

The settlers are retreading the path they have followed ever since they founded the very first settlement - a series of errors, lies and violations of the law, in order to impose their messianic way on the State of Israel and the whole Israeli public.

The refusal of the right and the refusal of the left do not have even one thing in common. A vast abyss separates us. Israel must decide whether it is falling into the abyss of the occupation or is pulling away from it.

The writer is the chairman of Courage to Refuse.

Apartheid roads

Regarding "IDF rejects `apartheid' comparison on road policies," by Yoav Stern and Amos Harel, August 10

Are we expected to act surprised that the IDF rejected the B'Tselem accusation? The IDF has a long and disgraceful history of denial when it comes to the shameful and inhumane treatment of the Palestinian people.

I have just returned from a 45-day trip to Palestine and can attest that calling the IDF practices `apartheid-like' is a gross understatement. They are much more nefarious than that. The village of my birth, Beit Hanina, has the misfortune of being cut into two by the Begin Road. The very residents on whose lands the Begin Road was built, who lost thousands of trees and much valuable agricultural lands by its construction, are not permitted to use or drive on this road. The road is closed off to the residents because they happen to be Palestinians, and for no other reason.

The road was primarily built for the exclusive use of the Jewish settlers who live in settlements that were built on Beit Hanina's and the surrounding villages' land, thus ensuring the Jewish settlers would not be "inconvenienced" by the many roadblocks and checkpoints that choke the very life of Palestinian lives and society.

When the Begin Road was completed, it became apparent it was more of a wall than a mere road. The only road that connected the people of Beit Hanina (the lower portion and upper portion) was subsequently destroyed and a large mound of earth and boulders was placed under the bridge to make sure that even foot traffic was discouraged.

There are many more instances of these so-called bypass roads that are built exclusively for the Jewish settlers, including bridges and tunnels.

Undemocratic detention

I seriously doubt whether a democracy has the right to have a concept of administrative detention in general. The countries that I know that have administrative detention are countries that have a dictatorship. Most democracies have habeus corpus.

Israel has no habeus corpus and has administrative detention. The latest attack on right-wingers who hold that the land of Israel and the people of Israel are sacred and are not to be disposed of as cattle, moved from one pasture area to another, is now being implemented.

Public Security Minister Tzachi Hanegbi and Shin Bet chief Avi Dichter are planning administrative detention of Jewish extremists without charge or trial. This is the most undemocratic procedure. There is no justification for this kind of action. If the Jews who are going to be detained in this way were Arab Israeli citizens it would not be done.

Why is it permissable in this Jewish country of Israel to have administrative detention for no reason other than in the minds of Avi Dichter and Tzachi Hanegbi? If this can be done now other things will be done to other people in the future?

Amnon Rubenstein should be the leader in the battle for civil liberty. His name is well known and respected and he can articulate the dangers of administrative detention.

Gandhi's grandson to kick off unarmed Palestinian campaign
By Amira Hass	and Haaretz Correspondent	| Aug. 13, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The grandson of former Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi, Arun Gandhi, is to kick off a Palestinian campaign for an unarmed, popular struggle against the Israeli occupation.

The campaign is being organized by a group of Palestinian social and political activists in Ramallah, that was formed after a ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague against the separation fence and Israel's occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The group's members are anti-fence activists, members of non-government organizations for water and agriculture development, and central Fatah activists, headed by minister without portfolio and Fatah activist Kadura Fares.

Gandhi, head of the M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence in the United States, will be the star speaker in three mass rallies planned in Ramallah, Abu Dis and Bethlehem on August 26. Gandhi said he intends "to promote the philosophy of nonviolence, the approach that nonviolence is the only venue that can solve our problems."

The Ramallah group resumed it ties with Palestinians for Peace and Democracy in the U.S., and reportedly consists of 400 volunteers. The group's leader, Mohammed Al Atar, said they felt "an urgency to find another way to resist occupation."

The link between Al Atar and the Ramallah group was Terry Boulata of East Jerusalem, the principal of a private school in Abu Dis and a major anti-fence activist. The fence separates her home from her place of work and from her husband's family. Boulata said the Hague decision and Israel's High Court ruling to change the fence route strengthens the position of the proponents of an unarmed struggle. Like Al Atar, she said: "The struggle is our right, but we must be creative."

The two then invited Gandhi in order to learn creative ways of fighting against the occupation.

In a telephone call from the United States, Gandhi said he is coming both to learn and to teach his philosophy. "I understand that many bad things happened 55 years ago, but the attempt to get justice by revenge accomplishes nothing," he said. He said he learned that from his grandfather when he was just a boy, and thought of revenge in retaliation to the apartheid and humiliation he felt in South Africa, where he was born in 1934. Gandhi said his father spent 15 years in jail because he refused to obey the apartheid laws.

It is difficult to tell how the Palestinians will relate to Gandhi's tendency to explain violent conflicts by reducing them to private, inter-personal relations. "I've dedicated my life to explain to people how damaging prejudices can be, and how to form better relations. That is the basis of non-violence. Relations must be based on love, understanding and honor, not on negative foundations," he said.

"I will tell the Palestinians that it is their responsibility to change. If the Israelis do not want to listen, it does not mean we cannot act."

Gandhi intends to tell the Palestinians that the essence of violence is that each side justifies it by saying the other side started. "The question is who is more intelligent (to stop using violence) and who has more power to change. I think the Palestinians have a chance to be more intelligent and not act like the Israelis."

The organizers intend to bring thousands to the rallies and record the talks with Gandhi. The events will cost about $200,000, and contributions have arrived from Switzerland and Norway. It is uncertain how much Gandhi can contribute to the Palestinian struggle, but the invitation indicates a considerable part of the Palestinian public is seeking popular, non-violent ways to struggle. "We want to organize a Palestinian peace camp to explain to Israel and the world that our freedom is the key to peace," Boulata said.

Non-Aligned Movement boycott stirs sanctions fears
By Reuters	| Aug. 23, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Measures adopted by the Non-Aligned Movement to boycott Israeli settlers and firms building the West Bank separation fence have stirred real worries in Israel of a broader sanctions campaign.

"We must remember that these sanctions are only the beginning," said Nitza Nahmias, a political science professor at Haifa University.

"This is the marker that grants legitimacy to economic and commercial sanctions, which could endanger our future and security," the professor commented in the Maariv daily.

The 115-member group of developing countries urged its members late last week to ban visits by settlers and to boycott firms that work on the fence, which Israel says it needs to keep out suicide bombers but Palestinians call a land grab.

The decision of the Non-Aligned Movement followed a non-binding ruling against the fence by the International Court of Justice in The Hague in June. The Hague court's ruling was echoed by a UN General Assembly resolution.

Israeli officials brushed aside the boycott call. "We are sorry for this decision," said one. "But we think this political decision will be impossible to implement."

Israeli commentators, however, said it could still prove damaging, even if not entirely unexpected from a grouping that includes many Arab countries and has long been sympathetic to Palestinians fighting for a state.

Many Arab states maintain diplomatic and trade boycotts on Israel - until talks with the Palestinians in the 1990s they even shunned firms that did business there - but few other countries now take such sanctions against Israel.

The big fear for Israel now is an international campaign similar to that against South Africa's apartheid regime.

That gained momentum after the World Court ruled illegal South Africa's occupation of Namibia.

Attorney General Menachem Mazuz urged the government on Thursday to reroute the fence to minimize the risk of foreign sanctions. The High Court of Justice earlier ordered the route to be changed, partly for the same reason.

Among key members of the Non-Aligned Movement is India, seen as a long-term friend of Israel and buyer of defense equipment. Some Latin American states could also be important customers for Israel's defense industry.

"India cannot for long continue its excellent relations with Israel if this momentum continues," said former senior Foreign Ministry official Alon Liel.

"This is a hard hit for us that shows international frustration with Israeli behavior," he added.

UN agent: Apartheid regime in territories worse than S. Africa
South African John Dugard, the special rapporteur for the United Nations on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories, has written that there is "an apartheid regime" in the territories "worse than the one that existed in South Africa."

South African law professor Prof. John Dugard, the special rapporteur for the United Nations on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories, has written in a report to the UN General Assembly that there is "an apartheid regime" in the territories "worse than the one that existed in South Africa."

As an example, Dugard points to the roads only open to settlers, from which Palestinians are banned.

In his report presented early this month, Dugard is highly critical of Israel for its "continuing violations of human rights in the territories." He said Israel is blatantly violating the International Court of Justice's ruling on the separation fence, and has declared it will not obey it.

The report was disseminated among the member countries ahead of the September General Assembly session meant to discuss the fence.

Dugard, a law professor from South Africa, was a member of a Truth Commission at the end of the apartheid regime, and was appointed by the UN in 2001 as special rapporteur for human rights in the West Bank and Gaza.

He called for a general arms embargo against Israel in May, in response to the IDF operations in Rafah, similar to the arms embargo imposed on South Africa in 1977.

According to government sources in Jerusalem, Israel is currently leaning toward cooperating with the various rapporteurs of the UN, and responding to their questions and requests.

But there are two exceptions to that rule: Dugard, and the special rapporteur for food, Jean Zigler. Israel refuses to cooperate with them because of the language of their mandates, and what it regards as their unfair approach. According to the sources, Dugard's assignment was phrased in a way that discriminates against Israel.

But the government does not prevent Dugard from traveling in the territories and Israel, to meet people and to report as he wishes.

The battle of the narrative
Sharon understands the danger and portrays his disengagement plan as a last-ditch battle against the pressure to drive Israel back to the 1967 borders, a deal to save the West Bank at the cheap price of Gaza. In the coming months it will become evident if his gamble succeeded or if it was too late, and Israel will then face an international political collapse that makes irrelevant the domestic debate over the settlements.
By Aluf Benn	| Aug. 25, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
At the end of the fourth year of the intifada, Israel appears to be losing the "battle of the narrative" that has been the backdrop to the conflict since its beginning. Israel's claim that this is a just war of defense against ruthless terror from peace rejectionists is being worn down by the decline in attacks. The relative quiet on the Israeli side against the daily casualties on the Palestinian side strengthens their claim that they are fighting for their freedom from an occupation.

And thus the settlements were sent back to the top of the agenda. The international media is getting interested in the construction tenders for the territories, the diplomatic arena is warming up for the coming debate in the UN General Assembly about the separation fence, and there's the threat of sanctions on Israel. The consensus that held inside Israel when it was under fire has been broken, and the debate over the purpose of the war has renewed.

At the center of the debate is the question of how many settlements must die. Some want to keep all the settlements (Yesha and the rightist parties); some are ready for vague concessions but not now (Uzi Landau); and some would make do with giving up all but a few settlements (Yossi Beilin). In the middle is Ariel Sharon, who proposes giving up some settlements so that others will survive, and his supporter, Shimon Peres, who believes in the power of Gaza First to move along a similar process in the West Bank.

Sharon is trying to revive the distinction made by the Labor government between "settlement blocs" and the isolated settlements. In his eyes, expanding Upper Betar and Ma'aleh Adumim is only a solution to the housing problems of young Jerusalemites. Housing Minister Tzipi Livneh explained that the new projects will be built "in places that are in the heart of the Israeli consensus." There is a political logic to the distinction between the settlers in the blocs who sought better standards of living, and the ideologues of the hilltops. It shrinks the camp of opponents to compromise.

The problem is that the domestic debate does not interest the international community, which regards all the settlements as a crime. The foreign ministers of the unaligned countries who called for bans on the entry of settlers to their countries don't distinguish between Harel Moyal of Ma'aleh Adumim, winner of the "Star is Born" singing competition and a symbol of mainstream Israel, and the ideological settler of Kiryat Arba. The European Union, which demanded labels on settlement produce, does not give any discounts to the Barkan industrial zone which is in "the heart of the consensus." As far as they are concerned, Israel needs to end at the Green Line.

Those who scorned the international community's position and relied on the belief that America is with us and there's nothing to worry about were devastated by the blows from the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which rejected all of Israel's actions in the territories as violations of law. Israel lost the campaign for the fence, and it was forced to drag it to the Green Line, despite the backing from Washington. The jurists and diplomats in Jerusalem are now quarreling over how grave was the defeat at The Hague, and whether the sanctions are a real threat, as Attorney General Menachem Mazuz's lawyers have claimed.

It's obvious to all that Israel will not be successful at persuading the world of the justice of its claim, and that the debate is only about the extent of the anticipated damage and the steps that must be taken: should Israel hurry to adopt the Fourth Geneva Convention, or is a quiet understanding with friendly governments sufficient?

Oded Eran, the Israeli ambassador to the EU, reckons that sanctions won't be applied, because there is a solid bloc of European countries that would foil such an attempt. The question is whether that support will hold. A senior European ambassador in Israel says his government is against sanctions in principle. "But in the 1980s, I served on our South African desk," he recalled this week, "and I noticed that the sanctions against apartheid began from below in the volunteer organizations, and slowly rose to the top and brought about changes in the government's position."

Sharon understands the danger and portrays his disengagement plan as a last-ditch battle against the pressure to drive Israel back to the 1967 borders, a deal to save the West Bank at the cheap price of Gaza. In the coming months it will become evident if his gamble succeeded or if it was too late, and Israel will then face an international political collapse that makes irrelevant the domestic debate over the settlements.

For the left, Sharon will always be Sharon
It is difficult for the world to eliminate its lack of faith given Sharon's past in general and his stand on settlements in particular. But there are signs of change. As The Economist wrote in its last issue: 'Sharon does seem at last to have learned that Israel cannot hold on to all the land it conquered in 1967.'

Will Ariel Sharon ever shed the demonic image that is attached to him? Even when he decides to take actions no one ever imagined him capable of, struggling valiantly against persistent forces in his own party trying to torpedo him, Sharon continues to be painted as a cunning power-politician who always cloaks his true intentions.

There was an example last week (August 8th) in an International Herald Tribune article by Henry Siegman, the former executive head of the American Jewish Congress and of the Synagogue Council of America. Siegman is a vehement critic of the Sharon government in the spirit of the Israeli left, and has taken a hostile tone on more than one occasion.

Siegman says there is no real reason to be optimistic about the disengagement plan, and that it is even misleading. Sharon, he says, has no intention of agreeing to the minimum conditions required to establish a Palestinian state, and his resolve to continue settlement policy in the West Bank proves that any other assessment is wishful thinking.

According to Sharon himself the disengagement plan is only a means to ensure Israeli control of the West Bank. Israel is conducting the same policy of apartheid South Africa, which disengaged from the Bantustans it created only to continue ruling most of South Africa.

"It is one of the ironies of history that the Jewish people, who were disproportionately involved in struggles for universal human rights and civil liberties all over the world-should now be supporting the policies of a rightist Israeli government that are in danger of changing the Jewish state into a racist enterprise," says Siegman.

Siegman and his like still do not get the extent to which Sharon has changed in the past two years. They do not realize that Sharon now understands that in order to remain a Jewish state Israel must disengage from as many Palestinians as possible. In the present geo-political reality this means getting rid of the entire Gaza Strip and most of the West Bank.

It is impossible to implement the whole disengagement at once for two reasons - there is no interlocutor on the other side, and Sharon cannot sell to his nationalist party in power a 180-degree reversal of policy in one fell swoop.

One proof of a changing mood is seen in President George Bush's letter of April 4th to Sharon that stated: "In the light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli populations centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949. It is realistic to expect that any final status agreement will only be achieved on the basis of mutually agreed changes that reflect these realities."

It is routine to point out that the U.S. has thus recognized the legitimacy of the annexation of "major Israeli population centers." No less important is the fact that Sharon has recognized the fact, as did his predecessor Ehud Barak, that Israel cannot expect to annex more than the settlement blocs, and even this must take place only in direct negotiations with the Palestinians on the establishment of a Palestinian state.

President Bush's letter was included in the government's decision to implement Sharon's disengagement plan, and Sharon has accepted that the letter's statements are the most Israel can expect.

It is difficult for the world to eliminate its lack of faith given Sharon's past in general and his stand on settlements in particular. But there are signs of change. As The Economist wrote in its last issue: "Mr. Sharon does seem at last to have learned that Israel cannot hold on to all the land it conquered in 1967, and is risking all by beginning the process of withdrawal. That is why the settlers are determined to defeat him, and why he deserves the world's support."

Siegman, like the Israeli extreme left, continues to prefer the demonic version.

The beginning of the start of the end
Some of the criticism we are absorbing is beginning to have an impact. It may not happen tomorrow, but it is possible to notice a flicker of hope. First cracks have started to appear in the mask of self-righteousness we have worn for 37 years.

How long can the costume ball go on? How long can we pretend the spit in our faces is rain? There are now signs that it can't go on forever - it is not the beginning of the end, but it looks like the beginning of the start of the end of the occupation.

Some of the criticism we are absorbing is beginning to have an impact. It may not happen tomorrow, but it is possible to notice a flicker of hope. First cracks have started to appear in the mask of self-righteousness we have worn for 37 years.

The bad news is that the cracks are only the result of international pressure; the good news is that this pressure is mounting. After hope ran out that we would manage to come to our senses on our own, now we need to hope the world doesn't give up until we return to being a just state. Those anxious for the future of Israel must hope the world will move from vehement words to no less vehement action.

The apartheid regime was finally brought to an end through sanctions and by excommunication from the family of nations. That, regrettably, is apparently the only way to ending the Israeli occupation.

After long years of ignoring international criticism, apparently the fear of the world taking action - sometime between the festivities of A Star is Born to the festivities over the medals at Athens - has started to take root in Israeli society.

It began with the disengagement plan and the prime minister's comments on the impossibility of permanent occupation - no matter how hollow they sounded. It continued with the High Court ruling against the separation fence - no matter how partial. And now, it ended with the recommendation by the attorney general to "thoroughly reexamine" applying the Fourth Geneva Convention to the territories - no matter how belatedly.

All these developments show that the occupied land is beginning to burn beneath our feet. For all the years of the occupation, Israel brutally trampled over the Fourth Geneva Convention, one of the most important and enlightened international documents that the world, including Israel, adopted.

But Israel made a mockery of the spirit of the treaty on the baseless argument that the territories were not captured from a sovereign power - as if that would change the act of occupation and its ramifications for the occupied population and its rights.

Israel violated and continues to violate Article 27 of the treaty that says: "Protected persons are entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their honor, their family rights, their religious convictions and practices, and their manners and customs. They shall at all times be humanely treated, and shall be protected especially against all acts of violence or threats thereof and against insults and public curiosity."

It violates this by controlling the Palestinians with military orders, imposing collective punishments, damages their property and puts severe limits on their freedom of movement, with all that implies for their lives.

Article 32, prohibiting causing physical suffering to the residents of the territories is not applied, nor is Article 47, which prohibits moving prisoners from the occupied territories to the state of the occupation power, and it certainly does not abide by the Article that prohibits moving civilian population from the occupying country to the occupied territories.

By the way, it's not only the Palestinians who are taught that the Geneva Conventions don't apply to them, Israeli children are also taught that. Civilized countries world-wide, though not our country, have long since become fed up with all of these.

But there's U.S. support and Europe hesitation about taking more aggressive steps. Now there is a bit of hope that the rope has been stretched too far. There are no more international bodies, from the World Health Organization and the World Bank through the European Union and the Organization of Non-Aligned countries, let alone UN agencies, which have not recently laid harsh accusations against Israel.

It's very easy to ask Menachem Mazuz, what happened? What's different from one more day of occupation to two more days? It is depressing to think that his eyes only began to open when UN sanctions are at the door, as he lately warned. And the Supreme Court's eyes opened only when the ruling at The Hague was at the door.

It is tempting to condemn the awful tardiness of adopting what should have been applied from the start of the occupation. But it is certainly better late than never. The worries that have hit Mazuz about the world are indeed good tidings.

We have no Israeli leader capable of acting, we have an army that has been corrupted beyond all recognition, we have a Supreme Court that stays away from occupation issues like they were fire. So, who knows - maybe it will be an attorney general whom nobody suspected of greatness, who will be the one who brings the good tidings home from out there.

Likud MKs' visit to S. Africa signals thaw in ties
By Peter Hirschberg, Haaretz Correspondent	Aug. 30, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
A Likud delegation headed by deputy minister of Industry and Trade, Michael Ratzon, departs tomorrow night for a week-long trip to South Africa as a guest of the government there, in another sign that Pretoria appears keen to put relations between the two countries on a new footing.

The group, which also includes MKs Michael Eitan, Ayoub Kara and Yuli Edelstein, is scheduled to meet with President Thabo Mbeki and will hold deliberations with both current and former government ministers who were involved in the negotiating process in the early 1990s that led to the demise of apartheid and the rise to power of the African National Congress. One of the participants will be former president F.W. de Klerk.

"The South Africans are very interested in initiating a dialogue with the government in Israel, even if there are disagreements," Ratzon told Haaretz yesterday. "This is the first time that a Likud delegation is going to South Africa since the regime changed there in 1994."

The director-general of the South African Department of Foreign Affairs, Ayanda Ntsaluba, who was on a visit to Israel last week, said the invitation to the Likud delegation is aimed at opening up "lines of communication with the current [Israeli] government." Until now, he adds, "Israel has misunderstood our engagement. Any support for the Palestinians they perceive as anti-Israel."

Ntsaluba talks of an "evolution of thinking" in the South African government. "People in Israel have elected a government and it has the power to change," he says. "We must engage them."

The ANC has historical ties with the PLO and regularly backs the Palestinians in international forums - a stance that has generated considerable antagonism among Israeli officialdom. In recent years, only left-wing politicians and peace activists have traveled to South Africa as guests of the government.

An initial sign of South Africa's desire to engage the government of Ariel Sharon, was the appointment of a new ambassador to Israel last month, Major General Fumanekile Gqiba, who is a member of the ANC and was handpicked by Mbeki. In October, Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will become the first Likud minister to visit South Africa since Sharon came to power in early 2001.

"We will certainly be interested in seeing how two groups that were involved in such a harsh struggle, managed to forge coexistence," said Ratzon. "It's completely different, of course, to our situation. We aren't running an apartheid system here."

The Likud delegation also includes the party's director-general, Arik Barami, as well as four other central committee members. The visit starts with a two-day sojourn at a game reserve and also includes meetings with the Jewish community.

Oslo lives
Legal adviser to the Foreign Ministry since 1996, Alan Baker has watched the rise and fall of the Oslo process and warns against the attorney general's ideas on the Geneva Convention.
By Aluf Benn	| Sep. 2, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
In his eight years as legal adviser to the Foreign Ministry, Alan Baker has been an eyewitness to shock waves and transformations. When he was appointed in 1996, Israel was at the height of the Oslo process with the Palestinians. This week, as he leaves for his new post as ambassador to Canada, Israel is mired in an armed conflict with the Palestinians and viewed as transgressing the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

Baker has logged thousands of hours of negotiations with Egyptians, Palestinians, Jordanians, and Lebanese. He has had meetings with political leaders on the left and the right and appeared often in international forums to protect Israel from Palestinian claims of human rights infractions with regard to the occupation, the settlements and the construction of the separation fence. "No job is more interesting than this one," he says in an interview in his Jerusalem office on Monday.

From the perspective of 2004, what is the lesson you learned from negotiations with the Palestinians?

"We were naive when we conducted negotiations during the period of Rabin and Peres. There was nothing in the interim agreement [Oslo B, which detained the relationship between Israel and the Palestinian Authority] that related to what would happen if the whole business fell apart. We depended so heavily on the exchange of letters between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat that stated that we were finished with violence, that we didn't put any assurances into the agreements involving the Americans or the Europeans, or, between the two sides, except for the military committee and such like. There was nothing about the complete crumbling of the PA, or its takeover by hostile and violent elements. And we have been suffering because of this for years."

Did you try to put a clause like that into the agreement?

"I remember a meeting in 1995 with Uzi Dayan, Gilad Sher, and Jibril Rajoub, in which we proposed a clause allowing the Israelis to go into the territories. Rajoub said, in good Hebrew, with a smile on his face, "I won't be able to sell that to Arafat, and you'll do it anyway."

According to Baker, the interim agreement stated that both sides would do what was necessary to prevent terror, and "we base our presence in the territories today on this vague legal formulation. We must act, because the Palestinians are not preventing terror."

Were you properly prepared for negotiation?

"We prepared very well. We coordinated with the defense establishment, we did background work and planned everything. The problem is always those conducting the negotiations tend not to remain within the red lines that we, the civil servants, dictate. I'll never forget the time when Shlomo Ben-Ami was foreign minister and we told him at one point that he was ready to give up more than we had proposed. He responded that as a historian sometimes one reaches a historic juncture from which one must move ahead. It's a problem of the professional negotiators, the civil servants. They can do the background work, but the ones negotiating - Peres, Ben-Ami, Bibi - compromise, and we find ourselves left with formulations that we have to find ways to correct after the fact."

Are the Oslo Accords still in force?

"Yes, and that is very important, in spite of all the breaches on both sides. We are also not without fault. But we and the Palestinians both have been careful not to declare them null and void. If they are annulled, there will be a vacuum, and I have always been afraid of a vacuum into which the United Nations will step. The Palestinians need agreements very much, because that is the legal basis for the PA and Arafat's status."

Is the unilateral disengagement plan in accordance with Oslo?

"Certainly. The agreements include Israeli obligations to redeploy that do not depend on Palestinian agreement. And I see this as a kind of redeployment, as far as it can be implemented."

Alan Baker was born in Great Britain, as was his professional mentor, the first foreign ministry legal adviser, Shabtai Rosenne. Baker came to Israel at the end of the `60s, joined the Foreign Service in 1979, and went right into the normalization talks with Egypt under Elyakim Rubinstein.

"I am disappointed and frustrated," Baker says. "I expected a much more encouraging game from the Egyptians. I sat with them on 50 negotiating committees on every possible subject, and the economic and tourism potential has been lost. We have been without an Egyptian ambassador for four years. I'm disappointed in the Jordanians as well. They conducted very intimate negotiations over the peace treaty and the transportation agreements. They are very nice people, but the agreements include an obligation for a resident ambassador. Where is he? I recommended that the issue of ambassadors be paramount in our talks with Jordan and with Egypt. But I am only the legal counsel. There is a political complex; I only give advice."

Baker admits to being "frustrated and disappointed" in the results of the peace process with the Palestinians as well. "It's part of the naivete I mentioned. We really did believe. When we finished the negotiations over the interim agreement on the eve of Rosh Hashanah nine years ago, we were overjoyed that we had gotten out of the dirt and were on the high road."

Nevertheless, Baker believes even now that the interim agreement is a good one, and says, "It's a shame that we could not hold on to it." The Hebron and Wye agreements signed during Benjamin Netanyahu's tenure, and the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement from the beginning of Ehud Barak's term in office, strengthened and clarified things that were important to both sides. "They can still be fulfilled if there is a will," Baker says.

What about Israel's violations?

"The Palestinians always claimed that we never put the safe passage into operation [from Gaza to the West Bank]."

And what about the settlements?

"The Palestinians asked for a clause on freezing settlements during the negotiations, as Menachem Begin had promised during his talks with the Egyptians. We started to negotiate with them on an accompanying letter that would clarify Israel's settlement policy and its limitations. After five or six formulations, Arafat came and said he preferred there not be anything, otherwise he would be blamed. In the interim agreement there's just the clause about planning and construction in the civilian appendix, that both sides can build in their territory as long as it does not cause damage."

But the UN resolutions and The Hague ruling determine that settlements are illegal and contravene the Geneva Convention.

"We have a dispute with the international community. We argue that the prohibition on the transfer of population to occupied territory, in Article 94 of the Geneva Convention, was formulated during World War II to prevent the massive forced transfer of population in Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. We aren't doing this. The settlement policy is voluntary. All settlers, myself included [Baker lives in Har Adar northwest of Jerusalem] sign an agreement with the Israel Lands Administration that they know the time may come when a political settlement will change the status of the territory. My house is not registered as mine in the Land Registry; I have only a leasing agreement with the administration. We therefore argue that the settlements do not contravene Article 94. But no one else buys this."

According to Baker, the Palestinians prefer to emphasize the settlements as the spearhead of their political struggle against Israel, because it is more convenient for them than raising demands about Jerusalem, which may anger the Christian world, or about the Palestinian refugees' right of return, which he says does not exist at all in terms of international law.

And how to you explain the success of the Palestinian struggle over the separation fence?

"It's a sexy subject, which provides a soap box for all the Palestinian claims: it involves annexation, as they claim, of territory, of Apartheid as they say that it creates limited enclaves, and serious infraction of human rights in the prevention of freedom of movement. All the components of every injustice. My surprise and disappointment were in the fact that the international community was unwilling to see the fence as part of the struggle against terror. They look at it as if the Israelis just up and decided one day to make trouble for the Palestinians and to build a wall, just to make things hard for them."

The ruling of the International Court of Justice, according to which Israel's actions in the territories are illegal and the wall should be taken down, infuriate Baker. "They are doing us an injustice. The problem is that it's impossible to separate between politics and the hearing. We saw in The Hague that people came to the court with a clear political agenda, with the UN political resolution, and clear political motives that the Palestinians didn't hide to detour negotiations with a court ruling. That does not mean that our positions were not right."

Baker has no doubt that the construction of the fence is justified according to international law, which allows the occupier to construct defenses. He is convinced that he was right in his advice to the government not to send Israeli representatives to appear before the court. He utterly rejects the report by a team of jurists appointed by Attorney General Menachem Mazuz who examined the implications of the court's ruling. According to Baker, the report engenders unnecessary panic. "The Justice Ministry recommendation that we try to mollify the international community, will not be taken in the right way. It will be understood as if we were not right, and I am convinced that we are."

What do you think about the recommendation that Israel declare the application of the Geneva Convention in the territories?

"Since 1967 Israel's policy has been to apply the Fourth Geneva Convention de facto. We did not agree to its de jure application because the relevant clause in the convention states that occupied territory is territory taken from a previous sovereign. Since we did not want to recognize Jordanian sovereignty in the West Bank, we did not formally apply the convention. We did apply it in practice. The High Court scrutinizes the army's activities in terms of the Geneva Convention, so that in every way it does apply in the territories.

"It might have been possible to talk about applying the convention 20 years ago. There were private members bills on this that were voted down. In 1993-1994 we began to transfer territory to the Palestinians and at that point there was certainly no place to declare the application of the convention. We are now pushing the disengagement plan in the international community. How will we look if we suddenly announce the application of the Geneva Convention? We will be a laughing stock."

Aren't you concerned about sanctions against Israel as a result of the international court's ruling?

"No, and on this I disagree with the Justice Ministry. I don't believe that the Europeans and most countries want to take a `violent' step against Israel. So I also object to the evaluation of the Justice Ministry that every senior Israeli traveling abroad will have to stand trial."

Do reports of human rights infractions against Palestinians bother you?

"It's not right, and it can be dealt with. I saw this first-hand. My son served at the Qalqilyah checkpoint. We would go there to bring him food, and I would sit with him at the checkpoint and see what was happening. It is terribly difficult for soldiers to deal with the challenges there. With impatient people, with groups of international students who come to provoke them, to denounce them, yell at them and curse them. Manning the checkpoints is very difficult and requires a great deal of skill and patience. Clearly, we must behave in non-violent and tolerant ways. The problem is that the Palestinians take advantage of our Western democratic morals to undermine this."

Baker follows the Palestinian effort to give international recognition to the Green Line and is trying to fight against it. "As a jurist, I say that this has no legal basis. The cease-fire agreements state that the line is temporary and is not to impair any political border to be determined by the two sides. Therefore the Green Line is not considered a border, but rather in practical terms has become a separation line between sovereign Israeli territory and territory that is still in negotiation or dispute. My legal advice to prime ministers and foreign ministers was to approach the Americans and the Europeans and note that the Green Line is not a border."

Israel asks PA donors to fund new, upgraded West Bank roads
Israel has asked countries that contribute funding to the Palestinian Authority to finance the construction of new roads and the upgrading of existing ones in the West Bank, according to foreign diplomatic and Palestinian sources.
By Amira Hass	| Sep. 5, 2004 | 12:00 AM

Israel has asked countries that contribute funding to the Palestinian Authority to finance the construction of new roads and the upgrading of existing ones in the West Bank, according to foreign diplomatic and Palestinian sources. Roads on which Palestinian vehicles have been banned will be replaced by the new ones, and existing roads that have been blocked by the separation fence will be improved.

The Palestinians and some donor nations believe that Israel seeks to create two separate transportation systems in the West Bank - one for Israelis, especially settlers, and another for Palestinians.

Diplomatic sources say that the financing of these projects may violate rulings by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, which instructed the states not to assist the barrier being built in the West Bank in any way.

The sources say that it would be highly problematic for the donor countries to take part in creating two separate road systems for Israelis and Palestinians. Some of these countries' representatives used the term "apartheid roads," while others said more diplomatically that such roadways help maintain and expand the settlements, and by financing them, their countries would be helping Israeli activities that are illegal according to international law.

Some of the representatives believe that building roads that will assist the settlements also contradicts the principles of the United States' road map plan, as it would render the debate on evacuating settlements superfluous. In any case, they said, donors may only act vis-a-vis the Palestinian Authority, to finance an infrastructure project the PA itself is planning.

Israeli sources told Haaretz that Israel had not asked the donors to finance the roads, but had attempted to respond to their request to ensure what the Israelis called "transportational contiguity" for the Palestinians.

These sources say that in the recent debates with the World Bank on the disengagement plan, Israel's National Security Council wanted to specify which West Bank roads could be built or upgraded without any problems. The sources confirmed indirectly that some of the new roads would be parallel to those from which Palestinians are currently banned.

"We've forgotten the days when dozens of terrorist attacks were launched against Israelis in the West Bank from moving vehicles," an Israeli source said. "Palestinians are banned from many roads for security reasons. Some of the problems could be solved if certain interchanges enabled Palestinians to enter the area from one side. We would drive above and they would drive from below, and vice versa."

The Israeli overture, which some donors see as a "request" or "expectation," raised a storm among the countries that assist the PA. The existence of another list of roads, which Israel did not submit, has provoked suspicion among the donors as to its intentions.

"The list and map took longer than we thought to prepare and they were delayed," an Israeli source confirmed. "Last Thursday we completed it and the map will be presented to [the donors] during the week."

A diplomatic source said that a few months ago, before the ICJ ruling, the Israel Defense Forces' coordinator of activities in the territories had already asked the donor nations to renovate numerous roads along the separation fence route, to compensate for rural byways that were cut off by it. The donors replied that this could only be done at the PA's request.

At the end of July, representatives of the World Bank and the National Security Council discussed Israel's response to the bank's report on the repercussions of disengagement on the Palestinian economy. The report stresses the importance of freedom of movement, stating that that economy's recovery depends on a "radical easing of the internal closure" of the West Bank, and on the opening of borders to Palestinian exports and to the entrance of Palestinian laborers into Israel.

"Israel is interested in improving the transportation infrastructure to enable uninterrupted movement across the West Bank. This requires extensive and complex construction (with international assistance)," Israel said in its reply.

In subsequent debates, the World Bank and donor community were given a list of 30 roads and intersections earmarked for improvement. A diplomatic source reported that the PA had already asked donor nations to finance their renovation, following heavy damages incurred by IDF operations in recent years, and by heavy Palestinian traffic that was rerouted there after being prohibited from the main routes.

The issue of Israel's desire to build and upgrade certain Palestinian roads has intensified the argument among donor nations about whether past financial aid to the Palestinians has been of any benefit. Many projects financed by them during the Oslo process were later destroyed or damaged in IDF operations. The donors have been paying for the rebuilding of the homes of thousands of people, which were demolished by the IDF, especially in the Gaza Strip, as well as for various emergency welfare programs. Some sources described this in private conversations as "subsidizing" or "sustaining" the Israeli occupation.

One Israeli source said: "Some agencies are trying to create tension. We must recognize the existing situation. Shouldn't we solve some of the problems? Is it better for the Palestinians to go on suffering?"

Daring woman, daring writing
Ben Lovatt was born 16 years ago to a serene and harmonious bourgeois family in Doris Lessing's book "The Fifth Child" (which was published by Am Oved in a Hebrew translation in 1994).
By Shiri Lev-Ari	| Sep. 6, 2004 | 12:00 AM

Ben Lovatt was born 16 years ago to a serene and harmonious bourgeois family in Doris Lessing's book "The Fifth Child" (which was published by Am Oved in a Hebrew translation in 1994). More than a decade later, Lessing decided to go back and see what happened to Ben, who was the fifth child in the family but never behaved like the rest of his siblings. He was violent, heavy, unrestrained, mentally retarded and bore no resemblance to anyone else in the world. The sequel, "Ben, In the World," was published in 2000 and has now come out in a Hebrew translation by Dorit Landes (Am Oved).

"People asked me what happened to Ben and I became curious myself," says Lessing in a telephone interview from her home in London. "I wondered where he could find a place where he would be accepted despite his uniqueness."

In the sequel, the character is already 18 years old, but looks 35, and this is how he behaves: He has strength and violence and barely restrained urges, and he tries with all his might to navigate a life on the edges of society. Lessing: "I thought criminals would accept him and exploit him, or that he would be accepted by especially poor people, or that he would find himself in scientists' laboratories. So I began to write the book to solve this question. He spent a certain amount of time in the world of cinema, which was tolerant toward him but exploited him because Ben has always been exploited. In this book he becomes aware of the fact that he is exceptional, and of his loneliness, because in `The Fifth Child' he did not know this."

It seems you are not very optimistic about the way society deals with its exceptional people.

Lessing: "I really don't think we can tolerate people who are too different from us. We are a very organized society, we expect conformity, and people who do not conform are punished one way or the other, or are cast out or commit suicide or enter an insane asylum. We consider ourselves tolerant but we're not. We live in a society that is orderly in a really extreme way. Everything has to be in its place and everything depends on our cooperation so that we will be able to function."

No utopias

Lessing, who is 85, who began her literary career at the beginning of the 1950s, is a daring writer and a daring woman. To date she has published about 50 books in Britain, among them novels, collections of short stories, memoirs, poetry, plays and operas, essays and a series of science fiction books. Even at her age, she has not stopped writing and publishing books.

"I'm simply used to it," she says. "My time is limited, you know."

"The Fifth Child" aroused a great deal of interest in its day. Critics saw Ben's story as a metaphor, and each had their own interpretation of that metaphor. There were those who thought it was a book about dilemmas of parents, especially mothers, about raising children; there were those who saw it as a conflict between the moral imperative - that is, to raise the son, the weak link in society, within the family unit and come to terms with the destruction he wreaks all around him - and the concern for personal needs at the expense of the weak, and there were those who saw Ben as a metaphor for the evil inherent a priori in every individual that can burst out at any time, despite the restraint of urges that is so encouraged by human society.

Lessing in fact sees herself as an optimistic person. "I think that the human race will survive because we are good survivors," she says. "We have survived everything, from the Ice Age through plagues and wars. We are flexible and adaptable and intelligent and courageous, and we are good at coping with disasters. So you could call me an optimist. We live right in the midst of disasters. What would you call a world where so many children die during the first year of their lives?

Despite her optimism, Lessing no longer believes in utopias. She was disappointed by the promises of the feminist movement, by the promises of communism and also by the dream of the end of apartheid and the start of Black rule in Africa, after she saw that corruption is also rife in Black governments.

Is there any ideology in the world that speaks to you today?

"When we were young, every kind of utopia spoke to us, and especially communism. People of my generation look very coldly at utopias because we know what happens to them in the end: they very quickly turn treacherous and become brutal. I prefer programs for amendment and change that have limited adjectives," not in the style of `we are in danger now and we have a plan for equality, justice, fairness, egalitarian wages and free sex.' This is the kind of thing that certain political parties were declaring back then. But if there are parties or movements that say `We are going to amend the law on this matter in this way' - this usually also happens."

Too much shouting

Doris Lessing was born in 1919 in Persia (now Iran) to British parents, and when she was 5 years old her parents moved to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). She grew up on a farm, left highschool when she was 14 and went to work in the capital, Salisbury, as a nurse and telephone operator. At the age of 19 she married Frank Wisdom, with whom she had two children, Jean and John (her son died some years ago of a heart attack). In 1943 she decided to leave her husband and her two children (in interviews with her she has said that this was the best thing and the worst thing she had ever done in her life, and she is at peace with it), and married Gottfried Lessing, a German refugee. The two had a son, Peter.

In 1949, she separated from her second husband and moved with her young son to London, where she became politically active as a feminist and a Communist. Her first novel, "The Grass is Singing," was published in 1950. Her first books deal with her life in Rhodesia, Western colonialism and the clash between cultures. Her most famous book, "The Golden Notebook," which came out in 1962, is considered a cornerstone of feminist thinking. The book tells about Anna Wulf, who writes in four different notebooks, each of a different color, in different voices of liberated women until she unites them and writes in a single golden notebook. At the time the book was perceived as a liberated and daring feminine text, both with respect to the contents and with respect to the style.

However, Lessing does not identify herself with the feminist movement - neither then or now. In fact, she has harsh criticism of it. Women's liberation, she said once in an interview, was achieved by science - the invention of the pill and the dishwasher - and not by the feminist movement. Three years ago she caused a public ruckus at the Edinburgh Book Fair when she said that men are the silent victims of the war between the sexes.

Do you think the feminist movement has not achieved anything?

"I think the feminist movement could have been far more effective. `The Golden Notebook' and my attitude towards the feminist movement of the 1960 have no connection to each other. The reason I was disappointed by this movement is that there was too much talk there and not enough action. The sexual revolution took place then, and that's fine, but feminism was not able to bring about real change, that is, bring about equal pay and equal rights.

"When I was young, they told us, `Don't play at being men, go out and achieve equal opportunity for yourselves, equal pay for equal work and a good daycare center. And when you've achieved all that you'll have the same status as men.' This sounds to me the most reasonable thing on the subject. In the 1960s, there was so much noise and shouting, and so few achievements."

Not political

A few years ago Lessing published a satirical novel, "The Good Terrorist," about a young woman from Britain who lives in a commune and plans to change the world, even through terror. But she has never considered herself a political writer. "There is a big difference between a novel that depicts politics, like I've written in the past, and a novel that encourages a specific kind of political activity, and I don't think I've written anything like that. People always talk about me as a political writer but I don't think that I am one."

Has your perception of terror changed since September 11?

"People talk about September 11 as the biggest terror event, but people forget that we live in Britain, where the IRA (Irish Republican Army) was active for years. People forget that the IRA almost killed our prime minister in 1984 and it was just luck that it didn't happen. This kind of horror is not new in Britain, it is new in America. Their sky fell down on September 11, but the rest of the world is already used to these things. So chronicling events in a world that began on September 11 seems to me to be meaningless.

"Today it seems that the species of revolutionary terrorists has somewhat disappeared, but in certain places in Europe and in the United States they are still common - young people who live together in one house, wear a certain kind of clothing, talk in a language of their own and see themselves as revolutionaries. This is their way of giving themselves an identity."

PRETORIA - Likud party officials and members of the South African government pledged Wednesday to continue talks on ending Middle East violence as they wrapped up a two-day meeting.

South Africa hopes its experience negotiating a peaceful end to close to half a century of white-minority rule can help Israel resolve its conflict with the Palestinians.

"Both delegations committed to the need for a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and recognized that peace in the Middle East will contribute to global peace and stability," the South African Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.

"Both parties have agreed to continue these discussions as would be mutually convenient in future."

Although a number of Israeli and Palestinian officials have in recent years sought Pretoria's guidance on conflict resolution and transformation, it is the first time that a delegation from the Likud is in the country.

Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry Michael Ratzon led the delegation, also attendiung were the chair of the constitutional committee Michael Eitan, Likud director-general Arik Barami, and its campaign manager Eitan Sulami.

President Thabo Mbeki led the South African delegation, which included current and former Cabinet members who participated in the negotiations that ended apartheid in 1994. However, he left after the first few hours to attend an African Union summit in Burkina Faso.

Pretoria said it aimed to offer insight into the process that culminated in South Africa's transformation to a peaceful democracy.

Donating to apartheid
If the donor states now finance the upgrading of Palestinian roads, they will be providing the Palestinians with temporary relief. But they will be direct accessories in consolidating a uniquely Israeli regime of separation and apartheid.
By Amira Hass	| Sep. 8, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
It's only logical and self-evident that the road from Bir Zeit to Attara, north of Ramallah, be upgraded. It's a narrow, dangerous road, without lighting, or median lines, or sidewalks or even shoulders to the road. For the same reasons, the Ein Ariq road west of Ramallah cries out for improvement, as does the Nahalin-Husan road west of Bethlehem. Those are only three arteries of the road network in the West Bank that the Palestinian Authority planned to improve by the end of the 1990s, with help from the donor countries as part of the Oslo proces.

But over the last four years, those roads and others like them became the only roads, the main avenues that bore all the Palestinian traffic in their regions and between regions in the West Bank. Israel prohibits Palestinians from using the main inter-urban highways in the West Bank or it drastically limits their rights to use those roads, which are mainly for the use of the settlers. In recent years, thousands of Palestinian vehicles have been daily directed to use the secondary roads, banned from the main highways.

The three roads come from a list of 30 that Israel told the World Bank it wants to see upgraded. Other roads for Palestinians, some new, some existent, some to be upgraded with tunnels and rotaries, will be added to the list that Israel expects the donor states to finance.

The logic is clear here, too. The settlements are a given, a fact. The danger to the lives of the settlers and other Israeli civilians on the "joint" roads is tangible, as has been proven by many drive-by shootings. But freedom of movement for the Palestinians, as the World Bank has stated, is vital for economic recovery.

The donor nations are committed to help the Palestinian Authority. Therefore, build separate roads for the Palestinians. And since there is no partner for peace and negotiations, we will continue to develop for our citizens a separate network of roads, which will bring them even closer to sovereign Israel and continue to encourage new settlers to move to the settlements.

Seemingly, it's a temporary, innocent solution, essentially reactive, answering the need to protect the safety of Israeli citizens because of the current reality. In effect, the creation of two separate road networks is a logical step, utterly not innocent or accidental, a part of the long-term systematic planning of the settlements that began almost as far back as 1967. Its purpose: to expand the borders of the state of Israel as much as possible, according to the spreading and strengthening of the settlements.

What makes the Israeli planning system so great is that every stage can be explained as an ad-hoc reaction, or the whim of this or that government or pressure group, ignoring the initial goal. Thus, at every stage, the silently compliant can be counted on to accept the latest development, even if they say they are against settlements in principle.

If Yossi Beilin now supports leaving Ma'aleh Adumim and Givat Ze'ev under Israeli control because they are large and established settlements, in another five years he and his colleagues from the Geneva initiative will be forced to support leaving Givat Assaf and Itamar in place, as each will be a well-established neighborhood of some full-fledged Israeli city.

The donor states, if they finance now the work on the Palestinian roads Israel wants upgraded and improved, will be contributing to the temporary relief of many Palestinians. But they will be direct accessories to turning available land for farming and construction into unnecessary asphalt, further damaging the landscape and environment; and they will assist in consolidating a uniquely Israeli regime of separation and apartheid, making permanent the separation of neighboring communities divided on ethnic grounds, in an area where most of the land has been taken away for the benefit of a dominant minority.

The Jews will have broad, expansive, green communities with "high" standards of living, a developed infrastructure, as much water as they want - the "First World." Beside them will be a "Third World" of suffocatingly dense communities, cut off from other communities and limited in their contacts because of a web of endless roads, the Israeli law and its army, and subject to a strict regime of water quotas and allocation. And thus, while the international economic aid is meant to serve as a strategic instrument for a two-state solution along the borders of June 4, 1967, it is turned into an instrument of the Israeli settlement policies.

The donor states are so absurdly financing infrastructure work at the request of the PA, that the Palestinians have become unwitting accessories to the Israeli settlement enterprise. For long-term national reasons, they can oppose upgrading the roads that Israel allows them to use according to Israeli priorities. Then Israel will wave around the argument that the Palestinian leadership is once again sacrificing the welfare of its people - and continue to drastically limit the freedom of movement of the Palestinians. Or the Palestinians can agree to the paving of separate roads because of the clear and immediate needs of the residents. Thus they can free the donor states of the need to explain to their taxpayers why, as donor nations, they are helping to build and maintain a new apartheid regime.

PRETORIA - Likud Party officials were in South Africa yesterday to meet past and present government officials for talks over two days on the situation in Israel.

South Africa has described the meeting as a part of its ongoing efforts to assist Israelis and Palestinians in finding a lasting and comprehensive resolution to their conflict.

Although a number of Israeli and Palestinian officials have in recent years sought Pretoria's guidance on conflict resolution and transformation, it is the first time that a delegation from the Likud is in the country.

Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry Michael Ratzon is leading the delegation, which also includes the chair of the constitutional committee Michael Eitan, Likud director-general Arik Barami, and its campaign manager Eitan Sulami.

Pretoria will offer insight into the process that culminated in South Africa's transformation to a peaceful democracy. South African President Thabo Mbeki was expected to address the meeting at the presidential guesthouse in Pretoria.

Apartheid era politicians, among them former foreign affairs minister Pik Botha, who helped broker a negotiated settlement that brought about an end to the oppressive regime with the first all-race elections in 1994, were also to participate in the talks.

Look who's talking about defeating terror
"You cannot make compromises with terror," Ariel Sharon told the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. "It must be fought and defeated."
By Israel Harel	| Sep. 9, 2004 | 12:00 AM

"You cannot make compromises with terror," Ariel Sharon told the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. "It must be fought and defeated."

And the sorrowing guest - this revolutionary lesson being taught to him at a time when most of the victims had not yet been laid to rest - did not respond, at least according to the communique that reported the above lesson, "Look who's talking about defeating terrorism." But if not publicly, than at least during their private conversation, it would nevertheless have been proper for the guest to put his host in his place.

"If one cannot make compromises with terror," Lavrov might have asked (though he apparently did not), "why did you declare, at the height of the terrorist war against Israel, that Israel recognizes the Palestinians' right to a state? No prime minister before you ever said that, and so from the Palestinians' point of view, that statement was not merely a compromise - it was capitulation. And from the standpoint of those who are fighting Islamic terror worldwide, Israel, who gave the terrorists a state before defeating them militarily, thereby encouraged terrorism against us, however unintentionally.

"And even when the terrorists continued their atrocities, thereby proving that they were not fighting only for a state - since if they had been, they would have stopped blowing up buses and started establishing their state - you compromised, in defiance of the lesson you just taught me, with the ongoing terror.

"Fact: Instead of defeating them, as per your own doctrine, you began to build a fence. And even before the fence had been completed, you hastened to announce an additional compromise: the `unilateral disengagement.' And the disengagement, in addition to being a compromise with terror, is also causing an internal rift in your nation and your party the likes of which have never been seen before.

"In the past, Israel acquired a reputation - in Operation Jonathan in Entebbe, for instance - as a country that does not give in to terrorism. And in a world in which countries many times larger than Israel, such as Germany and France, did give in to terror and even paid it protection money in various forms, your uncompromising stance aroused admiration and constituted a strategic asset.

"No longer. And, though it pains me to say so, this process of Israel losing its deterrent power in the face of terror has occurred precisely at a time when someone like you, who contributed perhaps more than any other Israeli to your country's deterrent image, is at its helm. The fact that you, of all people, are the one who decided to grant the Palestinians a state in response to terrorism, and to hide from terrorism by means of a fence, and who afterward chose the already tested option known as `unilateral disengagement,' has caused a vast erosion - whose negative ramifications are hard to exaggerate - in your country's deterrent power vis-a-vis other, `conventional' enemies as well.

Moreover, instead of waging the offensive war that previously characterized your army, and particularly your own military leadership, you are putting your people and your army into a narrow ghetto, both mental and territorial, and turning the Arabs, the originators of suicide terrorism, into the victors and heroes of the Muslim world. And that fact also impacts on us: We assume that the Palestinians' impressive achievements - yes, impressive - will also encourage our terrorists and increase their motivation.

"You know that we oppose the settlements. But tell me: What is the rationale behind packing them up now, before you have defeated the terror? If that is the conclusion you draw from the rule you advised us to adopt - that `one cannot make compromises with terror' - then I must say, with all due respect, that this capitulation is a negative contribution to the war that we and the rest of the world are waging against terror. And don't be impressed by the compliments you receive - including, publicly, from us - for uprooting settlements: That is part of the verbal protection money that we also pay to buy a little quiet. But, as was proven in Beslan, to no avail.

"Despite the flattering articles in favor of disengagement that have appeared both in Israel and the rest of the world - articles whose purpose is to push you into additional concessions - you will never achieve the rehabilitation for which you long so greatly. Even now, they are saying that the fence is an act of apartheid and that you should be put on trial, along with the defense minister and senior Israeli officers, on charges of crimes against humanity. And such things were never said before, even when you controlled all the territory, when you built settlements on it, when you declared that it was the inheritance of your forefathers and that a Palestinian state would never arise upon it.

"Your excessive concessions have led the Palestinians, and all Muslims, to reach one clear conclusion: Terrorism pays. And that is what worries us. Just as international public opinion justifies terror against you, it is liable to justify terror against us, even though we are a great power. And we are liable to lose all the autonomous Muslim republics, not just Chechnya."

Presumably, these things were not said. But there is no doubt that Russians, Americans, Britons and even Frenchmen who are engaged in the war on terror are indeed astonished by what has happened to Israel, which has lost its self-confidence - a development that, as noted, also impacts negatively on the entire world's ability to fight Islamic terrorism.

Cricket legend Bacher to talk in Ra'anana
By Anglo File Sports Staff	Sep. 14, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Legendary South African cricketer and administrator Dr. Ali Bacher will be guest speaker at an event hosted by the Israel Cricket Association on Monday, September 20, at the Ra'anana Bowling Club. Proceeds from the NIS 100 admission fee will go toward the continued development of youth cricket in the Negev communities.

Bacher, who captained arguably the finest South African team of all time to four straight victories over Australia in 1969-70, was known for his tenacious performances on the field, and later became an influential cricket administrator, both during South Africa's isolation from international sports and after its readmission.

Bacher, one of the greatest Jewish sportsmen of all time, organized the so-called rebel tours during the 1980s, when South Africa's apartheid policies made it a sporting no-go area. But Bacher saw the post-Mandela writing on the wall, put away the check-book, and reinvented himself as South Africa's cricket supremo when the previously separate black and white associations combined to set up the United Cricket Board. Bacher's reward came when his country marched back onto the international scene at the 1992 World Cup. He remained at the helm for the best part of a decade, before stepping aside to mastermind the organization of the 2003 World Cup.

Bacher made his first class debut in 1959, at age 17, and made a total of 120 first class appearances during his career. As an active player he scored 7,894 runs (averaging 39.07 per match), 18 centuries, and made 110 catches. He captained the Balfour Park Cricket Team in 1962 and captained Transvaal the following year.

Bacher's highest single match score came against Australia in 1966, when he rang up 235 runs for his Transvaal side in the first-ever victory for a South African team against an Australian team in South Africa.

In 1972, he was awarded South Africa's Sports Merit Award, the country's highest athletics honor.

Reservist gets 28 days for refusing Gaza duty
"I lived in a society where one group's survival translated into injustice for others. That's the situation in Gaza and I don't want to be part of that," he said.
By Charlotte Hall	and Lily Galili	| Sep. 27, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
An IDF reservist was sentenced on Sunday to 28 days in jail for refusing to serve in the Gaza Strip. South African-born Sgt. (res.) G.S., employed at Tel Aviv University, reported to his base last week for duty, but told officers he was not willing to follow their orders to guard settlements in Gaza for 21 days.

G.S., who immigrated to Israel 12 years ago, said Sunday at his trial that his childhood in apartheid South Africa had been very influential on his willingness to go to prison for his beliefs.

"I lived in a society where one group's survival translated into injustice for others. That's the situation in Gaza and I don't want to be part of that," he said.

A year ago, G.S. signed a letter circulated by Courage to Refuse, the movement of reservist soldiers who refuse to serve in the territories, and he was subsequently transferred to a different unit. On Saturday, prior to the call-up for his latest stint of reserve duty, officers in his unit expressed willingness to allow him to perform guard duty at the Kissufim crossing, without going into the Strip itself.

On Sunday, however, the IDF authorities backed down from this proposal and put him on trial. G.S. said he believed the move was an indication of a change in IDF policy, with a hard line being taken against the left wing ahead of the disengagement. "They are using me to convey a message to the right at this point," he said.

Close to 250 reservists have been jailed since the outbreak of the intifada four years ago, according to Arik Diamant, director of Courage to Refuse.

On arriving at his base for reserve duty, G.S. says he was witness to the full extent of the phenomenon of "gray refusal": Of the around 130 reservists called up for duty in his unit last week, only 26 showed up. Around 50 were on sick leave, over 20 got off for "personal reasons" and 20 didn't show up at all, he said.

World-reknowned French philosopher Jacques Derrida dies
By The Associated Press	| Oct. 9, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
PARIS - World-renowned thinker Jacques Derrida, a founder of the school of philosophy known as deconstructionism, has died, the French president's office said Saturday. Derrida was 74.

Derrida died at a Paris hospital of pancreatic cancer, the television station LCI reported.

The snowy-haired French intellectual taught, and thought, on both sides of the Atlantic, and his works were translated around the world.

Provocative and as difficult to define as his favorite subject - deconstruction - Derrida has been a leading intellectual for decades. He is considered the modern-day French thinker best known internationally.

"With him, France has given the world one of its greatest contemporary philosophers, one of the major figures of intellectual life of our time," President Jacques Chirac said in a statement.

Derrida was born into a Jewish family on July 15, 1930, in El Biar, Algeria. He wrote hundreds of books, including "Writing and Difference," "Of Grammatology," and "Margins of Philosophy."

He was best known as a father of deconstructionism, a kind of critical thinking or mode of analysis developed in the late 1960s and applied to literature, linguistics, philosophy, law and architecture.

Derrida focused his work on language, showing that it has multiple layers and thus multiple meanings or ways of being interpreted. This challenges the notion that speech is a direct form of communication or even that the author of a text is the author of its meaning.

Deconstructionists like Derrida explore ways to liberate the written word from the structures of language confining it, opening up limitless interpretations of texts.

The deconstructionist approach was controversial, with detractors proclaiming the movement dead.

Former Culture Minister Jack Lang, who knew Derrida, praised his "absolute originality" as well as his combative spirit.

"I knew he was ill, and at the same time, I saw him as so combative, so creative, so present, that I thought he would surmount his illness," Lang said on France-Info radio.

Derrida was often named - but never chosen - for a Nobel Prize in Literature.

He moved to Paris in 1949, receiving an advanced degree in philosophy from the prestigious Ecole Normale Superieure in 1956.

Derrida taught philosophy at the Sorbonne University from 1960-64 and at the Ecole des Hautes Etude en Sciences Sociales from 1984-99.

He also taught in the United States, at the University of California at Irvine, among other schools.

However, Derrida was not confined to an intellectual ivory tower. He also took up causes dear to his heart, fighting for such things as the rights of Algerian immigrants in France and against apartheid.

"Profoundly humanist," Derrida spent his final years working for the "values of hospitality," particularly between Europe and the Mediterranean, said current Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres.

"He wanted to build an open idea of Europe," a ministry statement said.

Foreign Ministry warns Israel, Europe on collision course
By The Associated Press	and Haaretz Service	| Oct. 13, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
A secret report prepared by the Foreign Ministry warns that Israel's global standing could deteriorate in the coming decade and could even resemble the pariah status of apartheid South Africa.

According to the document, which was written in August by the ministry's Center for Political Research, Israel and Europe will find themselves on a collision course that will cause serious economic and diplomatic damage to Israel.

Israel could become increasingly isolated in the coming years if Europe becomes more influential, the Foreign Ministry report says.

"In extreme circumstances, this could put Israel on a collision course with the European Union. Such a collision course holds the risk of Israel losing international legitimacy and could lead to its isolation, in the manner of South Africa," according to the document.

"The EU could sharpen its expectation that Israel will comply with international norms ... and honor the authority of the United Nations and its agencies - an issue that has the potential of leading to friction," the analysts wrote.

The document says the EU is pushing to become a major global player in the next decade, and that as a result, the United States, Israel's main ally, could lose international influence.

In light of ongoing European criticism of Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a more powerful Europe could weaken Israel's position.

The paper also examines various scenarios for the development of Israel's relationship with Europe and Russia.

Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom has repeatedly warned that Israel has to work to strengthen ties with Europe, which also accuses of pro-Palestinian bias, and has expressed concerns over a growing wave of anti-Semitism in parts of Europe.

The report says a new form of anti-Semitism is developing in Europe, one which denies Israel's legitimacy as a sovereign Jewish state.

EU officials in Brussels said that while the EU and Israel have sound relations in the areas of trade and scientific research, they have very definite differences of opinion over Middle East peacemaking.

They also said the EU is seeking more of a say.

"Regarding the Middle East peace process and our relations with Israel and the Palestinians, there is no doubt that the role of the EU has increased," said Christina Gallach, a spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana.

"We have had difficult moments [with Israel] when we responded to things like the West Bank wall and now what is happening in Gaza," Gallach said, referring to the separation fence in the West Bank and the ongoing major military offensive in northern Gaza.

Europe fiercely objects to the route of the fence, and EU foreign ministers called this week for the Israel Defense Forces to withdraw from the northern Strip.

Gallach said the Israeli government wants to broaden the relationship with Europe, without giving the EU a bigger role in resolving the conflict.

"The situation is not easy but we have a lot of investment, especially in Europe, that is important to all of us," Foreign Ministry director-general Ron Prushor told Army Radio on Wednesday.

"When it comes to our economy, which is geared towards developing markets, we are talking about a scope of trade totaling $22 billion."

UN criticizes Israel for human rights violations in territories
By The Associated Press	and Shlomo Shamir Haaretz Service	| Oct. 14, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
Israel is guilty of severe human rights violations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including "wanton destruction" of houses and infrastructure, according to a United Nations report obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.

The annual human rights report is to be presented to the UN General Assembly later this month.

The 18-page report was prepared by John Dugard, the UN representative for human rights. It charges that while some of Israel's actions in the Palestinian areas can be explained by security concerns, many cannot.

During operations in the Gaza Strip, Israel engaged in "massive and wanton destruction of property," the report said. "Bulldozers have destroyed homes in a purposeless manner and have savagely dug up roads, including electricity, sewage and water lines."

The report is dated August 12, well before the current Israeli operation in northern Gaza, the largest in four years of fighting. On Thursday, Israeli forces pulled out of the Gaza town of Beit Lahiya, leaving behind a swath of destruction.

The report criticizes repeated Israeli operations in the Rafah refugee camp on the Gaza-Egypt border. Israel has said its forces were looking for arms smuggling tunnels.

The document said that over four years, "1,497 buildings have been demolished in Rafah, affecting over 15,000 people." Some of the destruction, along the border, was for operational reasons, the report said. "Often, however, the destruction is wanton," it charged.

The UN report concentrates on Israeli violations, according to the mandate given by the world body, and does not cover Palestinian attacks against Israelis, beyond noting that nearly 1,000 Israelis have been killed during the conflict.

Israeli Foreign Ministry legal adviser Daniel Taub said the fact that the document glossed over the Rafah gunrunners' tunnels and ignored the suicide bombings that Israel says the West Bank fence is meant to stop, means the report "has nothing to contribute to any serious discussion about finding the right balance between security and human rights."

The report also criticizes Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to withdraw from Gaza next year, as well as the separation barrier Israel is building along the line between Israel and the West Bank, dipping into the territory in some places.

Israel's disengagement plan is designed to allow Israel to say that its occupation of Gaza is over, and it is no longer bound by terms of the Fourth Geneva Convention governing occupied territories - but since Israel would retain control of border crossings and air space, it remains an occupier, the document said.

Israel does not recognize application of the Geneva Conventions to the West Bank and Gaza, calling them disputed areas, not occupied.

Some of the harshest criticism in the report was aimed at the separation barrier, called "the Wall" in the document.

Israel has said the complex of walls, fences, trenches and electronic surveillance devices is necessary to keep Palestinian suicide bombers out of Israel, after hundreds of Israelis were killed.

The UN report charges that Israel's real goals are to incorporate Jewish settlements into Israel, confiscate Palestinian land and force Palestinians to move - echoing Palestinian charges.

"The Wall is responsible for much of the suffering of the Palestinian people," the document charged. It noted that the UN world court ordered Israel to tear it down, but Israel is ignoring the ruling, following instead its own Supreme Court instructions to move the barrier to reduce hardships on Palestinians.

The report notes that "terrorist attacks inside Israel" dropped 83 percent in the first half of 2004 compared to the same period a year before, but "there is no compelling evidence that this cannot have been done with equal effect by building the Wall along the Green Line," the 1949 cease-fire line between Israel and the West Bank.

Israel does not recognize the Green Line as a boundary and insists on negotiating its permanent border in peace talks.

The report called for international action against Israel because of the barrier. "This is no time for appeasement on the part of the international community," the document said twice.

UN figure calls on EU to freeze Israel's special trade status A United Nations food expert called on the European Union to freeze Israel's special trade partner status, in order to pressure Jerusalem into ceasing a policy that the expert says is interrupting the distributrion of foor to Palestinians in the territories.

According to Israel Radio, the demand was made by Jean Ziegler, UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, who is stationed in Geneva.

Ziegler said he approached the former President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi on the matter, and that he will also contacted the new president, Jos Manuel Barosso. Ziegler said he would submit a report at the next United Nations General Assembly meeting , according to which 22 percent of Palestinian children in the territories were suffering from malnutrition.

Ziegler, a Swiss citizen, was a member of the Swiss parliament in the past, representing a far left party. He is a controversial figure, and several Jewish organizations have claimed he is hostile to Israel. A Geneva-based Jewish group that monitors UN activity asked the chairman of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Micheal Smith, to dismiss Ziegler, citing his one-sided approach to Israel.

Ziegler has previously called on Europe to break off trade with Israel, and accused Israel of conducting policies that were interrupting food distribution in the territories, and compared the West Bank and Gaza to concentration camps.

A classified foreign ministry report that was published Wednesday warned that the international standing of Israel could worsen in the next decade, and that its situation could resemble apartheid-era South Africa.

The report states that Europe is gaining international strength, which influences Israel's standing, given Europe's criticism of Israel's policy in the territories. Europe is strongly opposed to the route of the separation fence, and EU foreign ministers demanded this week that the Israel Defense Force cease its operations in the northern Gaza Strip.

According to documents compiled by the foreign ministry, if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not resolved, in the next decade Israel and Europe will find themselves on a collision course that will gravely harm Israel politically and economically.

The report also states that a new wave of anti-Semitism is developing in Europe, which denies the legitimacy of Israel as a sovereign Jewish state.

Israel and Europe on a `collision course,' Foreign Ministry warns
By The Associated Press	and Haaretz Staff	| Oct. 14, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
A secret report prepared by the Foreign Ministry warns that Israel's global standing could deteriorate in the coming decade and could even resemble the pariah status of apartheid South Africa.

According to the document, which was written in August by the ministry's Center for Political Research, Israel and Europe will find themselves on a collision course that will cause serious economic and diplomatic damage to Israel.

Israel could become increasingly isolated in the coming years if Europe becomes more influential, the Foreign Ministry report says.

"In extreme circumstances, this could put Israel on a collision course with the European Union. Such a collision course holds the risk of Israel losing international legitimacy and could lead to its isolation, in the manner of South Africa," according to the document.

"The EU could sharpen its expectation that Israel will comply with international norms ... and honor the authority of the United Nations and its agencies - an issue that has the potential of leading to friction," the analysts wrote.

The document says the EU is pushing to become a major global player in the next decade, and that the United States, Israel's main ally, could lose international influence as a result.

In light of ongoing European criticism of Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a more powerful Europe could weaken Israel's position.

The paper also examines various scenarios for the development of Israel's relationship with Europe and Russia.

The report says a new form of anti-Semitism is developing in Europe, one which denies Israel's legitimacy as a sovereign Jewish state.

EU officials in Brussels said that, while the EU and Israel have sound relations in the areas of trade and scientific research, they have very definite differences of opinion over Middle East peacemaking. They also said the EU is seeking more of a say.

"Regarding the Middle East peace process and our relations with Israel and the Palestinians, there is no doubt that the role of the EU has increased," said Christina Gallach, a spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana.

"We have had difficult moments [with Israel] when we responded to things like the West Bank wall and now what is happening in Gaza," Gallach said, referring to the separation fence in the West Bank and the ongoing major military offensive in northern Gaza.

Hundreds of S. African Muslims protest Olmert's planned visit
By The Associated Press	| Oct. 16, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
CAPE TOWN - Hundreds of Muslims in South Africa marked the start of the holy month of Ramadan with marches Saturday to protest a visit next week by Israel's Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.

Olmert is expected in the country next week to discuss strengthening economic ties with South Africa.

"Suddenly economics is more important than human suffering," said Mandla Sishi of the Palestinian Solidarity Group, which helped organize a demonstration in Cape Town, one of three major cities where rallies were staged.

"We call on our government to cease negotiations with Israel. Impose sanctions on Israel now," Sishi told a crowd of about 500 people gathered outside the District Six mosque at the foot of Table Mountain.

Marchers waved placards reading, "Death to Israel," "Sharon the butcher" and "Stop the holocaust in Palestine."

The crowd sang old liberation songs borne out of the struggle against South Africa's racist apartheid government. The crowd chanted "Amandla Awethu" (Power to the people) and "Phantsi Israel"(Down with Israel).

Protest leaders also delivered a letter of demands to the regional government in the Western Cape province. The letter called on South Africa to cancel Olmert's visit and make efforts to isolate Israel internationally, including by severing diplomatic links and imposing sanctions.

South Africa has held a number of meetings with Palestinian and Israeli representatives throughout more than four years of fighting in a bid to help the sides find common ground.

Regional Prime Minister Ebrahim Rasool said he would forward the protesters' letter to the foreign affairs ministry.

Another of the demonstration's organizers, Ebrahim Gabriels of the Muslim Judicial Council, said members of Hamas and other violent Palestinian groups behind suicide bombings and other attacks in Israel were not terrorists. Like South Africa's anti-apartheid movements, they are fighting for freedom, he said.

"Hamas is not a terrorist group. The apartheid government once called the African National Congress terrorists, but we said no ... they are liberators," he said.

Gabriels said his movement supported Hamas "100 percent," drawing cheers and raised fists from the crowd.

Marchers also gathered in the cities of Durban and Johannesburg.

Between America and South Africa
It is customary to treat the things said on the eve of a presidential election lightly, particularly if the race is likely to be determined by the Jewish vote.
By Akiva Eldar	| Oct. 18, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The debate surrounding the disengagement plan and a national referendum lacks a component that has for years accompanied political-ideological debate in Israeli society: Everyone is talking about "a torn people" and about "civil war." You hear almost nothing about "American pressure" and "a rupture with the United States." The prime minister cannot warn the public, as many of his predecessors did, that if his plan doesn't go through America won't phone us. Here, in response to the eulogy for the road map plan that Dov Weisglass delivered in the pages of Haaretz, all the American secretary of state, Colin Powell, had to say was that the adviser's statements didn't matter - only the firm commitment to the road map of Ariel Sharon himself.

That was three weeks after Sharon himself voiced his "commitment" to the road map in an interview with the daily Yedioth Ahronoth, saying: "[Labor's Amram] Mitzna suggested beginning by evacuating Netzarim and continuing to evacuate according to the road map ... I objected to that ... Now, too, we're not going for the road map. I'm not prepared to do that."

Since the disengagement plan nudged the road map off the agenda, a reminder is in order that Sharon, according to Powell, is "committed," in accordance with the road map, to an agreement that will bring about "the establishment of an independent, democratic and lasting Palestinian state that will end the conflict" in 2005.

It is customary to treat the things said on the eve of a presidential election lightly, particularly if the race is likely to be determined by the Jewish vote. This time, too, some are warning that "the American pressure" will come on the day after the elections.

Gerald Ford promised Yitzhak Rabin that if elected president, his first act would be to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Later on, when they met at the White House, Ford shrugged his shoulders and muttered: "Life looks different from the Oval Office." Ronald Reagan bequeathed the dialogue with the PLO to George Bush Sr. He, in turn, bequeathed to Bill Clinton the linkage between the peace process and financial aid (releasing loan guarantees in return for freezing settlements).

Bush Jr. is the first American president who abandoned the "land for peace" formula in favor of the formula of "unfreezing negotiations in return for a total freeze on terror." Weisglass recounted that "when Sharon declared six or seven years ago that we would never negotiate under fire, he only generated gales of laughter. Whereas today that same approach guides the president of the United States. It was passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 405-7, and in the Senate by 95-5 ... Effectively, this whole package that is called the Palestinian state, with all that it entails, has been removed from our agenda indefinitely. And all this with authority and permission. All with a presidential blessing and the ratification of both houses of Congress."

Weisglass wasn't overstating matters. On September 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden changed the rules of the game in the American-Israeli arena. Islamic terrorism deleted the term "pressure" from the lexicon of U.S.-Israel relations and granted every last terrorist veto power over the peace process. In the congressional elections, which take place alongside the presidential race, the large political group that is enamored of the concept that Israel has no partner for peace, unfortunately, until Yasser Arafat is gone, is expected to strengthen its position further. The Jewish lobby, the one that contributes greatly to fashioning the positions of American politicians on everything concerning the Israeli-Arab conflict, is having trouble dealing with even a unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip.

Regardless of whether Bush is reelected or John Kerry takes his place, there will be no "pressure" from America. Unfortunately, we will have to wait patiently until the prophecy by the brave doomsayer from the Foreign Ministry comes to pass and the world begins treating Israel like the apartheid regime in South Africa.

France: Mideast peace process has implications for Europe
By The Associated Press	| Oct. 18, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier expressed deep concern Monday over the breakdown of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, saying the instability in the region had direct implications for Europe.

"The spirit of violence is threatening the entire region," he said at a news conference. "The instability and insecurity is also for us, the Europeans, our own instability and insecurity."

Barnier spoke at a news conference with Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom on the second day of a three-day visit to Israel. Earlier in the day he met privately with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and President Moshe Katsav.

Barnier said Europe has been a financial giant thus far, but a political midget vis-a-vis the Middle East peace process. The foreign minister stressed that Europe was interested in becoming a political giant and playing a greater role in the region's diplomatic process, Israel Radio reported.

Many Israelis view France as biased toward the Palestinians in the Middle East crisis. Shalom acknowledged differences with France, but said they had not interfered with bilateral relations.

"We see France as an example for all of Europe in her determination not to let differences of opinion on the tactical issues in the peace process get in the way of our mutual desire to promote our bilateral cooperation," he said.

Shalom also welcomed a role for France and other EU members in pressing for changes in Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.

"I call on France and Europe to bring their influence to bear on the Palestinian side to promote (Palestinian) political reform," he said.

Barnier's visit to Israel was the first by a senior French official since Sharon set off a flap in July by saying France was host to "the wildest anti-Semitism" and urging French Jews to flee the country and come here. Both governments said the uproar over the incident was over.

Also Monday, Barnier said France had no intention of pressing for economic and political sanctions against Israel, despite its deep concern over Israel's Middle East policies.

A confidential 10-year forecast prepared in August by the Foreign Ministry warned that the country is on a collision course with the European Union and could turn into a pariah state, like South Africa during the apartheid years, if the Middle East conflict is not resolved.

However, Barnier rejected the possibility that any punitive actions against Israel might be imposed.

"This is not at all our state of mind," he said.

Barnier emphasized that Israel's EU association agreement, which provides it with lucrative economic and trade benefits, would not be suspended, declaring "there is no going back on the terms of the association agreement."

U.S. campus group refuses to condemn Palestinian terror
At the convention Israel was compared to South Africa under apartheid, called a "disease," and there were calls to stop American aid to Israel.
By Nathan Guttman	| Oct. 18, 2004 | 12:00 AM

DURHAM, North Carolina - Ran Bar-On's shirt displays a large Palestinian flag above an Israeli tank and Palestinians in silhouette. Below is emblazoned "Divest from Israel." This is the official T-shirt at the annual convention of the Palestine Solidarity Movement (PSM), of which Bar-On is a key organizer.

The convention, held at Duke University, drew some 500 activists (including Israelis) and closed yesterday, and was peaceful for the most part.

Bar-On, 24, considers himself an Israeli, even though much of his life was spent abroad. He volunteers to explain fervently, in native Hebrew, not only why it is necessary to strive for Israel's economic isolation as a means of ending the occupation, but also why he, as an Israeli, is organizing it all.

Jewish organizations had called for the convention's cancellation, since previous gatherings became a platform for harsh anti-Israel sentiment. The university took a lot of flak; besides letters and petitions, several donors threatened to pull out, but the university felt academic freedom was at stake.

One of the main complaints against PSM - which Jewish organizations view as the most radical of the pro-Palestinian organizations active on U.S. campuses - is that the movement refuses to condemn terrorism. "We are a solidarity organization. We don't take a stand on the matter," Bar-On tries to explain.

In his view, the cause of terror is the Israeli occupation, so when that ends, terrorism will also automatically end. "It's like Algiers under the French or Poland under the Nazis. There is always violence under occupation," says Bar-On, whose grandfather, Hanan Bar-On, was a Foreign Ministry veteran and one of Israel's most senior diplomats.

Fayyad Sbaihat, a Palestinian from Jenin who is studying in the U.S. and is also a conference organizer, adds a practical explanation: "And if we say to the Hamas to stop firing rockets from Gaza, will they listen to us? We don't want empty words without action."

The protesters outdoors, however, have trouble understanding why the PSM finds it so hard to devote even a sentence to terrorism. On the second evening of the convention, Shlomo Marmur and Daniel Shoval of the Amcha movement are standing outside the auditorium waving sings. The university administration fenced an enormous lawn for the protesters and surrounded it with guards, but on this chilly evening Marmur and Shoval are alone in a corner. "Just let them say that they're against terrorism. Silence encourages terrorism," says Marmur, who came from New York to protest the convention.

Abe Greenhouse was one of the people passing by who heard their demand for a disavowal of Palestinian terrorism. Greenhouse, known as the Jewish student who tossed a cream pie at then minister Natan Sharansky two years ago at Rutgers University, responds with a question: "Why don't they say anything against the Israeli government that is killing civilians?" He objects to the murder of civilians on any side, he explains. Next to him is Nirit Ben-Ari, an Israeli from Ramat Hasharon who has lived in New York for eight years and is active in the organization Jews Against Occupation. "Violence is not just bombing buses," she says. "The attacks are just the symptoms, the violence is the disease."

At the convention Israel was compared to South Africa under apartheid, called a "disease," and there were calls to stop American aid to Israel. But there were also several attempts to speak with the demonstrators outside and ceaseless claims that the gathering is not anti-Israel, only anti-occupation.

At the end of the day, representatives of the organizations that comprise the PSM voted on resolutions to change a clause in the organization's guidelines that stipulates a neutral stance on terror attacks. These proposals were defeated by a majority, so the movement maintains its refusal to condemn terror.

Greenhouse ascribes the striking Jewish presence in the organization to the tikkun olam (setting the world to rights) tradition," but Yona Berman of Amcha sees matters differently: "They were educated to justice, but didn't learn anything about what goes on in Israel.

Except for Amcha, which counter-picketed the convention, most Jewish organizations avoided confrontation and prefered holding a parallel convention about Israel, featuring former MK Avraham Burg. Chabad brought to Durham the sign from the No. 19 bus destroyed in Jerusalem, and the Jewish community held a concert against terror.

Is it time to consider a regional agreement?
It is not within the power of the IDF to bring about a solution or a fundamental change, when all around millions of people in the Arab and Muslim world are being educated to believe that Israel is to blame for all their trials and tribulations.
By Aluf Benn	| Oct. 19, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The continuing stagnation in the war with the Palestinians, the absence of a conclusion and the sense that there is no formula at hand for ending the hostilities are reawakening the question of the aims of Israel's war. What, in fact, is the fighting about? To what end is the Israeli public being called upon to rally and make sacrifices? Is a stable agreement at all possible, or will the war go on forever?

In the 1990s the perception prevailed that the cure for the conflict was "a two-state solution," that if Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat were allowed to rule over an independent state in the territories he would mend his ways and change from a terrorist and enemy into a nice neighbor. When difficulties emerged, Israel decided to force the partition solution on the Palestinians, initially by diplomatic means, with the help of U.S. president Bill Clinton, who convened the Camp David summit in 2000.

When diplomacy failed, and the Palestinians started a war, Israel tried bombardments, targeted assassinations, imprisoning Arafat and occupying the cities of the West Bank, with the diplomatic backing of President George W. Bush. The aim of the war was to change the Palestinian leadership, until they became worthy of independence, in accordance with the road map.

And only Arafat was not convinced - whether because he was offered too little (as the left thinks), because of his desire to destroy Israel (as the security establishment thinks) or because of his revolutionary nature, which is no longer given to change. The Palestinian state was not established and such a possibility now seems very distant, despite the periodic declarations by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, the Americans and the Europeans about their "commitment to the road map."

Israel has succeeded in decreasing the terror, but even in the Israel Defense Forces it is believed that military means are not enough in the Sisyphean attempt to "persuade" the Palestinians with blows from a billy-club that terror doesn't pay. These bullying means are effective at decreasing the threat, but it is not within their power to bring about a solution or a fundamental change in the situation, when all around millions of people in the Arab and Muslim world are being educated to believe that Israel is to blame for all their trials and tribulations.

In these circumstances, the top military echelons are beginning to wonder whether it is correct for Israel to continue to insist on imposing a two-state solution, or whether its time has passed. Possibly the war is being conducted on the basis of an irrelevant paradigm, which was perhaps not practical even in the past.

What might a new paradigm be? In the West, there is an intellectual and media debate going on about Israel's right to self-definition as a Jewish state. Palestinian writers are proposing the establishment of "a state of all its citizens" on the ruins of the idea of partition and thus "exposing the Zionist apartheid." The idea is making waves. Last week the Los Angeles Times devoted an editorial to the question of "Who Needs a Jewish State?" and decided to support its existence after all.

In the Israeli establishment there are not, of course, many supporters for the idea of one state for the two peoples, which would mean the end of Zionism. Instead, there are those who are proposing an opposite idea, "the regional settlement," which means abandoning the failed attempt to share the land with Arafat and his cohorts and a return to the solution of the 1948 truce agreements. Egypt will take the Gaza Strip, Jordan the West Bank and Syria the Golan Heights, and Israel will obtain stable agreements with the countries responsible in exchange for conceding the territories.

This is how the army's support for an agreement with Syria should be understood, as well as the statement by Chief of Staff Moshe Ya'alon that it is possible to give up the Golan Heights in return for an agreement. As far as Ya'alon is concerned, the problem of security is not only measured by topography. No less important is who is in control on the other side and with a stable peace, the heights and the borders are less important. Syria looks like a possible partner for a stable agreement, but it is doubtful that this is the case with respect to the Palestinians.

Ideas about a regional agreement have cropped up several times during the past year. Sharon's disengagement plan also tossed them a wink, in his suggestion that the economy of the West Bank link itself to Jordan and that Egypt take on the responsibility for security in the Gaza Strip. The international community is ignoring these ideas and sticking to the Arafatian notion of making the Palestinian Authority into a state, and neither Jordan nor Egypt is keen to play the role designated for them in this scenario. Syria indeed does want the Golan, but Sharon is refusing to negotiate.

And despite the difficulties, the proponents of the idea believe that it is worthy of serious discussion in Israel, no less than Sharon's plan for a long-term freeze of the war along the post-disengagement lines.

Ehud Olmert on visit to South Africa to tighten ties between countries
By The Associated Press	| Oct. 20, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
JOHANNESBURG - Israel's Vice Premier Ehud Olmert flew to South Africa on Wednesday on a trip aimed at deepening ties between the two countries and encouraging dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.

Olmert, who also serves as Israel's trade minister, was scheduled to sign an investment agreement with South Africa on Wednesday evening. Terms of the deal would only be announced at the signing, said Mantshele wa ga Tau, spokesman for the South African Department of Trade and Industry.

Olmert is the highest-ranking Israeli government official to visit South Africa since apartheid ended in 1994.

His visit provoked protests by hundreds of Muslim South Africans who staged marches in three cities over the weekend demanding that their country cut economic ties with Israel.

The South African government said the visit was part of a series of meetings with Palestinian and Israeli representatives in recent years aimed at helping both sides find common ground.

"South Africa supports the realization of a two-state solution in the Middle East with an independent state of Palestine coexisting side by side with Israel within secure borders," the Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a weekend statement.

During the four-day trip, Olmert was scheduled to meet with President Thabo Mbeki, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Aziz Pahad and Minister of Trade and Industry Mandisi Mphahlwa.

No further details were released about the trip.

South African President Mbeki meets with Deputy PM Olmert

		 submit to reddit	
PRETORIA - South Africa on Friday defended its warming of relations with Israel, criticized by pro-Palestinian groups, and said it would play an even hand in its attempt to help find a solution to the Middle East conflict.

President Thabo Mbeki met Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in Pretoria on Friday behind closed doors as part of a series of meetings by Mbeki's black-led government with factions in the Palestinian conflict.

South Africa says it hopes to use its experience in negotiating the end of white rule to help bring peace in Israel, but has also been a vocal critic of Israel's security polices.

"It's not a question of warming up of relations, it's a continuation, so that we can extend out contacts with factions of the Israeli society," Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said after Mbeki and Olmert posed for photographers.

"We are not mediators, we want to use our own experience to help them," he told a news conference. "We will criticize actions, for instance of Israeli defense forces occupying territories and at the same time criticize actions of the Palestinian groups, such as suicide bombing."

He said South Africa wanted to see a legitimate Palestinian state living side by side with Israel behind secure borders.

Pahad said talks to discuss broad issues covering peace in the Middle East would continue later in the day.

South Africa's willingness to talk to the Israeli government, and its position as Israel's largest trading partner in Africa, has angered some pro-Palestinian activists drawn mainly from its economically influential Muslim minority.

The Palestinian Solidarity Group this week accused Pretoria of "squandering the moral high ground" by forging links with Israel, while other activists accused South Africa of purposely keeping Olmert's visit a hush-hush affair to limit protests.

Olmert, who also heads the trade and industry ministries, is the first top Israeli official to visit South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994. He has hailed what he said was a new era of stronger ties with South Africa during his trip, and signed an investment protection agreement with his counterpart.

Trade between the nations stands at about $500 million per year, and officials say it could double in coming years.

South Africa, which hosted talks last month with members of the Likud party to try to revive negotiations to end the Middle East conflict, has slammed Israel for building a wall in the West Bank, which Israel says is to keep out suicide bombers but Palestinians call a land grab.

When Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry and Trade Ehud Olmert met with Nelson Mandela two weeks ago, the former South African president told Olmert that he was very pleased with the disengagement plan and was closely following developments between the Israelis and the Palestinians. "I wish Prime Minister Ariel Sharon success," he added. "This is a step of immense importance." According to Olmert, these are not insignificant words from a man who is considered to be like God in South Africa.

The meeting with Mandela, arranged at the last moment in the leader's Johannesburg home, represented a marked shift in South African policy toward Israel. Olmert was the first Israeli minister officially invited to visit South Africa since the African National Congress (ANC) rose to power in 1994 elections.

"During the visit, I met with Mandela, President Thabo Mbeki and six ministers," says Olmert. "I attended one meeting where several leaders of the former regime were present, like Pik Botha, and a few former military commanders, who are now members of the ANC party. Israel was not criticized in any of the meetings. I frequently find myself in positions like that - where ministers and public figures, even in nations which are quite friendly, feel a need to pay verbal homage by leveling criticism at Israel so that they will not, God forbid, be accused of forgeting our harsh policy in the territories, and our mistreatment of the Palestinian public, etc. Not a word like that was spoken in any of the meetings in South Africa."

A soft spot for Arafat

Olmert's support of the disengagement plan and his position as deputy PM apparently were instrumental in landing him the invitation. But wide sectors of the South African public still identify Israel with the apartheid regime. Public image does not shift in a day. Olmert's visit was preceded by demonstrations in Capetown, Johannesburg and Pretoria, the capital city, calling on the government to cancel the visit, which protesters described as "a withdrawal from the battle for equality."

The South African Palestine Solidarity Committee, central in organizing these demonstrations, refer to Israel as "Apartheid Israel" and call the Likud Party "a vicious racist party." Muslim organizations also participated in the demonstrations alongside Cosatu, South Africa's largest trade union, and the Sangoco Coalition for Non-Government Organizations.

Signs at the demonstrations bore slogans like "Death to Israel," "Sharon the butcher," "Stop the holocaust in Palestine," "Israel and Zionism are racism" and "Isolate Apartheid Israel." A spokesman for the South African Palestine Solidarity Committee in Johannesburg described Olmert as "the most racist of all Israeli politicians." He said: "When he was mayor of Jerusalem he literally ordered the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians," and he called the visit "a reversal to apartheid times."

Olmert told his hosts that he was not surprised by the demonstrations because "Your public has become accustomed to hearing major criticism of Israel and one-sided information for years." Given this reaction, Olmert positively cited his hosts' readiness to conduct a public dialogue with him and their resistance to changing any aspect of the scheduled visit, including formal ceremonies.

A mutual investment protection agreement was signed, which later received the approval of President Mbeki. Both governments agreed to hold talks on signing a limited free trade agreement in 2005.

The high profile visit included multiple media interviews, meetings with writers and editors and, of course, the meeting with Mandela. Mandela reserves a warm corner in his heart for Yasser Arafat, whose struggle he supported during his years of imprisonment. Mandela told Olmert, "I told the Palestinians more than once that they would never beat Israel through violence. I said, `The Jews are a wise and talented people, and you should make peace with them.'" Mandela noted that Jewish organizations had always supported him, and defended him in his own struggle, and spoke about Yitzhak Rabin's death with sadness.

Alon Liel, who was Israel's ambassador to South Africa from 1992 to 1995, emphasizes how poor relations between the two nations were until only a few years ago. He cites the UN anti-racism conference in Durban two-and-a-half years ago, where truly anti-Semitic demonstrations took place. Three months ago, Durban also hosted the Unaligned Nations Conference, led by South Africa, where it was decided to recommend that Israelis living in the territories should not be permitted entry into these nations.

Israel failed to receive an invitation to participate in President Mbeki's swearing-in ceremony after the last elections on April 17, 2004. When the Israeli ambassador phoned the foreign minister's office in Pretoria to investigate the meaning of this oversight, he was informed that an error had been made. Israeli President Moshe Katzav and the Israel ambassador received invitations to the ceremony only days before its scheduled date but did not attend.

Liel says that the deterioration in relations occurred during the intifada. Attacks against Israel were broadcast on South African television, which focused on the separation fence. Even government ministers referred to the fence as the "apartheid wall." South Africa sent Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Aziz Pahad to the International Court of Justice in The Hague in February, 2004 to speak against the separation fence. "There were 14 nations who came to the court at The Hague to testify against the fence," Liel says. "South Africa was the only nation among them with which we have diplomatic ties." Mbeki also called for meetings between figures in the Israeli left, like Yossi Beilin, Naomi Hazan and representatives of the PLO, under his auspices.

"When senior members of the Israel's Foreign Ministry visited South Africa, they only met the deputy foreign minister," complained Ambassador to South Africa Tova Herzel, in an interview with Haaretz at the end of her term. She compared this with the honorable welcome enjoyed by members of the Israeli left.

Economic potential

Israel unofficially paid South Africa back by not sending a replacement for Herzel, who left her post in December, 2003. A new ambassador, Gershon Gan, was appointed but was forced to relinquish the position and leave the foreign service due to personal considerations. Meanwhile, a tender has been issued for the position of minister, and the appointment is in committee, according to a spokesman from the Foreign Ministry.

Olmert says, "I think this is something which we need to rectify immediately." The Industry and Trade Ministry also decided to cancel the services of the Israeli economic attache in Johannesburg for budgetary reasons. Ministry spokeswoman Haya Peri explained that budget cuts made by the Treasury do not permit the economic attache to continue, but that all the functions that he performed will be transferred to the embassy in Pretoria.

The first indications of the shift in the South African government's attitude toward Israel were witnessed in the appointment by Mbeki of his ambassador to Israel, Major General Fumanekile (Fumie) Gqiba. Gqiba was a former commander of the ANC's military wing, and served most recently as chaplain general of the South African National Defense Force (SANDF) before his appointment here. In September, 2004, only two months after submitting his credentials, Gqiba told Haaretz that the government of Israel should not "question our relationship with the Palestinians" and must remember that Israel was once "part and parcel of the old regime [in South Africa]. They supported them until the last. So they cannot overnight expect us to be kissing their cheeks." He also noted that some of "the technology used by the apartheid regime was supplied by Israel." Despite that, Gqiba announced that his government was interested in fostering relations with the Sharon government. "It's a myth that we are anti-Israel," he said. "We want to be partners with them toward the goal of peace."

He arranged a visit to South Africa by a delegation of MKs and members of the Likud Central Committee, which received a warm reception and met with President Mbeki. As a member of this delegation, Olmert invited three ministers (who accepted) to visit Israel, and that invitation lay the groundwork for Olmert's recent visit.

What explains the change in South African policy?

South Africa is mainly motivated by the desire to play an active role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, says Olmert. "They want to feel that they have a certain status, which is taken into consideration in connection with the conflict, and they understand that a policy of sanction and attack doesn't work."

Will South Africa be able to play a role?

Olmert insists that the South African model, which could be described as a "binational state" in terms of the local conflict, is unacceptable to him and to wide sectors of the Israeli public.

"But that does not mean that South Africa, a nation that experienced enormous political turmoil and internal revolution, might not have some sort of influence on the process of forging alternative relations between the Israelis and the Palestinians."

Olmert says he told President Mbeki that the current problem in the conflict is not the absence of a mediator, but the absence of a Palestinian partner. Moreover, he asked Mbeki, "Why should the State of Israel be interested in the involvement of an interest which misses no opportunity to vote against us [in the UN] and to condemn us?"

Netafim President and CEO Erez Meltzer, who was in the delegation of 23 industrialists that accompanied Olmert on his recent visit, poses his own explanation for the new South African approach to Israel. Meltzer says that South Africa is interested in taking advantage of its new economic power to strengthen its position in the international market. Given this interest, he says, South Africa cannot ignore Israel, a nation known in the international marketplace for excellence, broad experience, an innovative approach and knowledge in the fields of communication and agriculture. According to Meltzer, the potential value of business agreements discussed during the visit could reach $30 million in the fields of communication, agricultural technology and infrastructure innovations. Olmert summarizes, "There is the potential for tremendous cooperation between the nations."

Second chance with an old-new partner
The disengagement plan can serve as an ideal breeding ground for nurturing an old-new partner, in the guise of Abu Mazen. The very fact that it is unilateral will enable Israel's prime minister to coordinate the move with a Palestinian statesman who has never stopped condemning terror and believing in a two-state solution.

If the government were headed by someone like the old version of Labor Party chairman Shimon Peres, or the new version of Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, we would have to write that the impending death of Palestinian Authority (PA) Chairman Yasser Arafat and the re-election of U.S. President George W. Bush have created a unique opportunity to change the face of the Middle East. We would have to mention the Beilin-Abu Mazen document, and the Peres-Abu Ala understandings, and to quote from the Clinton parameters and Taba agreements. For the purists, we could have brought selected lines from the Geneva Initiative and from the Nusseibeh-Ayalon principles.

If regional developments preoccupied us somewhat more than petty local politics, we would have to discuss the significance of the reports that archterrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (a native of the Jordanian city of Zarqa) has his eyes on Jordan. From there, as we know, it's a short distance to the West Bank. If the heroism of Israel Defense Forces commanders and the Shin Beth security services were not measured only by the number of assassinations but also by their willingness to tell the truth to the leaders and to the public, they would warn that the day isn't far off when the Al-Qaeda ambassadors of death in Gaza will arouse longings in us for the late Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.

Were the government echelons in Jerusalem and in Washington capable of seeing further than the end of their noses, there would be a point in writing that if we don't soon reach a two-state agreement, before we have a binational, Balkan-style state or a South African-style apartheid regime, we will find ourselves with a Fallujah-style terrorist state.

However, what can we do when all that the Jewish mind has succeeded in inventing for us is the unilateral disengagement plan from places where we have no reason to be, and what preoccupies us is the ladder that will enable the man who claims the prime minister's crown to climb down from his demand to conduct a referendum regarding our exit from there? This is the situation.

"Without any relation to the question of whether disengagement is a successful plan," states a position paper of the Reut Institute - a nonpartisan Israeli think tank for policy planning, which presents its analyses to the National Security Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - "once it has begun, it has become a strategic watershed for the State of Israel." The authors of the document warn that causing the plan to fail will constitute a significant victory for the supporters of the binational state and will make it difficult in the future for Israel to use the strategic alternative of unilateral moves in order to bring about the end of its domination of the Palestinians. Arafat's demise will not lead to a replacement of the unilateral disengagement with negotiations, since his presence was the excuse rather than the reason for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's refusal to discuss a permanent agreement with the Palestinians. Moreover, as the paper explains, in Arafat's absence, in the short term, at least, there will be a decline in intra-Palestinian legitimacy for the historic compromises required to end the conflict.

Indeed, the fragile coalition that is beginning to be formed in Ramallah would do well to impose order on the military and civilian mechanisms before it is required to make painful concessions, such as the partition of Jerusalem and the limitation of the right of return for Palestinians. Unfortunately, even Arafat's death will not erase overnight the "there is no partner" propaganda that has taken root among us, left and right. In a rare moment of public courage, Chief of Staff Moshe Ya'alon expressed his regret about Sharon's refusal to grant Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) - during the short period in which he served as Palestinian prime minister - achievements that could have strengthened his position vis-a-vis "there is no partner" Arafat. Ya'alon was referring to the release of prisoners, the removal of checkpoints, an easing of economic restrictions and an attempt to renew security coordination.

With the claim that Arafat would take credit for the gestures, Sharon refused to give Abu Mazen even an iota of the achievement that he gave Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, with the release of murderers (in exchange for the bodies of three IDF soldiers and an Israeli businessman who had been held hostage). Arafat took this reason/excuse with him as well. The disengagement plan can serve as an ideal breeding ground for nurturing an old-new partner, in the guise of Abu Mazen. The very fact that it is unilateral will enable Israel's prime minister to coordinate the move with a Palestinian statesman who has never stopped condemning terror and believing in a two-state solution. It's not certain that there will be a third chance.

Mandela: Arafat was 'outstanding freedom fighter'
By Haaretz Service	and Agencies	| Nov. 11, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
World leaders marked the death Thursday of Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat with a mixture of praise for his dedication to the Palestinian cause and regret for his failure to realize the dream of statehood for his people.

South African anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela on Thursday hailed Arafat as "an icon in the proper sense of the word" and urged new commitment to a Middle East settlement.

"Yasser Arafat was one of the outstanding freedom fighters of this generation, one who gave his entire life to the cause of the Palestinian people," said Mandela, who met Arafat numerous times over the years.

"We honor his memory today. We express our sincerest condolences to his wife, family and the Palestinian people. It is with great sadness that one notes that his and his people's dream of a Palestinian state had not yet been realized."

Terje Roed-Larsen, the United Nation's longtime Middle East envoy and a key mediator in past peace talks, said Arafat's last years were marred by mistakes.

"One of the reasons his credibility as a leader was undermined on the Palestinian side was an increasing agreement among the leadership and the Palestinian people that Arafat had led them in the wrong direction over the past four years," Roed-Larsen told Norwegian state radio NRK.

"He was like a surrealistic painting, full of contradictions, full of mystery, full of inconstancies. He was complex, deep, superficial, rational, irrational, cold, warm. He may be the most fascinating person I have ever met, and without comparison the most fascinating leader I have ever met," Roed-Larsen said.

French President Jacques Chirac hailed Arafat on Thursday as a man of courage and conviction who embodied the Palestinian struggle for a state.

"It is with emotion that I have just learnt of the death of President Yasser Arafat, the first elected president of the Palestinian Authority," Chirac said in a written statement. "I offer my very sincere condolences to his family and to people close to him."

Chirac, who had visited Arafat days before his death, called him a "man of courage and conviction who, for 40 years, has incarnated the Palestinians' combat for recognition of their national rights."

Tears and gunshots, praise and condemnation marked the death of Yasser Arafat, whose fight for the Palestinian cause made him a towering and controversial figure on the world stage.

Arafat's death at a Paris hospital, long expected after he flew to France for treatment of a mysterious illness late last month and soon after fell into a coma, was announced about 6 A.M. in the Middle East.

Powell urges calm On word of the death of Arafat, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell pledged on Thursday the United States "will do all we can" to help Palestinians achieve peace and urged calm to prevail in the region.

"Our concern remains for the Palestinian people and the realization of the vision of an independent, democratic, viable Palestinian state, at peace with its neighbors, as set forward by President Bush," Powell said.

U.S. President George W. Bush's offered his condolences to the Palestinian people on the death of Arafat.

"The death of Yasser Arafat is a significant moment in Palestinian history," Bush said in a statement issued by the White House. "During the period of transition that is ahead, we urge all in the region and throughout the world to join in helping make progress toward these goals and toward the ultimate goal of peace."

The State Department said Wednesday that Israel must implement Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's disengagement plan despite the death of Arafat.

United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan was "deeply moved" by the death of Palestinian Arafat and urged renewed efforts by the Palestinians and the Israelis to reach peace, a spokesman said late on Wednesday.

The spokesman said Arafat would be remembered for leading the Palestinians in a "giant step" toward peace in signing the Oslo accords in 1993 and, "It is tragic that he did not live to see it fulfilled."

Annan expressed his condolences to Arafat's family and to the Palestinian people.

The European Union praised Arafat on Thursday for his "single-minded commitment" to the Palestinian cause and pledged to work with the new Palestinian leadership to find peace in the Middle East.

"We will work with the Palestinian authorities and the international community to contribute to realizing the aspirations of the Palestinian people," said a statement on behalf of the EU from Dutch Foreign Minister Ben Bot. The Netherlands holds the EU's rotating presidency.

Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said the "best tribute" to Arafat would be to renew efforts to implement the 2003 "road map" peace plan which envisions an end to violence and the creation of a Palestinian state.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is expected to press for a Middle East peace push in his meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush in Washington on Friday, said Arafat "led his people to an historic acceptance and the need for a two-state solution."

British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said, "Arafat played such a dominant role on behalf of the Palestinians over so many decades that it is hard to imagine the Middle East without him.

Straw will represent the British government at Arafat's funeral.

But Australian Prime Minister John Howard said that history would judge Arafat harshly because of his failure to embrace a proposed peace deal with Israel.

Earlier this week, Howard had ruled out attending Arafat's funeral, saying an Australian government representative would go instead.

Putin: Heavy loss Russian President Vladimir Putin praised Arafat on as "an influential political figure on an international scale."

"It is a heavy loss for the Palestinian leadership, and all Palestinians," Putin said in a statement released by the Kremlin. He credited Arafat with "strengthening friendly relations between Russia and Palestine."

Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II expressed condolences following the death if Arafat, who he said "had waged a struggle for decades to uphold the national interests of the Arab people of Palestine," the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

The Vatican praised Arafat as a leader who struggled to win independence for his people and repeated its support of a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel.

A Vatican statement called Arafat an "illustrious deceased" and asked God to grant eternal rest to his soul and peace to the Holy Land.

Chinese President Hu Jintau said Arafat's "death is not only a great loss for the Palestinian people, but the Chinese people also lost a great friend."

Former U.S. president Bill Clinton on Thursday offered condolences to Palestinians but said their leader had missed the opportunity to create lasting Middle East peace in 2000?

Clinton will not attend either his memorial service or his funeral, the former president's office said.

In his statement Clinton said, "I regret that in 2000 he missed the opportunity to bring that nation into being and pray for the day when the dreams of the Palestinian people for a state and a better life will be realized in a just and lasting peace."

Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter called Arafat "the father of the modern Palestinian nationalist movement" and "a powerful human symbol and forceful advocate."

Tears, gunshots in Arab world In the teeming refugee camps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh near the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, burning tires spewed heavy black smoke and guerrillas fired into the air, rites of mourning that expressed frustration as well as sadness.

Houses on Ein el-Hilweh's streets and alleys were bedecked with Arafat's pictures, Palestinian flags and black banners. Arafat has strong loyalties in the camp, but also fierce rivals. Ein el-Hilweh, known for its lawlessness, is home to about 75,000 Palestinian refugees and their descendants who were displaced by war since the 1948 creation of Israel, and who had pinned hopes on Arafat's promises he would lead them home.

At Cairo University, the campus where Arafat earned an engineering decades ago, one student was moved to tears.

"Every leader has both mistakes and accomplishments," said 19-year-old Nadia, who gave only her first name. "I think he was a very kind person. His people loved him very much."

The peace motif on a new scale
I have always preferred to spend my time in places where people exchange ideas that go beyond ideology, where peace already breathes between Palestinians and Jews - in the hospitals of Ramallah, at universities, at musical events.

I never met Yasser Arafat because I never wanted to. Despite a number of invitations, I have always preferred to spend my time in places where people exchange ideas that go beyond ideology, where peace already breathes between Palestinians and Jews - in the hospitals of Ramallah, at universities, at musical events. In these places lie the roots for the resolution of the conflict in the Middle East. The Palestinians and Israelis there move forward much more so than their politicians because they act with logic and emotional intelligence - qualities of which Yasser Arafat unfortunately lost sight.

Tradition demands that we not speak ill of the dead. Arafat gave the Palestinians self-confidence; he became the icon of an oppressed people. But we cannot ignore the other truth: He was perhaps a genius, surely a living myth, and without doubt a terrorist. In any event, he was an autocrat. From today, the cry for peace in the Middle East must now be: "The autocrat is dead! Long live the people!"

Arafat himself also nurtured a myth parallel to that of his own - the myth of Hamas. For a ling time, international diplomats mistakenly thought that they had to negotiate with Arafat because he was the only alternative to the radical Palestinians. This isn't true. I know that there is a large group among the Palestinians that supports a third path - the democratic Mubadara, the Palestinian National Initiative, led by Mustafa Barghouti. The members of this group support a solution that recognizes the right of the Jews to return to their land and also believe in a non-violent struggle for the rights of the Palestinian people.

A logical analysis of the situation in the Middle East leads to the conclusion that the settlements should be dismantled and an independent Palestinian state should be established as soon as possible. At the moment, we have a policy of apartheid. The solution is an independent Palestinian state, and Jerusalem should be the capital of the two peoples.

Arafat missed the opportunity to fight the mutual mistrust between Jews and Palestinians. There can be no peace if the Palestinians deny the Holocaust. But there also can be no peace if Israelis do not accept at least partial responsibility for the conflict. Arafat's death is like a musical transition - one phrase ends, and with the last note, a new phrase begins, with no break whatsoever. Now the issue is how the next phrase will sound. And time is pressing. The phase after Arafat has to belong to the Palestinian people, and this time requires great courage - from the Palestinians, the Israelis, and especially from Europe.

Israel and the U.S. can no longer block free elections in the Palestinian areas out of fear of a possible Hamas majority. They must trust the Palestinian people. I am convinced that Hamas will not win a free election.

In light of the fact that the United States will always be perceived by the Muslim world as biased, the key to peace lies in Europe. More than half of all Israeli exports go to Europe, and Europe bears a strategic and moral responsibility - also due to its past ties with the Jewish people. And it has no choice. If it doesn't bring peace to the Middle East now, the Middle East will quickly bring violence to Europe. Europe must guarantee the holding of legitimate elections in the Palestinian Authority.

I don't know exactly when Arafat began to distance himself from his people. Maybe it had happened by the Madrid Conference, before Oslo. These negotiations were led by Palestinians who lived in the occupied territories, and they awakened great hopes. Parallel to this, Israel and Arafat decided to begin talks on a different level, and went to Camp David. And then, in 2001, Arafat made the biggest mistake of his life - not by refusing Ehud Barak's proposals, but, worse still, by militarizing the second intifada, or at least tolerating its militarization.

If he had organized peaceful resistance, the Palestinian cause would have won a moral victory. At that historic moment, Arafat lost sight of the essence of the Palestinian people. At that moment, he became a tragic figure: The majority of his people no longer believed in him, and the Israelis certainly didn't.

Now, the issue of who is to blame for the failure of the peace talks until now is unimportant. Anyone who believes in a peaceful solution in the Middle East has always come up with the same results as far as the borders are concerned. The issue of the terms of the peace has always been the same, like Beethoven's "Eroica." Just an arpeggio, but then, a miracle happens - the same notes are played, but on a different scale. And this is exactly what we have to achieve: We have to intone the peace motive on a different, new scale.

The death of Yasser Arafat has opened a new door. Now is the time for the first step toward democracy. This step is full of risks, and requires trust on all sides. We don't know where it will lead. But if we just stand still, we will have no chance of escaping the violence.

A deconstructing of symbols: South Africa looks at Sakhnin
By Jerrold Kessel	and Pierre Klochendler	| Nov. 21, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The long yellow drapes in the living room of the home of Bnei Sakhnin chairman Mazen Ghnaim filter out the sunshine, but they can't deflect the noise. The modest front room perched over the major traffic circle on the town's main street - the busy central Galilee trunk road that bisects Sakhnin - is the unlikely pitch for an encounter between two heady symbols.

For a fortnight, a powerful middle-ranking delegation of grass-roots activists from the African National Congress, the political movement that dominates post-apartheid South Africa, has quietly been hosted by Machon Hanegev at a special "leadership seminar." Their encounters have been primarily with Jewish Israel. But now, their itinerary has brought them to the Arab town as part of tentative efforts to strike up a tangible relationship between the famous local football club and the South African government.

Arrayed on the two sides of the higgledy-piggledy Ghnaim living room, like teams before a friendly match, it seemed that it would be all too easy for the two dozen African visitors and an equal number gleaned from the Sakhnin "Who's Who" to create a stage for symbolic sentimentality, with both sides lining up to extol the common symbols of coexistence and reconciliation which they project. Indeed, Ghnaim declares that the gathering represents harmony - just being here is proving what we believe we ourselves are doing in our club - that ways of living together can be found.

Sakhnin's Arab and Jewish players aren't here. But the club's African component, among them Nigerian striker Agoye Olumide, his wife and child, all in colorful boubous (traditional Western African robes), are playing their due role. Missing, however, is Zimbabwean national goalkeeper Energy Murambadoro, who abruptly informed the club this week that he won't be returning from "a short trip' back to southern Africa. Left in the lurch, Sakhnin brushes off their former goalkeeper's charge that he was never made to feel really at home; it's a kind of own goal that threatens to stain the club's self-proclaimed identity as a miniature "family of the world".

Only last May, two magical pictures suggested that there could be common ground between these two unlikely partners. In back-to-back events, two sparkling trophies were held high, and at the same time gave lie to an old adage that sports and politics don't mix. Sports and politics do mix. They do so particularly when such powerful issues as equality and national identity are in the picture.

The first political cup gave Nelson Mandela (the great symbol of reconciliation) a Nobel-like crowning moment for "the decade of democracy" of his "Rainbow nation": FIFA rewarded South Africa and its soccer team (which is affectionately known as Bafana, Bafana, literally in Zulu, "the Boys") with the chance to host the 2010 World Cup.

Matching that on their more humble field were the "Sons of Sakhnin" - as Abbas Suan, captain of the team, which likes to pride itself on being a "rainbow club" within Israel, held aloft the State Cup.

Catapulted into worldwide limelight, Bnei Sakhnin had hoped to capitalize, literally, by winning sponsors in neighboring Arab countries or the Gulf. Nothing materialized. Despite Sakhnin's self-made triumph, many in the Arab world remain suspicious of their Israeli identity, and regard the club as a negative symbol. So now they are looking instead to the original "rainbow" society.

But something curious is happening in the Ghnaim living room, and subsequently, when Sakhnin hosts the ANC people at Da'us, the club's favored Oriental restaurant. Behind the gleaming pictures of hearty handshakes and friendly interaction, there's a different picture. The symbols are simply not interplaying, and it's not on account of language or cultural barriers.

Maybe it's because symbols are often used to make national and communal interests serve those symbols. Here, it's the other way around: By-passing the symbols, interests are seeking to advance hard political and pecuniary goals.

Sound familiar? Isn't the process of deconstructing myth and fitting it to the needs of realpolitik something with which Israelis and Palestinians have been grappling ever since Oslo? Specifically, isn't it precisely what the Palestinians are busily engaged with following the death of their arch symbol?

Mohammed Bashir abu Shadeh, the Sakhnin mayor, evokes the expected symbol of South Africa. "We envy your success in having moved from apartheid to modern democracy. We look up to you for having achieved what we hope one day to achieve. You provide clear hope for Arabs and Jews that such things are possible here too."

The man who had brought the two groups together is Kenny Brozin, boss of the Israeli branch of the South African-based fast-food company Nandos, and one of Bnei Sakhnin's sponsors. Along with his speciality piri piri chicken, he caters lofty ideals. His food for thought is that a Sakhnin-South Africa relationship could benefit both. This club, Brozin tells the visitors, is a breath of fresh air in the complexities of Middle East politics. Building on the concept of a state of soccer for all its fans, he is keen to make Sakhnin a household word in the country where the idea of "a state for all its citizens" is reality.

But it's in the nature of rainbows to be ephemeral. Political and strategic agendas change too. And, it soon becomes clear that finding a pot of gold - literal or strategic - at the end of a rainbow simply ain't easy.

Top-level Pretoria political circles had shown not inconsiderable interest in the Nandos notion of South Africa embracing Sakhnin and for the team to be hosted on a goodwill soccer tour to the republic during the Christmas season break. Then in recent weeks, Brozin and the company's management in South Africa found that the initial enthusiasm seemed to be drying up. They pondered: Was the caution they were encountering because of grass-roots reticence about any kind of new relationship with Israel?

South Africa has indeed embarked upon a committed new political strategy vis-a-vis Israel. A symbiotic, symbolic PLO-ANC link, deftly forged as an alliance of the weak during the "guerrilla years" of the 70s and 80s, remains indelible. Until recently, having succeeded in transforming itself into the Rainbow nation, South Africa advocated the model of what is known in Middle Eastern parlance as the bi-national state.

It has dropped that. South Africa now accepts that its situation was unique and is not given, as they had previously argued, to emulation by Israelis and Palestinians. It now also accepts that the realistic solution for the Middle East conflict is for two states to live alongside one another.

Still, having re-joined the consensus of nations around a two-state solution, South Africans envisage a role for themselves in trying to help promote that solution - an even more involved role. "We are not a model, but we believe we can share our experience in a way that can prove instrumental in resolving this conflict as well," Tony Yengeni, the designated delegation leader and a member of the national ANC executive, says with disarming single-mindedness. South Africa's Ambassador to Israel, Major-General Fumi Gqiba, expands on that. What South Africa can offer is an alternative to the "kind of dominating influence which the U.S. seeks to wield. We would never seek to impose our way. We don't believe in declaring arrogantly `this is the way'." Not to impose - seen as an ideal in itself.

Pointedly, Mandela's successor, president Thabo Mbeki, has struck out in a new direction by courting the "powers that are" in Israel. Late in the summer, a ranking Likud delegation was invited on a high-profile visit to South Africa, and three weeks ago Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert made the first official ministerial visit since the collapse of the Oslo reconciliation process. And now here, this ANC delegation, hand-picked by Mbeki's man in Tel Aviv, Gqiba.

During the Olmert visit, there was a substantial outcry, including street protests and calls for a boycott, to nip in the bud any burgeoning contacts with Israel. Gqiba insists that his president "will not allow his new strategic course to be shunted aside."

In this context of diplomatic realpolitik, that being influential doesn't grow out of catering to friends, the Sakhnin projection of itself as a "model cross-community soccer family" suddenly seems quaintly passe.

With moral judgments and political efficacy being the kernel issue, what future is there for the Nandos initiative? A clue comes from Sinsale Maclean, the mayor of Buffalo City, a city of one million that was known as East London in pre-apartheid days. He cannot even entertain the idea of Buffalo's National League team Bush Bucks being encouraged to host Bnei Sakhnin, "unless both football associations, South African and Israeli, agree that the visit is important." But this is not about soccer, it is politics of the highest order, he implies: "A Sakhnin visit would have to be sanctioned at the highest level."

The chance of Sakhnin being embraced by South Africa seems now to hinge on whether Bnei Sakhnin, albeit an Israeli club, is recognized as not simply "just another Israeli club." Sakhnin could be promoted only if it were to be seen as serving Mbeki's broader Middle East political purpose. Since these are Israelis who know discrimination well, the South African authorities, by forging an official link with Bnei Sakhnin, might mute domestic discontent about the overall warming of the country's attitude toward Israel.

Therefore, South Africa's support of Sakhnin would not be just because it serves as a bridge between Israeli Arabs and Israeli Jews (as Sakhnin had envisaged), but would serve as a bridge between South Africa's own rainbow symbol and its strategic shift on how the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ought to be solved.

Sakhnin's pale imitation of the South African rainbow is not a factor. Still, even if this incongruous encounter doesn't yield anything tangible, there is a sort of silver lining for Sakhnin in any dark cloud beyond its rainbow. One of the club's constant battles is to gain recognition and acceptance within Israel. It appears that at least when outsiders relate to the team, they relate first and foremost to the Israeli component of their identity - of Sakhnin as an Israeli soccer team.

A warning signal from the churches
In the eyes of American Jews, the church's new approach is a significant threat both to Israel's status in the United States and to the delicate fabric of relations between organized Judaism and organized Christianity there.
By Nathan Guttman	| Nov. 26, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
WASHINGTON - At the beginning of last week, Israel's foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, held a press conference during the General Assembly of the United Jewish Communities in Cleveland; the audience of journalists was composed mainly of representatives of the Jewish media in the United States. One of the first questions they asked the foreign minister concerned the attitude of the State of Israel toward the decision of the institutions of the Presbyterian church to withdraw some of its investments in Israel because of Jerusalem's policy in the territories. For a moment, Shalom appeared to be confused by the question, but even after his aides had explained the issue to him, he was forced to admit that he is not at all familiar with the matter.

The staff of the Foreign Ministry hastened thereafter to explain that "there was no need to bother the minister about this issue," which, according to a senior Israeli official who deals with the subject, is being handled at lower levels. But the incident itself shed light on substantial differences in approach between the State of Israel and the American Jewish community when it comes to handling the threats of divestment from Israel on the part of the Presbyterian church and other bodies in the United States.

To the organized Jewish community in the United States, this is an important issue. In the eyes of American Jews, the church's new approach is a significant threat both to Israel's status in the United States and to the delicate fabric of relations between organized Judaism and organized Christianity there.

Israel sees things differently. A senior Israeli official who deals with the subject explained last week that the approach of the government was to try to keep the affair out of the headlines as much as possible. The Israeli assumption is that the threats of divestment are only of marginal practical importance, and that the American Jewish community can use its influence to moderate the harsh decisions. In this case, there is no point in providing free advertising for an anti-Israel approach. The burden of the struggle is therefore being borne by American Jews, and they can point for now to a certain degree of success.

After the initial uproar aroused by the decision of the Presbyterian Council, the decision was toned down, and in the final analysis, there will be divestment only from a number of companies or organizations that are directly related to the occupation in the territories. At the same time, there has been a strengthening of pro-Israel groups within the Presbyterian system that are explaining to the U.S. Jews that the decisions of the council do not necessarily reflect the views of the three million Presbyterian believers all over the United States.

The American Jewish organizations managed not only to pave the way for rapprochement with the Presbyterians, they even managed to convince the Episcopalian church to remove a similar decision from the agenda, and also to prevent liberal Protestant denominations from discussing the question of divesting from Israel.

The idea of divestment originated in the struggle of Western human rights organizations against the government of South Africa during the period of apartheid. The success of the organizations in convincing businesses and academic and religious institutions to divest from racist South Africa had a real effect on the country's economy; and in the opinion of those who initiated the struggle, it hastened the end of the apartheid regime.

The idea of using the method in Israel has been popular mainly among pro-Palestinian activists on American campuses since the beginning of the second intifada in October 2000. The effort is directed at institutions with investments in Israel, such as the pension funds of the Presbyterian church, which are worth about $7 billion; part of this sum is invested in Israel bonds. Municipalities, universities and workers' organizations have similar investments.

Supporters of the approach of the Israeli government, which prefers to ignore the issue, can point to the fact that during the four years since the start of the intifada, not a single dollar has been withdrawn from investments in Israel. But the American Jewish community sees a more worrisome picture, of which there are many examples - from annual conventions of students who support divestment, to discussions in the institutions of the Presbyterian, Episcopalian and Anglican churches in the United States, to the bitter battle against Caterpillar, manufacturer of the bulldozers used by the Israel Defense Forces to destroy homes and crops in the territories.

The success of the Jewish community in halting these initiatives for the time being is what enables Israel to treat the question of divestment as a curiosity, or as an internal American issue. But the very fact that discussion of the subject continues, and that the Christian churches belonging to the centrist denominations in the United States are moving away from support for Israel, is a warning signal, not only for the American Jewish community, but for Israeli decision-makers as well.

Donor countries won't fund Israeli-planned separate roads for Palestinians
The representatives of the donor countries, including the U.S. consul general in Jerusalem, have officially said they do not intend to finance any project against the will of the PA.

The Palestinian Authority has asked the donor countries to turn down an Israeli request for them to finance the paving and upgrading of alternative roads in the West Bank that would take the place of the main roads that the Israel Defense Forces prevent Palestinians from accessing, allowing only Israeli cars on them.

The representatives of the donor countries, including the U.S. consul general in Jerusalem, have officially said they do not intend to finance any project against the will of the PA. According to a diplomatic source, the donor mandate (including the World Bank, as the planning, coordinating, financing and monitoring arm) is to operate opposite the PA and therefore they are only committed to development projects the PA submits and is interested in.

Another diplomatic source said that most of the donor countries are also committed to the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague concerning the separation fence. That source said that most of the donor countries are carefully examining the projects they finance to make sure the projects do not inadvertently sustain the fence or the settlements, as the international court ruled. The separate transportation system proposed by Israel, said that source, raised concern among some donor countries that the system contravenes the international court's ruling.

Palestinian Planning Minister Ghassan al Khatib told Haaretz yesterday that the Palestinians in principle reject the Israeli proposal for a separate road network because it would perpetuate the settlements and consolidate an apartheid regime. The separate road system contradicts the Palestinian and international demand, he said, for removal of all the checkpoints and lifting the internal closure in the West Bank and it should be regarded as part of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan.

Al Khatib plans to reiterate this at the upcoming conference of donor countries slated for Oslo next week, which will be discussing the financing of Palestinian development and rehabilitation plans. According to a diplomatic source, an Israeli Foreign Ministry official due to take part in the meeting is expected to raise the issue of the disengagement plan.

As part of the discussions with the World Bank about the disengagement plan, Israel proposed that the donor countries finance the construction of 16 passages (tunnels or bridges), upgrade existing secondary roads and pave new roads, for a total of about 500 kilometers of roads.

A representative of the Israeli National Security Council presented the new road network as a solution to the internal closure imposed on the Palestinians in the West Bank, a closure that the World Bank says is the main reason for the economic deterioration in the territory. The general proposal was delivered to the World Bank in the summer, and at the end of September, officials from the office of the coordinator of government activities in the territories presented to the World Bank a map marked with the proposed passages, the new roads and the upgraded roads. The map makes no mention of the Green Line but does designate Areas A and B (about 40 percent of the West Bank), areas that under the Oslo accords are under Palestinian control.

Diplomatic sources and Palestinian Planning Ministry sources say that it is difficult to estimate the overall cost of the Israeli proposal, since it depends on how wide the roads will be, and the total number of roads to be upgraded compared to new roads to be built. But according to assessments provided by the Israelis, with each new road costing between $3-4.5 million, meaning a total of around $60 million, the total cost of the entire network would be around $200 million, to be paid by the taxpayers of Europe, the U.S. and Japan.

After the map was given to the World Bank, which passed it on to the donor countries and the Palestinians, the PA cabinet discussed it on the basis of an analysis prepared by the PA Planning Ministry. In October, the PA cabinet rejected the Israeli plan. Because of an Israel attack on Jabalya at the time, followed by Arafat's illness and death, the PA's position on the map went unnoticed by the public.

The PA's position, said al Khatib ahead of the donor conference next week, is that Israel is trading territorial contiguity for a future Palestinian state with "transportation contiguity" for Palestinians and territorial contiguity between the settlements and Israel proper. The alternative, secondary roads, which run parallel to the main highways, are long, winding, more difficult for traffic, and not economically viable.

Moreover, their existence as a separate traffic network, said the PA planning minister, will strengthen the settlements, which the international court has ruled illegal. Al Khatib emphasized that the U.S. consul general told PA Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia that the U.S. accepts the PA position and will not carry out any road projects in the West Bank against the PA's will.

The PA set up an interministerial committee meant to discuss every road-building project on its own merits. Among the roads suggested by the Israeli proposal are roads that the PA had already planned and various international agencies, including USAID were to finance. In accordance with PA government instructions, from now on requests by local Palestinian municipalities for financing and repairing roads will go to the central planning authorities in the PA, something that did not always happen in the past.

Diplomatic and Palestinian sources said that local authorities, stifled by the internal closure, might not see the overall picture and thus might favor building new roads parallel to existing roads that are forbidden by the Israelis to Palestinian traffic. The interministerial committee therefore came up with a set of criteria for approval or denial of road-building requests from the towns and villages. For example, the roadworks should not serve the existence of the separation fence; should not be an alternative to existing roads; and should not form the basis for two, separate road networks in the territory.

Based on those criteria, three separate local authority requests for small roads, for the use of farmers, were already turned down by the PA central planning authority.

A surprising decision by the PA cabinet
How might the decision of the Palestinian cabinet serve as leverage for a popular struggle - Palestinian, Israeli and international - against the Israeli policy of carving the Palestinian territory into enclaves and mutilating the two-state solution.
By Amira Hass	| Dec. 1, 2004 | 12:00 AM

There were no real surprises in the map submitted two months ago by Israeli officials to World Bank representatives and, via these representatives, to the donor countries. It presented a system of 16 passages - tunnels or bridges - and roads slated for upgrading or construction in the West Bank. The passages were intended to keep Palestinian and Israeli vehicles far apart by diverting the Palestinian vehicles to secondary roads. Israelis, that is, Jews, will for the most part travel on a system of well-maintained highways.

The Jewish settler logic of ethnic separation based on blatant discrimination in rights, living conditions, laws and the official attitude toward Jews and Palestinians has deepened over the years until it has become second nature for Israeli society. Who, if not the various consuls and World Bank representatives, who often travel around the West Bank and Gaza Strip, are well aware of the logic that has developed here and finds expression in the map they received?

It is also not surprising that Israel expects the donor countries to finance these alternative roads and passages, which are aimed at ensuring the well-being of the settlements and their ability to develop and expand. After all, Israel has become accustomed to this luxury: It occupies the Palestinian territories, and the taxpayers of the Western countries bear the burden of the occupation's damages.

Those taxpayers financed the rehabilitation of the Palestinian infrastructure at the beginning of the Oslo process, which years of intentional neglect during the period of direct Israeli rule had destroyed. During the Oslo years of indirect occupation, they compensated for the economic closure and siege that Israel imposed as a means of political pressure on the Palestinian Authority, but they did not succeed in dampening the fervor of Israeli construction in the settlements.

Since the outbreak of the intifada, they have spread a wide safety net by financing the daily sustenance of about half of the Palestinian population, which fell into unprecedented poverty as a result of the policy of internal closure. They build new housing to replace the homes of civilians that Israel shells, bombs and demolishes with bulldozers. They cover the deficit in the current budget of the Palestinian Authority when the Israeli government or Israeli judges decide to put a lien on the PA's tax revenues (which are transferred via the Israeli Finance Ministry).

So why shouldn't the taxpayers in the United States and Japan also pay for the passages near Itamar and Alon Moreh in order to enable the dozens of residents of these settlements to continue to travel safely on Arab-free roads, to build on the hilltops until they link up with the neighboring settlement, to market eggs from free-range chickens in Israel while hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living in the area are clustered into strange mini-enclaves, trapped between Israeli roads and settlement blocs?

Perhaps there is one surprising thing in this story of submitting the map of passages: The Palestinian cabinet heard the Palestinian Ministry of Planning's analysis, which views the Israeli proposal as a plan to perpetuate the settlements and establish an apartheid system. Despite the short-term logic in accepting the passages plan - it would enable relatively free Palestinian movement in the West Bank after years of destructive internal closure - the cabinet decided to reject it completely. In this way, it signaled to the donor countries not to agree to finance the passages nor any other road without the approval of a special Palestinian inter-ministerial committee. That is, the cabinet did not only protest verbally, but also adopted a practical measure.

This is surprising because since 1994, the PA has acted as if it is incapable of doing a thing to counter the Israeli policy of creating Palestinian enclaves in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. One aspect of this policy was the accelerated construction in the settlements and the roads servicing them under all governments, both Labor-Meretz and Likud. A second aspect was the pass system for Palestinians and travel restrictions Israel imposed within the occupied territories since 1991. The travel restrictions were ultimately aimed at ensuring the unfettered expansion of the settlements - that is, the creation of Jewish territorial contiguity.

The Palestinian Authority, under the leadership of Yasser Arafat, acted as if it were a matter of force majeure, a deterministic process that no diplomatic or popular struggle could counter. It generally left efforts to oppose land expropriations for settlement construction in the hands of NGOs and private individuals. It was busy with the big show of "state building." Its leaders cooperated and are continuing to cooperate with the closure regime - that is, with the pass system. As VIPs, they enjoyed and continue to enjoy Israel easing their own travel. They were not behind the decision of some villages to refuse to accept the special travel passes issued by the Civil Administration for residents of "the closed military area" between the separation fence and the Green Line.

The question is how the decision of the Palestinian cabinet, which even obligates the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), might serve as leverage for a popular struggle - Palestinian, Israeli and international - against the Israeli policy of carving the Palestinian territory into enclaves and mutilating the two-state solution.

A pugilist's dream: An Israeli boxer in time for Beijing
The story of Brian Rakoff - a Jewish boy growing up in South Africa in the mid-1950s - begins in the musty, smoke-filled boxing halls of Cape Town.
By Haim Shadmi	| Dec. 1, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The story of Brian Rakoff - a Jewish boy growing up in South Africa in the mid-1950s - begins in the musty, smoke-filled boxing halls of Cape Town. Hidden behind apple crates and trash cans, wooden stairs led down to darkened cellars, where the city's blacks - banned by the apartheid regime from competing against white boxers - fought in secret.

It was into one such cellar that Rakoff - who was instilled with a sense of mission, of social justice, and who identified with the blacks of his hometown - stumbled one day, and announced that he was joining in.

Perhaps "stumbled" is the wrong word. Entering the darkened building from the bright sunlight of a Cape Town summer's day, Rakoff lost his footing and fell down the entire flight of stairs leading to the cellar.

The sight of a scrawny, short white boy tumbling into their cellar left the black boxers dumbstruck. The first one who did speak to Rakoff was Gunboat - a huge black boxer, rippling with muscles and with a single shark's tooth hanging from a strap around his neck.

Gunboat took Rakoff under his wing and made him his apprentice. For several months, Rakoff laced up Gunboat's gloves and wiped the blood from his eyes in between rounds. Then, one day, Rakoff was given a chance to fulfill his dream and box against some of Gunboat's friends in the cellar as a sparring partner. Once again, the sight of this short white kid, bouncing around the ring, amused the black boxers - until he managed to floor his opponent with a powerful hook to the face. After several more months, Rakoff finally got his first pair of gloves.

"Gunboat adopted me," Rakoff says. "He always used to tell me, `Brian, boxing will be with you all your life.' He was 35 when I met him, and if he had been boxing today, he would have been an Olympic champion at least. I never liked the discrimination against blacks, and I identified with them. And boxing was the only sport I could participate in and make a little money too. Boxing in South Africa is now all about big money; the cellars are a thing of the past."

Rakoff, now 69, lives with his wife, Adina, in Givat Ze'ev, not far from his son and daughter-in-law. Since immigrating to Israel four years ago, Rakoff has dreamed of setting up a boxing school and, ultimately, sending an Israeli boxer to the Olympic Games. Ideally, Rakoff wants to fulfill that ambition in time for Beijing 2008.

When he immigrated, Rakoff decided that as a religious Zionist who believes in affirming the Jewish people's ties to the land, it was his duty to serve as a volunteer in the reserves. During that time, and during his many visits here in the years before he immigrated, Rakoff saw that Israelis know how to punch. Now he intends to transfer that quality from the street to the boxing ring.

The infrastructure and resources are available, he insists, and with his experience and knowledge - he spent more than five decades as a trainer, administrator and promoter of boxing in South Africa, and has the letters of commendation to prove it - all that is missing are students.

Rakoff says that at the very least, he can promise his students the dream of incredible riches. Getting rich and hitting people? What could be more Israeli than that?

"I've been in the boxing business for 50 years," says Rakoff. "I even had a Jewish trainer at the beginning - Bernie Rubin. He taught me many things, but most importantly, he taught me never to give up. And that's what I am saying now: don't give up."

Why do you think Israeli boxing is so underdeveloped?

"Boxing has been neglected in Israel for years. We didn't have a single boxer at the Athens Olympics. I understand that everything here is about football and basketball, but it's very disappointing. A huge talent like Roman Greenberg - who is Jewish - is training abroad. If I was in the business, he would not have left. And what about the Arab boy from Shfraram? What's his name - Kasisi? Why is he thinking about retiring? Because no one is investing in them. I have contacts in the Israel Boxing Association, and they tell me, `If you've got professional trainers, they're welcome to come any time.' So I'm going to build the first boxing school in Jerusalem. There are some boxing clubs in Israel, but they don't have any facilities. I'm talking about the real thing. I want to establish the first club here where people fight for money, and that's where we'll find the talents to take to Beijing. It's a huge challenge, but it'll be okay. Four years is a long time. I know that football and basketball are the most popular sports here, but others sports can flourish. I'm looking for talented boxers from all over the country. I've been in this business a long time, and I can feel it: there are a lot of undiscovered talents in this country."

Regarding "Soldiers force Palestinian to play violin at West Bank checkpoint," November 25

Your article and accompanying photo regarding the Israeli soldier who demanded that a Palestinian "youth" at a checkpoint play his violin omitted the following relevant details.

On August 9, 2001, another Palestinian "youth," this one the son of a well-to-do restaurant owner from Jenin, managed to slip through a checkpoint on the border of West Jerusalem and stroll to the city center with a guitar slung over his shoulder. He entered the Sbarro pizzeria and saw a room crowded mostly with children out for a light lunch. Then, with the explosives hidden in his guitar, he murdered 15 Israelis in cold blood.

Among those victims was my daughter, Malki, and her friend - two sweet 15-year-old girls with hearts of gold. There are many more stories of eternal pain wrought by that guitar.

To ignore the context of those searches at the checkpoints - four years of barbaric terror attacks on innocent Israelis - is dishonest. But in this case, what exactly is MachsomWatch criticizing? The soldiers in Horit Herman-Peled's photo, which Haaretz chose to print, not once but twice in one issue, do not appear to be gloating or enjoying the Palestinian's music. Rather, they seem intent on confirming, without dismantling and damaging it, that this was indeed nothing more than a violin.

The fact that an army spokesperson apologized for the soldier's conduct without mentioning the above facts is disconcerting. It highlights the destructive pressure that MachsomWatch is exerting on the people entrusted with defending us and our children.

One day, an uncertain soldier at a checkpoint may be forced to make a split-second choice between inconveniencing a Palestinian and being thorough. The intimidating presence of someone like Herman-Peled on the scene may push him to err on the side of leniency toward another Palestinian like my Malki's murderer.

Regarding "Second-class Jew," December 2

[Jewish Theological Seminary] Chancellor Ismar Schorsch is quite correct when he states that Conservative Jews are second-class citizens in Israel. The situation is even worse than that because any Jew in Israel who does not identify with the Chief Rabbinate is a second-class Jew and suffers from a lack of religious freedom. I know of no other country in the free world in which a Jew does not have the right to be married by a rabbi of his or her choice or to have a religious divorce by the rabbi of his or her choice.

As for conversion, the Ne'eman commission failed to reach an agreement because of the intransigence of the Chief Rabbinate. The Conservative Movement did become a partner in the Joint Institute that was later established, but only on condition that its membership did not prejudice its right to continue its own conversions as well.

We are partners in that institute because we feel the need to convert tens of thousands of non-Jewish Russians was a national need that could only be met by a government-sponsored institute and that a conversion recognized by all would be of benefit to those converts. We also welcomed the opportunity to expose the candidates to the various streams in Judaism and to a more open, pluralistic approach than that received in courses offered by the Chief Rabbinate. Although the institute has succeeded educationally, it has run into difficulties with the rabbinate in the conversion process. Hopefully those difficulties are being overcome with the new conversion process the government sponsors under Rabbi Druckman.

At the same time, the Conservative Movement continues it own conversion program for those who want it and will do so in the future as well. Fortunately the government of Israel does recognize our conversions performed in Israel as well as those performed in the Diaspora, but only because the Supreme Court ruled that it must do so. It is to be hoped that the court will similarly dismiss the government's position of not recognizing our conversions for purposes of the Law of Return and will bring equality to all our conversions for all purposes.

Regardless of the legal problems that the Conservative Movement faces here, we have taken a strategic decision to build from the grass roots up at the same time that we struggle for legal equality. Therefore we continue to build congregations, schools and educational institutions, youth movements and camps that serve thousands in the Israeli public.

Regarding "Donor countries won't fund Israeli-planned separate roads for Palestinians," November 30

It is high time the donor countries of the world, including the overburdened American tax payers, of which I am one, put their foot down and stop their complicity in enabling and perpetuating the racist and apartheid policies of the Israeli governments.

The Palestinians are to be rerouted around, over and under their own lands so that the Israeli settlers will not have to be "inconvenienced" by their presence. This is an outrage, much like the many outrageous policies of the Israeli governments that confiscate Palestinian lands, build settlements in their midst, populate them with Jews, build by-pass roads for their exclusive use and then have the audacity to ask the tax payers of Europe, Japan and the U.S. to fund the very roads that will separate them from their lands ....

The Palestinians do not need new roads to take them from one Bantustan to the next. As my Palestinian mother likes to say: "A donkey dressed and decorated even with gold, is still a donkey"! So, too, with racism: No matter how it is packaged or "dressed up," it is still racism.

Regarding "A shared past: Spain and Israel," December 2

In his article, Miguel Angel Moratinos, Spain's foreign minister, cites a variety of historical tidbits (including the doubtful speculation that Cervantes was a Jew) to point a picture of rosy relations between Israel and Spain. He also sites the positive steps Spain took toward Israel, including recognition of the state (which came only in 1986!). Mr Moratinos omits only one thing: Spain and the European Union's clear bias in favor of the Palestinians of which he was one of the main architects, in his function as the EU's representative in our region for 8 years (1996 to 2004).

Two years ago I asked Mr. Moratinos at a public meeting at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem why the EU still makes a distinction between Palestinian terrorism and other terrorism. He responded cynically by saying "We all make mistakes" and adding that this mistake is being corrected.

In his frequent sessions with Arafat, Moratinos failed to persuade him to change his ways, let alone stop his support of suicide bombers.

It is not surprising that after Arafat's death, Minister Moratinos published in the French daily Le Figaro (November 12) a most lavish song of praise of the father of modern terrorism without mentioning a word about Arafat's deliberate targeting of school children (30 years before the Chechen attack on a school in Beslan), ordering the destruction of airliners, assassinating athletes, and encouraging and financing suicide bombers. Instead Minister Moratinos writes in Le Figaro about Arafat's "honest and courageous struggle."

In light of these facts Minister Moratinos' article in Haaretz stretches the term "diplomacy" to its farthest limits of duplicity.

Coalition in Crisis / Tails wagging dogs
The current political crisis is also the result of a change in the balance of forces between the `leaders' and the `grass roots'
By Akiva Eldar	| Dec. 3, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
The goddess of history did a gracious favor to the peace camp. If Anwar Sadat had asked to address the Knesset in November 2004 in order to offer peace in exchange for territories, it's very possible that the Likud party rank-and-file and the members of the party's central committee would direct its Knesset faction to show him the door. Today's Likud "rebels," those fighting against Ariel Sharon, are not the "rebels" who fought Menachem Begin, the first Likud prime minister, not in terms of their numbers (there are far more of them), clout or chutzpah. They would not have let Begin conclude the first Camp David agreement, entailing the withdrawal from Sinai, which passed with the aid of votes from Labor MKs. The good goddess cast her grace on the Labor Party. If Ehud Barak had grabbed the microphone in a central committee meeting on the eve of the 1999 elections, it's possible that the electorate would have preferred the original - Benjamin Netanyahu - and Barak would never have arrived at the second Camp David summit, in order to shatter the myth of a unified Jerusalem.

The political crisis can be viewed as a concatenation of present-day circumstances, personal power struggles and ideological disagreements. But it can also be viewed differently: as another link in a long process in which the true power in politics is moving from the leadership to the party activists, the "grass roots." The activists are no longer being led - they are doing the leading. That's the case in both the Likud and Labor. These people are imposing all manner of manipulations on their leaders, which will help them survive in power, and the major threat to these leaders no longer comes from other parties, but from their own. It is an internecine threat.

In the view of a former senior figure in the Likud, it's far from certain that Begin would have been able to become prime minister under the conditions of today's political culture. Today's Likud central committee would not give a ninth opportunity to a leader who had failed eight times in his bid to win the election. "The functionaries want instant gratification, short-term achievements. They are in a big hurry to become cabinet ministers, Knesset members, directors general, members of boards of directors, to get this permit or that benefit, and also to screw the rival camp," the source says. The members of the central committee are not ashamed to shout out in unison, "Yes, yes!" to the minister who asked, innocently, whether it is her function to give them jobs. That question, which was posed by Education Minister Limor Livnat, was an anomaly. No Likud leader has dared repeat the mistake and tell the activists - who hold the minister's political fate in their hands - that handing out cushy jobs to confidants is not part of the role of political leadership.

Furthermore, adds the veteran Likudnik, "Thirty years ago, the task of the Uzi Cohen and David Appel types" - referring to two well-known activists - was to recruit the masses to shout `Begin to power.' The masses listened to the leader and followed him. Today they want to influence policy and even to dictate the path of the prime minister."

The chairman of the Knesset's House Committee, MK Roni Bar-On, a veteran Likud man himself, recalls that this is not the first time the grass roots have acted up. He and Ehud Olmert, he says, defied the great Begin. At the same time, he agrees that something has changed in the relations between the top levels of the party and the roots. He attributes this to the damage done by the direct election of the prime minister, a system that was in effect briefly. "The system of the double vote - for prime minister and for party, separately - threw a wrench in the works," Bar-On says. "The movement no longer has a directorate. There is nothing left of the classic party structure that borrowed from the communist system - cell, city, region, district, central committee, bureau, directorate, all the way up to the head honcho."

Yes to the telephone

The system of direct election and the cellular telephone connected the candidates directly to the grass roots and the grass roots to the leadership. When Bar-On joined the party, there were no more than 180 members in the central committee. The media showed no interest in that unknown institution, and the meetings were not a media festival, watched by the entire world. "When I entered politics my parents didn't have a phone in the house," Bar-On adds. "Today every central committee member has the mobile number of every MK in his address book, and every Knesset candidate has to promise that if he is elected, he will not change the number."

Bar-On says cautiously that "in a certain sense this helps connect the leadership to the grass roots." He also notes the creation of Channel 2, the first commercial television station in Israel, as a formative event in the populist thrust of contemporary Israeli politics. "Once people used to come to Beit Frumin [site of the original Knesset] in order to see [David] Ben-Gurion. Today everyone sees his leaders on television and gets a slap on the back from them at central committee meetings. Obviously, this gives people a feeling of power."

Dan Meridor, who was a disciple of Menachem Begin and was closely involved in the Likud under the leadership of Yitzhak Shamir and Ariel Sharon, has some interesting insight into the problematic balance of power between the political leadership and the grass roots. At the same time, he shares Bar-On's view that the central factor in the crisis now afflicting the Likud has be sought in the ideological meltdown. Begin, he says, believed that it was possible to preserve simultaneously the integrity of the home and Jewish rule in the Land of Israel. He was ready to grant Israeli citizenship to every Arab who requested it, because he understood that otherwise Israel would become a second Rhodesia.

"Reality pushed the Likud to a junction, a kind of `T' in the road, which requires a historic decision," Meridor continues. "[Ehud] Olmert believes that we have to embark on the path of disengagement from the Palestinians and from the danger of apartheid. The opponents of disengagement want to take the opposite path. For some of them, the decision to dismantle settlements is heartrending. The others say that, with all the pain, the principle of equality overcomes the principle of the whole Land of Israel."

Leadership crisis

The scenes in Tel Aviv's Beit Hahayal this week show that the Labor Party, too, has come a long way - from the period of the "arrangements committee," which determined the fate of politicians, to an evening where a former prime minister grabs the microphone in order to persuade the members of the central committee to support his position. Why and wherefore did Barak lose his head, or plan this act of hooliganism in advance? It was over nothing more than a procedure relating to the primaries to elect the party chairman. Labor MK Yuli Tamir, who was once one of the leaders of the Barak camp, says that if Barak thinks the party members liked his behavior, he is dead wrong. "Our average member does not want the Labor Central Committee to resemble the central committee of the Likud."

At the same time, Tamir is concerned about the leadership crisis and the populist trend in her party. The deterioration, she says, derives from the absence of an agenda and the lack of clarity regarding the order of priorities.

"The secret of the strength of the old arrangements committee was its ability to represent commonly held values, such as land settlement, education and immigration," Tamir explains. "In the absence of a common ideology and ethos, what interests many of the activists is the headline in tomorrow's paper and in the pamphlet for the central committee members."

She says that she herself does not have a specific public, such as kibbutzim, moshavim, trade unionists, immigrants or whatever. "How do I survive? There are apparently party members who think it's important that there should be an animal like me in the jungle conditions that rule here." She is concerned that in the current situation of a party without a common denominator, even a consummate politician like Shraga Netzer - the king of the pre-primaries arrangements committees, who mediated skillfully between the top levels of Mapai (Labor's forerunner) and the grass roots - would not survive for long.

Coalition in Crisis / Tails wagging dogs
The current political crisis is also the result of a change in the balance of forces between the `leaders' and the `grass roots'
By Akiva Eldar	| Dec. 3, 2004 | 12:00 AM

The goddess of history did a gracious favor to the peace camp. If Anwar Sadat had asked to address the Knesset in November 2004 in order to offer peace in exchange for territories, it's very possible that the Likud party rank-and-file and the members of the party's central committee would direct its Knesset faction to show him the door. Today's Likud "rebels," those fighting against Ariel Sharon, are not the "rebels" who fought Menachem Begin, the first Likud prime minister, not in terms of their numbers (there are far more of them), clout or chutzpah. They would not have let Begin conclude the first Camp David agreement, entailing the withdrawal from Sinai, which passed with the aid of votes from Labor MKs. The good goddess cast her grace on the Labor Party. If Ehud Barak had grabbed the microphone in a central committee meeting on the eve of the 1999 elections, it's possible that the electorate would have preferred the original - Benjamin Netanyahu - and Barak would never have arrived at the second Camp David summit, in order to shatter the myth of a unified Jerusalem.

The political crisis can be viewed as a concatenation of present-day circumstances, personal power struggles and ideological disagreements. But it can also be viewed differently: as another link in a long process in which the true power in politics is moving from the leadership to the party activists, the "grass roots." The activists are no longer being led - they are doing the leading. That's the case in both the Likud and Labor. These people are imposing all manner of manipulations on their leaders, which will help them survive in power, and the major threat to these leaders no longer comes from other parties, but from their own. It is an internecine threat.

London school to host conference on 'Resisting Israeli Apartheid'
Israeli and Jewish scholars also set to participate in the conference, titled Resisting Israeli Apartheid: Strategies and Principles.

A decision by The London University School of Oriental and African Studies to host a conference on Sunday at which academics will launch a campaign to break links with Israeli universities has raised a stir among Jewish groups, Army Radio and the Guardian reported.

The school's Palestinian Society which organized the event, called the conference Resisting Israeli Apartheid: Strategies and Principles. Jewish groups are accusing the society of inciting hatred.

Organizers are calling on the academic community to avoid cooperating with Israeli research institutes, to shun Israeli researchers by barring them from international conferences and by not awarding them any prizes. The organizers promise, however, to support any Israeli researchers who support their Palestinian counterparts in their struggle for self determination and academic freedom.

Several Israeli and Jewish professors and students are also set to attend the conference.

Dr. Ilan Pappe of Haifa University will deliver a lecture on the significance and meaning of the academic ban. Ben Young, of the Jewish Students for Justice for Palestinians group will deliver a lecture titled The Students Role: Lessons from South Africa.

The President of Israel's National Academy of Sciences, Prof. Menahem Ya'ari said the conference was "a pathetic attempt to revive a failed academic boycott of Israeli researchers and institutions from two years ago - an effort which was condemned by academics in both the U.S. and Europe.

The university's Jewish Society has lodged a complaint with the school about its decision to allow Tom Paulin to deliver a keynote address.

Paulin, a poet and academic, was quoted in the Arab newspaper Al-Ahram Weekly in 2002 as saying that settlers "should be shot dead". He later claimed that he had been misquoted.

Gavin Gross, of the school's Jewish Society, said: "I see this conference as an out-and-out hate conference which is solely there to de-legitimize Israel and its people. It makes no pretence of balance. SOAS has a reputation for being the center of political extremism. In the past this has only meant the vilification of Israel; there's no attempt at all to achieve an understanding of the conflict."

Other speakers at the conference include Professors Steven and Hilary Rose, who began the call for an academic boycott of Israel more than two years ago in a letter to the Guardian, and the linguist Mona Baker, who was the subject of an official inquiry by the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology after she fired two Israeli contibutors to a journal she edited.

Danny Stone, of the Union of Jewish Students, which is organising a counter-meeting at SOAS Sunday, said he had attended a meeting with the university to ask for extra security to ensure the safety of Jewish students on campus.

But one of the conference organisers, Awad Joumaa, a coordinator of the Palestinian Society, said: "We are promoting peace and equality for the Palestinian people.

"We are not the ones inciting hatred here. We are the ones under attack. If having an academic conference is inciting hatred, I don't know what their definition of it is."

The school released a statement distancing itself from the conference.

The non-event
Those Labor leaders who proudly depict their steps as heroic enlistment in the cause of peace should not deceive themselves. Their move into Sharon's government is not even shameless crawling. It is simply a non-event.
By Meron Benvenisti	| Dec. 16, 2004 | 12:00 AM

The negotiations over Labor joining the Sharon government as a junior partner is usually described as shameless crawling to get some inferior ministry portfolios, while being depicted as heroic enlistment in the cause of making sure the disengagement plan is implemented. But only a few are prepared to say they are convinced that Labor's motives are noble, and that the party is ready to give up its dignity and self-respect just to make sure the disengagement is completed as soon as possible. But that contemptuous and cynical approach does not do justice to some of the Labor leaders who want to help fulfill the opportunity that has opened and advance the peace process. The feeling that "a window of opportunity" has opened is prevalent in most of the public: Not only did Arafat's departure open a new chapter in relations with the Palestinians and a chance "to disengage with an agreement," but the "Arab world" led by President Mubarak is changing its attitude toward Israel "regardless of the Palestinian problem."

Such a chance should not be missed, say those who until recently regarded Labor joining the Sharon government as a betrayal of values and suicidal, and who now are at the head of those encouraging the move, "even without portfolios," on the assumption that Labor joining is just a matter of time.

But are the scenarios on which that assumption is based going to justify the move, or have Labor's leaders fallen into a trap laid for them by Sharon, whereby they will turn into his slaves and help his annexationist, apartheid policies, for which they will serve, as in the past, as a fig leaf?

The optimistic wave rising among the Israeli public as a result of the positive statements made by Arab leaders is fed by the pendular swing of the Arab states' position, which moves between independent interests and ethnic solidarity. The complexity of the international constellation forces sovereign states to balance their own interests with loyalty to ethnic-nationalist connections. During severe crises, public opinion forces Arab leaders to take a hard line and stretch relations with Israel to the verge of snapping, but never to the extent that it would harm their own interests.

When the Israeli-Palestinian conflict shows even the weakest signs of moderation, the neighboring states' leaders will be the first to grab the opportunity to improve their bilateral relations with Israel, a move that of course has important advantages for their relations with the U.S., which so much needs good news in the Middle East.

The elections for the presidency of the Palestinian Authority, promises for "abatements" in conditions, Abu Mazen's declarations about the need to cease the violence in the territories, and Ariel Sharon's moderate statements create an energy that is enough to move the pendulum from ethnic solidarity to the direction of fulfillment of the interests of independent Arab states. Israel celebrates, of course, over what Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom called "the disconnection from the Palestinian axis," and resumes fantasizing about a "new Middle East" apparently orchestrated by copywriter Shimon Peres.

Count on Peres to provide the glamorous cover for the continuation of the policy of brutality toward the Palestinians. Every opening of an "interests section" in the Gulf states, textile plant in Port Said or sparkling "business conference" will replay the "peace euphoria" of the mid-1990s, which hid the doubling of the settlements and the institutionalization of the closure and siege of the Palestinian population in the territories.

The "peace atmosphere" blurs the absolute refusal to respond to feelers from Syria ("which doesn't come with clean hands"), and will serve as a weapon against the Palestinians "who insist on continuing to use terrorism," so "it is not possible to change the policy toward them."

Sharon, who once needed Peres to serve as an umbrella for protection from the rain of international criticism, no longer needs him. The "disengagement plan" and neutralization of the connection between the Arab states and the fate of the Palestinians has resulted in even Silvan Shalom being able to function effectively.

So what will Labor get out of joining the government? A little bit of respect, a little bit of influence, but mostly responsibility for the continuation of the repression, institutionalization of the annexation, moral responsibility for the harm done to humanitarian norms, and a decisive contribution to the blurring of the differences between left and right. Those Labor leaders who proudly depict their steps as heroic enlistment in the cause of peace should not deceive themselves. Their move into Sharon's government is not even shameless crawling. It is simply a non-event.

Sakhnin Diaries / Memories of lost land versus acceptance in Israel
The blunting of the land dream partly explains why the contemporary Sakhnin dream is so wrapped up in the achievements of its soccer team, Bnei Sakhnin. For the past year, the dream has been about a new stadium, which is being realized.
By Jerrold Kessel	and Perre Klochendler	| Dec. 19, 2004 | 12:00 AM
		 submit to reddit	
It's unseasonably warm and the steep climb past Kibbutz Hanaton and Kfar Manda has taken its toll. Ten kilometers out of Sakhnin, the car begins to overheat. We stop to give it a breather at the entrance to Moreshet. As we ponder the many identity issues in a land where place names underline claims to land, in an area where space is sparse, a large military truck pulls up. The driver approaches to complicate identity matters further. Sheepishly, he shows us his delivery order and asks directions to an army base. Judging by his accent and his disorientation, it's clear that he is a new immigrant from Russia - his Hebrew is anything but fluent and he mispronounces the name of his destination. We point him down the hill toward Misgav.

There, as you enter Sakhnin from the west, lies a sprawling army base behind barbed wire and rows of pine trees, with army jeeps and trucks lined up near squat two- and three-story buildings and prefab huts. The base is central to Sakhnin's feelings of being deprived, constantly deprived.

As is the case in the town these days, much of the imagery used by Ghazal Abu Raya (who speaks for City Hall) is soccer-based. "Over several decades, we've been handed several red cards," he says. All the "red cards" are about land expropriation. "In 1964, we lost land in Bet Netofa for the National Water Carrier, then came the military training area of Zone 9. In the early '80s, it was the large Raphael base on the hill; in 1991 - the industrial zone that was taken for Misgav; and, finally, this base, which was opened in May 1999." All were built on land that once belonged to Sakhnin.

Blunting of a dream

Sakhnin originally encompassed 120,000 dunams, by the mid-1970s it was reduced to 55,000 and it is now down to 30,000. The land within the town's municipal limits is only 9,600 dunams. "We need the right to dream, that has been largely taken from us," says Abu Raya.

The blunting of the land dream partly explains why the contemporary Sakhnin dream is so wrapped up in the achievements of its soccer team, Bnei Sakhnin. For the past year, the dream has been about a new stadium, which is being realized. Seven million shekels is being provided - half by the Prime Minister's Office and half from other government sources. It is the fulfillment of Ariel Sharon's promise to the club to help build a proper stadium in the town - a pledge he gave on that magical May night when the team won the State Cup. The stadium should be ready for the next soccer season in August 2005.

As much as soccer dominates future hopes, memories of land issues don't fade. "A war for regional existence," Abu Raya calls it. "I accept the state's needs, but it must accept that we have a place in it, that we need to be given our place in it."

Once, when we were interviewing Sharon, we asked his views on the rights of Arabs in Israel. He produced this intriguing formula: "They have every right in the land, no rights to the land." Shortly afterward, he became prime minister. In terms of Sakhnin's relations with the state, it is a formula tested day after day, month after month.

An infallible memory

Wadi Safa (Softstone Valley) is spectacular. A dirt road climbs directly south, behind the town's last houses, toward a range of hills, beyond which lies Emek Bet Netofa. On the eastern hill is a sparse forest of wild pine, to the west an old barbed-wire fence - not particularly imposing in this day and age, when a fence is a wall. Every couple of hundred meters, there's an old blackened signpost, the writing all washed away by time (and perhaps by purpose?).

Adjacent to the fence is a small olive grove, where Mohammed Hiyadri (Abu Majdi), his wife and grandchildren are busy completing the harvest. They are only too well aware of what used to be on the blackened signposts and why they must not surmount the easily surmountable fence: "Closed military area, no photographing!" Beyond the seven rows of olive trees, the hillside is scruffy shrub, but these are the margins of the Raphael base, one of those "red cards" dealt out to Sakhnin.

There's less urgency these days for Abu Majdi to complete the harvest quickly. After four decades as an educator, he retired this summer as headmaster at the local high school. While he says engagingly that he remembers every single pupil, he confesses that he does occasionally forget a name. But his memory is infallible when it comes to every goal scored in every Bnei Sakhnin match over the last decade - from the third league up until today's lofty heights.

In reality, olive harvesting is not as arduous for him as it once was, says Abu Majdi with another entrancing smile. For a simple reason: His family used to have 56 dunams here, but 48 were taken for the base. Another 18 were taken in the Bet Netofa valley. Now the family has just 8 dunams. Applications to the High Court of Justice didn't help. And the state remains impervious when it comes to compensation - offering a paltry $500 per dunam (considered the price in 1964, when the land was appropriated). The state is unwilling to consider a dunam for a dunam or the $50,000-plus that Abu Majdi says is the real value of Galilee land today. Abu Majdi has not, however, lost heart. An ardent advocate of Arab-Jewish coexistence, he predicts that change is coming. There is "a beginning of an understanding of the power of boundaries and of the boundaries of power" is his neat play on words.

His hope is that, somehow, with a new overall climate "soon to be reached in the Middle East," this will trickle down to make an impact on his own family's rights. A more tangible test, he says, would be for the zoning authorities to consider Sakhnin's demand for part of the hillside overlooking Wadi Safa to be allocated as a new neighborhood for young couples from the town. So far, such hopes have fallen on insensitive ears in the Misgav Regional Council, which controls all the hillsides since the major land appropriations of the '70s and '80s.

Why, asks Abu Majdi rhetorically, should the 27 Jewish villages (some set up only during recent decades in a drive to settle more Jews in Galilee) thrive on the principle that their young families have the right to a small house and a garden, "whereas they tell us to build seven-story apartment blocks in Sakhnin?" It's one of the answers to Sakhnin's constant complaint of being mercilessly hemmed in.

`Live here and die here'

In 2025, the population will be 45,000, compared to today's 25,000 and to the 2,850 who were in the village in 1948, when the four mukhtars of the main extended families - the Khaleilas, the Ghnaims, the Abu Rayas, and the Zubeidats - took a critical decision to remain, saying, "we'll live here and we'll die here." In fact, only three families from Sakhnin became refugees.

The driving goal of Mayor Mohammed Bashir is to extricate his town from a steady process of land strangulation, to find its place in a state that seems determined, some fear, to encroach further. "We need to watch ourselves closely, always reticent and self-controlled, because we're like a player who has already been issued a yellow warning card and is in fear of getting another red," observes Abu Raya. On this field, after all, red cards tend to be permanent.

This past week, the Nazareth-based I'lam Media Center for Arab Palestinians in Israel invited journalists on a tour of Sakhnin to see up close "the Apartheid policies" in force against "so-called Arab Israelis" and examples of "failed coexistence."

You still hear plenty of that kind of talk. Plenty. But other attitudes are coming to the fore. Bashir is in his garden with his wife picking olives off their six trees. Although he doesn't have trees outside the garden, he deploys the customary line about the olive being the symbolic link to the land. Somehow, he manages to invest his talk of "standing steadfast" with a different tone. It's the language of accommodation, even of hope, and it's upbeat - a sense, as he puts it, that disengagement from Gaza will usher in a whole new era in Jewish-Arab relations within Israel as well.

The soccer stadium is a key symbol. Bashir acknowledges the prime minister's appreciation of the problem. But there are two more critical tests of intention that are due to come to a head within months. Sakhnin is seeking final approval for a new developmental project in Bet Netofa, which would allow land there to be developed at last. They haven't been able to do so until now because of lack of water allocation, even though the National Water Carrier cuts right through their lands.

More pertinently, what will be the decision of a special committee set up by the interior minister to assess Sakhnin's application for the land directly under its jurisdiction to be boosted by 8,600 dunams, from its present 9,600, in order to set proper final boundaries of the town within which it can legitimately grow? In the Sharon vein, do they have rights to the town, or only in the town?

This is the kernel. Most of the expropriated land went to three projects - the Raphael base, the army base and on the Torodian hill, for the creation of the Misgav industrial zone. "None will be removed, I recognize that," says Abu Shadeh. "We don't challenge that. But why shouldn't the land of the army base and the industrial district be rezoned to again fall under Sakhnin's jurisdiction? In that way, we could benefit from the arnona and it would open the way for cooperation and sharing of the industrial zone with Misgav." He adds a third plan for further sharing with their Jewish neighbors - a new joint industrial zone to be built in conjunction with the Misgav Regional Council, in an area that falls within Sakhnin's current boundaries.

On broader fields, the coming year is considered critical in Israel's future orientation. Here, too. Will new attitudes that are taking root in Sakhnin be served by new politics on high? Will Sharon still be in power when he comes to dedicate the new stadium? And how far might he have amended his adage on Arab rights, or in any way altered his conception about rights to the land, as well as in the land? Or does his conception of such rights stop at 100 meters by 60 meters - the size of the new soccer pitch?

Removing Israel from the activist's map Structurally the Israel activist training and support system is flawed. Pioneering efforts and good intentions aside, the Israel activist training network in its current format will soon buckle and Israel activities on campus will soon stop much the way they have in the past. Joshua Einstein, Rutgers University
Of Native Americans and native Palestinians Whether or not they existed as a people prior to Zionism's arrival to Palestine, and whether or not Israel has been the primary cause of their suffering, the Palestinian people's collective psyche is shaped - much like the Jewish one - by a sense of victimhood. Sam Hopkins, University of Kansas
Destination Israel Leaving Israel at a young age left me with few memories to hold on to. I now know Israel is where I belong. Etty Asafov, Seneca College, Toronto
Is Israel also disengaging from the Negev? We can't encourage aliyah and at the same time not create conditions for people who are willing to move to the Negev. Ben-Gurion was right in his warning. If we "lose" the Negev, we will lose everything. Andrei Iosef Schwartz, Politehnica University, Timisoara, Romania
Friends for the Future Now, as the situation in the Middle East looks to be tentatively improving, pro-Israel students must prepare to shift to an offensive stance. The best way to do this, and in turn have a tangible effect on the future of Israel, is to make new friends and engage new allies. Justin Weitz, Cornell University
Imbalance of exposure - 'Israeli Apartheid Week' The success of Hillel Toronto's IsraelFEST 2005 went almost unnoticed by the media, instead overwhelming coverage was given to Israeli Apartheid Week, which was developed to detract from our positive Israel programming on campus. By Tilly Shames and Lauren Parl, University of Toronto
Israel's role today A serious threat exists, one that the Jewish people has not faced since the time of the Greeks. Jews are barely educating their children. An entire generation of Jewish youth has risen, completely disconnected from their people and their nation. By Michael Friedlander, Georgia State University, Atlanta
'Heil Bush, Zionist War Criminal with Sharon' "Who controls the banks, the media and real estate? Who has the money? The Jews, of course." These comments were not spoken in 18th century Britain, 1930s Germany, nor 1960s Egypt, but rather 2004 in the Canadian capital of Ottawa. By Robert Walker, University of Ottawa
Destroying Zionism for a generation The truth is that the intifada has destroyed Zionism for a generation, our generation. This defeat is not only detrimental to the Jewish students themselves, but to Israel, whose hopes and dreams for this new century are pinned on youth of the Jewish world today. By Adam A. Salkin, University of Leeds
Transcending borders The professor's aim was clear. He hoped the class would draw the conclusion that the notion that Israel is the Jewish state, is misguided. He proposed the theoretical dismantling of the Jewish state. By Chris Silver, University of California, Berkeley
On Zionist Activism and the War of Ideas "Israel organizations" on campus and nationally are geared towards battles - they are designed to shape or rather re-shape Israel's image. Bound as they are to the tit-for-tat, if they do not change, we will lose the war of ideas. By Joshua Einstein, Rutgers University
Post-crisis identity crisis Israel should be viewed as more than just a state whose reputation must be defended from slander, but as a homeland whose ethical and cultural up-building is incomplete and invites our participation. By Josh Goodman, Yale University
On not loving all things French I had to admit disappointment when the French journalist sitting next to me on the flight opined that the French have always been and will remain anti-Semitic. By Ronah Sadan, Rutgers University
The Withering Link As a university student, I have noticed a secularization of religious symbols. They are being drained of their religious connotations. By Mark Hanin, Yale University

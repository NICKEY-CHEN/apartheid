<title>Abbas: Palestinian Authority will not collapse</title>
<date>6/1/2016</date>
<content>
The Palestinian Authority will only be replaced by a Palestinian state, and “no  one should dream that it will collapse,” President Mahmoud Abbas said on  Wednesday.In a televised speech from his office in Bethlehem, where he  arrived to attend Christmas celebrations of Orthodox Christians, Abbas said that  the PA would be followed by a Palestinian state. “We won’t accept any other  scenarios,” he said, referring to reports that the Israeli government had  recently discussed various scenarios that could emerge in the aftermath of the  collapse of the PA.




“The Palestinian Authority exists and it is here,”  Abbas stressed. “It will be followed by a Palestinian state. The Palestinian  Authority is one of our achievements and we won’t give it up.”Over the  past few years, Abbas and other senior Palestinian officials had threatened to  dissolve the PA and “hand the keys back to Israel.”Abbas’s speech on  Wednesday was preceded by rumors that he is planning to resign. On Saturday,  unconfirmed reports claimed that Abbas, 80, had suffered a stroke and was being  treated in a Jordanian hospital. Abbas’s office strongly denied the  reports.In his speech, which did not carry any surprises, Abbas said  that he wants a solution for the Palestinian issue. “It is inconceivable that  the Palestinian cause remain unsolved,” he said. “We have seen solutions in for  Iran, Libya and Syria although our cause is older.The situation is  complicated and difficult and solutions might not come today or tomorrow. But we  must hold on to our achievements and we won’t backtrack on our full  rights.”The Palestinians continue to extend their hand for peace and  peaceful negotiations in order to achieve peace and the two-state solution, he  said. “We shall remain on our land, and Israel is not permitted to establish an  apartheid state or a state with two systems.”The Palestinians will  continue to demand the eviction of all settlers from the West Bank, he said.  “This is our land and all the settlers must leave and they will leave as was the  case in the Gaza Strip,” Abbas added.He indirectly criticized the Greek  Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem for allegedly “diverting” church property to  Israel. “These are holy lands and we won’t allow anyone to transfer them to  anyone else,” he said. “This land belongs to us and our children and  grandchildren. It will remain ours forever.”Abbas’s remarks  coincided with a campaign that is being waged by Orthodox Christians in  Jerusalem and Bethlehem against Greek Orthodox Patriarch Theophilos III, who has  been accused of facilitating the sale of church property to Israel. Leaders of  the Orthodox Christian community on Wednesday boycotted Theophilos as he arrived  in Bethlehem to lead Christmas Eve celebrations.Abbas called for an  international conference to solve the Israeli- Palestinian conflict and  cautioned against the continuation of violence and terrorism in the region. He  warned against turning the conflict into a religious one and urged Israel to  keep a distance from Al-Aksa Mosque.Palestinians are carrying out  “peaceful” protests while Israel is resorting to violence, he said.
“All  our demonstrations are peaceful,” Abbas said. “But who are the aggressors? Our  youths are throwing stones while they are opening fire. Our protests are  peaceful and they will remain so.”

<title>Analysis: Where Israeli and African interests intersect</title>
<date>4/7/2016</date>
<content>
ENTEBBE, Uganda - When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Ministry Director-General Dore Gold talk about a “confluence of interests,” they generally refer to a commonality of interests with the Arab countries in the region that is behind the unprecedented, but discreet, cooperation with them.That term, however, is also used when explaining why precisely now – nearly 30 years after Yitzhak Shamir was the last sitting prime minister to visit Africa – Israel, as Netanyahu puts it, is returning to Africa, and Africa is returning to Israel.




Interestingly, Shamir's six-day, four country tour took him to western Africa – Togo, Cameroon, Liberia and the Ivory Coast – while Netanyahu's five-day, four-country hop takes him to the east: Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda and Ethiopia.The main common interest revolves around security issues. Three of the four – Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia – are facing terrorism from Islamic extremists, and Rwanda is concerned about a spill-over effect.These countries are afraid that what has happened in Libya, Mali and the Ivory Coast could happen to them as well.For this reason they are interested in forging stronger ties with Israel. It is not all about getting water, energy and agricultural know-how, but it is also very much about getting Israeli knowledge and assistance in how to combat terrorism.These countries, and other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, are more concerned with questions of homeland security than they were some 20 years ago, and they see Israel as one country with a great deal of experience – and technology – in this field .One of the reasons for this enhanced concern is the break-up of Libya, and the negative forces that it unleashed on its neighbors – Mali and Chad.The break-up of Libya has had another impact as well – it removed the single biggest factor inside Africa that was working against a normalization of ties with Israel.It was former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi who pressed to get Israel's observer status removed from the African Union, arguing in one debate that Israel was responsible for all the continent's ills. And it was Gaddafi who actively lobbied to keep countries from welcoming Israel. His fall had an impact on the willingness of a number of countries to strengthen their ties.South Africa has also been an impediment to Israeli inroads into the continent, and indeed has been key in recent years to blocking an upgrade for Israel at the African Union, an upgrade that Netanyahu will raise in his meetings. There are many reasons for the South African animosity, including Israel's relations with the apartheid regime, and the ANC's close ties to the PLO.But, according to diplomatic officials, while Libya actively tried to convince African states not to strengthen their ties with Israel, South Africa is not doing he same with countries such as Rwanda, Ethiopia and Kenya. Partly, officials in those countries will say, because Pretoria realizes that they will not be able to do so.Another common interest is keeping Iran and Hezbollah from gaining ground on the continent. Iran is active in east Africa, keen on getting access to the Red Sea, and Hezbollah in the west. A high-profile Israeli presence can serve as a counterweight to their efforts.Israel's close security cooperation with Jordan and Egypt is also something that is well-known in Africa, as are Israel's discreet ties with Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf countries. This, diplomatic officials maintain, has led to some of the African countries asking themselves: “If they can do it, why can't we?”During Shamir's visit to west Africa in 1987, The New York Times quoted from an editorial in the Nigerian Tribune: ''We can do business with Israel and keep our Arab friends - Egypt is doing exactly that,'' the editorial read. ''Our Arab friends should not be seen as choosing our enemies for us.”
Israel and Africa's “return” to one another is an indication that 30 years later, this sentiment is indeed taking hold.

<title>Anti-Israel activists attempt to vilify Elie Wiesel after his death</title>
<date>3/7/2016</date>
<content>
As news of Elie Wiesel's passing reverberated around the world, there was an outpouring of tributes, quotations, and homages honoring his life and works.  So too, however, did the news bring out a select few, seeking to vilify and defame his legacy.
Most notably, pro-Palestinian Jewish journalist Max Blumenthal, son of longtime Hillary Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, who took to Twitter less than an hour after the announcement and said:
“Elie Wiesel is dead. He spent his last years inciting hatred, defending apartheid & palling around with fascists.”
He continued with a series of tweets posting links to articles citing that Elie Wiesel "denied Armenian genocide" and "repeatedly lauded Jewish settlers for ethnically cleansing Palestinians in East Jerusalem."
He then tweeted: "Elie Wiesel went from a victim of war crimes to a supporter of those who commit them. He did more harm than good and should not be honored."
Blumenthal was joined in his denigration by other pro-Palestinian activists.
Among them Ali Abuminah, co-founder of the Palestinian advocacy site Electronic Intifada who also took to Twitter and wrote: “Those who praise Elie Wiesel without mentioning his deep ethnic hatred for Palestinians are as hypocritical and vacuous as he was."
He followed with another tweet: "Elie Wiesel will be remembered by Palestinians for his racism and his propaganda services to their oppressors, ethnic cleansers and killers."
Despite the attempts at vilification, the tweets came in stark contrast to the majority of outpourings from world leaders, public figures, and countless people touched by Wiesel’s works who offered their praises and expressed their mourning on social media and beyond.
Those who cherished and valued Wiesel’s immense contribution to humanity – basically the vast majority of the social media world – filtered out these negative comments made by those who consistently take world events as an opportunity to defame and de-legitimize Israel.

<title>Applying Israeli law to W. Bank is not creeping annexation: former MAG</title>
<date>9/5/2016</date>
<content>
Adopting Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked’s plan to apply Israeli law to citizens living in the West Bank, would not constitute annexation, former military advocate general Maj.-Gen. (res.) Danny Efroni said on Monday.Efroni said that during his tenure as MAG three years ago, he had tried to apply Israeli law to citizens in the West Bank due to professional and legal considerations and not connected to the broader political debate.




“400,000 Israeli citizens live in Judea and Samaria,” Efroni told reporters at a briefing hosted by MediaCentral in Jerusalem. “They pay taxes, they serve in the IDF, they do all their duties.” Therefore, he said, Israelis living in the West Bank should have the same rights as Israelis on the other side of the Green Line.“There is a need to fit the law to the reality that Jews live in Judea and Samaria,” Efroni said. “The government could even annex Judea and Samaria, as it did with east Jerusalem and the Golan, but it has not done so for 50 years.”“We can bring Israeli environmental law to Israeli localities in Judea and Samaria without any territorial implications,” the former MAG said, adding that “applying Israeli law to Judea and Samaria does not contradict any legal principal, whether local or international.”Asked if he was concerned that the International Criminal Court would view the application of Israeli law to the territories as annexation, Efroni explained that “the issue of settlements is complex and supposed to be addressed in negotiations by politicians” and not by the ICC.“So many countries have tried to resolve this issue…if she [ICC Chief Prosecutor  Fatou Bensouda] has the solution, she can try,” he said, expressing skepticism  that ICC intervention would achieve anything positive.He said that a number of Israeli laws have applied to Israeli citizens in the West Bank for years and that proposed changes were not so much a sea change as they were the more organized continuation of a trend.Several questioners confronted Efroni with questions about negative ramifications on the Palestinians in the West Bank, an increase in the specter of apartheid and that he could not so easily disentangle the legal issues from the political ones.He replied that his plan would only impact Israeli citizens in the West Bank and was specifically constructed to either have no impact on Palestinians, or only an indirect positive one.For example, he said his plan would apply Israel’s library law and labor laws for Israelis in the West Bank. This would mean that Palestinian employees working for Israelis in the West Bank would get better benefits and pension rights.He also clarified that at least in his version of applying Israeli law to the West Bank (he maintained throughout that he does not know if Shaked’s plans are identical with his), the plan would be to import Israeli law with an order of the IDF Central Commander as opposed to the Knesset. He said this was necessary to observe international law requirements for JS as a disputed or occupied area.He stayed far away from specific recent or current event controversies such as demolishing Amona and whether Shaked and others are trying to indirectly implement the 2011 Edmund Levy Report, named for the former Supreme Court vice president.

<title>Bank of Ireland shuts down anti-Israel BDS accounts</title>
<date>3/10/2016</date>
<content>
The Bank of Ireland, the country’s oldest financial institution, closed  the accounts of the pro-Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions organization’s Ireland  Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) in late September. The group’s accounts were  terminated in Ireland and Northern Ireland, according to a report Sunday in the  Irish news outlet RTÉ.A spokesman for the Bank of Ireland wrote The  Jerusalem Post on Monday saying that they “cannot comment in relation to  customer accounts.”




According to RTÉ, the PSC said the bank closed its  accounts because it defined transfers to Palestinian territories as high-risk.  The PSC said it transfers funds to a factory in the West Bank that produces  Palestinian scarves that the PSC buys to promote solidarity, wrote  RTÉ.The PSC had held accounts at the Bank of Ireland for 15  years.The Irish pro-Palestinian group opened a new account with the  Allied Irish Banks (AIB). A Post query to the AIB was not immediately returned  on Monday.According to RTÉ, the PSC believes it is vulnerable to a new  closure.Post media queries to the PSC in Ireland were also not  immediately returned. The AIB and the Bank of Ireland are considered to be part  of the “Big Four” Irish financial organizations. SPC also maintains a PayPal  account.The SPC branch in Ireland is a hardcore BDS group targeting the  Jewish state.According to its website it has launched campaigns to force  divestment from Israel’s Mashav (the Foreign Ministry’s Agency for International  Development Cooperation) and started a letter campaign from more than 215 Irish  artists to boycott Israel. The PSC website wrote it seeks to “support the  awareness-raising to expose the contamination of the global diamond market with  Israeli ‘blood diamonds.”’ In addition to the SPC’s call to boycott Israeli  products, it aims to create an “Apartheid- Free Zone” in Ireland where Israeli  goods are ostracized.The organization wrote that the late Israeli  president and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shimon Peres is an “unpunished war  criminal and apologist for apartheid.”The closure of the SPC account  appears to be part of a larger trend within the European banking system to sever  ties with pro-BDS groups.RTÉ wrote, “It [closure of the SPC account]  follows similar decisions in other European countries including Austria,  Germany, France and the UK where banks have closed down accounts of Palestinian  campaign groups.”Ireland is considered one of the strongholds of BDS  activity in Western Europe. The termination of the SPC could result in growing  financial actions to end relationships with pro-BDS groups.The Post  reported first on the closures of bank accounts in France, Germany and Austria  in 2016.Commerzbank, Germany’s second largest bank, shut a BDS account  in June. The Austrian bank Bawag shut down the account of the Austria-Arab  Culture Center, which had hosted convicted Palestinian terrorist Leila Khaled,  who participated in the 1969 hijacking of a TWA jet. A year later, she helped  hijack EL AL flight 219. Khaled was in Europe as part of a speaking tour. The  Austria-Arab Culture Center advocates BDS.In May, PayPal and Credit  Mutuel pulled the plug on their accounts with BDS France. The Austrian financial  company Erste Group terminated BDS Austria’s account in April. The French  banking giant BNP Paribas shut down its subsidiary DAB bank account with  BDS-Campaign in February in Munich. A subsidiary of Paribas in Brussels (BNP  Paribas Fortis) appears to hold a BDS account.Malka Nusynowicz, a  spokeswoman for the parent BNP in Paris, told the Post last month ”the bank  never comments on any alleged client-relationships for obvious confidentiality  rules reasons.”Hans Mariën, the head of public relations and press for  BNP Paribas Fortis in Brussels, told the Post that he cannot comment because of  bank privacy rules.The Belgium-based BDS group that holds a Paribas  account is called Association Belgo-Palestinienne (BNP). It has an office in New  York State where Gov. Andrew Coumo signed an anti-BDS executive order in June.  He said at the time: “If you boycott against Israel, New York will boycott  you.”Eric Soufer, a spokesman for New York State Attorney- General Eric  Schneiderman, wrote the Post in September saying that “the attorney-general  vehemently opposes any effort to single out Israel for an economic boycott.” BNP  Paribas paid the US government a record fine of nearly $9 billion in 2015 for  Iran, Cuba and Sudan sanctions violations.German banks maintain scores  of BDS accounts.Stephanie Rüth, a spokeswoman for the Bank für  Sozialwirtschaft (Bank for Social Economy), told the Post recently that the bank  is investigating a BDS account.The Bank for Social Economy holds  accounts for the largest Jewish community in Germany in Berlin and for the  Central Welfare Board of Jews in Germany. The Stuttgart-based  Baden-Württembergische Bank (BW), which has an office in New York City, has  vehemently rejected a closure of its pro- BDS account with the group Palestine  Committee Stuttgart.The BW also holds an account for the local neo-Nazi  NPD party, which calls for a complete boycott of Israel.
When asked about  the bank account information listed on the website of the Bonnbased pro-BDS  group Institut für Palästinakunde (IPK), Silvia Annecke, a spokeswoman for the  VR-Bank Altenburger in Germany, said “because of existing bank privacy we cannot  issue information.”

<title>BDS in Israel is a dangerous phenomenon, says Im Tirtzu</title>
<date>9/11/2016</date>
<content>
The Boycott, Divest and Sanctions Movement (BDS) activists in Israel has become  a dangerous and serious problem, Matan Peleg, CEO of rightwing grassroots  organization Im Tirtzu, recently told The Jerusalem Post.Speaking on the  backdrop of the opening of the new academic year, Peleg spoke about the  challenges facing Israeli democracy and academia, as well as the group’s agenda  and planned activities for the coming year.




“The heart of Im Tirtzu’s  activities is fighting against BDS from within,” Peleg said.He explained  that for BDS organizations to be effective, they need to convince the world that  Israel doesn’t have the right to exist, “and we will crumble from within. Inside  Israel they have a simpler job: They just need to cause doubt, to cause a lack  of security in Israeli society and the foundations on which it’s built – a  Jewish democratic state.”Peleg said that at the beginning of the century  there was an increase in the number of foreign-funded organizations operating in  Israel.“These are organizations that are causing delegitimization from  within – claiming that Israel commits war crimes in Gaza, that there is  apartheid in Judea and Samaria, that the Golan is occupied,” he  explained.“These are organizations that are foreign funded, that are  promoting the notion that there is something not right in every part of the  State of Israel,” he added.However, Peleg said this is not even the  heart of the problem.“This isn’t just propaganda, it also penetrates.  These same organizations petition the Supreme Court daily, against IDF soldiers,  for example – this is an attempt to change the policy of Israel from within,  funded by foreign governments,” he said. “This is anti-democratic.”He  explained that foreign governments that don’t agree with Israel’s policies will  fund Israeli NGOs to present their agenda in court and in Israeli academia.  Peleg said his organization’s main goal is to “expose this  connection.”“We are against foreign governments funding NGOs – even to  right-wing NGOs – we are against the entire principle,” he said. “When you look  at the big picture, Im Tirtzu connects the dots and exposes the connection  between all the organizations and exposes who funds them.”Peleg added  that this problem has also “infiltrated” Israeli academia.“Some of the  activists of these NGOs are professors in our universities, these NGOs fund  scholarships and provide internships for students, and this is how they educate  students of their own political agenda,” he said.Im Tirtzu’s head said  that when he speaks about “politicization in academia, it’s not a catchphrase –  it is a real and tangible problem.”“The involvement and penetration of  political organizations into Israeli academics, many of which are funded by  foreign governments, has become a very serious problem.”He cited a  number of programs at the leading universities, which he claimed are promoting  political agendas in academia. This, Peleg explains, is “one of the main  criticisms” of his organization.Im Tirtzu has in the past two years  grown significantly, both in the number of its activists – who include some  6,000 students spread across 15 campuses – as well as in its influence and  reach.“We have activists who are across a spectrum of political  parties,” Peleg said. “They all have one thing in common: a love for a Jewish  and democratic state and the understanding that the BDS within is a serious and  dangerous problem.”In the new academic year, Peleg said his organization  plans to make an even greater impact – expanding its activities on campus as  well as helping to promote new legislation and mobilizing the Israeli public to  its cause.“This coming year our first objective is to take out many  political organizations from academic programs,” he said.Peleg called on  the Education Ministry and the Council for Higher Education to establish a  committee to examine all academic programs and “remove” the political  organizations operating within.Im Tirtzu will also, for the first time,  hold tours for students to visit Hebron in an effort to teach them about the  historical and biblical ties to the land as well as to counter claims of IDF  brutality.“Not enough Israelis have been to Hebron. Israelis should come  and see for themselves.It is not going to be political, but rather  historic tours and we want to show people the truth behind Breaking the  Silence’s claims,” he said.The organization will also expand its program  for Zionist thought, an extracurricular lecture series bringing prominent  Zionists to lecture on university campuses.“Im Tirtzu has branches,  activists, we go to the people and harness the Israeli public to address these  issues, by protests, and writing reports – and also through the policy makers,”  Peleg said.“We provide policy makers with information,” he explained.  “We want MKs to know who is standing in front of them. When you hear of a human  rights organization it may seem legitimate on the surface, but in reality it is  being funded by foreign governments and is working against the  state.”This year, the organization aims to work together with policy  makers to counter National Service funding to foreign-funded organizations,  Peleg added.“Im Tirtzu has received massive criticism over the years,  more than any other organization dealing with these issues.
Why? Because  we are the most effective,” Peleg said. “We are not only satisfied with  research, but we move the Israeli people to act as an authentic force, because  they see the importance in the struggle for a Zionist Israel.”

<title>BDS vs Bruce: Boycott activists urge Springsteen not to play Israel</title>
<date>16/2/2016</date>
<content>
No date has been set, no contracts signed, but the long knives have been drawn  by vehement anti-Israeli activists intent on preventing a Bruce Springsteen  concert this summer in Israel.Soon after a Ynet report earlier this  month sparked rumors of a Springsteen Tel Aviv date being added to his summer  European tour in support of The River boxed set, the online campaign to lobby  against the Boss entering the promised land.




Multiple tweeters launched a  
CancelTelAviv hashtag and shared a poster targeting both Springsteen and  Jennifer Lopez, who is also rumored to be bringing her summer tour to  Israel.An organization called The Jewish Voice for Peace, who evidently  think that Springsteen singing “Crush on You” in Hayarkon Park is a detriment to  peace, created their own poster that pleads: “Dear Bruce, Please don’t perform  for an apartheid state.”Serial anti-Israel activist Stanley Cohen, with  close to 20,000 Twitter followers, posted “@springsteen You’ve spent a lifetime  writing about principle, dignity, justice and truth.Was it all a lie?  Don’t play Israel. BDS” And even left-wing radical personality of the month Max  Blumenthal got into the act by questioning Springsteen’s principles in a tweet  that said “Dust Bowl populist impersonator Bruce Springsteen is in negotiations  to perform in Israel” and linked to The Jerusalem Post story on the  rumors.Individual band members have not been spared from the vitriol  either. Many tweets were directed to Springsteen band member Steve Van Zandt,  who 30 years ago campaigned against artists performing in South Africa and  created the star-studded single “Sun City.”Even mild-mannered bass  player Garry Tallent seemed to be miffed by a tweet that said: “rock n roll OR  selling your soul? Did you ever perform in apartheid South Africa?” Tallent’s  response was sharp and to the point: “I did not. Perhaps we should cancel St.  Louis as well,” referring to the 2015 police shooting death of Michael Brown in  nearby Ferguson.
“Would that shuteth thy mouth? You are railing against a  rumor,” Tallent added, pointing out the energy being misspent on an event that  is still on the backstreets.

<title>Beduin community leader: The state doesn’t treat us well</title>
<date>14/7/2016</date>
<content>
What is life like in an unrecognized Beduin village? According to a report by  State Comptroller Joseph Shapira, published in May, one third of the 200,000  Beduin in Israel live in unrecognized villages.One of those shanty  towns, known as Umm al-Hiran, could explode in anger if the government moves to  implement the Supreme Court approval of its demolition and the eviction of its  residents in order to build the Jewish town of Hiran on the site.




Salim  Abu al-Kian, the head of the committee of the unrecognized villages of Umm  al-Hiran and Atir, told the Post Wednesday that the issue is not about the  difficulty of the daily life, but general anger at the government for its  “racism.”“The problem is not water or electricity. The state doesn’t  treat us well – cruelly, and with racism,” he exclaimed.“I have the  solution. Israelis leave the land and there will be quiet,” he raged, adding  that it is “a war for our existence.”Kian said Umm al-Hiran and Atir,  like all unrecognized Beduin villages, suffer from lack of infrastructure,  roads, and sewage. In the past, tractors were used to bring water, he  said.The electricity does not work in the rain or when it is too hot.  “It is insufferable,” he added.Kian also complained that “settlers”  holding positions of authority are responsible for dealing with the Beduin  issue.“The state is against us and itself. Right-wing extremism is not  good for Arabs or Jews,” he claimed.The Beduin leader cautioned the  government against implementing the Supreme Court approval to evict the  residents of Umm al-Hiran, and replace their town with a Jewish  settlement.Joint List MK Ahmad Tibi, who has been involved in the issue,  told the Post that “the lack of basic services and infrastructure in thousands  of unrecognized villages is due to the deliberate neglect and blatant  discrimination against the Arab population.”Tibi noted that he raised  the issue in his meetings with the UN and at the White House this  year.“Destroying Umm al-Hiran would be a declaration of war against  Arabs of the Negev,” he said at an event in the village in March marking the  40th annual Land Day.“Umm al-Hiran is the prototype of apartheid,” the  deputy speaker of the Knesset and Ta’al party chairman had said, adding that  Arabs could take the matter of the village to the UN.Amichai Yogev,  southern director of the NGO Regavim – describing itself as seeking to ensure a  responsible, legal and accountable use of the country’s land – told the Post the  Beduin are not telling the truth in some of their claims about not having  adequate water or electricity in illegal villages.“The High Court ruled  that the state must supply water, and the state constructed pipes to the illegal  villages, but not always in a comfortable location,” he said.In some  unrecognized villages such as Umm al-Hiran, a pipe with water is present on the  road at the entrance to the settlement and residents either bring water by  tractor, truck or other means. Sometimes they build a pipe extension to their  home.The water is metered, and residents are charged consumption, he  added.Regarding electricity, Yogev asserted that the Beduin use solar  panels.“The fact of the matter is,” continued Yogev, “if Beduin in  unrecognized villages do not like the quality of life, they can easily move to a  recognized village such as Hura or Rahat and receive generous government  benefits.”The state gives the Beduin “what it gives no other citizen,”  he continued. Adult males that are married are offered to move from an  unrecognized village to a recognized one such as Hura and receive a plot of land  at around 10 percent of the cost, at around NIS 15,000 per plot in Hura, and is  compensated for any illegal structures that they built and that the state wants  to destroy.
By way of comparison, said Yogev, the price for a plot of  land at the new settlement of Hiran, which is planned at the location of Umm  al-Hiran, is NIS 600,000.

<title>Foreign Ministry workers demand Bennett apologize over his 'DNA' jab</title>
<date>17/1/2016</date>
<content>
The workers of the Foreign Ministry insulted by comments that Minister of Education Naftali Bennett said about their office, have decided to cease all contact with the minister until he apologizes, Israel Radio reported on Saturday. Bennett told Radio Tel Aviv earlier this week that there was "a deep problem with the DNA" of the ministry.  In response to the protest, Bennett's office released a statement saying that his remarks referred specifically to those who act against the nation, like former foreign ministry director-general Alon Liel.




The Education Minister's remarks come days after Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely accused Liel of "using his status as a former senior Israeli diplomat...to encourage Breaking the Silence activists in their efforts against Israel abroad." The Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence describes itself as “an organization of veteran combatants who have served in the Israeli military since the start of the Second Intifada and have taken it upon themselves to expose the Israeli public to the reality of everyday life in the occupied territories." Liel recently caused a stir in Israel when it came to light that he  described a scenario whereby Israel could be expelled from the UN, as  South Africa once was.Liel is a former ambassador to South Africa, and compared the Breaking  the Silence activists to Jews who worked on behalf of Nelson Mandela to  upend apartheid, often at the price of being condemned by friends and  family.Following Bennett's remark, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Liel's conduct could not be applied to all of the workers of the Foreign Ministry who have, "served the nation and the government faithfully."

<title>Black Lives Matter activists claim Israel a brutal 'occupying' force</title>
<date>3/8/2016</date>
<content>
The streets of “occupied” Palestine closely resemble the police brutality  witnessed in Ferguson, Missouri, in the US, members of the Black Lives Matter  group told The Jerusalem Post.Ferguson became a hotbed of unrest after  police fatally shot unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in August 2014,  resulting in a series of riots and protests. Police efforts to dispel the unrest  raised even more controversy, leading activists to claim widespread police  brutality – one of the issues at the core of the Black Lives Matter  movement.




Black Lives Matter has pulled no punches when it comes to  criticizing Israel, claiming it is an apartheid state that perpetuates genocide  against the Palestinian people, according to its platform released on  Tuesday.For the delegation of Black Lives Matter activists here, who  spent the majority of their time in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, the  parallels between Ferguson and the Palestinian territories were eerily  similar.“Going through checkpoints, seeing rubber bullets, reminds us  what our comrades and some of us experienced in Ferguson, [and] IDF soldiers  totally remind me of the cops that brutalized [me],” said Ash-lee Henderson, a  regional organizer for Project South, which does grassroots advocacy for  low-income communities. According to Henderson, a Black Lives Matter movement  member, a violent encounter with police left her gravely injured and forced to  use a cane for more than a year.A similar observation was made last  month by New York University’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine,  which accused Israel of being complicit with police brutality in the United  States. The allegation drew swift criticism, resulting in a half-hearted  clarification from SJP.Such a comparison dovetails with the popular BDS  slogan, “From Ferguson to Palestine.”“We’ve met with folks leading the  BDS movement to talk about organizing strategies.There’s a lot of  similarities between organizers working in the United States on anti-black  racism and organizers here,” said Shanelle Matthews, Black Lives Matter’s  communications officer. “We share many of the same organizing  strategies.”Black Lives Matter, which “unequivocally” supports BDS, has  “a lot to learn from the movement,” Matthews said.“I think that one of  the best parts of our trip was listening to folks talk about how they  strategically thought about building a nonviolent movement that spreads like  wildfire across the world in a way that can actually change the conditions in  the most oppressed places,” she said.
The full interview will be  published as a Frontlines feature in Friday’s paper.

<title>Brainstorming BDS battle strategies</title>
<date>6/1/2016</date>
<content>
The government cannot fight the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement  alone; it needs a network, Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan said at a  packed Knesset Caucus to Battle Delegitimization conference on  Wednesday.“Delegitimization is a challenge with strategic potential,”  Erdan said. “BDS is part of a broader campaign that covers many areas, including  education and culture, which is meant to present Israel as the source of all  evil and opposed to the values of the democratic world, in order to restrict the  IDF’s actions and discriminate in international institutions.




“The  campaign’s goal is to destroy the existence of the State of Israel as the home  of the Jewish people,” he said.Erdan’s ministry is responsible for  coordinating the government’s efforts against delegitimization, and to that end  has a NIS 100 million budget for 2016. He called this the first time one  government office was appointed to integrate all efforts on the  matter.The minister commended the work of the many pro-Israel NGOs  attending the conference, saying that they and the government must work together  to fight delegitimization.“We need a network to face a network. We need  a real network built of [nongovernmental] organizations and other bodies, like  the Knesset. We have to work together on an issue that unites the Jewish  people and Israel’s many supporters in the world,” he added.Erdan said  they must put BDS on the defensive, while at the same time using public  diplomacy to improve Israel’s image in the world.The Caucus to Battle  Delegitimization is led by opposition and coalition MKs – Anat Berko (Likud),  Nachman Shai (Zionist Union), Michael Oren (Kulanu), Robert Ilatov (Yisrael  Beytenu) and Aliza Lavie (Yesh Atid) – and they invited representatives of NGOs  and high-profile experts to join the effort.Berko called BDS “jihad  dressed up in a suit.”Oren called the battle against delegitimization “a  war like any other, and in war, we must take off the gloves and reach new  battlefields on campuses around the world.“No tank will move and no  plane will take off if we don’t have the right to defend ourselves,” Oren  said.The Kulanu MK and former ambassador to the US described a bill he  proposed, meant to train outstanding IDF vets to be stationed on overseas  college campuses to advocate for Israel.“I’m sure if all the relevant  factors cooperate, we will successfully deal with international boycott  attempts,” he stated.Shai pointed out that the coalition and opposition  stand together in fighting BDS.“The boycott movement is an ugly one that  wants to harm Israel,” Shai said. “Every citizen of Israel can be a partner in  this world. We need to encourage people to buy more locally produced goods to  contribute.”Ilatov said boycotts of Israel remind him of the Nuremberg  Laws in Nazi Germany, which, among other things, included the boycott of Jewish  businesses.“Then, too, the Jews were blamed for all of the world’s  problems, and today, Israel, the state of the Jewish people, is the scapegoat,”  he said. “Our enemies slightly changed the rhetoric, but the meaning is mostly  just hatred of the Jewish people.”Former Canadian justice minister Irwin  Cotler described the boycott movement as “a new, global, sophisticated, virulent  and even lethal form of anti-Semitism.“Israel is the targeted Jew among  the nations,” he said.One of its tactics, Cotler explained, is to “mask  anti-Semitism with universal values, in an attempt to make Israel the enemy of  all that is good and the repository of all that is evil.”Cotler pointed  to the “annual ritual” of the UN portraying Israel as the enemy in all areas –  labor, health, culture, women’s rights – and thus the enemy of humankind in  general.Cotler, an expert on international and human rights law, said  that the new anti-Semitism uses the language of those areas against  Israel.“One of the worst things you can say about people today is that  they’re racist,” he said, explaining a delegitimization tactic. “People call  Israel an apartheid state, because apartheid is defined as a crime against  humanity, so if Israel is apartheid, it has no right to be.Not only  that, they call Israel a Nazi state, so the international community has a  responsibility to say Israel has no right to be.”Former MK Einat Wilf, a  senior fellow at the Jewish Peoplehood Policy Institute in Givat Ram, Jerusalem,  also pointed to the strategy of identifying Zionism, and thus Israel and the  Jewish people, as the source of all evil.“All violence starts with  preparing people’s consciousness so they think the violence [against Israel] is  a good thing,” she said. “The minute the world supports the Palestinians as the  total victims of evil and think this is a struggle between good and evil and not  between two nations with history, the chances of an agreement [with the  Palestinians] will be postponed for another 200 years. People don’t negotiate of  compromise with evil.”Wilf said that, as someone who is left-wing and  believes in a two-state solution, she thinks fighting the boycott and changing  the way people see Israel is important.The former MK emphasized the  importance of relaying the message that Zionism is not meant to displace anyone  or to cancel anyone else’s rights.“We have to enlist in this war of  awareness. We need the ‘IIDF,’ Israel Intellectual Defense Forces,” she  quipped.Some of the MKs referred to Israeli NGOs that they said support  the effort to delegitimize Israel.“The battle is at home, too,” Berko  said. “It’s against groups and organizations that may have good intentions but  are being used as to deceive people.Ilatov spoke out in support of the  Justice Ministry’s NGO transparency bill, which would require representatives of  organizations mostly funded by foreign governments to wear tags when visiting  the Knesset, and for the NGOs to disclose the funding in all  publications.“The bill says that the minute you get funding from a  foreign government and promote its agenda, which harms Israel, the public should  know,” he said.IBA journalist Yaakov Ahimeir, however, pointed out that  a recent Washington Post editorial criticized the NGO bill, and said it was bad  for Israel’s image.“Are all the laws being passed in the Knesset really  necessary?” he asked.
Ahimeir also called on lawmakers to be better  behaved, saying that an unruly Knesset looks bad in the eyes of the world. Two  MKs interrupted him while he spoke.

<title>Britain to prevent publicly funded bodies from boycotting Israeli goods</title>
<date>16/2/2016</date>
<content>
Publicly funded authorities in Britain will be prevented from boycotting Israeli goods under new government procurement guidelines.The new regulations will be announced by Cabinet Office minister Matthew Hancock during an upcoming visit to Israel, the Guardian reported Monday.




According to the guidelines, such boycotts are considered by the government ministers to be “inappropriate, outside where formal legal sanctions, embargoes and restrictions have been put in place by the government,” the Guardian reported.Plans for the guidelines were first announced in October.“We need to challenge and prevent these divisive town hall boycotts,” Hancock said, adding that the guidelines “will help prevent damaging and counterproductive local foreign policies undermining our national security.”A spokesman for Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbyn told the Jewish Chronicle that the guideline plan is “an attack on local democracy.”“People have the right to elect local representatives able to make decisions free of central government political control,” the spokesman said. “That includes withdrawal of investments or procurement on ethical and human rights grounds.”The spokesman added: “This government’s ban would have outlawed council action against apartheid South Africa.”Corbyn has been accused of being anti-Israel. He has publicly endorsed a blanket arms embargo on Israel and the boycott of its universities involved in weapons research.
Among the publicly funded bodies affected by the guidelines are councils, universities and National Health Service trusts.

<title>British doctors seek to expel Israel from World Medical Association</title>
<date>20/1/2016</date>
<content>
The students exposed to boycotts against Israeli academia today will be the  senators of the next generation, and here lies the long-term danger, Prof.  Peretz Lavie, president of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and  chairman of the Association of University Heads in Israel, said on  Wednesday.He spoke at a Knesset Science and Technology Committee  discussion on boycotts of Israeli academic institutions and  researchers.




“We have no complaints about the academic leadership in the  world. Our problem is on campuses. Initially this was only on marginal campuses,  very quickly it spread to leading campuses in the US,” he told the  committee.Lavie addressed an upcoming vote by the American Anthropological Association in which its 12,000 members will vote on whether to  adopt a boycott and refrain from formal collaborations with Israeli academic  institutions.“The American Anthropological Association wrote a report  that we are apartheid universities,” he said. “We must reach all 12,000 members  of the association. This is a symptom and if we do not act the fire will  spread.”Lavie urged the committee to establish “one address to  coordinate this issue.”Prof. Zvi Ziegler, professor emeritus at the  Technion and recently appointed head of an Association of University Heads forum  to counter academic boycotts, told the committee he is “very worried about the  future.”“There is a covert boycott among faculty members [abroad]. It is  still below the surface because they think it is illegitimate. With our  meager forces, we are unable to stop this erosion,” he said.The Knesset  panel also heard from Dr. Zeev Feldman, chairman of the Israeli Medical  Association World Fellowship and president of the Israeli Neurosurgical Society,  who revealed that the latest boycott call comes from a group of 71 British  doctors.Speaking to The Jerusalem Post following the Knesset discussion,  Feldman said the doctors penned a letter last week to the World Medical  Association seeking to expel the Israeli Medical Association, claiming that  Israeli doctors carried out “medical torture” on Palestinian  patients.According to Feldman, this letter was just one effort in a  consistent and organized campaign against Israeli institutions and  scientists.“We are in a struggle, everyone must understand that there is  an organized struggle – a fight against academia, doctors, and other Israeli  bodies,” he said.“Our stance is that these accusations are lies, and we  are engaged in a dialogue with the World Medical Association and we will bring  forth the facts, and I hope that it will be enough to [persuade the association  to] reject this request,” he said.Asked what the result of such a  boycott might be, Feldman said it would have a “domino effect and radiate to all  other scientific associations.“A boycott of the Israeli Medical  Association would prevent Israelis from participating in medical conferences  [and] publishing papers in journals, would halt funding of research and joint  research endeavors, and prevent membership in other medical associations,” he  explained.While Feldman said the Israeli Medical Association has been  successful in countering past calls for boycotts, he fears a time may come when  those opposing Israel will succeed.“If there will be many hammer hits,  eventually the wall will give in,” he said.At the end of the Knesset  Science and Technology Committee discussion, MK Uri Maklev (United Torah  Judaism), the panel’s chairman, called on the government to establish a central  body responsible for coordinating the efforts to counter boycotts of Israeli  academic institutions and researchers.
“The boycott [campaign] harms the  strength of the State of Israel. The government must allocate appropriate funds  for the good of the struggle in this hour of national emergency,” he said.

<title>Bruce Springsteen guitarist blasts ‘obnoxious idiots’ who back BDS</title>
<date>3/5/2016</date>
<content>
Amid rumors that Bruce Springsteen will perform in Tel Aviv this summer, he and his E Street band have come under fire from supporters of boycotting Israel.On Monday, band guitarist Steven Van Zandt – who is also known for playing a mobster on HBO’s The Sopranos – responded in typically direct style. In a series of tweets, he called Israel boycotters “politically ignorant obnoxious idiots” and suggested to one: “go f*** yourself.”




In March at the SXSW conference in Austin Texas, Van Zandt met Israel’s consul general in New York, Ido Aharoni, and posed for photos with him. Rumors circulated that Springsteen and the E-Street Band would include Tel Aviv on the European leg of their 2016 tour, but a show was never confirmed or announced, and Springsteen’s two-and-a half month jaunt, beginning next week, seems to be finalized.Van Zandt has taken tweet heat before for the unconfirmed show.And he’s not alone among his bandmates.Bassist Garry Tallent has been heckled by the Twittersphere. And self-described anti-Zionist Stanley Cohen, who has more than 20,000 Twitter followers, went after the Boss himself back in February.The latest Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) brouhaha emerged unexpectedly from a seemingly unrelated Twitter conversation. On Sunday, a fan bemoaned to Van Zandt Springsteen’s cancellation of a show in North Carolina last month in opposition to the state’s recently enacted “bathroom law” – which targets transgender people by requiring bathroom use according to the gender on a person’s birth certificate.Another Twitter user then accused Van Zandt of touring other countries “which do much worse.”Van Zandt responded that he held the US to a higher standard.After some debate about what makes America so great, and whether it’s OK to call it America, the argument came around to the boycott issue. A user asked why, if Van Zandt gave other countries a pass, had he gotten involved in the movement against South African apartheid with the 1985 protest song “Sun City.” Van Zandt said that was about the US too.Then, a certain Patrick – whose Twitter bio reads: “I have one issue human rights for Palestine people” – brought Israel into it.This earned a double-tweet smack-down from Van Zandt.

You and the other Israel boycotters are politically ignorant obnoxious idiots. Israel is one of our two friends> https://t.co/jfLX5bAzyc

<title>Celtic fans raise over £136,000 for 'Palestine' after Israel match debacle</title>
<date>24/8/2016</date>
<content>
Celtic fans have so far raised over £136,000 in two days for Palestinian charities after the club received a disciplinary charge from the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). Last week, fans of Scotland’s Celtic soccer team staged a protest, organized by Green Brigade fans, against Israel when their team faced off with Hapoel Beersheba in the Champions League.




The fans waved more than a 100 Palestinian flags at the match last week in spite of prior warnings, breaching UEFA rules on political statements at matches. The online 'gofundme' fundraising page was launched shortly after the charge from UEFA and shared via social media as 
MatchTheFineForPalestine. UEFA considers the Palestinian flag an "illicit banner" and according to the group's rules and regulations, bans all messages that are of a "political, ideological, religious, offensive or provocative nature."According to the BBC, the club has been penalized at least eight times in the past five seasons for fan misconduct. The Celtic group affiliates itself with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, which it hails as “inspiring and unstoppable.”According to the Facebook page which organized the protest, an Israeli soccer team should not be allowed to participate in the soccer competition “due to the system of apartheid laws and practices including religious- and ethnic-based colonization, military occupation and segregation of what remains of Palestinian land and over 90 laws which discriminate against indigenous Palestinians who make up 20 percent of the population of current-day Israel.”The soccer club is due to present their case at a disciplinary hearing on the 22nd of September.

<title>Diplomacy: Bless the rains down in Africa</title>
<date>7/7/2016</date>
<content>
ADDIS ABABA – From people lining the street holding Israeli flags  and waving on the road from the Entebbe airport to the presidential palace  nearby; to the “Karibu, We Welcome H.E. Benjamin Netanyahu” billboards on some  Nairobi streets; to the Rwanda brass band and colorful honor guard that greeted  him at the Kigali Airport – East Africa, or more precisely a good chunk of East  Africa, clearly embraced Israel this week.And what was so telling about  this embrace is that it was done in public, in broad daylight, and with much  enthusiasm.




Which leads to one major question. Why did it take so long?  If leader after leader, from Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni to Kenya’s  President Uhuru Kenyatta to Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame, all – in their own  unique style – extolled the benefits of cooperation with Israel, and if  Netanyahu, in numerous speeches and four press conferences, declared the  strategic importance of Africa to Israel, then why did it take so long to move  this relationship into high gear? Kenyatta supplied the answer: It’s now a  different world.“We think the world has changed,” he said in elegant  British-accented English, standing alongside Netanyahu on a red-carpeted podium  set before the entrance to State House in Nairobi, a palatial, White  House-looking building with a massive black, red and green Kenyan flag flying  from the rooftop. “The nature of the global problems that we now share are  different from what they were some 30 years ago.”Africa, he said,  “cannot live in history,” an allusion to opposition from some on the continent  to greater ties with Israel because of the relationship Israel had in the past  with apartheid South Africa.“We have to be able to live in the future,  address ourselves to the challenges of today,” he said. “And the one clear fact  is that [terrorism is] the biggest challenge we face, not only as a state and  continent but as a community of nations threatened by deranged people who  believe in no religion and threaten men, women and children around the  globe.”More than all the technological know-how that Israel can supply,  more than the expertise it can provide in soil conservation and solar energy,  Africa is opening up to Israel because of groups like the al-Qaida-affiliated  al-Shabaab from nearby Somalia, threatening the peace and quiet of the  continent’s eastern corridor.All efforts to push a social agenda, all  attempts to build infrastructure and improve the living standard of the people,  all attempts to make life better for their citizens are being thwarted, Kenyatta  said, by the threat of terrorism. It dwarfs everything else; it casts a cloud  over everything.And for that reason, he made clear, Africa needs Israel,  as much as Israel needs Africa.NOW WHILE ALL THIS may sound clear and  logical to Israelis, the fact that Kenyatta – as well as Ethiopian Prime  Minister Hailemariam Desalegn – said it openly is what is unique.Israel  is no stranger to discrete diplomatic ties; indeed, they continue to this day,  both with states in Africa with whom Israel does not have diplomatic relations –  such as Somalia, Chad and Mali – as well as with Arab countries in the  region.And it is those ties with the Arab states, with Saudi Arabia and  the Persian Gulf states in particular, that has helped lead to a change in  African attitudes. The public might not know much about Israel’s ties with the  Gulf states – beyond the fact that they are taking place – but leaders around  the world are aware of them, and their very existence is having an  impact.Kenyatta said that faced with the challenge of terrorism, it  would be “foolhardy” for Africa not to cooperate closely with Israel, it would  be “like an ostrich burying its head.”He noted that Israel today has  better ties with the Arab world than ever before, and asked – essentially – why  Africa should be more Catholic than the pope. “Why should we on the African  continent say we know better than those in the region?” Yoram Elron, the Foreign  Ministry’s director-general for Africa, whose father was an ambassador in Zambia until he was kicked out in 1973 when most of Africa cut off ties with Israel  under intense Arab pressure, and who himself served as ambassador to Cameroon  and nonresident ambassador to South Sudan, termed this week’s events a  “milestone” in Israel-African ties.One of the elements that made it a  milestone, he said, was Netanyahu’s summit in Uganda with the leaders of seven  Eastern African countries: Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Zambia, South Sudan  and Tanzania.That summit was unprecedented, he said, and its  significance should not be downplayed.At short notice, the leaders flew  to Uganda for a three-hour meeting that Netanyahu described as the start of a  strategic alliance among countries with many common interests. That meeting sent  a message that those who attended were no longer afraid of bringing ties with  Israel into the sunlight, no longer afraid of the reaction of Arab states, the  North African states or South Africa.The importance of the meeting to  the African leaders who participated was evident in that Rwanda’s President Paul  Kagame came to it even though it fell on the day marking the end of the genocide  in his country in 1994. In Rwanda, that day is the equivalent of that nation’s  independence day, and his showing up to the meeting would be like Netanyahu  flying abroad for a meeting on Israel’s Independence Day.Tall,  razor-thin and soft-spoken – not elegant like Kenyatta or bombastic like  Uganda’s Museveni – Kagame, in fact, is the force driving this alliance, pushing  it forward, urging other countries to get involved. And Rwanda, despite its  small size, has emerged as a key force in Africa in recent years, largely  because the country’s military is strong and its economy is robust and growing  rapidly.Rwanda is also arguably – along with Kenya – Israel’s strongest  friend in Africa. Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said recently that both those  countries were instrumental in beating back Iranian attempts at the UN to keep  Israel, for the first time ever, from gaining the chairmanship of a key UN  committee.Jerusalem hopes to replicate the type of summit it held in  Uganda on Monday in the near future in West Africa, with countries like Togo,  Ghana, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and others participating.The impression is  that Monday’s meeting will open the door and provide a strong “back wind” for  replicating this type of event in West Africa.Ironically, it is Nigeria  – a country plagued by the terrorism of Boko Haram and which had very warm  relations with Israel up until new elections there in 2015 – that is posing an  obstacle. Israel’s relationship with Nigeria flowered under its Christian  president, Goodluck Jonathan, but when he lost the election, the country’s  attitude – and voting pattern in international forums – changed.This  phenomenon – of changing attitudes depending on who is in office – works both  ways, however.Just as Nigeria’s attitude cooled with the election of a  Muslim president, Muhammadu Buhari, Tanzania’s attitude improved with the  election there in 2015 of a Christian president, John Magufuli, replacing his  Muslim predecessor.Tanzania’s Foreign Minister Augustine Mahiga was at  the summit in Uganda and announced that his country would open an embassy in Tel  Aviv. This will bring the number of African embassies up to 15, with four new  ones opened in the last three years: South Sudan, Rwanda, Zambia and now  Tanzania.In addition to the Uganda summit, Netanyahu’s trip was  significant on two other levels: It provided strong momentum to strengthen  bilateral ties in each of the countries he visited – Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda and  Ethiopia. Some nine bilateral agreements, ranging from accords on tourism to  those on agricultural cooperation and visa waivers for diplomats, were  signed.Furthermore, representatives from some 50 Israeli companies held  business seminars in both Kenya and Ethiopia, giving a huge push to developing  business ties.Secondly, both Kenyatta and Hailemariam pledged to work to  get Israel’s observer status at the African Union reinstated, a status that has  been blocked since 2002 by the Arab states and South Africa.The  significance of this, Netanyahu said, is that it will further open Africa’s  doors to Israel, as Israel will be involved in pan-African consultations and be  able to present its case to the body. The Palestinian Authority has this status  already.Netanyahu clearly soaked in all the warm words and the pomp and  ceremony surrounding his whirlwind visit to four states in just over four days.  One reason he seemed to enjoy it was that he was not confronted at every turn by  questions about the diplomatic process.The Palestinians, according to  one senior official in the prime minister’s meetings with the African leaders,  barely came up.“They have bigger fish to fry,” he said.It was  refreshing, another senior diplomatic source noted, that the main issue on the  table on a foreign visit was not the Palestinians or the diplomatic process, but  rather, how to grow more crops, how to more efficiently use more water, and how  to use Israeli technology to fight terrorism.Though Museveni, Kenyatta  and Hailemariam all mentioned the need for peace in the Mideast in their  speeches, they all just essentially pledged allegiance to the two-state solution  and stressed the need for negotiations. By emphasizing the need for  negotiations, they gently fell into line with Israel’s position that this is  what is needed to move the diplomatic process forward, not additional  international conferences.
In Africa this week, none of the leaders  fixated on the Palestinian issue or cared overmuch about whether a few hundred  more housing units will be built in Ma’aleh Adumim. That definitely would not  have been the case had Netanyahu opted to spend the first week of July not in  Africa but, rather, in the US or Europe – another reason he is eager to return  to Africa, this time the western part, in the near future.

<title>Diplomacy: South Africa’s softening stance toward Jerusalem</title>
<date>24/3/2016</date>
<content>
The South African government is pushing to deepen its ties with Israel, in spite  of persistent calls by its citizens to sever ties with the Jewish  state.At the heart of a new warm breeze from Pretoria is a growing trade  imbalance, in which the two countries have gone from a parity situation in 2009  to one where Israel exports to South Africa almost four times as much as it  imports, according to the South African Embassy.




“We are all serious  about moving things forward,” South Africa’s Ambassador Sisa Ngombane told The  Jerusalem Post.He spoke in the aftermath of a visit to his country by  Foreign Minister director-general Dore Gold. It was the first time in a decade  that someone in his post had visited South Africa.The two countries have  diplomatic ties that stretch back to 1948, when South Africa was among the first  nations to recognize Israel as a Jewish state.But the government that  first brokered that relationship was the past apartheid regime. Post-apartheid  South African governments have remained committed to those historic ties but  have been unable to shake off the negative consequence of that history,  particularly in light of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.The South  African street sympathies with the Palestinians and as a result is antagonistic  to Israel. In addition, the global pro-Palestinian rhetoric of the conflict has  equated Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians with apartheid’s racial  segregation.As a result, South Africa-Israel relations have been held  hostage to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in a way that has made it  impossible for the two countries to move beyond history and politics.As  he sat in his Tel Aviv office, Ngombane tried to explain the delicate dance his  county is doing between history, diplomatic alliance and political  sentiment.The South African street might be strongly pro-Palestinian,  but its calls against Israel have nothing to do with government policy, Ngombane  said.The South African street is vibrant when it comes to many issues,  and demonstration are held frequently on all kinds of issues, he said. He  recalled how he had seen a pro-Israel demonstration when he last visited  Johannesburg.Events in the Middle East, including the three Gaza wars  and the 2010 naval raid on the Gaza flotilla in which nine Turkish activists  aboard the Mavi Marmara were killed, had created a tense decade-long period with  South Africa, which President Jacob Zuma has recently tried to  break.“Zuma felt it was important to have some form of discussions going  on [with Israel],” Ngombane said.“We have had several attempts from the  South African side to reach out, to see what can be done,” he said.“We  have an unfortunate thing that always crops up, that past [apartheid] South  Africa is linked to Israel. It is like a monkey on our back for us, literally.  There is nothing we can do about it, unfortunately,” Ngombane said.The  two countries have to figure out how to live with this history, he  said.“This is where we are and where we come from. We cannot transfer it  and give it to someone [else] and say please take care of it, it is not from  South Africa,” said Ngombane.“It creates all these difficulties in terms  of the relationship,” he said.If South Africa were interested in  settling an old grudge, it would not have a relationship with Israel.“We  have [a relationship] because we are not settling any scores with Israel. There  is no attempt to come back and say you previously supported apartheid,” Ngombane  said.But the issues that “drag us off into this part of the world is the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Whether we like it or not, we are brought into  this matter, and strongly,” he said.“No matter how much we try and say  forget the past, we find ourselves referenced,” he said. “People globally  reference the South African experience, and so we have to deal with that,”  Ngombane said.He dismissed the question of whether he himself saw a  comparison between Israel in 2016 and apartheid South Africa.That  question, he said, is exactly the problem. “The problem is that people  want us to answer the question,” Ngombane said.“Why should we be made to  answer the question in that way? This is the issue. If you want me to answer, it  brings me to the problems that are manifesting itself here,” he said.If  the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were resolved, he said, “it would multiply our  engagement [with Israel] 100 times more,” Ngombane said.In the absence  of that resolution, it is important for the two governments to establish a  pattern of meeting and talking so that they can find avenues of common ground  outside the heated political arena.Trade is one of those avenues, he  said. There is a “big trade imbalance,” he said. "In the past the  majority of South African exports to Israel has been coal and  diamonds. That export list must be expanded." South Africa also  wants to improve cooperation in the areas of agriculture and water.“At  this moment we are just opening the space, creating the ground, for more  discussions in all these area,” he said.Overall, he spoke positively of  Gold’s visit, in which the director-general stopped at some historic sites  important to South Africa, including Nelson Mandela’s home and the Liliesleaf  Farm.It was important, Ngombane said, that he came and saw South Africa  firsthand.“South Africa is a work in progress. It is a live experiment.  You see all these things happening because 20 years is nothing.“When you  get to South Africa, you see the ravages of separate development, you see the  lack of infrastructure. The legacy and impact of all those years and centuries  of deprivation are so stark and so painful, and he [Gold] was there to witness  that,” Ngombane said.But he noted that it was a mistake for Gold not to  have visited the Apartheid Museum.“When you go in there, no one needs to  tell you what apartheid was; it is there. The puzzle of South African society is  all collected under one roof,” Ngombane said.“My regret is that [Gold]  did not get there. It is like visiting Israel and not going to the Holocaust  museum,” he said.Israel is not Ngombane’s first post as a  diplomat. He was an ambassador in Côte d’Ivoire, the Congo and Malaysia.  He is in Israel with his wife and 14-year-old daughter.Their time here  has been marred by violence – first the Gaza war in the summer of 2014 and then  the wave of Palestinian attacks in the last half-year.The air raid  sirens “were a shock to our systems,” Ngombane said. “When you wake up in  Israel,” he said, “something says you should be happy, but something says, not  so fast. You do not know what will happen.“The sky is blue, the sun is  shining and this is fine, and then the air raid strikes,” he  said.Similarly, now, when he hears ambulance sirens, he does not know if  that means an attack has occurred.“The wave of violence has also been  difficult. It sits with you in the back of your mind all the time. Your  mind tries to rationalize things. At the same time, you have a problem that a  shooting [or] a stabbing [has occurred],” he said.The knowledge he has  gained from his professional life and family has taught him more about Israel  but has not helped simplify for him its conflict with the  Palestinians. The more he knows, he said, the more confused he has  become.Israel’s Ambassador to South Africa Arthur Lenk said he was glad  to hear of Ngombane’s statements about increasing trade. More trade  delegations are needed, he said.But work is already under way to improve  ties. This year his embassy is foregoing its annual Independence Day celebration  and using that budget to bring representatives from Israel’s best water  management companies to South Africa to meet with private and public sector  decision-makers to talk with them about ways to combat the drought the country  is undergoing.Israeli expertise can also serve South Africa’s interests,  he said.
“I am glad to hear that we are a good consumer market. The more  they introduce Israelis to great things from South Africa, I am sure that it is  good for them and good for us,” Lenk said.

<title>Comment: Dividing Jerusalem - Capitulation or pragmatism?</title>
<date>10/3/2016</date>
<content>
Jerusalem, perhaps the world’s most contested capital, is indeed a tale of two  cities. In fact, it is a city that frequently resembles parallel  universes.While ideologues and politicians endlessly bicker over  rightful sovereignty, a simple truth remains: Based on any meaningful metric,  the “united model” of the capital upheld since the 1967 Six Day War has abjectly  failed.




It has failed to keep Jewish women and children on the Western  side safe from Arab killers living in the east – killers who are indoctrinated  at birth into a profoundly hateful culture that celebrates death the way Jews  are taught to celebrate life – and it is no longer tenable, or  sustainable.As the past six months of brazen and unconscionable violence  carried out by terrorists as young as 11 – children who are rewarded with  acclaim by their families and society – has proven, these two radically opposed  ideologies simply cannot coexist in a shared environment.It is the  equivalent of mixing milk and battery acid.There is no question that the  vast majority of Palestinians living in east Jerusalem are peaceful and want the  bloodshed to stop as much as their Jewish counterparts. However, they have  unequivocally failed to meaningfully repudiate the celebrated murderers among  them.From Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, to clerics,  parents, and grade-school educators in Arab schools who refuse to condemn the  barbaric violence, the silence is deafening, if not horrific.Opposition  leader and Zionist Union head Isaac Herzog’s call to finally divide the city  into Arab and Jewish halves has logically been met with derision from right-wing  parties, particularly Likud leaders, who claim that division is tantamount to  “capitulation to terrorism.”However, such reductive reasoning is the  equivalent of being “dead right” – i.e. correct, but self-damaging.In  the final analysis, one must ask a couple of important questions: Is it  capitulation to quarantine predators that will stop at nothing to kill their  vulnerable prey? Is it capitulation to save innocent lives? A true pragmatist  does not make decisions based on ideals or emotion – he or she makes them based  on reality; on facts on the ground.And when these irrefutable facts are  endlessly challenged, Albert Einstein’s maxim on the definition of insanity  proves itself time and again: repeating the same process over and over, but  expecting a different outcome.Based on tangible evidence, it is time to  replace wishful thinking – or even being “right” – with the scientific  method.As the Jerusalem reporter for this paper I have seen multiple  murder scenes that belong in pulp fiction novels, not the holiest city in the  world. I have walked the streets and seen young Arab men and children with  incandescent rage in their eyes.I have written too many stories about  women and children being knifed or shot to death for the crime of being  Jewish.You can categorize what is happening in Jerusalem as a “third  intifada” or a “war,” but the bottom line is that innocent people are being  killed in our midst by children with relative legal immunity who are being  cynically used as pawns by elders who were supposed to teach them to value all  life.In terms of the human rights groups around the globe that will undoubtedly deem a separation of Jews and Arabs in Jerusalem as "apartheid" or a “crime against humanity,” I would ask whose humanity they are referring to?Is it apartheid or a crime  against humanity to protect one group of people from another group that refuses  to accept they have a right to exist? A group that teaches and encourages its  impressionable children at home, in mosques, and in classrooms that murdering a  Jew, and dying in the process, will send them to heaven and bring their families  great pride? If dividing the city will save just one more Jewish life from being senselessly targeted by unimaginable predators who believe his or her own violent death will bring them salvation, then how, in good conscience, can one not allow that to happen? Ultimately, the only presently viable means of  stopping more innocent Jewish blood from spilling on Jerusalem’s streets is to  divide it from an enemy that has dehumanized the Jewish people to such depths  that they view their blood as worthless.Those on the Right will argue  that dividing the capital is futile because no matter what is offered to  Palestinian terrorists, it will never be enough. That it is not about land or  compromise, but rather the destruction of the Jewish People and the State of  Israel. That they will continue to kill Jews no matter what.They are  absolutely correct.However, if a fence and heavily armed checkpoints will make it exponentially more difficult for them to kill – as Gaza and the West Bank have proven – then why can’t that logic be applied to Jerusalem, the holy of the holies itself? Indeed, if the Talmud is correct and “whoever  destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world” and  “whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world,” then  perhaps it’s time to divide these worlds once and for all.In the  meantime, if preventing one more Jewish death at the hands of terrorists who are  free to roam among them is capitulation, so be it.This is not weakness. It's strength.When is enough enough?How many more children and women need to be slaughtered? How many more funerals  need to take place? How much more blood needs to be spilled on these streets?  
Until a better proposal than separation is offered, it is wiser to be pragmatic  than “dead right.”

<title>During historic Netanyahu visit, Kenyan president says Africa needs Israel</title>
<date>5/7/2016</date>
<content>
NAIROBI – Kenya will work to restore Israel’s observer status at the African  Union because Israel is a critical partner in the battle against terrorism, the  most serious challenge facing the world today, Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta  said Tuesday.The upgrading of Israel’s status in the pan-African body is  critical not for Israel, “but for all those who see this [terrorism] as a common  challenge.




This is a battle not won by any nation, but by coming  together,” Kenyatta said.In very warm words, he said it was critical for  Africa to re-evaluate its relationship with Israel in order to better enable  Africa to deal with its challenges.Israel lost its observer status at  the African Union, formerly known as the Organization of African Unity, in 2002.  Libya and other North African Arab countries were primarily behind the move,  though in recent years South Africa has blocked attempts to get Israel  reinstated.The Palestinian Authority does enjoy this status, meaning  that PA President Mahmoud Abbas may address the body, while Israeli leaders may  not.Netanyahu told reporters he has set breaking the automatic majority  against Israel in international forums as a strategic goal for the country, and  that upgrading Israel’s position in the African Union will go a long way toward achieving that  goal.Netanyahu noted that when he drove the five minutes on Monday from  Entebbe to the Ugandan presidential palace nearby to meet with the leaders of  seven east African states – Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Zaire and  South Sudan – some people lined the streets waving Israeli flags and  cheering.Netanyahu said he told the leaders he met that one person held  up a sign that read, “Uganda needs Israel.”“I said ‘Israel also needs  Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya, all the countries,’” Netanyahu said.“We need  that alliance, that alliance can gradually change – it will take time, it may  take a decade – the automatic majority against Israel. Something that has never  been possible in the past.”The prime minister said his aim was to widen  “our circle of ties. If we succeed in making inroads with the 54 countries of  Africa, the automatic majority against Israel would fall by the  wayside.”This is something that could have a long-term impact on  diplomatic efforts with the Palestinians, he said, claiming that the  Palestinians are “running away from direct negotiations” with Israel to various  international forums where they believe they will get automatic  backing.If that backing can be removed, he said, the Palestinians would  have more of an incentive to deal directly with Israel, since their chances of  getting significantly better terms under an international umbrella would be  diminished.Kenyatta firmly backed Israel’s call for direct negotiations,  saying: “Dialogue between leaders is important when lives of people are at  risk,” adding that Kenya views Israel as a ”critical partner, friend and ally,  all the more reason why we desire peace in that part of the  world.”Kenyatta referred to previous difficult relations between Israel  and Africa – an apparent reference to Israel’s relationship with apartheid South  Africa, which was one fact that soured Israel’s ties with the rest of the  continent – saying, “the world has changed, and we cannot live in  history.“We have to be able to live in the future, address ourselves to  the challenges of today,” he said at the outdoor press conference in front of  his palatial office. “And the one clear fact is that [terrorism is] the biggest  challenge we face, not only as a state and continent, but as a community of  nations threatened by deranged people who believe in no religion and threaten  men, women and children across the globe.”He said this threat directly  impacts on the capacity of countries to further an agenda aimed at improving the  daily lot of their citizens “It would be foolhardy to say that faced with those  challenges, Africa can’t engage with Israel,” he said. “That would be like an  ostrich burying it head.”Kenyatta noted that Israel today has better  relations with its immediate Arab neighbors than ever had before. As such, he  said, “Why should we on the African continent say we know better than those in  the region?” The Kenyan president, who visited Israel earlier in the year, said  Kenya stands to gain a great deal from security cooperation with  Israel.“Kenya has already gained” he said, “from training to strategic  thinking,” as well as in the use of technology to fight  terrorism.“Israel has faced this challenge much longer than we as a  country or region have,” he said. “We can really practically learn a lot from  Israel’s experience.”Netanyahu, meanwhile, said Africa has no better  friend outside of the continent in terms of providing security and development  assistance than Israel.“There may be other friends,” he said, “but none  of them exceed Israel in our proven capacity and desire to put our experience in  helping African countries struggling against the same adversary and same enemies  that want to destroy us, and want to destroy you.”Kenyatta began his  comments by referring to the 40th anniversary of the Entebbe raid on Monday,  saying that Kenya – which provided Israel with critical logistical assistance –  stood with Israel at that time in “practice and principle.”And as a  country, he added, Kenya paid the price, as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin killed  “many of our people” who were living in the neighboring country “as a result of  the support we gave.”The Kenyan president said Entebbe was an example of  good will prevailing over evil, “right over wrong.” That event, he added, should  be “a source of incredible encouragement and hope to a world increasingly  standing together” against terrorism.
On Wednesday morning, Netanyahu is  to fly to Rwanda, where he will spend eight hours, before flying to Addis Abba,  the last leg of his tour.

<title>Erdan at JPost Conference: Terror and BDS share the same ideological roots</title>
<date>23/11/2016</date>
<content>
BDS – a movement that calls to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel – is another form of terrorism directed at Israel, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan asserted at The Jerusalem Post Diplomatic Conference on Wednesday.“Just as the goal of terrorism is to spread fear and instability, BDS aims to delegitimize and isolate Israel and in the end to destroy it,” Erdan said later, adding, “The ideological roots of both Palestinian terror and the BDS campaign are exactly the same. BDS is not about human rights, both are about the rejection of Israel’s right to exist as the nation-state of the Jewish people.”




Erdan asked the international community to “reject BDS in all forms,” and pressure Palestinian leadership to recognize Israel as a Jewish state. “I believe that if each of your countries make this a core demand from the Palestinians and repeat it over and over, and don’t put the pressure only on the wrong side, we may see the day when we have true partner for peace,” he said.He said Israel would soon release information on legal violations committed by BDS groups and connections among BDS groups to supporters of terrorist organizations. However, he did not release any details or a timetable for the release of information.The BDS movement formed in 2005 is a nonviolent international movement that seeks to politically and economically pressure Israel to end what it contends is Israel’s “occupation and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall,” according to the official BDS website. The movement compares Israel to apartheid-era South Africa and advocates the “right of return” for all Palestinians considered refugees, around 7.25 million, to the current State of Israel.Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, has advocated for a boycott of Israeli settlements, but in 2013 rejected the idea of boycotting Israel inside the Green Line. While some Palestinian politicians support the movement, the great majority of the PA’s trade is with Israel.Meanwhile Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, said that Erdan’s equating of BDS with terrorism wrongfully conflates violent and nonviolent acts.“There are at least two different types of boycotts, boycotts of Israel and boycotts of settlements, that the Israeli government tends to conflate,” Ibish said, “If you refuse to acknowledge the difference between violent and nonviolent actions, that are in the case of settlement boycotts completely legitimate under international law, indeed I would say morally imperative, then you’re trivializing violence, you’re trivializing terrorism.”Erdan, however, did leave the options open for a negotiated settlement to be reached with the Palestinians. “It was a Likud government that made peace with Egypt and I believe that it is a Likud government that can make peace with the Palestinians,” he said.Israel has made great advances in fighting both terrorism and the BDS movement, the public security minister said.Citing a drop in terrorist attacks in the capital over the past year, Erdan said that Jerusalem is one of the safest places in the Middle East.Jerusalem Post staff contributed to this report.

<title>Erekat: IDF in West Bank an invalid legal system</title>
<date>19/5/2016</date>
<content>
PLO  Secretary-General Saeb Erekat late on Tuesday rejected a compromise for  resolving disputes over the IDF’s West Bank courts and over alleged dual unequal  legal systems for Jews and Palestinians living there by adding foreign observers  to IDF West Bank courts.When asked by The Jerusalem Post about the  compromise suggestion at a conference held by the Palestine-Israel Journal in  Jerusalem, he called it “playing around with” an inherently invalid legal  system, instead of trying to take apart that system as should be  done.




The idea was suggested to the Post in discussions with a top  defense lawyer for Palestinians about what changes might be viewed as improving  the objectivity of the courts short of abolishing them – as is traditionally  demanded by the Palestinian side.Mostly, the Palestinian side sticks to  the claim that Israeli military courts trying them inherently violates their  sovereign rights. They say this is especially true, since Jews living in the  West Bank are brought to trial in Israeli civilian courts.But the lawyer  had framed the idea as a possible improvement, since the courts would likely  continue to be a reality for the foreseeable future.Erekat responded to  the compromise idea, saying, “It’s not about... the Geneva Conventions or  international law. There was a law invented [by Israel], the law of getting away  with it. Everyone hears and sees what Israel is doing to the Palestinians over  50 years,” he continued, repeating that “the real law” is getting away with  violating Palestinian rights.The PLO secretary-general also recounted  his personal experience with the West Bank Courts when he was arrested and  brought before an IDF court in Nablus in 1987.He said that his lawyers  were fined NIS 1,500 for asking the court a question about his case, and said  the courts are the “tools of apartheid.”Putting on a more positive spin,  he added, “in the long run, Palestinians and Israelis are destined to live  together in peace and security.”Erekat’s response had been predicted by  a variety of current and former Israeli officials who also rejected the  compromise idea for a variety of reasons, including their seemingly accurate  prediction that the Palestinians would never accept the idea.
For  example, former West Bank IDF judge Ahron Mishnayot poured cold water on the  idea in discussions with the Post. He said that it is “completely unrealistic”  and that the Palestinians would never do it.

<title>Green Party presidential candidate Stein: End military aid to 'apartheid' Israel</title>
<date>8/8/2016</date>
<content>
US Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein says she would end all military aid to Israel and has recently called the Israeli government "very oppressive."In an interview with Newsweek published Friday, Stein said that as an American Jew she has a relationship with Israel, but called that relationship "ethical" and blasted right-wing donors such as Sheldon Adelson who "contributes a huge amount of money to [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu." She said that if she were an Israeli citizen she would be "up in arms about it."




When asked about military aid to Israel, Stein responded she would end all military funding, adding that, "This would be decisively against our common values, to support apartheid, to support home demolitions, to support occupation, to support violations of international law."As the Green Party candidate in 2012, Stein appeared on ballots in 36 states and received 469,000 votes, or some 0.36 percent of the ballots cast.Stein ran unsuccessfully for governor of Massachusetts in 2002 and 2010.Before entering politics, Stein, a graduate of Harvard Medical School, was a practicing physician for 25 years.In line with the Green Party platform, Stein supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel, or BDS. She places Israel in the company of non-democratic American allies Saudi Arabia and Egypt. In tweets, she has accused Israel of “the pillage of Palestine” and written that Israel’s “war crimes & human rights violations are off the charts.”Stein needs to garner 15 percent support in election polls to be invited to participate in the presidential debates. She currently is polling at about 5 percent.

<title>'German BDS hurts Israeli and Palestinian workers alike'</title>
<date>8/11/2016</date>
<content>
The 700,000 member Histadrut labor federation urged the German GEW union (The Education and Science Workers’ Union) on Sunday to stop its attacks on Israel and focus on advancing the conditions of Palestinian and Israeli workers.“The Histadrut strongly opposes the BDS phenomenon, which contradicts the belief and ideology of the GEW,” Avital Shapira, director of Histadrut’s International Department, told The Jerusalem Post on Sunday. “It is counterproductive, harms innocent Israeli and Palestinian workers and its goal is to delegitimize and demonize Israel and Israeli organizations,” she said.




“Rather, the Histadrut calls on trade unions throughout the world and other organizations to focus on constructive deeds and cooperate with the Histadrut in its constant protection of workers – Israeli, Palestinian and migrant alike – and strive to enhance the relationship between Israeli and Palestinian unions,” she added.

(Anti-BDS conference at the UN )A branch of the GEW (the teachers’ union), based in the city of Oldenburg, launched a Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions campaign targeting Israel in its September magazine.  The branch has 1,200 members.Members of the Oldenburg GEW leadership have endorsed the BDS campaign run by Christoph Glanz, a public school teacher and author of the magazine article calling for the boycott.In response to the Glanz’s activities, Klaus Faber, a member of the Coordinating Council of German non-Governmental Organizations Against Antisemitism, told the Post that “ for us and our membership associations, antisemitic anti-Zionists do not belong in the German teaching profession or in the teaching profession anywhere in Europe.”The Coordinating Council sent a letter in October to Chancellor Angela Merkel and members of the Bundestag regarding the antisemitism of Islamic State and Iran’s regime. The letter cited the case of Glanz and the GEW. According to the letter, “antisemitic anti-Zionism has spread over the decades and a current example is the new publication [magazine article] calling for an antisemitic boycott movement against Israel in the German school, college and educational labor union GEW.”Jewish human rights organizations and the heads of German Jewish communities have denounced Glanz as an antisemite. Glanz termed the allegation of antisemitism “absurd.” He declined to answer specific Post questions about his views toward Jews and Israel.The NGO Association against Antisemitism in the city of Kassel, in the German state of Hesse, published an open letter to the GEW Hesse in 2015, complaining about the GEW-Hesse’s continuing education trip to Israel with the anti-Israel activist Fuad Hamdan, who defended Hamas attacks on Israel during Operation Cast Lead in 2009.Hamdan has said that “Israel’s politics remind him of the apartheid system in South Africa.” The association called for the GEW to end the Anti-Israel program with Hamdan.
Post queries to Marlis Tepe, the president of the federal GEW, were not returned. Maike Rademaker, a spokeswoman for the German trade union federation – the rough equivalent of Histadrut – declined to respond to several Post queries.

<title>Hotovely slams former Foreign Ministry D-G for working against Israel abroad</title>
<date>14/1/2016</date>
<content>
Former Foreign Ministry director-general Alon Liel’s efforts on behalf of  anti-Israel activists while cynically using his status as a former senior  Israeli diplomat is a stain on Israel’s foreign service, Deputy Foreign Minister  Tzipi Hotovely said on Wednesday.Hotovely’s comments came in response to  a Yediot Aharonot report on Wednesday that quoted Liel as encouraging Breaking  the Silence activists at a meeting last month to continue their efforts against  Israel abroad, saying that only the type of international pressure that was once  brought to bear on South Africa would get Israel to “end the  occupation.”




Liel is a former ambassador to South Africa, and compared  the Breaking the Silence activists to Jews who worked on behalf of Nelson  Mandela to upend apartheid, often at the price of being condemned by friends and  family.Liel served as Foreign Ministry director-general from November  2000 to April 2001 in the waning months of Ehud Barak’s premiership under  then-foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami.Liel told the Breaking the Silence  gathering that it was easier to fight Israel at the UN and the EU, than  bilaterally.“States cannot fight [bilaterally] with Israel. Not France,  not Britain, not the US, because of the consensus here, and because of the  determination and willingness to pay the price. Bibi [Netanyahu] was willing to  go to Congress [last March] and fight with [US President Barack] Obama, and  nothing happened.According to a secret tape of the meeting, Liel  described a scenario whereby Israel could eventually get kicked out of the UN,  as South Africa once was.“Every article of yours, every meeting with  politicians can reach the public, and reach some head of state who will give  directions on whether to vote for or against,” he said, adding that he did not  see another way to move Israel, since “the political system is lost.”He  claimed that Breaking the Silence has the support of 2 percent of the population  who are “the most moral, wisest people who are able to see 20 years forward, and  were not brainwashed by right-wing messianic propaganda.”Liel in the  past lobbied Brazil against accepting former settlement leader Dani Dayan as  Israel’s ambassador, and has worked toward getting parliaments in Europe to  recognize a Palestinian state.Hotovely said that Liel “forgot his  obligation to the country, and – to our regret – has turned into an active  helper for forces who want to harm Israel.”
She said his “active efforts  in the ranks of those who want to boycott Israel, and his efforts in the  diplomatic arena while cynically using his status as a former diplomat, stains  the Israeli foreign service and works in the ranks of the Israel-haters.”

<title>In Palestinian city of the future, few residents and charges of collusion with Israel</title>
<date>21/1/2016</date>
<content>
RAWABI, West Bank — Bashar Masri is not your typical billionaire real estate developer.Born in the Palestinian city of Nablus in 1961, as a teenager Masri was apprehended and jailed by Israel eight times for throwing rocks and organizing demonstrations, the first time when he was 14 years old. During the first intifada, he served as a conduit between the uprising’s leadership and the Palestine Liberation Organization, then based in Tunisia. He later grew close with Yasser Arafat. When the late Palestinian leader touched down in Washington for the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, Masri says he was the one who opened the airplane door.




Now, after having spent much of his early life resisting the Israeli 'occupation,' Masri stands accused of colluding with it.Masri is the developer of Rawabi (Arabic for “The Hills”), a high-tech city of gleaming apartment buildings rising from the West Bank hills north of Ramallah. Hailed as a linchpin of the future Palestinian state, the city has drawn visits from US Secretary of State John Kerry and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, as well as support from an array of American Jewish groups, including AIPAC and the Anti-Defamation League.But to some in the Palestinian community, the very idea of Rawabi is a betrayal. These critics say building a modern, comfortable Palestinian city serves merely to normalize the Israeli 'occupation' of the West Bank — a charge Masri rejects out of hand. If it were not Palestinians building on those hills, he says, it would be Israeli settlers.“A project like Rawabi that may appear to some as sugarcoating the occupation,” Masri said, “is in reality defying the occupation.”Rawabi is the largest real estate project in Palestinian history and, according to Masri, the first new Palestinian city in 1,000 years. Situated on 1,600 acres, it is home to a 20,000-seat amphitheater, has created 6,000 jobs in construction and engineering and, Masri estimates, will create another 5,000 in the next 10 years in retail, health and other sectors. Masri says he is in talks with major technology companies in an effort to lure them to open offices in Rawabi.The first phase of construction alone has cost $1.2 billion, a third of which was funded by Masri’s company, Massar International, and the remainder by the Qatari government. Ultimately, Rawabi will encompass over 6,000 apartments and house approximately 30,000 residents.Despite those ambitions, however, the project has been beset with delays. Masri waited four years for the Israeli government to provide access to water and approve an access road, which even now remains too narrow to serve the projected population.The Palestinian Authority has also not stepped up, Masri says, despite initial promises to fund and support the project. The city’s three schools and medical clinic are all privately funded, as is the sewage and water system. Rawabi is the only Palestinian city with its own fiber optic network — also privately funded.“We believe the Palestinian Authority should have seen the project as a top priority and should have supported it … by building a school, by building a road, building a clinic, building the sewage treatment, building a water tank,” Masri said. “Unfortunately, their contribution so far has been zero when it comes to funding.”The first phase of Rawabi consists of 1,300 apartments — only 637 are ready, and only 140 of those are occupied. The first “Rawabians” were supposed to move in a year ago, but with the water and road delays, they only moved in this August.According to Masri, political unrest in recent months led to Israeli checkpoints on area roads, which deterred buyers worried they might have trouble reaching their jobs in nearby cities if they moved in. Such concerns are part of the reason Masri is trying to establish Rawabi as an IT hub and why he has billed it as a place to “live, work and grow” — not as a bedroom community where people live but work elsewhere.“Sales have slowed down because of the political situation,” said Masri, looking sadly out his window at the construction cranes and workers that are operating six days a week to finish the project. “People are concerned that this is not the right time to make a move, not the right time to borrow such big loans. It’s upsetting for us. Because of the political situation, we could not celebrate the first people moving in.”Units range in price from $70,000 to $500,000 — cheaper, Masri says, than nearby Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, which lacks Rawabi’s amenities.What might also be keeping people from buying and moving in is the harsh criticism Rawabi has received from the Palestinian community. In order to get Rawabi off the ground, Masri had to cooperate with Israeli government officials, enlist the help of Israeli advisers and work with Israeli contractors.That opened Masri to charges he was undermining calls for a boycott of Israel. The Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions National Committee has accused Masri of “normalization with Israel that helps it whitewash its ongoing occupation, colonization and apartheid against the Palestinian people.” Wasel Abu Yousef, a senior Palestinian official, told Al-Monitor that “all Palestinian factions” should be boycotting Israel, “including Rawabi.”To Masri, the criticism is absurd.“They know damn well we don’t have a choice. There is not a single Palestinian home built in Palestine that does not have Israeli products,” he said, incredulously. “Eighty-five percent of the cement in all of Palestine — in all of the West Bank and Gaza — is coming from Israel. In the West Bank, all of our electricity is from Israel.”Where Masri draws the line is cooperating with settlements. Israeli companies working to develop Rawabi signed a contract vowing not to use settlement products, which has angered right-wing Israeli lawmakers.Basim Dodin, 55, who with his wife, Asma, was among the first buyers to move to Rawabi, has heard the criticism as well. Friends have asked why he was going to live in an Israeli town and charged that the development is an Israeli government project, but Dodin was undeterred.“Our economy is strongly linked to the Israeli economy,” Dodin said. “So what’s wrong if we have cooperation with Israeli companies in building this city and benefit from the Israeli experience and technology in building such a city?”Despite the obstacles and criticism, Masri considers his project a huge success.
“I’m very hopeful of Rawabi, just like I’m hopeful of the Palestinian state,” Masri said. “It will happen; it’s just a matter of time. We can speed it up also, and Rawabi is part of the speedup.”

<title>Interior Ministry keeping BDS leader Barghouti from leaving country</title>
<date>10/5/2016</date>
<content>
The Interior Ministry refused to renew Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)  movement founder Omar Barghouti’s travel documents, a Population, Immigration  and Borders Authority spokesman confirmed Tuesday.Barghouti spends much  of his time traveling the world to campaign for boycotts of Israel, but is  unable to leave the country without the travel documents a permanent resident  carries.




“Interior Minister Arye Deri announced a month ago that he is  considering canceling [Barghouti’s] permanent residence status,” the PIBA  statement said. “In addition, it turns out that, recently the center of his life  apparently has been not in Israel, but in Ramallah.”The Interior  Ministry has, since the start of the last wave of terrorism, revoked  citizenship, and permanent residence status from noncitizens who abetted  terrorists.Barghouti was born in Qatar, grew up in Egypt and married an  Israeli- Arab woman, gaining permanent residence status. He is a doctoral  candidate at Tel Aviv University and has lived in Jaffa and Acre, according to  media reports.He founded the BDS movement in 2005 and supports the end  of the State of Israel and the creation of one state between the Jordan River  and the Mediterranean Sea, in which Palestinians from all over the world will  have the right to live, and Jews will be a small minority.Barghouti  often compares Israel to apartheid in South Africa and to the Nazis, and has  generally refused to cooperate with Israelis, even if they are sympathetic to  his cause. In fact, he has said Palestinians who engaged with Israelis have  “moral blindness,” calling them “clinically delusional” in a 2005  article.The BDS founder does not speak to the Israeli press and ignored  past requests for comment from The Jerusalem Post.Barghouti told AFP on  Tuesday that he was never based in Ramallah, saying: “I reside with my family in  our home in Acre. I’ve had Israeli permanent residency for almost 23 years, in  accordance with the law and without any violations.”He also said he was  prevented from attending two events in California in recent weeks, addressing  them by Skype.
“Israel is imposing this travel ban on me, demonizing me  and threatening me to intimidate me into silence,” Barghouti said, according to  AFP.

<title>Irish councilor calls to throw out iPads in wake of Israel boycott motion</title>
<date>4/10/2016</date>
<content>
The Irish district council of Derry and Strabane approved a motion, by majority vote, to back a campaign to boycott Israeli goods in solidarity with Palestinians, Thursday. Derry City and Strabane is a district in the northwest of Northern Ireland. In 2014 the council area had a population of roughly 150,000 people which totals approximately 8.1% of the population of Northern Ireland.

Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician Gary Middleton, a critic of the motion, lashed out saying that if they were serious about the boycott then the councilors should give up their iPads as Apple uses Israeli-manufactured flash memory components, the BBC reported. "I think we all realize the huge role that the research and development sector within Israel plays.""The iPhone I'm using, the iPads the council use, they all use components that come out of Israel," Mr. Middleton stated.He added that the motion raises serious issues of discrimination and that he would put the question to the first minister of Ireland. Sinn Féin councilor Jackson, who initiated the proposal, replied saying that Middleton's comments were "nonsensical" and added that "the motion itself was symbolic" and has succeeded in raising awareness. DUP councilor Drew Thompson, who opposed the motion, stated that he had never heard "anyone talk about the rights of the Israeli people," the bi-weekly newspaper Derry Journal reported. Adding that "boycotts cause division and make matters worse."Councillors in favor of the proposal likened the motion to previous campaigns to end apartheid in South Africa. Councillor Jackson stated that the "campaign is a non violent response to the Israeli apartheid and occupation. It is inspired by the South Africa Anti-Apartheid movement.”Sinn Féin is the largest Irish republican political party and has been  accused by the Irish as well as the US Governments of being linked, or  at least "closely associated" with the Irish Republican Army (IRA), a  proscribed terrorist group in the UK and illegal in the Republic of  Ireland. Sinn Féin refutes these allegations. A US special envoy to Northern Ireland in 2005  condemned Sinn Féin's links to the IRA, saying "it is hard to understand  how a European country in the year 2005 can have a private army  associated with a political party."In 2005, a peace treaty was  signed by the British and the Northern Irish to end hostilities and  terrorism and almost a decade later, citizens of Northern Ireland are  still searching for ways to cope with the trauma caused by, what was  affectionately known as, “The Troubles.” The name for the  ethno-nationalist conflict that erupted in the late 1960s between mainly  Protestant Unionists and the mainly Catholic Irish nationalists which  has left the country divided politically as well as physically. During  the conflict segregation walls were erected to separate Protestants and  Catholics in urban interface areas such as Belfast, Derry and Portadown.

(Credit: Reuters)The conflict resulted in approximated 3,500 deaths and a total of 50,000+ casualties. There are roughly over 100 of theses walls, termed "peace lines," still  erect. 
According to a study by the University of Ulster 69% of  residents who live behind the segregation walls "maintain that they are  necessary because of the potential for violence."

<title>Israeli Arabs warn gov't: Razing Beduin settlement is 'declaration of war'</title>
<date>30/3/2016</date>
<content>
Thousands of Arabs protested across the country on Wednesday to mark the 40th annual Land Day with a major event held in the Negev where community leaders threatened resistance to government plans to destroy an unrecognized Beduin village.The two main events were held in the unrecognized illegal Beduin settlement of Umm al-Hiran in the Negev and in the northern town of Arrabe. Smaller demonstrations took place in the northern localities of Sakhnin, Deir Hanna, and Kafr Kana. 




The first test could come if the government moves to implement the Supreme Court approval of the demolition of Umm al-Hiran and the eviction of its residents in order to build a Jewish town called Hiran.“Destroying Umm al-Hiran would be a declaration of war against Arabs of the Negev,” Joint List MK Ahmad Tibi told The Jerusalem Post at the event in the Beduin village.“Umm al-Hiran is the prototype of apartheid,” said the deputy speaker of the Knesset and Ta’al party chairman, adding that Arabs could take the matter of the village to the UN.Joint List MK and Balad head Jamal Zahalka told the Post that “if Israeli authorities try to expel the residents from the village there will be a confrontation and people will come from all over the country to defend it.”Zahalka emphasized that a stand had to be made in Umm al-Hiran since if it falls quietly, the government would move on to destroy other villages.Joint List chairman Ayman Odeh told the Post that it is unconscionable that the government would destroy an Arab village and replace it with a Jewish one. “It would be a terrible crime,” he asserted.“Arab villages have no roads, no water and electricity, no education system. Opposite the villages are sparkling lights of Jewish settlements and isolated farms. I have no other name for this thing except apartheid," said Odeh.Land Day is held March 30 every year to commemorate the deaths, in the 1976 riots, of six Galilee Arabs over a government decision to confiscate land. The Arab Higher Monitoring Committee had decided that Israeli Arabs would protest and hold a general strike because of government house demolitions and the threat of the threat of the evacuation of unrecognized illegal Beduin settlements in the Negev.Salim Abu Al-Kian, the head of the committee of the unrecognized villages of Umm al-Hiran and Atir, told the Post that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “needs to recognize our settlement” to demonstrate “we are equal citizens.”“Don’t destroy our homes to bring Jews. We will fight until the end,” he warned.Asked if the residents of Umm al-Hiran would accept a compromise solution, he responded that it could be possible if the government first recognized the village and then negotiated over its size. Local Sheikh Halil Abu El-Kian said that destroying the village shows there is “no democracy and no law.” Asked what would happen if the government starts destroying structures, he responded, “They destroy, we build.”Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, released a report to mark Land Day, arguing that the government exacerbated the housing shortage in Arab towns.It said that the government made most efforts to reduce housing prices in Jewish and mixed areas. The report also said that 38,095 housing units were tendered for building in Jewish and mixed communities compared to 1,835 in Arab communities.Raed Salah, the leader of the banned northern branch of the Islamic Movement was also in attendance and, as is usual, railed about the Al-Aksa Mosque on the Temple Mount.The Higher Committee, which coordinates Arab political action, is made up of Arab MKs, municipal leaders and other community figures and is headed by former Hadash chairman Mohammad Barakeh.A knowledgeable source from the Arab sector told the Post on Tuesday that there was a fierce internal battle over where to hold the main event and that the Higher Monitoring Committee pushed for the events to be held in Sakhnin and Arrabe.However, the source continued, “the younger generation prefers the main protest to be held in the Negev where the biggest fight is going on over the land of the unrecognized Beduin village of Umm al-Hiran, which is threatened with destruction.”The younger generation is more prone to activism and people who have their homes threatened are more emotional, said the source, adding that the battle has pitted communist Hadash against nationalist Balad, with the latter focusing on protests in the Negev.Arik Rudnitzky, the project manager of the Konrad Adenauer Program at the Moshe Dayan Center of Tel Aviv University, told the Post on Wednesday that “Hadash would like to have the protest associated with past events, with the ‘traditional’ story of the Land Day in the Iron Triangle - Sakhnin, Arrabeh, and Deir Hanna.”
“Balad wants to connect the event to current developments, especially in places where the same government policies of the historic land day are implemented. This is the case of the Negev, from this point of view,” explained Rudnitzky.

<title>BDS on campus: the current discussions</title>
<date>1/8/2016</date>
<content>
While the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction (BDS) movement against Israel has picked up steam in recent years on campuses across the US, those observing the phenomenon may have come to ask themselves what draws activists to one side or the other of the issue. The BDS movement encourages economic and cultural boycotts of Israel in an effort to advance their pro-Palestinian political demands while isolating the Jewish state. 





As the heated debate on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict rages, a mix of Jewish, Israeli and Palestinian students from US colleges sat down with The Jerusalem Post to discuss the escalation of the BDS student movement, and their involvement in the campaign or the battle against it. With such contentious discourse surrounding the conflict, here is a breakdown of some of the major sticking points in the emotion-packed dispute that has taken American institutions of higher education by storm.The labelsAre the 'pro-Israel' and 'anti-Israel' labels mutually exclusive with the 'pro-Palestinian' and 'anti-Palestinian' ones?Not necessarily. Whether the discussion is about identifying with or defining the actions of one side or the other, such labels and the underlying stances they encapsulate have become increasingly more complicated to define for both sides. With controversial issues like religion, security, human rights, and apartheid--all issues that have come up when discussing BDS--there is a vast spectrum of positions regarding the Israeli-Palestinian issue. 
When asked about labels regarding the conflict, most students interviewed agreed that labels do more to confuse students and drift them away from the actual issue.“I think my labels are relatively accurate, though these terms can mean different things for different people,” Jason Epstein of the University of Texas at Austin told JPost. “Some will skew these definitions to align with their political views, some will skew these to bash the other side, and some may focus these definitions on a group of people, rather than a country.” For American University student Noa Banayan, these labels create further division that deter from peace. With an Israeli father, she said, “I’m pro the culture and my family, but I’m not against anything or another people. I’m just pro-peace. These labels create a bigger division that isn’t going to lead to peace.”For many students, when discussing Israel’s actions, the issue comes down to human rights and security. Some students, like Jessica Markowitz from New York University, feel as though siding with the pro-Israel platform means, “supporting Israel and its decisions and advocating for its needs and safety.”On the other hand, for Palestinian-American student, who asked to be called Leila as she plans on visiting the Palestinian territories soon, being pro-Israel can mean anything from “complacency, pro-occupation, illegal settlements, and impunity” to individuals “who genuinely believe in self-determination and who desperately want to see Israel improve itself as a country, to uphold international standards and respect human rights policies.”It goes both ways, and labeling the issue only escalates the tensions, misunderstandings and controversy spewing from the BDS conversation.  
 
The movementsThe most notable form of dialogue on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been facilitated through student activist groups such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), J Street U and Students for Justice and Palestine (SJP). Although they allow for discussions of the conflict, student groups continue to be polarized, which often creates a one-sided and unproductive conversation, especially regarding BDS.
For student Leila being a part of SJP entails being an activist and voice for her Palestinian community. She said that the mission of SJP at her school is “to stand in solidarity with the demands of the Palestinian people and support their basic human right to self determination.” 
For University of Michigan student Lauren Siegel, her involvement with student groups also comes down to her “deep connection to Israel” and belief that student support outside of Israel is “vital to the survival of the State.”For others, like Gabriella Levy from American University where political and social activism drives the student body, this conversation seems to be the most taboo. She said, “I feel like [the conflict is] one of the only things that I would not necessarily feel comfortable bringing up depending on who I’m with.” 
 
College campus BDSUnderstanding the roots of activist movements on each side is just as essential to the conversation as learning about the conflict. For some students, BDS has had a direct impact on their daily lives. A report released by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), titled BDS on ‘American College Campuses: 2014-15 Year-In-Review,’ cited studies that showed 520 explicitly anti-Israel events and programs took place nationwide on college campuses, representing a 30% increase from the previous academic year, and that over 50% of those events focused on various aspects of the BDS movement.In the same report, the ADL released a list of 19 universities that considered divestment resolutions or referenda this year, including the results of these votes. Included in the list are prestigious schools, such as Stanford and Northwestern--two colleges where the student governments decided to pass a BDS resolution. Others on the list, like University of Texas at Austin, Princeton University and University of Michigan, either came close to passing a boycott resolution or passed referenda similar to or associated with the BDS movement.For University of Texas at Austin student Sam Reichstein, the topic of the BDS movement has become all too familiar, as BDS legislation was pushed for on UT’s campus through its Student Government, though ended up losing in the spring of 2015. Recalling this moment in her campus’s history, Samantha felt nervous and worried, and at times unsafe wearing an Israeli t-shirt or a Hebrew necklace.
For Josh Woznica, head of the Jewish Student Union at Berkeley University, who attends a school that has been known for its strong anti-Israel sentiments and successful BDS movements, the feeling is similar, and added that he feels that BDS is not conducive to any product dialogue.
Leila said, however, that, BDS is “one of the main peaceful means of protest that appeals to conscience and employs non-violent measures,” so groups on campus should continue to be allowed to advocate for the movement.
The media and educationWhile the amount of formal discussion in classrooms on the topic varies by campus, those who have not visited the Middle East or lack personal ties to the conflict are generally misinformed by the media.What adds to the contention on campuses is that the majority of students seem to know, or care, relatively little about the conflict.As Woznica said, “It’s to get the sort of 70% of students who really know nothing about the conflict and walk by and see a demonstration or a protest--it’s to really get them to understand the conflict.” In response to this indifference and misinformation, some students suggest speaking to actual Palestinians and Israelis who have lived and spent time in the region, and others go further to recommend that courses on the conflict be required on campus. 
 
Future possibilitiesWhether genuine dialogue on the Middle East conflict  is possible depends largely on the students who choose to engage; most students are hopeful that it is. “The only way to bring new ideas to light is to keep talking about the conflict. Strong dialogue is the best way to inform and be informed,” said American University student Niv Avneri.
On the center of his campus, Woznica has witnessed small groups of students come and sit down and discuss. Though it often becomes very personal, and naturally so, “at least they’re hearing each other’s sides on a one-to-one basis,” he said.
Leila pointed to a critical matter, stating, “To overcome the differences that exist between the opposing sides, one must be brave enough to confront the ugly and brutal realities that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict produces both in the Middle East and here in the United States.”
“We cannot continue to silence critical debates because of fear for this coming at the expense of ‘civility,” she added.

<title>US accuses Israel of expropriating 2,342 dunams in the Jordan Valley</title>
<date>15/3/2016</date>
<content>
The US accused Israel of expropriating land in the Jordan Valley after it reclassified as state land 234 hectares (578 acres) near Jericho.“This decision is, in our view, the latest step in what appears to be an ongoing process of land expropriations, settlement expansions, and legalizations of outposts that is fundamentally undermining the prospects for a two-state solution,” US State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in Washington.




The United Nations, the United Kingdom, France and Germany also condemned the reclassification of the property located in Area C of the West Bank within the boundaries of the Megilot Regional Council.There will be a 45-day appeals process.The reclassification does not change existing use, but it does pave the way for Israel to develop the mostly empty desert terrain on both sides of Route 1 as it heads down to the Dead Sea.The large tract of land includes 150 hectares (371 acres) whose reclassification was first reported in January and similarly condemned.On Tuesday Kirby told reporters in Washington: “We strongly oppose any steps that accelerate settlement expansion, which raise serious questions about Israel’s longterm intentions. And as we’ve repeatedly made clear, we continue to look to both sides to demonstrate with actions and policies a genuine commitment to a two-state solution. Actions such as these do just the opposite.”The Palestinians have argued that settlement activity is a stumbling block to the peace process. Israel holds that such activity has no impact and that the true barrier is the Palestinian refusal to hold direct talks to negotiate a two-state solution.In order to arrive at a two-state solution, Kirby said, “you’ve got to have both sides willing to take the steps necessary to ratchet down the violence, to tone down the rhetoric, and through policy and decisions and actual actions move that process forward. It has to start there. It has to start organically.”“Thus far, we haven’t seen that. We haven’t seen decisions get made to propel that process forward, and that’s what we continue to want to see,” Kirby said.Leaders on both sides have to “make tough decisions and be willing to compromise,” Kirby said as he chastised both the Israelis and the Palestinians.The United Kingdom’s Foreign Office on Wednesday said that “such steps clearly damage the diminishing prospects for a two-state solution.”“The UK and our international partners have consistently called for an end to settlement expansion, which is illegal under international law and an obstacle to peace. If the Israeli government is truly committed to a two-state solution, then it will reverse its decision,” the Foreign Office said.“This decision sends a wrong signal at the wrong time,” the German Foreign Ministry said.“Especially in the current tense situation, both parties in the Middle East conflict are called on to take steps for a deescalation and to find ways that lead to an urgently needed resumption of peace negotiations,” it said.In Paris, Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said France is “extremely concerned.”In a sharply worded statement United Nations Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon’s spokesman said that the reclassification is “an impediment to the two-state solution.”“Such actions appear to point toward an increase in settlement activity and demonstrate that Israel is continuing to push forward in the consolidation of its control of the West Bank,” Ban said in a statement his press secretary read out at the noon briefing in New York.“The secretary-general urges the government of Israel to halt and reverse such actions in the interest of a just and comprehensive peace and a just and final-status agreement,” the spokesman said.The Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday had no response to the condemnations.On Tuesday the Office of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories said in response: “In accordance with the decision of the political level and the examining of the professional authorities, 2,342 dunams [234.2 hectares] have been declared as state land.”The Civil Administration’s Head of Government Property signed the decision on March 10, as US Vice President Joe Biden left Israel after a two-day visit, according to the NGO Peace Now which monitors Jewish building over the pre-1967 lines.During Biden’s 2010 visit, plans were advanced for 1,600 new apartment units in the east Jerusalem Jewish neighborhood of Ramat Shlomo. News of those plans broke while Biden was in Israel and cast a pall over his visit. This time, news of the Jordan Valley reclassification, which was first publicized by Army Radio, broke well after Biden was back in Washington.In Washington, Kirby had no comment with regard to the timing of the announcement.According to Peace Now, some of the reclassified property is already in use along Route 1 for road-side stands and restaurants. This includes the landmark gas station and rest stop Almog Al Haderech.There is a plan to expand tourism and trade opportunities in the area that was awaiting the land reclassification, Peace Now said.Some of the land is located within the boundaries of the Almog settlement, which can now move forward on a plan to build 358 new homes, according to Peace Now.The reclassification concludes a study by the Civil Administration into the ownership of the property, much of which was already assumed to be state land.Megilot Regional Council spokeswoman said she had not comment on the matter. But former Megilot Regional Council head Mordechai Dahman said the issue of the reclassification had been in the works for over three decades.The Civil Administration “kept checking and rechecking” the whole issue of property ownership, he said.PLO Secretary-General Saeb Erekat condemned the reclassification.It is part of Israel’s “plan to impose an apartheid regime in occupied Palestine,” he said.“Israel, the occupying power, continues its colonial project by maintaining its belligerent occupation and by annexing more Palestinian lands throughout the occupied West Bank, including the Jordan Valley,” he said.Erekat noted that the Palestinian leadership was informed of the decision while France’s special envoy Pierre Vimont was visiting Ramallah to discuss plans to jump-start the peace process by holding an international conference this summer.The US denounced the reclassification of the initial 371 acres. In the past, it has said that it opposes settlement activity including at the planning level.

<title>Israel trying to 'bribe' Hollywood stars with Oscar 'swag bag,' BDSers say</title>
<date>10/2/2016</date>
<content>
Pro-Palestinian supporters who advocate a boycott of Israel urged Hollywood A-listers nominated for Oscars to reject an all-expenses paid trip to the Holy Land funded by the Israeli government.Advocates of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement reacted to news that Oscar nominees in the acting and directing categories at this month’s Academy Awards will be given a 10-day, first-class trip to Israel valued at $55,000, included among other goodies in their $200,000 gift bag.




The list of nominees features powerhouses and blockbuster draws, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jennifer Lawrence, Sylvester Stallone, Christian Bale and Kate Winslet."These are the most senior people in the film industry in Hollywood and leading opinion-formers who we are interested in hosting here in Israel so that they will experience the country first hand and not through the media,” Tourism Minister Yariv Levin said. “If they do indeed accept the invitation, their visit will have enormous resonance among millions of fans and followers, including social media. The very fact that they are considering visiting Israel places the option in the public discourse in the social and professional circles in which the stars move." The gift raised the hackles of Israel critics who say that the initiative is aimed at promoting “Zionist propaganda” among celebrities.“Israel is desperately trying to fight its increasing international isolation through bribes and intimidation rather than by ending its occupation and apartheid,” Omar Barghouti, a prominent BDS proponent, said."There are no Hunger Games in Gaza but there is real hunger," he added.The Hunger Games trilogy catapulted the career of Lawrence.
In addition to their Mediterranean escape at five-star hotels with likely full bodyguard protection, nominees like Cate Blanchett and DiCaprio (who has already received the bodyguard treatment on a previous visit with then-girlfriend Bar Refaeli), will receive swag like a 15-day walking tour of Japan ($45,000), a laser skin-tightening procedure ($5,500) and a lifetime supply of skin creams from Lizora ($31,000), according to a press release from Distinctive Assets, the company that puts together the luxurious gift bags.

<title>Jerusalem culture: Stepping into the station</title>
<date>12/4/2016</date>
<content>
Mfon Akpan comes from the melting pot of New  York, but Jerusalem has left an impression on her.“To come to see this  part of the world and the religious sites, it was breathtaking,” she  says.




A biochemistry major, she learned step dance at State University of  New York, and is the artistic director of Step Afrika!, which is performing in  Israel this week. “It’s our second day here and the energy is great. I didn’t  have any concerns about coming,” says Akpan.The nine-member dance group  performed at Jerusalem’s First Station Monday to a crowd of 200. It is part of  an initiative by the US Embassy to bring cultural exchange events to Israel.  Tuesday they will be performing at Haifa’s Krieger Center and will visit Kafr  Yasif and Kibbutz Mirza.“This venue at the First Station is new and it’s  a place that is progressive and has the kind of diversity and cohesion and  tolerance that matches our goals,” said Bill Murad, director of the American  Center, before the performance began.The diverse attendance was clear  from the crowd, which included off-duty soldiers, families, religiously  observant and Arabs.As the performers warmed up, dressed in black shirts  and blue jeans, C. Brian Williams, the founder of the company, watched from  afar. From Houston, he learned step dance in his Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity at  Howard University, a traditionally African-American college. But it was South  Africa that transformed college fun into a life-long mission.While in  Lesotho in 1991, during the last years of apartheid, he saw a boy doing a local  “gumboot” dance. Three years later, working with a dance theater group in  Soweto, one of the most infamous townships of the apartheid era, he founded Step  Afrika! “Our root is cultural exchange and artistic exchange. I love the arts  and I love travel and to combine that in Step Afrika!, to share dance  forms.”Working through a combination of loud stomping or stepping and  clapping, Williams describes the dance as deeply rooted in African-American  culture in the US. “We convert the body and the floor into a drum,” Williams  explains. When the drum was banned during the slavery era in the US, slaves  replaced it by turning the body into an instrument.But it was Greek-life  or fraternity culture among African-Americans that turned it into it’s current  art form.As the performance got going the audience was encouraged to  participate through clapping and supporting one of the teams of dancers as they  had mini danceoffs with each other. Seeking to encourage the audience to  chip-in, one of the dancers, named Brittny Smith, described the routines as a  mixture of love, pride and community.“Today we are all sort of the same  community so when you see something you like, do what you want to do – clap and  yell and stomp; the more energy you give us, we will give back to  you.”Later, as the sun began to dip beneath the trees lining the  railroad tracks that give the First Station its name, the performers put on the  almost knee-high “gumboots” that have their origins in the South African mines.  With bandanas and almost looking like African-American members of a cowboy ring,  the men and women sang songs and gave memory to the days of grueling work in  South Africa’s mines.For Williams the concept is not just to bring  cultures together, but to introduce the world to this American art form. “All my  dancers are American and are college graduates and not necessarily in  dance. They love the art.” With degrees in journalism, graphic design and  media, the dancers come from all across the US, and have all the qualifications  to be running a newspaper, if not for committing years of their life to  this.Audience members enjoyed the experience, with some of the younger  children joining the dancers to learn the steps. Katheina Vasilliadis from  Machol Shalem, a dance house in Jerusalem which helped host the group, thought  this event accomplished its goal of building bridges and working with the local  community.
For Williams and his dancers, who are experiencing Jerusalem  and Israel for the first time, the concept of cultural exchange overrides any  political issues here. “I love that people can be different; in spite of the  differences that exist, with cross cultural communication. We see how  similar we are in art and when people move beyond that, who knows what is  possible; it’s good to be beyond the media reports.”

<title>Jewish disunity: Public figures nationwide discuss its dangers</title>
<date>13/8/2016</date>
<content>
A host of public figures including academics, authors, journalists, politicians  and social activists held meetings across the country on Saturday night to  discuss the abiding challenge of Jewish disunity and the concept of “the center  and the extremes” in Jewish society, past and present.The Sderot  Conference for Society and Sapir Academic College staged the evening of debates  and discussions on the eve of the Tisha Be’av fast. Readings of the Book of  Lamentations, traditionally read on the eve of the fast, were also  staged.




One of the participants was Shivi Froman, a social activist,  teacher, and son of the late champion of coexistence Rabbi Menachem Froman, who  spoke at an event in the capital’s French Hill neighborhood.Talking to  The Jerusalem Post ahead of the event, Froman argued that in a country and  society which is maturing, a certain amount of radicalism and departure from the  mainstream is to be expected.Just as adolescents in the process of  growing up can frequently act in wild, rebellious manner, elements within a  maturing society can act in a similar way, said Froman, explaining that the  country needs to undertake two sets of actions to cope with this  phenomenon.“Firstly, we need to build up the central narrative of our  identity around our common denominator, and that needs to include Jewish,  democratic and pluralist values,” he told the Post.“But we also need to  build a dialogue with the extremes, and we need to find a way to allow space for  the extremes as well.”Froman argued that denying space for elements and  forces at the extremes of society would only exacerbate their extremism, and  demanding that everyone should be “mainstream and politically correct” is itself  a form of extremism and doomed to failure.He said however that it was  necessary to fight “an uncompromising war” against those elements that seek to  physically harm the state.“For example, the Islamic Movement is a  legitimate organization in Israel and we need to allow Arab society to give  expression to its Muslim faith and allow Muslims to organize in this way. But at  the same time we need to wage relentless war against anyone seeking to harm  Israeli state and society, including extremists in the Arab sector.“But  a perspective that all Arab representatives and organizations are illegitimate  is very problematic.”Froman said that another example is the so-called  “hilltop youth,” radical and intensely religious young Jews who seek to  establish new settlement outposts in Judea and Samaria, some of whom have been  accused of violence against Palestinians and other minorities.“Hilltop  youth have a deep faith and love for this land and its connection to the Jewish  people. The language they use is outside of the mainstream, but if someone feels  he can’t express his opinion it will be translated into inclination to kick out,  burn down and, destroy,” Froman said.“We need to think about how we can  give an attentive ear and a place to their positions,” he continued, while again  emphasizing the importance of preventing harmful actions MK Yossi Yonah of the  Zionist Union, who also spoke in Jerusalem, at an event in Baka, emphasized the  need for different societal groups to take responsibility for Israel as a whole,  and to therefore compromise on their desires and goals.The lawmaker said  in particular that the Israeli Left has accepted to a large extent the need to  include settlement blocs inside Israel’s borders in any future two-state  solution, and warned that those seeking territorial maximalism would be biting  off more than the country can chew.“We’re letting the extreme rightwing  lead us into the abyss. Out of concern for the future, I am afraid that due to  this perspective we will be in danger of either having a binational state or on  the other hand having an apartheid state, neither of which anyone wants,” said  Yonah.The MK said that it was the responsibility of the Center and  Center Left to emphasize to the public the dangers of such outcomes.“We  might compromise a sovereign Jewish state if we continue on like this. I’m not  saying the Palestinians aren’t also responsible for the current stalemate, but  we need to take responsibility too.”Yonah also highlighted the large  socioeconomic gaps as another serious challenge facing the nation, as well as  “the growing influence of capitalist and neoliberal ideologies” which he said  were responsible for a growing lack of tolerance for the notion of societal  responsibility.“We have solidarity against external threats, such as  terrorism, but regarding the economic plight of other citizens there is growing  indifference and a lack of concern, and this lack of social solidarity worries  me a lot.”Yonah said that “creating a more homogeneous society glued  together by common values and heritage and future goals” was the only way to  create a greater sense of such social solidarity.Author, lecturer and  novelist Yochi Brandes spoke at an event in Ariel. Speaking to the Post, she  highlighted what she believes to be the decreasing rigidity with which the  majority of Jewish Israelis view their Judaism and their observance of the  religion.She noted that in the past, there was a very definitive group  of secular Israelis who were uninterested in religion whatsoever, but said that  in the last 20 years this had begun to change.“Young people don’t  necessarily like to learn about Judaism, but they do want to observe some of the  religious practices, they are okay with integrating different aspects of  religion into their lives, they take a bit from their grandmother, a bit from  experiences they had in India perhaps,” said Brandes.She described this  phenomenon as “the victory of Mizrahiut,” the attitude toward religion which  many Middle Eastern Jews in Israel have adopted, where religious life is  observed but in a more relaxed manner than strictly observant Jews have  done.“This kind of Judaism without the requirement for group affiliation  has taken hold, and I think the majority of Israeli society is more accepting  and saying ‘I’m a free Jew, I do perform commandments but no one will tell me  how to do so.’” Brandes acknowledged that this sentiment has not yet entered the  political realm, but said that divisiveness in Israel was frequently brought  about by politics itself, as well as by the media.
“But large parts of  Israeli society are not there anymore. People are more relaxed, especially  youth, people don’t want to fight and have an attitude that we are all Jews, we  are all Israelis, and are happy for others to do as they like if they are  allowed to do the same,” she opined.

<title>Jimmy Carter: US must recognize a Palestinian state</title>
<date>29/11/2016</date>

Former US president Jimmy Carter, a frequent and caustic critic of Israel,  joined a host of others this week in trying to lobby US President Barack Obama  to take one final, dramatic step on the Middle East before leaving office in 52  days.Carter, in a New York Times op-ed on Monday, called on Obama to  recognize a Palestinian state.




“I am convinced that the United States can  still shape the future of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before a change in  presidents, but time is very short,” wrote Carter, who in 1978 helped broker an  Egyptian-Israeli peace deal, and in 2006 helped legitimize the use of the term  “apartheid” in reference to Israel with the publication of his book, Palestine:  Peace not Apartheid.“The simple but vital step this administration must  take before its term expires on January 20 is to grant American diplomatic  recognition to the state of Palestine, as 137 countries have already done, and  help it achieve full United Nations membership,” he wrote.Carter argued  that a US recognition of “Palestine” would make it easier for other countries to  do the same, and would “clear the way for a Security Council resolution on the  future of the Israeli Palestinian conflict.”

(Obama urges Israel end occupation and Palestinians accept Israel)He said the Security Council  should pass a resolution laying out the parameters for resolving the conflict,  “reaffirming the illegality of all Israeli settlements beyond the 1967 borders,  while leaving open the possibility that the parties could negotiate  modifications.”Such a resolution should include security guarantees for  both Israel and a Palestinian state, the demilitarization of the Palestinian  state, and a “”possible peacekeeping force under the auspices of the United  Nations.”As Carter’s criticism of Israel over the years has become  increasingly scathing and one-sided, Jerusalem’s policy has been to largely  ignore him. In line with this approach, neither the Prime Minister’s Office nor  the Foreign Ministry had any response on Tuesday to his op-ed.Carter’s  critics have often said that he is “obsessed” with Israel, and that as a result  of this obsession he overlooked as president the radical changes taking place in  Iran that led to the fall of the shah and the establishment of an Islamic  Republic under Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979, something that radically altered the  Middle East landscape.“The primary foreign policy goal of my life has  been to help bring peace to Israel and its neighbors,” Carter wrote in his New  York Times piece.In October, the Times also called on Obama to back a UN  Security Council resolution that would lay down guidelines for a peace  agreement.Israel adamantly opposes such a move, saying that an agreement  cannot be imposed from the outside, but must come out of direct negotiations  between the parties.A UN resolution, Jerusalem believes, would only  harden the Palestinian positions, because they would believe that if they wait  long enough, the world will force Israel to give them what they want.A  number of European governments, as well as various think tanks, are talking with  Obama administration officials, urging them to take some kind of action on the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the waning days of the current  presidency.Among the suggestions are a new UN resolution laying down  parameters for a peace deal; US support for the recognition of “Palestine” in  the UN; or – at the very least – backing or abstaining on an anti-settlement  resolution in the Security Council.Israeli officials consistently  maintain that they do not know what – if anything – Obama has planned. However,  the fact that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continuously says – as he did on  Sunday – that he expects Obama not to divert from traditional US policy on the  matter, is an indication that there remains concern over the matter in  Jerusalem.
For instance, on Sunday, at a memorial ceremony at Mount Herzl  for soldiers killed in the 1956 Sinai Campaign, Netanyahu said, “I expect that  in the twilight of President Obama’s tenure he will stand by what he said in  2011, that the way to achieve peace does not run through Security Council  resolutions, but rather direct negotiations with the Palestinians, which has  been the US position for years.”

<title>Ayelet Shaked: Apply Israeli law to West Bank within 1 year</title>
<date>2/5/2016</date>
<content>
Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said on Sunday that she is pushing to have  Israeli law applied to the West Bank within one year.She stated this at  a conference in Jerusalem organized by the Legal Forum for the Land of Israel  despite vehement opposition to the idea by senior ministry staff, including  former attorney-general Yehuda Weinstein.




“I established a joint  committee along with the Defense Ministry to work on legislation for Judea and  Samaria, the purpose essentially being that, ultimately, any law passed in the  Knesset will either apply to Judea and Samaria by virtue of the legislation  itself, or by an order of the general [the head of the IDF’s Central Command,  who legislates in the West Bank], or by any other manner considered  appropriate,” she explained when asked on stage about the Hok Hanormot  (Normalizing Law) for applying Israeli law to the West Bank.“And I tell  you, second, that as justice minister, I will give this priority. I have  dedicated staff to this, that there should be a real, thought-out legislative  process.... I repeat again that this might be by virtue of a general’s order, as  has been done until now,” she said.“But so far, this has not been done  sufficiently and not promptly enough,” she continued. “Most of the laws are very  narrow. Laws about the environment, about workplace law, do not apply in Judea  and Samaria. And my purpose, ultimately, is by one year from now, every law  passed in the Knesset will automatically be translated either by a general’s  order or by regular legislation into applying to Judea and  Samaria.”Although Shaked mentioned only the West Bank and did not  distinguish the differences that might apply to Jews and Palestinians, past  versions of the law sought to apply Israeli law specifically to Israelis in the  West Bank. The current ambiguity between Jews and Palestinians was one of  Weinstein’s significant objections.MK Tzipi Livni (Zionist Union) said  the path Shaked was taking would lead to a binational state, with a Palestinian  majority in the Knesset.“The right-wing government is quietly beginning  the process of annexation in order to impose its ideology,” she stated. “The  final result will be the collapse of the twostate idea, the imposition of two  legal systems in one state, mass international pressure and, in the end, 2.5  million Palestinians with the right to vote for Knesset.”According to  Livni, the threat of a binational state is “no less dramatic” than that coming  from Iran.“We must continue fighting for a Jewish and democratic state,”  she said.Meretz chairwoman Zehava Gal-On accused Shaked of “combining  annexation and apartheid,” and making Israel “stink” and “a leper” in world  opinion.“The law seeks to make different norms apply to Israeli citizens  no matter where they live, to indirectly apply the State of Israel’s laws to  settlers in the territories through a military order, but in reality, it creates  racial discrimination,” Gal-On said.“Even the previous attorney-  general, Yehuda Weinstein, opposed bills that would apply the Knesset’s laws to  settlements,” she pointed out.“He said these bills harm the status of OC  Central Command, the sovereign in the territories... and give it to the Knesset,  in opposition to the legal framework of laws of war, according to which the area  is managed.”
Recently, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced to the  world that the Golan Heights, which have been under Israeli law since 1981  despite having a status equal to that of the West Bank under international law,  would remain in Israeli hands forever. Politicians and activists on the Right  noted with disappointment that he did not make the same comment about the West  Bank.

<title>Knesset may punish MKs who call to boycott Israel, following JPost report</title>
<date>29/8/2016</date>
<content>
The Knesset House Committee plans to add a punishment for calling for a boycott  of Israel to the legislature’s rulebooks when it returns from its summer recess  at the end of October, following an exclusive report in The Jerusalem Post on MK  Basel Ghattas (Joint List) calling for a boycott and sanctions against Israel in  Montreal earlier this month. House Committee chairman Yoav Kisch (Likud) said he  plans to amend Knesset regulations so that there will be consequences for such  behavior. The proposed change, the details of which Kisch has yet to reveal, was  inspired by Ghattas’s call for a boycott of Israel at the World Social Forum, a  radical left-wing conference in Montreal two weeks ago.




The lawmaker from Balad, one of the four parties that make up the Joint List, called Israel an oppressive, racist and apartheid state. He said he is pessimistic that there will be peace soon, and international sanctions were the most effective way to combat Israel. After the conference, he made similar remarks at several other events in Canada.
“It’s absurd,” Kisch said, “that we are still giving licenses to encourage boycotting Israel to our MKs. MK Ghattas has a license from the Knesset; a license to boycott the state of Israel in his travels around the world. Those licenses must be confiscated.”Kisch said that Ghattas and other Joint List MKs travel the world, incite, encourage boycotts and international sanctions on Israel, and then come back to the country to be members of its parliament.The Likud MK vowed that the House Committee, under his leadership, will “act to change the regulations so that we will be able to punish incitement to boycotting Israel.”Ghattas’s office did not respond to a request for comment.MK Ahmed Tibi (Joint List) said earlier this month that boycotts are a legitimate, non-violent democratic tool accepted around the world, and that limiting calls for boycotts violates the rules of democracy and freedom of expression.“We may and we must boycott the settlements and their products, and we may promote that. The ‘occupation’ deserves to be boycotted,” Tibi asserted.
However, Israel’s longest- serving Arab parliamentarian, former MK Taleb a-Sanaa, took a different tack, responding on Facebook to Ghattas’s speech, according to a translation by B’nai Brith Canada. “If the boycott is the solution, why don’t you resign from the Israeli parliament? And how can you ask the world what you don’t ask of yourself?”

<title>Lapid slams international press group for ‘defending incitement’ to kill Israelis</title>
<date>13/3/2016</date>
<content>
The International Federation of Journalists is defending incitement to murder  Israelis – and not press freedom – by condemning Israel’s closure of an Islamic  Jihad TV station, Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid said Saturday  night.Lapid called for IFJ president Jim Boumelha to apologize for his  organization’s statement on the closure of Falastin al-Yom (Palestine  Today).




“Yesterday, after the channel was closed down, members of the  military wing of Islamic Jihad held a rally protesting the closure. Islamic  Jihad used Palestine Today to incite against Israel and encourage people to  carry out attacks. The manager of station has been convicted of being a member  of Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The connection is so patently obvious that it  calls into question your motives in condemning Israel’s actions,” Lapid  wrote.On Friday, the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency), IDF and Israel  Police shut down Palestine Today in Ramallah, a day after the security cabinet  decided to close Palestinian media outlets that incite terrorism against  Israelis in light of the ongoing Palestinian terrorism. The IDF declared the  channel an illegal organization, using a 1945 emergency law, and security forces  arrested the channel’s manager, 34-yearold Faruk Aliat, an Islamic Jihad  operative who has been imprisoned in Israel in the past.Palestine Today  “calls for carrying out terrorist attacks against the State of Israel and its  citizens. Its messages of incitement are broadcast through the television  channel and spread on the Internet,” the Shin Bet said.IFJ released a  statement Saturday in response that it stands with its affiliate, the  Palestinian Journalists Union, “in condemning this brutal attack against free  press and ask for UN immediate reaction [sic] to the escalation of attacks  against the free press in the occupied territories.”Boumelha added: “We  cannot tolerate these continuous attacks from Israeli authorities to muzzle  Palestinian press. Incitement of terrorism is a dangerous accusation to make  against a media and a decision to close it down cannot occur without due  process.”The IFJ President called on “the UN high commissioner for human  rights and the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the  right to freedom of opinion and expression to investigate violations of press  freedom in Palestine without delay.”Speaking to Army Radio Sunday,  Boumelha emphasized the need for due process and disapproved of the IDF’s use of  British Mandatory laws and shrugged off the military’s coordination with the  judiciary.(Many Israeli laws date from the British Mandate.) As for  Palestine Today’s repeated incitement to violence, Boumelha said he’s  responsible for journalists’ safety and freedom of expression, not for the  content of their work.Lapid pointed out in his letter to Boumelha that  “Israel is a thriving democracy with a thriving press corps that has the  absolute freedom to criticize and investigate.Israel is also home to one  of the largest international press corps in the world and they too operate here  without hindrance.”“However,” Lapid added, “freedom of the press does  not extend to terrorist propaganda and to those who incite to murder. The  content on Palestine Today would not pass the editorial guidelines of any of  your members. I was a journalist for over three decades; this isn’t  journalism. This isn’t free speech, this is hate speech...You are not  defending press freedom; you are defending incitement to murder.”Lapid  urged the IFJ to retract its statement and apologize to families that have been  harmed by Islamic Jihad.Haim Shibi, a member of the Foreign Relations  Committee of the National Federation of Israeli Journalists, accused Boumelha of  “turning the IFJ into a clear anti-Israel propaganda tool, continually  portraying the IDF as an army that hunts journalists, targets them and kills  them.“The man gave up on even appearing to understand Israel’s fight  against terrorism,” Shibi said on Army Radio.“He’s not a fair broker; we  are always the bad ones... [Boumelha] hasn’t been a journalist for a long time  now; he’s a propagandist.”Shibi pointed to research done following the  genocide in Rwanda in the 1990s that showed that media was used to encourage  violence and dehumanize the other side in the conflict.“Sometimes the  media is used to incite murder,” he stated. “[Palestine Today] isn’t journalism,  it is a deadly tool.”Last year, the IFJ suspended the National  Federation of Israeli Journalists, claiming it did not pay its affiliation fee  for three years.Shibi called the claim an excuse: “Jim [Boumelha] kicked  us out with different claims... He just doesn’t want us there. He pushed us into  the corner, like lepers, apartheid- style.”The Israeli journalist also  said Boumelha blocked all efforts for Israeli and Palestinian journalists to  work together. Shibi said he had suggested there be a hotline for Palestinian  journalists to call if they have issues with Israeli forces, but Boumelha said  he would never help it happen.Boumelha wrote in a July 2015 letter to  the Jerusalem Post that the NFIJ’s suspension was solely because of not paying  dues, and that he did not oppose the hotline being set up, but that it did not  get the necessary votes to make it an urgent motion at a European journalists’  meeting.In response, Post columnist Liat Collins noted that Boumelha had  politicized the IFJ and refused to meet with the Israeli affiliates to discuss  the hotline or the fees – even when he visited Ramallah, which is a short drive  away.
Collins quoted an email Boumelha wrote to Shibi from July 2014, in  which the former said the hotline effort was not “credible,” because “most  importantly, they [the Israeli Federation] have never expressed any solidarity  with their Palestinian colleagues at their time of need.”

<title>Likud MK: Revoke BDS founder's permit to live in Israel</title>
<date>25/2/2016</date>
<content>
Omar Barghouti, the founder of the anti-Israel BDS movement, should no longer be  permitted to reside in Israel, MK Nava Boker (Likud) wrote to Interior Minister  Arye Deri Thursday.“Barghouti spends most of his time lecturing around  the world and calling to isolate Israel and boycott it,” Boker wrote. “I ask you  to use your authority to revoke Mr. Barghouti’s permanent residence  status.”




The Interior Ministry has, in recent months, revoked  citizenship, and permanent residence status from noncitizens, who helped  terrorists attack.Barghouti, who was born in Qatar, grew up in Egypt and  married an Israeli-Arab woman, gaining permanent residence status, is studying  at Tel Aviv University and has lived in Jaffa and Acre, according to media  reports.He founded the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement in  2005 and supports the end of the State of Israel and the creation of one state  between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, in which Palestinians from  all over the world will have the right to live, and Jews will be a small  minority.Barghouti often compares Israel to apartheid in South Africa and  to the Nazis, and has refused to cooperate with Israelis who are sympathetic to  his cause. In fact, he has said Palestinians who engaged with Israelis have  “moral blindness,” calling them “clinically delusional” in a 2005  article.Despite this, Barghouti is expected to speak at a conference  organized by Raja Zaatry, an activist from Hadash and a former spokesman for its  current leader, MK Ayman Odeh, in Nazareth on Friday on the topic of how Israeli  Arabs should relate to the BDS movement, according to a report by Yishai  Friedman in right-wing website Mida this week. High Follow-Up Committee for Arab  Citizens of Israel chairman Muhammad Barakei is also expected to  participate.Boker wrote to Deri following Friedman’s article, saying,  “The BDS movement and Barghouti are the arrowhead in a campaign of hatred and  anti-Semitism.”“A democratic state cannot tolerate a situation in which  someone like this has permanent residence status and comes to Israel to preach  to its citizens how to boycott it. He is a very dangerous man and he has no  business in Israel,” Boker said.Right-wing NGO Im Tirzu’s director-  general Alon Schvartzer joined Boker’s call, calling Barghouti “the ideological  and operative arm of the campaign to destroy and boycott the State of  Israel.”“Israel should act like a sovereign state, like all Western  democracies do, and not allow those who want to destroy it to enter its  territory and preach against it here, too,” Schvartzer said.Zaatry  called Boker’s attempt to ban Barghouti from the country “incitement,” which is  “part of the hysterical attacks on the Arab minority in the democratic sphere,  which Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu himself leads.“The inability  of the Right to lead a real debate on a real solution for the conflict and about  the disastrous ramifications of the continued occupation and settlements leads  it to try to silence every critical voice,” Zaatry added. “It is a sign of  weakness and a basic misunderstanding of basic rights in every democratic regime  worthy of its name.”Zaatry also said it is “ignorant and malicious” to  call BDS anti-Semitic and that “it is ridiculous to pull the anti-Semitic card  every time Israel is criticized.”
Barghouti did not respond to an email  asking for his reaction. In an interview last summer, republished in Israeli  left-wing blog +972, Barghouti said he does not speak to the Israeli press.

<title>MK Ghattas calls for Israel boycott at far-left Montreal conference</title>
<date>14/8/2016</date>
<content>
Joint List MK Bassel Ghattas has called on the world to boycott and sanction Israel, repeatedly  comparing the Jewish state to apartheid South Africa, in a recording obtained by  The Jerusalem Post.Ghattas made the statements last week at the World  Social Forum in Montreal, which is meant to be a farleft alternative to the  annual World Economic Forum in Davos. The Canadian federal government revoked  its partnership with the forum because of anti-Semitic content, policies and  promotional materials, as well as the exclusion of Jewish Israelis and  supporters of Israel.




One session blamed worldwide terrorism and  imperialism on Zionists, which was promoted with a caricature featuring classic  anti-Semitic imagery of a hook-nosed man with forelocks, a beard, and a black  hat controlling Uncle Sam. The session was later canceled, and the caricature  removed from the website.Ghattas spoke at multiple events at the  conference, which was sponsored by Canadian Friends of Sabeel, an organization  whose goal is to convince churches to divest from Israel.B’nai Brith  Canada sent an observer to the WSF, who recorded Ghattas’s speeches, among  others.The MK from Balad, one of the parties making up the Joint List,  called Israel an oppressive, racist and apartheid state, saying he is  pessimistic that there will be peace soon, and international sanctions were the  most effective way to combat Israel.“The only way for this society to  change is the way of South Africa... international pressure, international  sanctions, saying one basic elementary thing: Justice for Palestine,” he stated.  “Without boycotts and sanctions, Israel will not do and comply with  international law.”The Defense Ministry said that “the real harm to  Israeli democracy is Ghattas and his friends, who serve in the Israeli  parliament while sabotaging it from the inside.”Ghattas said  international pressure is “the only mechanism Israel is afraid of,” and the only  way “to force Israel to comply with international law. I can promise you one  thing, that it will not take time like in South Africa for Israel to change.  Israelis are very connected to the world and very sensitive to the world, and once serious  action is taken by the international community, Israel will obey,” he  argued.Ghattas added that “BDS [boycott, divestment and sanctions] and  popular movements are the major and the most elementary step that have to be  taken in order to make governments and international bodies held  accountable.”The Joint List MK argued that the “occupation” is not only  of the West Bank, but that all of Israel is “settler colonialism” and an  “apartheid regime. When we say colonial settlers...this is the right  description for Israel as a whole, Israel dominating what was called Israel in  the 1967 borders and all the other areas that were in the 1967 war occupied by  Israel. We, as Palestinian citizens that have Israeli citizenship after 1948,  are still victims of this colonial settler regime,” he said.At another  point in the speech, Ghattas said that when it comes to the “apartheid regime,  the differentiation as if inside 1967 borders [or out] – this differentiation  does not exist, actually. Perhaps in some aspects the level... of the racism or  apartheid is different, but the same colonial settler apartheid reality is all  over Palestine.”All of Israel, Ghattas argued, has been taken over by  “settlers.” He backed up his statement by saying that such people have an  outsize influence on the Likud central committee, falsely claiming the body  chooses the party’s lists for the Knesset.He also claimed that a third  of Israel’s ministers live in settlements, when, in fact, only four out of 29  ministers and deputy ministers do. He also implied that Israel is less  democratic because Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman and Knesset Speaker Yuli  Edelstein are “settlers,” but while Edelstein identifies with his former home in  Gush Etzion, he is recently remarried and moved to his wife’s home in  Herzliya.Edelstein declined comment.Ghattas discussed his and  fellow Balad MKs’ Haneen Zoabi and Jamal Zahalka’s visit earlier this year with  the families of terrorists whose bodies were being held by Israel because of the  families’ refusal to have a modest funeral.“We met with Palestinian  families in Jerusalem that lost their sons in the last uprising, intifada, that  the bodies of their sons are not released up to today to bury them, and we just  went to hear their stories and follow up with the government,” Ghattas  said.The MK failed to mention that these sons had attacked Israelis. The  group included the father of Baha Alian, who, together with an accomplice,  killed three people by shooting and stabbing passengers on a bus in Jerusalem’s  Armon Hanatziv neighborhood on October 13. Police shot and killed Alian during  the attack.Ghattas lamented that “from Bibi Netanyahu to the last Israel  minister incited against us, that we went to terrorists’ families and we  encourage, embolden terrorism.”In addition, Ghattas misled the crowd in  stating none of the sons was buried. At least one family agreed to the Public  Security Ministry’s conditions, that they hold a funeral at night, without a  major parade glorifying martyrdom, and was able to bury its son.Ghattas  complained that the law inspired by the visit with terrorists’ families, which  would allow lawmakers encouraging terrorism to be expelled from the Knesset  following an impeachment process and a threefourths vote, is  undemocratic.“Israel kept saying we are the only democracy in the Middle  East, a villa in the jungle. The Expulsion Law makes my service in parliament  under question,” he stated.In Canada, the House of Commons can also  eject members. The House’s website reads: “The power of the House to expel one  of its Members derives from its traditional authority to determine whether  members are qualified to sit. A criminal conviction is not necessary for the  House to expel a member; the House may judge a member unworthy to sit in the  plenum chamber for any conduct unbecoming the character of a  member.”Ghattas threatened, in the name of Israeli Arabs, to stop  participating in Israeli politics, because of his arguments that it is  undemocratic.“We still think politically that it is a wise thing to do,”  he said. “Going to the Knesset is like going to the battle.We go there  in order to protect our rights, in order to do our case, in order to unveil the  mask of Israeli democracy and try to minimize and oppose the continuous attempt  of the Israeli right-wing, and most of the time the Israeli Jewish consensus of  creating almost on a daily basis racist legislation,” he stated.However,  he said, “this is not going to continue for a long time, because the margins of  Israeli democracy, which we decided to use, are getting narrower all the time.  We are in the years before getting to the decision to decide not to participate  in this game...We decided to play the game, the Israeli democratic election and  parliamentary game, but we are discovering that you are changing the rules...  It’s our choice to decide whether to continue or not.”Instead, Ghattas  posited, Israeli Arabs are likely to form their own representative body, outside  of the Knesset.Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee chairman  Avi Dichter said that “Ghattas is continuing his pattern of being in the Knesset  and speaking against it and the democratic values by which it  operates.”Dichter referred to Azmi Bishara, a founder of the Balad Party  who fled the country while under investigation for giving information to  Hezbollah during the Second Lebanon War, calling Bishara Ghattas’s “spiritual  father... who betrayed the State of Israel.”“Ghattas is sounding the  voice of his master, and could be prophesizing his future in relation to loyalty  to the state,” Dichter warned. “There are those who may say Ghattas is shooting  at passengers on the bus in which he is riding... Ghattas is riding on the  donkey of his Messiah, Bishara, but those of us watching on the sidelines can’t  tell who’s the donkey, the one on top, or the one on the bottom.”MK  Itzik Shmuly (Zionist Union) said that he opposes to government’s policies, but  boycotting is a “stupid act that will not bring a solution with the Palestinians  and weakens the Israeli Left. Ghattas is not a person who represents dialogue,  peace and coexistence, and it is pretty ridiculous that he is invited anywhere  to talk about such things following his pathetic provocations. He’s not  interested in promoting peace; he wants to erase Israel from the  map.”
According to Shmuly, if Ghattas were to invest a quarter of his  efforts to slander Israel on helping the population that voted him in, Israeli  Arabs’ situation would be much better.

<title>MK Ghattas participating in ‘anti-Semitic’ conference in Montreal</title>
<date>10/8/2016</date>
<content>
Joint List MK Basel Ghattas is a featured speaker at a conference this week that  outraged Canadian Jewish organizations with its anti-Semitic content and  promotional materials, as well as its support for boycotting Israel.He  is set to take part in the World Social Forum, which calls itself “the largest  gathering of civil society to find solutions to the problems of our time,” and  is meant to be a far-left alternative to the annual World Economic Forum in  Davos.




One of the four ideas the forum’s organizers said it is committed  to is “Non Apartheid,” which they act on by “taking a stand to exclude all  people, organizations or activities that promote any kind of oppression,  supporting Palestinians and all people struggling for their emancipation and  freedom.”B’nai Brith Canada said that commitment has been translated  into “a promise to ban all Jewish Israelis and supporters of Israel from the  WSF, which is clearly [an] anti-Semitic policy.”In addition, the  conference originally had an event scheduled on “Terrorizm (sic), Wahhabism,  Zionism,” in which Seyyed Ali Mousavi of the Center of Religious Dialogue for  Peaceful Coexistence intended to argue that worldwide terrorism and imperialism  are the fault of Zionists. The event was promoted with a caricature feature  classic anti-Semitic imagery – of a hook-nosed man with forelocks, a beard and a  black hat with a Star of David on it controlling Uncle Sam, who in turn controls  Wahhabism, a denomination of Islam dominant in Saudi Arabia.The event  was canceled following a media uproar in Canada, but Mousavi posted on the WSF  website that the conference is “occupied by Israeli tanks and petrodollars Saudi  Arabia.”Ghattas, a member of the Balad party, is listed on the WSF  website as speaking in favor of BDS at two events. In the first, the Joint List  MK will talk about his experience on the 2015 Gaza flotilla, meant to break the  Israeli naval blockade of Gaza. The second is the “Grande Conference Palestine,”  in which Ghattas, who is Christian, will “address the hardships and problems  facing Christians under Israeli rule.”The events in which Ghattas is  scheduled to participate are sponsored by Canadian Friends of Sabeel, an  organization whose goal is to convince churches to divest from  Israel.Ghattas’s office did not respond to a request for  comment.Over 20 anti-Israel events are listed on the WSF website. At  least eight promote the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement,  including “Divesting Your Church” and “BDS 101.” At least two events at the WSF  are about fighting “Israeli apartheid.”Others include “The ‘new  anti-Semitism’ or the ‘new McCarthyism’? The Israel Lobby’s war on Palestine  Solidarity and How Best to Resist,” “Decolonizing Israel-Palestine through  Challenging the Jewish National Fund (JNF)” And “Call for a Canadian Military  Embargo toward Israel.”Earlier this week, the Canadian federal  government instructed the WSF to remove its logo from the list of partners in  the conference. Liberal MPs Anthony Housefather and Michael Levitt led the  charge.The MPs told B’nai Brith Canada that they are “deeply concerned  with a number of the sessions that are scheduled for the 2016 WSF and in  particular, we are disgusted by the blatantly anti-Semitic cartoons and images  that appear on the World Social Forum website.“The prime minister, the  Government of Canada and the Canadian Parliament have been very clear that we  oppose the BDS movement and that anti-Semitism is never acceptable,” they  added.However, the Province of Québec and the City of Montréal, as well  as McGill University, Université de Québec à Montréal and the Cégep du Vieux  Montréal college are still listed as partners for the conference.B’nai  Brith Canada CEO Michael Mostyn expressed disappointment that, despite the  federal government’s distancing itself from the WSF, public funds are still  invested in the “anti-Semitic conference.”As for the WSF’s apparent  policy of excluding pro-Israel individuals, Mostyn said: “The idea that public  money is being invested in an event which not only spreads anti-Semitism, but  also bars attendees based on ethnicity is contrary to the multicultural and  pluralistic values that we as Canadians value so highly.”“Any  partnership by governmental agencies is entirely inappropriate for this event,  and we call on both the government of Québec and the City of Montréal to pull  all support from the WSF,” said Mostyn.
Last week, the CBC reported that  hundreds of people planning to participate in the WSF were denied visas to enter  Canada.

<title>MK Peri to Danish Parliament Speaker: Stop funding BDS</title>
<date>8/6/2016</date>
<content>
MK Yaakov Peri (Yesh Atid) presented Danish parliament Speaker Pia Kjærsgaard  with a list of organizations her country funds that promote boycotts of Israel,  calling on her to fight the anti-Semitic boycott, divestment and sanctions  movement during her visit to the Knesset Wednesday.“Denmark is part of  the European Union, and it cannot be that it’s government funds anti-Israel  organizations. These actions defy the EU’s policies against boycotting  Israel,” Peri, the head of the Knesset’s delegation to the European Parliament,  said.




The Yesh Atid MK and former Shin Bet chief told Kjærsgaard that  Denmark, as well as Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden, send millions of  euros to the International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Secretariat in  Ramallah, which supports BDS.Another organizations calling to boycott  the Jewish state which receives Danish funding is Al-Haq, which promotes lawfare  against Israel, and whose director-general, Shawan Jabarin, is also a leader of  the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which Israel, the EU and the  US consider a terrorist organization.Other Danish-funded pro-boycott  organizations are Badil, which presents Israel as an apartheid state on social  media, and Addameer, whose senior officials also have ties to the  PFLP.Peri received the information from watchdog and research  organization NGO Monitor.Also Wednesday, Kjærsgaard met with Knesset  Speaker Yuli Edelstein, who thanked Denmark for its treatment of Jews during the  Holocaust.“I’m glad you’re visiting so you can see with your own eyes  the complexities Israel faces, which look different than what you read in the  newspaper,” Edelstein added.Kjærsgaard said this is her second visit to  Israel, and that the country has good friends in the Danish  parliament.“I want to visit Ramallah to better understand the  Palestinian national aspirations, but it is important that they don’t come at  Israel’s expense,” she added.
On Tuesday, Peri and Kjærsgaard took a  helicopter ride, in which Peri showed how narrow Israel is and pointed to  security issues. Earlier that day, Kjærsgaard visited Yad Vashem.

<title>Politicians call to oust Israeli-Arab MK from Knesset for pro-BDS talk</title>
<date>16/8/2016</date>
<content>
Joint List MK Basel  Ghattas should be sanctioned for calling for a boycott of Israel at a far-left  conference in Montreal, Yisrael Beytenu MK Oded Forer said Monday, reacting to  the lead story in The Jerusalem Post.The lawmaker from Balad, one of the  four parties that make up the Joint List, called Israel an oppressive, racist  and apartheid state. He said he is pessimistic that there will be peace soon,  and international sanctions were the most effective way to combat  Israel.




“The theater of the absurd in the Knesset continues and the Joint  List continues to prove that its MKs do not belong in the Knesset,” Forer said.  “A member of parliament calling Israel racist and calling upon countries to  boycott and sanction it is an unheard of act in any sane country in the world.  It is not only delusional, it is against the law.”Forer said he checked  the laws prohibiting action that would harm Israel via boycotts and he intends  to ask the finance minister to remove special tax status from any organization  connected directly or indirectly to Ghattas.Deputy Minister in the Prime  Minister’s Office Michael Oren (Kulanu) and Likud MK Sharren Haskel said  Ghattas’s actions proved the need for the “MK expulsion law” that passed last  month. Oren said the BDS movement is racist and supports the destruction of  Israel.“An MK calling for the destruction of the country he represents  cannot sit in the legislature of that country,” Oren said. “Imagine a member of  Congress calling for the destruction of the US. That is essentially what Ghattas  did.”
Haskel said a parliament member cannot use the democratic tools  that were given to him by the democracy he represents in order to destroy that  country. She said she hoped the expulsion law could be used against Ghattas. But  Bayit Yehudi MK Bezalel Smotrich said parliamentary tools would not be effective  against Ghattas and he should not be given attention. “He doesn’t damage  Israel,” Smotrich said. “Israel is strong enough to withstand the threat from  Basel Ghattas, who nobody could care less about.”

<title>MKs, Christians and Israel supporters come together at the Knesset to condemn BDS</title>
<date>25/7/2016</date>
<content>
Knesset members and Israel supporters alike came together to condemn the  language of the BDS Movement and to thank the Christian community for its  ongoing support at a gathering at the Knesset on Monday.The Knesset  Christian Allies Caucus and the Delegitimization Caucus organized the event to  discuss the “Defeat BDS” campaign, which has helped to enact anti-BDS  legislation in 12 US states.




Along with speeches from several MKs, the  event featured two key speakers: Joseph Sabag, a US leader in the fight against  BDS with the Israel Allies Foundation, and Eugene Kontorovich, a professor at  Northwestern University and an expert on the Arab-Israeli conflict.“The  Delegitimization Caucus is here to fight the threats that generations and  generations have brought against us, but the Christian supporters are here  because they realize it’s God that has defended Israel and delivered us from  their hands,” said Josh Reinstein, director of the Knesset Christian Allies  Caucus.“It’s exciting to see both caucuses together. This is a first.  We’ve never seen this before,” he said.The Christian community has a  long-standing history with Israel and the anti-BDS campaign, and many of the MKs  made it a point to thank the community for its contributions to  Israel.“We seem to take things for granted,” Likud MK and member of the  Knesset Christian Allies Caucus Yehuda Glick told the Christian  attendees.“Your friendship is not something to take for granted. We  should never take it for granted.”Several of the MKs, as well as some of  the other speakers, cited language as one of the main issues with the anti- BDS  campaign. They believe that when Israel supporters use terms like “occupy” and  “apartheid” to explain BDS they are feeding into the narrative created by the  anti-Israel movement.“Language has been weaponized against us, simply by  the use of the term occupation itself, which you’ll find is used by more than  enough of Israel’s own media outlets and institutions and even more so through  the casual and common use of other related terms,” said Sabag. “Those who  support Israel should not use the terms that paint Israel as an  occupier.”The speakers at the event didn’t just focus on Israeli-  Christian relations, but also spoke about the Muslim community, its  contributions to Israel, and how it is effected by radical Islam.“In the  past 70 years the greatest victims of Islamist terrorism are Muslims,” said  Glick. “Every single day we have people being killed in Syria and Libya and  Yemen.Therefore, we have to strengthen moderate Muslim leaders. We have  to strengthen them and their voices.”
Despite the anger that the speakers  and attendees expressed toward BDS, the overall message of the event was that  the future looks positive. There was a general excitement over the 12 states  that passed the anti-BDS laws, with many stating that they believe even more  states will follow suit in the near future.

<title>'Musicians won't dare criticize Israel out of fear for their careers'</title>
<date>22/2/2016</date>
<content>
Roger Waters, the bassist and co-founder of legendary progressive rock group Pink Floyd, told a British newspaper over the weekend that musicians are afraid of denouncing Israel over its policies as they relate to the Palestinians because they see the backlash that he has absorbed over his support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.In an interview with the British newspaper Independent, Waters said that since he declared his support for BDS, he has been accused of being “a Nazi” and “an anti-Semite” – charges that he says could not be further from the truth.




“The only response to BDS is that it is anti-Semitic,” Waters told the newspaper. “I know this because I have been accused of being a Nazi and an anti-Semite for the past 10 years."“My industry has been particularly recalcitrant in even raising a voice [against Israel]. There’s me and Elvis Costello, Brian Eno, Manic Street Preachers, one or two others, but there’s nobody in the United States where I live. I’ve talked to a lot of them, and they are scared s***less."“If they say something in public they will no longer have a career. They will be destroyed. I’m hoping to encourage some of them to stop being frightened and to stand up and be counted, because we need them. We need them desperately in this conversation in the same way we needed musicians to join protesters over Vietnam.”Waters told the Independent that his view of the Middle East changed in the wake of his 2006 performance in Israel.The British rocker, who was originally scheduled to play in Tel Aviv, changed the venue to a joint Jewish-Arab village after he was pressured by human rights activists to denounce Israeli government policies.Waters said that while the 60,000 mostly Jewish Israelis at the show “could not have been more welcoming,” he was left with “an uncomfortable feeling” given the fact that the audience was not more diverse.Waters repeated his assertion that Israel’s rule over the Palestinians was akin to apartheid South Africa.“The way apartheid South Africa treated its black population, pretending they had some kind of autonomy, was a lie,” he said. “Just as it is a lie now that there is any possibility under the current status quo of Palestinians achieving self-determination and achieving, at least, a rule of law where they can live and raise their children and start their own industries. This is an ancient, brilliant, artistic and very humane civilization that is being destroyed in front of our eyes.”Waters noted the irony of critics accusing him of being a Nazi in light of the fact that his father, Eric Fletcher Waters, was killed in action fighting the Nazis during World War Two. Waters was only five months old at the time of his father’s death.“I have veterans coming to all my shows and meet them at half time. At a gig in 2013, one veteran came up to me, took my hand, wouldn’t let go and looked me in the eye... I can hardly tell you this now without welling up. He said: ‘Your father would have been proud of you’.”“My father died fighting the Nazis [and] my mother devoted her life to doing everything she could to create a more humane world,” he said.“We are asking questions that have never been asked until the last couple of years, which are bringing the wrath of the Israeli lobby down on people like me and all the others who dare to question and criticize.”
“[The Israeli lobby] is determined not to let that conversation develop into one that people can listen to and that is why they accuse us of being Nazis. This idea that BDS is the thin end of some kind of genocidal Nazi wedge that ends up in another Holocaust – well it isn’t."

<title>Netanyahu accepts Paris invite to meet Abbas, if France drops conference</title>
<date>8/12/2016</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday accepted  French President François Hollande’s invitation to meet with him and Palestinian  Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Paris later this month, as long as there is  no international conference.The French are planning a conference of  foreign ministers in Paris on December 21 to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian  issue, and invited Netanyahu and Abbas to come to the city the day after for a  meeting of their own.




Israel has made clear that it sees the French-led  conference, a follow-up to a meeting of foreign ministers in Paris over the  summer, as an effort to impose a settlement on it, and that it will not take  part.The Prime Minister’s Office issued a statement saying that  Netanyahu spoke to Hollande, and said that “if there is no international  conference in Paris, the prime minister will come to meet Abu Mazen [Abbas] for  direct talks without preconditions.”Israel will “not take part in an  international conference that will not contribute to achieving peace,” the  statement read.Netanyahu has said repeatedly over the last number of  months that he would meet Abbas “anywhere, anytime” for direct talks without  preconditions.

(France seeks to revive Israel-Palestinian talks, seeking two-state solution)The French daily Le Figaro reported on Wednesday that  France’s ambassador to Israel, Helen Le Gal, spoke with National Security  Council head Yaakov Nagel earlier in the week to extend the invitation for the  meeting with Abbas that would take place the day after the international  conference.According to the report, published before Netanyahu and  Hollande spoke, Paris remains determined to go ahead with the conference,  unfazed by the “icy reception” from Israel.The paper reported a French  diplomat as saying that since Netanyahu refuses to participate in the French  initiative, but at the same time says that he wants to meet with Abbas, Paris  decided it was time “to take him at his word.”Israel, diplomatic sources  said, viewed the invitation to meet a day after dozens of foreign ministers will  gather as “part of the French initiative.”“Peace will be achieved  through direct negotiations with our Palestinian neighbors, not through  international conferences,” Netanyahu’s spokesman David Keyes said. “Our  position has not changed: Israel will not attend the French conference, because  it will push peace further away.”The Palestinians, meanwhile, accepted  the invitation, with PLO Executive Committee member Ahmad Majdalani telling The  Jerusalem Post that “President Abbas agreed to the French invitation and  informed the French president of this.”Even before Netanyahu delivered  his answer to Hollande, Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat predicted that  the meeting would not take place.“Netanyahu has already made up his  mind,” he said, charging that the prime minister has chosen “settlement and  replacing the twostate solution with ugly apartheid in the occupied state of  Palestine in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.”Referring to a Russian  attempt in September to arrange a meeting between the two leaders, Erekat said  that Netanyahu rejected that as well. Netanyahu said at the time that the  Palestinians had attached preconditions to that meeting.“He’s the one  who suspended the negotiations,” Erekat said of Netanyahu.
“Just look at  his actions; his policies are determined by his deeds not his words. It seems  that Benjamin the Magnificent Netanyahu is not willing to have peace and stop  settlement and say the words ‘two states on 1967 [borders].’” Ben Lynfield  contributed to this report.

<title>Netanyahu defends much-maligned Foreign Ministry</title>
<date>25/7/2016</date>
<content>
Israel’s international relations and public image are constantly improving,  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday in the Knesset State Control  Committee.Netanyahu appeared before the committee in his capacity as  foreign minister, to respond to a State Comptroller report criticizing the  government’s public diplomacy and boycott- battling efforts.




Control  Committee chairwoman Karin Elharar (Yesh Atid) brought up criticism from the  report that the various offices dealing in public diplomacy do not  coordinate.“This harmed and harms Israel’s public  diplomacy.There are no instructions as to how responsibilities are  divided,” she said. “At a time when Israel deals with growing delegitimization  campaigns, attacks at UNESCO on the historic connection between the Jewish  People and Jerusalem, unilateral decisions against Israel in the UN Human Rights  Council and even the World Health Organization, now you don’t think we need a  full-time foreign minister to improve Israel’s standing in the world?” The prime  minister repeatedly argued that results are more important than the process, and  the results are that Israel’s ties in the world are better than  ever.Netanyahu presented a map of the world, color-coded to represent  the status of Israel’s ties with different countries, which emphasized improved  connections with Asia and Eastern Europe. He expressed hope that the ties can be  leveraged to reverse the “automatic anti-Israel majority” in the UN.The  prime minister also displayed a chart with Israel and the Palestinians’  favorability ratings in the US in Gallup polls over more than a decade, which  showed that Israel’s public image has improved overall, while the Palestinians’  has remained the same.The most important indicator of positive results  from the Foreign Ministry, according to Netanyahu, was that in the last two  military operations, Protective Edge in 2014 and Pillar of Defense in 2012,  there were no UN Security Council decisions that would have “tied our  hands.”In addition, Netanyahu said that if it were not for his  diplomatic efforts, Iran would have a nuclear weapon, though he lamented that  Teheran’s “aggression has not stopped since the deal [with world powers],  including testing ballistic missiles that say ‘erase Israel’ on them in  Hebrew.”“Public diplomacy isn’t a goal in of itself, it’s a means to  achieve our goals. The question is how to promote our interests,” he explained.  “How do we measure the success or failure of the Foreign Ministry? In trade,  foreign visitors, and public opinion. Changes are happening for the  better.”One of the reasons Netanyahu cited for Israel’s improved  standing in the world is the idea that it is the Start-Up Nation, which he  called “true branding.”Asked about the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions  Movement, Netanyahu said that Israel has had many victories, mentioning failed  attempts to get FIFA and the Methodist Church to boycott Israel.“The BDS  movement is on the defensive. Now, they’re trying to defend their ‘right to  boycott,’” he stated.Netanyahu called BDS “an anti-Semitic movement par  excellence” and a “hostile element,” and said that he didn’t think anything  Israel does, as long as it exists, will change its boycott efforts.When  it comes to claims that Israel is an apartheid state, Netanyahu pointed out that  Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said no Jews will live in  their future state.“If there’s ethnic cleansing and apartheid, it’s in  that direction,” he said.As for the criticism that public diplomacy  isn’t coordinated, Netanyahu said since he’s been in office, it hasn’t been a  problem, and denied a specific criticism in the Comptroller’s report that  messages were not coordinated between the government and IDF Spokesman’s  Office.MK Michael Oren (Kulanu) backed Netanyahu up, saying that he has  been involved in every military operation since he came to Israel as either a  member of the IDF Spokesman’s Office or as a diplomat, and that he always  received swift and consistent messages.
“Israel is less isolated than  ever before, and that is a fact,” Oren added. “When I was a college student, I  never imagined that we would have ties with China or what was then the Soviet  bloc.”

<title>Norwegian theater boycott call prompts Nazi comparisons from Israel</title>
<date>24/9/2016</date>
<content>
A video published online, purportedly on the behalf of the Norwegian National Theater, issued an apology for the theater's cultural cooperation with Habima, Israel's National Theater, on a project called 'Terrorisms' between 2013-2015. The Palestinian theater Shiber Hur Company also participated in the project. The nearly seven minute video went on to publicly endorse the BDS movement on behalf of Norway's National Theater and declare Israel a "colonialist" entity "based on occupation, ethnic cleansing, racism and apartheid."




The video, as well as its full transcript, was published in the Norwegian weekly newspaper Morgenbladet Friday. In contacting the Norwegian National Theater for comment about the video, an employee told The Jerusalem Post that the clip was part of an "art installation," produced independently without the "theater's knowledge." The Israeli Foreign Ministry released a statement saying that the video was produced "under the guise of freedom of speech and was officially funded." The statement added that "the film is reminiscent of the morbid Third Reich propaganda of Joseph Goebbels and the Nazi filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl."The State of Israel is "demanding the Norwegian National Theater clearly renounce the video and remove it from all sites immediately."The National Theater of Norway issued a response stating that "the unsigned article is part of the art project Monsters of Reality,  which is part of the                               International Ibsen Festival 2016. The  article is not written by The National Theatre of Norway – and does not  represent The                               National Theatre of Norway's attitude –  but is an expression of artistic freedom."
The statement added that "the National Theatre of Norway  still has                               greater faith in collaboration with  artists across national borders and from regimes we are critical to,  than boycotts and                               silence."

<title>NY professor says 'Israeli apartheid' akin to campus rape</title>
<date>20/4/2016</date>
<content>
Professor Simona Sharoni compared the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to campus rape in a recent interview with the online publication Alternet.Sharoni, a professor at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh in the Gender and Women's Studies Department, said that both the conflict and campus sexual assault feature institutionalized disparity of power as a linchpin.




Sharoni articulated that the pro-Israel narrative embraces a victim-blaming narrative akin to "she was asking for it" allegations common in rape culture. "The assumption that Palestinians bring the violence on themselves...it's similar to telling a survivor that it's what she was wearing," Sharoni said.Additionally, she asserted that supporters of Israel engage in a behavior analogous to discrediting rape victims in their repudiation of Palestinian claims."Palestinians are not believed, which is the same with survivors [of sexual assault]. It's very similar to saying, 'No, he's actually a nice guy,' about a man accused of rape," Aharoni remarked.
The professor concluded her interview by explaining that drawing parallels between campus rape and the "Israeli apartheid" is strategically advantageous for both the BDS movement as well as sexual assault survivors groups because it serves as "a means to an end...to create a just and equal society."

<title>Only Ethiopian MK awaits invite from PM to Africa trip</title>
<date>22/6/2016</date>
<content>
Likud MK Avraham Neguise, the only MK from Ethiopia currently in the Knesset, is  still waiting for an invitation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to join  him in two weeks on his trip to Africa, including a two-day visit to  Ethiopia.“No one has yet asked me,” Neguise, who is the chairman of the  Knesset’s Caucus for Israel-Africa Relations, told The Jerusalem Post on  Tuesday.




“I would be happy to go, it would be an honor for me, and I  think it would bring honor to Israel,” he said. “It would be an important  message to Africa and the world about Israel. I came here, got equal  opportunity, and am now a legislator. This is the answer to those who say  Zionism is racism, that Israel is apartheid. This is the answer to  BDS.”Neguise, who emigrated in 1985, said he hopes that the reason he  has not yet been invited does not have to do with the mini coalition crisis he  sparked in the spring along with fellow Likud MK David Amsalem when they refused  to vote with the coalition and deprive it of its one-seat majority because the  government reneged on a commitment to bring the remaining 9,000 immigrant  applicants waiting in Ethiopia to Israel.“The visit to Africa is a  national interest, the other is a parliamentary issue,” Neguise said. “I was  sent [to the Knesset] by the public to help [on issues important to them]. I did  this because immigration is one of the highest values of the Likud, and also to  prevent the suffering of the families.”Neguise was referring to members  of the Ethiopian community here waiting to be reunited with family members from  Ethiopia.An official in the PMO, asked whether Neguise would be invited  to join the prime minister, said that the list of who will be accompanying  Netanyahu has still not yet been finalized.Neguise said he was confident  he will still be asked to join the trip.Netanyahu is scheduled to go to  Uganda on July 4th to mark 40 years to the day of the Entebbe raid. A ceremony  will be held at the airport, and will include a number of those who were held  hostage there in 1976, as well as the IDF commandos who rescued  them.From there Netanyahu will proceed to Kenya, Rwanda and Ethiopia,  where he will spend two nights. He will return to Israel on July 8. This will be  the first visit by a sitting prime minister to Sub-Saharan Africa since Yitzhak  Shamir visited five countries in West Africa in 1987.Neguise said that  the government would be wise if it used members of the Ethiopian Jewish  community in Israel to build the relationship with Africa.For Ethiopian  Israelis, he said, the visit of the prime minister to Ethiopia is a “closing of  the circle,” and a source of pride to younger Israelis of Ethiopian descent that  the country of their parents’ birth was important enough to merit a prime  ministerial visit.“It gives the younger generation motivation to invest  there, which some are already doing,” he said.Neguise said that Israeli  companies doing business there should employ Ethiopian Israelis who know the  language and the culture, and could help them maneuver the business culture in  the country.
According to Neguise, Netanyahu’s visit has much more than  purely symbolic significance, and it will surely open the doors for Israeli  businesses to set up shop on the continent.

<title>Palestinians call for UNSC action over new Israeli building plans in east Jerusalem</title>
<date>25/7/2016</date>
<content>
The Palestinian Authority has called on the United Nations Security Council to  act against Israeli settlement building, in the wake of the Jerusalem  Municipality’s decision to advance 770 new Jewish homes in its Gilo  neighborhood, which is located over the Green Line.“This is yet another  opportunity for the international community to show its real commitment for the  two-state solution, and to take all needed action in order to have Israel fully  cease settlement construction in the occupied state of Palestine,” said PLO  Secretary-General Saeb Erekat.




“We have asked the State of Egypt and the  leaders of Arab countries during our recent visit to call for an urgent meeting  of the Arab Quartet, in order to submit a draft resolution to the United Nations  Security Council to halt settlement expansion.”Israel maintains that  Jerusalem would remain its united capital in any final status agreement with the  Palestinians for a two-state solution. As such, it argues that it has a right to  build homes for its residents in all areas of the city.“We won’t lend a  hand to a freeze of Jewish building in Israel’s capital,” said the Jerusalem  municipality.“Discrimination based on religion, race and sex would be  illegal in any other civilized country.”It added that building for Jews  and Arabs is advanced everywhere in the capital based on construction laws and  the city’s master zoning plan, and that such construction is important to ensure  the city’s future by providing housing for young couples.The plan for  what is known as Gilo’s southern slope was submitted on Thursday before the  Jerusalem District and Planning Committee, which means that there is now a  60-day objection period.Initial approval for the project was given in  2012, as the UN General Assembly voted to upgrade Palestine’s status by  recognizing it as a non-member state, rather than an observer  mission.The municipality said that depositing the plans was simply a  technical action that followed from that initial 2012 approval.According  to the non-governmental group Ir Amim, the project if approved would help  solidify Israel’s hold on the southwest perimeter of the capital, which abuts  both the Palestinian city of Bethlehem and the Gush Etzion area of the West  Bank.The municipality is already building 797 new homes on Gilo’s  western slope, near the site slated for the new 770 unit  project.Palestinians have argued that Israeli actions in that end of the  city is creating a wedge that is isolating Bethlehem from Israeli- Arab  neighborhoods of the city and the surrounding Palestinian villages.Such  a wedge, the Palestinians have claimed, would make it difficult to enact a  two-state solution that places east Jerusalem within the boundaries of a  Palestinian state.Gilo is located near the Jewish neighborhood of Har  Homa, and the location of what will be the new Jewish neighborhood of Givat  Hamatos.“While Israeli ministers complain about a ‘building freeze,’  Israel continues its policy of one-sided actions that complicate and distance  the possibility for a two-state solution,” said Ir Amim.“The past year  makes it clear that the peace and security which Israelis deserve require a  totally different policy.”Erekat said that “Israeli settlement  construction in general, and in and around Occupied East Jerusalem in  particular, is part of Israel’s political decision to bury the two-state  solution by consolidating its illegal occupation and apartheid regime over the  Palestinian people.”The UN condemned the Gilo project, and said it too  was concerned by its impact on the diplomatic process.“I reiterate that  settlements are illegal under international law, and urge the government of  Israel to cease and reverse such decisions,” said Nickolay Mladenov, the UN’s  special coordinator to the Middle East peace process.He noted that  earlier this month the Quartet — composed of the United States, Russia, the UN  and the European Union — had issued a report in which it called on Israel to  stop such building.“Continuing on the current trajectory entrenches a  one-state reality of perpetual occupation and conflict that is incompatible with  realizing the national aspirations of both peoples,” he added.Mladenov  said he was also worried about reports that settlers were attempting to rebuild  an outpost in the Kiryat Arba settlement, known as Mitzpe Avichai.
The  two projects, he said, “come against the backdrop of statements by some Israeli  ministers that there should never be a Palestinian state or calls for the full  annexation of the West Bank. Such moves raise legitimate questions about  Israel’s long-term intentions.”

<title>Palestinians charge Israel with confiscating 371 acres in the Jordan Valley</title>
<date>20/1/2016</date>
<content>
Palestinians warned on Wednesday that Israel was confiscating 150 hectares of  farmland in the Jordan Valley by moving forward with steps to reclassify the  property as state land.The technical move to change the status of the  land, which has been farmed for decades by settlers, followed the conclusion of  a Civil Administration of Judea and Samaria investigation into the land’s proper  legal status under Israeli law.




The Prime Minister’s Office had no  comment on the matter.The land reclassification was widely publicized in  Israel just as Netanyahu arrived in Davos, Switzerland, where he is scheduled to  meet with US Secretary of State John Kerry and Vice President Joe  Biden.Both US Ambassador Dan Shapiro and US State Department spokesman  John Kirby issued harsh words this week against Israeli settlement  activity.Kirby on Tuesday clarified that this opposition relates not  only to the building of homes but also to “planning and retroactive  legalization.”PLO secretary-general Saeb Erekat said that the  Palestinian Authority leadership would soon file a complaint about settlements  to the United Nations Security Council. He called on the 15 member states of the  UNSC to support the resolution or figure out a way to halt settlement  growth.“You ask them [referring to Israel] to stop settlements. They are  not listening to you. They are not listening to [US President Barack] Obama....  They are not listening to [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel. They are not  listening to anyone,” Erekat said.“So please, when we approach the  Security Council with a resolution concerning settlement activities, don’t stop  us; we are the victims here,” Erekat told reporters as he stood next to the  Israeli farmland in the Jordan Valley.The “annexation of 1,500 dunams of  land [371 acres] from the Jericho district and the Jordan Valley, near Route 1,  is the biggest confiscation in two years,” Erekat said.It is also close  to the settlements of Vered Yeriho, Almog and Beit Ha’arava and is under the  auspices of the Megilot Regional Council.Erekat said that Palestinians  are allowed to use only 30 percent of the land in the Jordan  Valley.Closed Israeli military zones make up 54% of the land, and the  settlements are located on an additional 16% of the land, he said.The  Palestinians believe that the Jordan Valley, like all land over the pre-1967  lines, is part of their future state. Israel holds that the Jordan Valley is  critical for the country’s security, because it borders Jordan and provides a  buffer against extremist forces, such as Islamic State, Iranian proxies, such as  Hezbollah, and al-Qaida.But Erekat said that when it comes to halting  Israeli settlement activity, the Palestinians have the support of the  international community. He referenced Monday’s statement by the EU Foreign  Affairs Council, which said that Israeli settlement activity is illegal under  international law.Erekat charged that Netanyahu had chosen to transform  the property into state land in direct response to the EU statement, Shapiro’s  harsh words and a Human Rights Watch report against companies that do business  with the settlements.These international parties called for an end to  settlement construction, collective punishment, house demolitions and the  displacement of Palestinians, including Beduin families, Erekat  said.“Instead of complying with the will of the international community,  Netanyahu is pursuing his policy of misleading and deceiving the world,” Erekat  charged.There is an “apartheid system” in the West Bank that posses a  threat to the two-state solution, Erekat said.The civil administration  said that a decision had been taken by the political echelon for professionals  to evaluate the status of the land. “The declaration of state land is in its  final stages,” the civil administration said.
There will be a 40-day  objection period before such a declaration takes place. Giving the property the  status of state land will make it easier for the farmers to use it.

Palestinian leaders reacted angrily Tuesday to the Knesset's passage on preliminary reading of the Regulation Bill legalizing settler housing units built on private Palestinian land, with PLO executive committee member Hanan Ashrawi calling for an emergency meeting of the UN security council to consider punitive measures against Israel."We call on the United Nations security council to convene an emergency meeting in light of Israel's disastrous settlement activities and to undertake serious punitive measures against Israel," Ashrawi said. "Israel's actions ae provoking grave violence and instability in an already volatile region-the international community must intervene immediately before it is too late."




Ashrawi termed the Regulation bill "a legal travesty."

(Israeli legislators advance settlement bill; Amona resident on importance of settlements 'we're not occupying')The Knesset voted 60-49 Monday evening to pass the Regulation Bill on preliminary reading, with Education Minister Naftali Bennett, head of the Jewish Home party, hailing the bill as "leading the way to annexation" of the West Bank. The bill will legalize 54 outposts situated on about 8000 dunams of privately-owned Palestinian land, according to Peace Now. The bill specifies that compensation is to be offered to land owners if they are known.Raji Sourani, director of the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, in Gaza City, told The Jerusalem Post "this is not legalizing something. You can't legalize a crime. In international law, especially the Geneva Convention and the International Criminal Court's Rome statute, this is considered a war crime. Nothing can legitimize it when it happens by an occupying power. It's void and illegal."He said the matter should be handled within the framework of Palestinian efforts to pursue the settlement issue at the ICC."This is the rule of the jungle,"Sourani said of the Knesset's action."Israel can't do this just because of its might. And when this coincides with the 50th anniversary of a criminal belligerent occupation this is the worst. They are ethnically cleansing Palestinian people and imposing new terms of apartheid."Mustafa Barghouthi, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council from Ramallah, told the Jerusalem Post that passage of the bill "is a declaration of war on the Palestinian people and on peace and an act that attempts to assassinate the possibility of a two state solution.""It kills the possibility of a historic compromise," he added. "If Palestinians are denied the possibility of having a state of their own they will have no option but to demand a one state solution of full democratic rights for everyone.""This reveals the real face of Mr Netanyahu, who keeps changing his skin but in reality was always against the establishment of a Palestinian state,"Barghouthi said.He termed the legalization of outposts "legalization of theft. We know that theft was practiced before under other auspices like security reasons but now we are seeing legalizing theft for settlement."Asked how Palestinians will react, Barghouthi said: "This will lead to big changes in the Palestinian cause. This is the final declaration of the end of Oslo. Palestinians will have to change their course. This will enhance the action of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions work worldwide. The whole notion of waiting for negotiation to produce results is over. The only way is to change the balance of power especially through peaceful popular resistance, Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, diplomatic measures to defend Palestinian land and to demand of the international community to respond by taking actions against Israel and its violations of international law."Issa Samander, director of the Popular Committee against the Wall and Settlements, said: "This is another way of putting more problems to our having our state and to our having peace with the nearby state of Israel. If Netanyahu thinks it's a chance to get what he can before Trump begins he's wrong because our conflict is not only connected with the Americans. It's ours, it's between us."
Samander said the bill "opens the door wide for any radical settler to walk on any hill, put his stick there, set up a tent and say here I'll stay. It means coming nearer to Palestinian villages so there will be no places for villages to grow. It's a real pity. Israel is lacking leaders with a good perspective. They don't care what the consequences for the future are."

<title>Netanyahu to French FM: Paris initiative could harm regional peace efforts</title>
<date>3/6/2016</date>
<content>
The launch Friday of the Paris- led international peace initiative imperils  regional efforts to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu told French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault on  Friday.“This initiative could harm regional efforts that have the  potential to succeed,” Netanyahu told Ayrault, according to an Israeli  source.




Netanyahu also spoke against the news that a working group had  been created to deal with Israel’s vital interests, chief among them  security.“The State of Israel, and no one else, is the one that worries  about its own security,” Netanyahu said.Ayrault called Netanyahu Friday  evening to update him on the one-day Paris summit on the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict that ended that afternoon after a meeting with delegates from 29 countries and international organizations  including the United Nations and the Quartet.It ended with a brief  statement acknowledging that both “acts of violence” and settlement activity are  endangering a two-state solution.The participants issued a joint rather  bland communique reaffirming their “support for a just, lasting and  comprehensive resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”Neither  the Israelis nor the Palestinians were invited to the meeting.In their  phone conversation following the meeting, Netanyahu reiterated comments he made  early last week in Jerusalem when he told Ayrault to turn Paris into a staging  ground for direct Israeli-Palestinian talks rather than pushing for an  internationalized initiative about such negotiations.There is no  alternative to direct talks without preconditions, Netanyahu said, adding  anything else would only distance the possibility of ending the  conflict.In Washington, Deputy State Department spokesman Mark Toner  told reporters on Friday the meeting was a good opportunity for the  international community to reaffirm its commitment to achieving a twostate  solution.“I don’t know that there’s any follow-up role that we  immediately see for ourselves,” Toner said.“I think there was a good  discussion about what makes sense in the current period of time that we find  ourselves in and how to create the kind of conditions that we believe can lead  to a meaningful – a rather meaningful progress,” Toner said.But what was  really needed, he said, was for the Netanyahu and [Palestinian Authority  President Mahmoud] Abbas to show leadership, and for the two parties to make  progress.“We’re going to continue to work with both sides as well as key  international stakeholders to try to get there,” he said.The joint  statement released after the meeting stated that 29 delegates “reaffirmed that a  negotiated two-state solution is the only way to achieve an enduring peace, with  two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.  They are alarmed that actions on the ground, in particular continued acts of  violence and ongoing settlement activity, are dangerously imperiling the  prospects for a two-state solution.”A brief document put out by the  French on Thursday explaining the purpose of the summit said that the two-state  solution was under increased threat, “particularly with regard to continued  settlement activities.”That document made no mention of Palestinian  terrorism.The final statement emphasized that the status quo is not  sustainable, and “stressed the importance of both sides demonstrating, with  policies and actions, a genuine commitment to the two-state solution in order to  rebuild trust and create the conditions for fully ending the Israeli occupation  that began in 1967 and resolving all permanent-status issues through direct  negotiations based on Resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), and also recalling  relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and highlighting the  importance of the implementation of the Arab Peace Initiative.”Israel  had worked intensively behind the scenes to water down the language of the final  statement.Former US special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations  Martin Indyk said it was the US, not Israel, which succeeded in toning down the  language of the Paris document.“[US Secretary of State John] Kerry saved  Israel’s backside in Paris. Perhaps someone in Israel’s gov[ernment] should  thank him rather than claiming credit,” Indyk tweeted.In addition to  working with the US, Israeli diplomats have been active in some 23 capitals  since February trying to convince world leaders of the dangers of an “extreme”  final statement.The communique referenced the prospect of convening an  international peace conference by the end of the year.According to the  statement, the participants discussed ways the international community could  help advance peace prospects, “including by providing meaningful incentives to  the parties to make peace.”The communique also highlighted the  “potential for regional peace and security as envisioned by the Arab Peace  Initiative.”At a press conference following the meeting, Ayrault said  that the participants agreed that in the absence of negotiations it is important  to rebuild the confidence between the two sides.“Only the sides can make  peace, but we can help them,” he said. “We do not want to replace the sides or  impose solutions on them.”But, he said, “We cannot simply stand to the  side and do nothing. Everyone understands the ramifications of the logjam for  the citizens, the region and the world.”Although the concluding  communique made no reference to deadlines for negotiations, the French foreign  minister said there was a need for a defined time framework, and that many of  the participants mentioned this during the meeting.“We all agree that a  twostate solution is the only viable option for a sustainable peace,” he told  the forum. “Yet we all can see that the two-state solution is at great  risk.”UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said from Paris that “Israel and  Palestine must pull back from the brink by undertaking serious efforts to create  the conditions which will enable a return to meaningful  negotiations.”While the secretary-general condemned “terror, violence  and the incitement that fuel them,” he also cited “the ongoing settlement  enterprise” and the “lack of unity between Gaza and the West Bank” as obstacles  to peace.“Settlement activity is illegal under international law, and  Israel must cease its policy of expanding settlements, legalizing outposts and  demolishing Palestinian structures,” he stated.“These actions raise  legitimate questions about its commitment to the twostate solution and to its  obligations as the occupying power.”PLO Secretary-General Saeb Erekat  called the Paris meeting a “very significant step and its message is clear: If  Israel is allowed to continue its colonization and apartheid policies in  occupied Palestine, the future will be for more extremism and bloodshed rather  than for coexistence and peace.”“What is required is a genuine mechanism  to fully end the Israeli occupation that began in 1967 and to solve all  final-status issues based on international law; including a clear and limited  time frame for its implementation,” Erekat said.The foreign ministers of  Russia, Germany, Britain and Japan did not attend the parley, and their absence  was interpreted in Jerusalem as an indication that they themselves did not deem  it that important.Foreign Ministry director- general Dore Gold told The  Jerusalem Post that “despite the fact that the final statement has been  considerably diluted through a number of diplomatic efforts, the whole effort to  have a conference without the parties in Paris is a distraction from what should  be the main effort, and that is to persuade Abu Mazen [Abbas] to sit down with  Israel.”The Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that the Paris  summit was a “missed opportunity.”The statement said that instead of  urging Abbas to “answer the prime minister’s repeated calls to immediately begin  direct negotiations without preconditions,” the international community is  enabling him to continue avoiding negotiations.“In the annals of  history, the Paris conference will go down as only having hardened Palestinian  positions and made peace more distant,” the statement said.Despite the  watered-down final communique, with no reference to follow-up working groups,  mention of this was made in remarks before the meeting by French President  Francois Hollande and Ayrault.Now that the Paris meeting is over, the  next major diplomatic development will be the Mideast Quartet’s release of its  report on the reasons for the current diplomatic stalemate, and what needed to  be done to break it. That report is expected by the end of the month.In  the last few weeks, including a very public call last Wednesday from the  Knesset, Netanyahu has urged moderate Arab nations to come together for a  regional peace process based on a revised version of the 2002 Saudi  initiative.

<title>Peres defies threats on South Africa visit</title>
<date>29/2/2016</date>
<content>
Shimon Peres, the country’s ninth president, doesn’t scare easily.At 92,  he has faced many threats and attempts on his life. Thus when the South African  Muslim Lawyers Association filed for him to be arrested and prosecuted for war  crimes if he proceeded with his plan to address the South African-Jewish  community’s gala Salute to Israel Sunday night, he remained singularly  unimpressed and unafraid.




Israel’s Foreign Ministry and Jewish leaders  had pulled out all the stops to ensure that the MLA’s actions with regard to  Peres would come to naught, and the people responsible for Peres’s safety in  Johannesburg, put a heavy security cordon around his hotel and sealed off nearby  streets.Peres arrived in Johannesburg on Thursday night.On  Sunday evening, supporters of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement,  which is very active in South Africa, staged a protest demonstration outside the  Intercontinental Hotel where Peres was staying and where the gala was  held.Thanks to the heavy police presence, efforts to disrupt the Salute  to Israel were thwarted.Peres, who was the keynote speaker at the event,  declared in his opening remarks: “No threat or attempt to harm us or the State  of Israel will prevent me from standing on this stage, here in South Africa and  to fight the just war of the State of Israel.”Reaching back into  prestate history, Peres said: “The State of Israel was established against all  odds when it was surrounded by enemies and wilderness. We transformed it into a  strong, morally just, progressive and democratic state with human rights,  justice and the pursuit of peace.We evolved into a start-up nation.  Today, Israel contributes to the world and has the most advanced agriculture,  the most advanced medicine and incomparable technology.”Peres said he  was proud to stand before thousands of members of the Jewish community of  Johannesburg.“You are a warm, Zionist, loving community,” he told them.  “I know that you are experiencing uneasy days, and I have come here to bring  you, the strength, the encouragement and the love of the State of  Israel.”Peres also addressed the claims by protesters outside the hotel  that Israel is an “apartheid state” because of the way it treats  Palestinians.Peres insisted that there is not a single word in Israeli  law that discriminates against people for reasons of creed, color, ethnicity or  nationality.“Apartheid was racism,” he said, “and in Israel, racism is a  crime.”Again harking back to history, Peres recalled: “We were attacked  several times and we were outgunned and outmanned.We were 650,000 people  surrounded by 50 million Arabs. Without sufficient equipment or ammunition we  fought for our rights. You call that apartheid? People tend to forget that we  made peace with the Arabs,” he stated, citing Egypt and Jordan.In  relating to the peace process Peres said that other than the two-state solution,  there is no solution to bringing about peace. Things change very quickly in the  Middle East, he continued, “but one thing that will not change is the resolve of  the Jewish people, of the citizens of the State of Israel to live side by side  with our neighbors. That will never change.”Earlier in the day, Peres  had a meaningful meeting with Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, 79, the second of the  three wives of the late president Nelson Mandela.Peres apologized that  due to illness, he had been unable to attend Mandela’s funeral a little over two  years ago. The meeting was so moving for both that each had tears in their  eyes.Although there was a long bitter period between Winnie and Nelson  Mandela, she appeared to have made her peace with him since his death. Clasping  Peres’s hand, and speaking in an emotional tone of voice, she thanked him and  the State of Israel for preserving the memory and the values of  Mandela.Peres, who was equally emotional, replied: “There is a little of  Nelson Mandela in all of us that shows us the way to peace, reconciliation and  wholeness.Nelson was a dear friend to me, and his moral path was noble  and courageous and lit the road to the future.”Both Peres and Winnie  Mandela agreed that peace and equality were always worth pursing no matter how  elusive and that no one should raise their hands in defeat in the face of this  elusiveness or the attempts by negative forces to torpedo the peace  process.
Peres said after the meeting that for him it represented the  closing of a circle.

<title>Scholars, politicians and activists to discuss 'extremism’ on Fast of Av</title>
<date>12/8/2016</date>
<content>
The travesty that befell the Jewish people with the destruction of the Second Temple and the ultimate loss of sovereignty in its historic homeland which followed is often held up as the paradigm  of Jewish disunity and the dangers such division brings. And the Fast of the Ninth of Av which commemorates this tragedy is a particularly appropriate opportunity for national self-reflection regarding the state of the nation, the challenges it faces and the ways to overcome them. 




To this end, the Sderot Conference for Society and Sapir College staged an evening of debates and discussions on the eve of the fast, on Saturday night, to discuss the abiding challenge of Jewish disunity and the concept of “the center and the extremes” in Jewish society, past and present. A host of public figures including academics, authors, journalists, politicians, and social activists participated in such discussion groups around the country, where readings of the Book of Lamentations, traditionally read on the eve of the fast, were also staged. One of the participants was Shivi Frohman, a social activist, teacher, and son of the late champion of coexistence Rabbi Menachem Frohman, spoke at an event in Jerusalem’s French Hill neighborhood. Talking to The Jerusalem Post ahead of the event, Frohman argued that as a country and society which is maturing, a certain amount of radicalism and departure from the mainstream is to be expected. Just like adolescents in the process of growing up can frequently act in wild, rebellious manner, so too elements within a maturing society can act in a similar way, said Frohman, explaining that the country needs to undertake two sets of actions to cope with this phenomenon.“Firstly, we need to build up the central narrative of our identity around our common denominator, and that needs to include Jewish, democratic and pluralist values,” he told the Post. “But we also need to build a dialogue with the extremes, and we need to find a way to allow space for the extremes as well.”Frohman argued that denying space for elements and forces at the extremes of society would only exacerbate their extremism, and demanding that everyone should be “mainstream and politically correct” is itself a form of extremism and doomed to failure. He said however that it was necessary to fight “an uncompromising war” against those elements of the extremes that seek to physically harm the state. “For example, the Islamic Movement is is a legitimate organization in Israel and we need to allow Arab society to give expression to its Muslim faith and allow Muslims to organize in this way. But at the same time we need to wage relentless war against anyone seeking to harm Israeli state and society, including extremists in the Arab sector.“But a perspective that all Arab representatives and organizations are illegitimate is very problematic.”Frohman said that another example is the so-called “hilltop youth,” radical and intensely religious young men and women who seek to establish new settlement outposts in Judea and Samaria, some of whom have been accused of violence against Palestinians and other minorities. “Hilltop youth have a deep faith and love for this land and its connection to the Jewish people. The language they use is outside of the mainstream, but if someone feels he can’t express his opinion it will be translated into inclination to kick out, burn down and, destroy. “We need to think about how we can give an attentive ear and a place to their positions,” continued Frohman, while again emphasizing the importance of preventing harmful actions such people have taken in the past. MK Yossi Yonah of Zionist Union, who also spoke in Jerusalem at an event in Baka, emphasized a message of a need for different societal groups to take responsibility for Israel as a whole, and to therefore compromise on their desires and goals. The MK said in particular that the Israeli left has accepted to a large extent the need to include settlement blocks inside the borders of any future two state solution, but warned that those seeking territorial maximalism would be biting off more than the country can chew. “We’re letting the extreme right wing lead us into the abyss. Out of concern for the future, I am afraid that due to this perspective we will be in danger of either having a bi-national state or on the other hand having an apartheid state, neither of which anyone wants,” said Yonah. The MK, who outside of political life has taught as a professor of political philosophy and philosophy of education at Ben Gurion University, said that it was the responsibility of the political center and center left to emphasize to the general public what he said were the dangers of such outcomes. “We might compromise a sovereign Jewish state if we continue on like this. I’m not saying the Palestinians aren’t also responsible for the current stalemate, but we need to take responsibility too.”Yonah also highlighted the large divides in socio-economic circumstances that have beset the country as another serious challenge facing the state, as well as what he described as “the growing influence of capitalist and neoliberal ideologies” which he said were responsible for a growing lack of tolerance for the notion of societal responsibility. “We have solidarity against external threats, such as terrorism, but regarding the economic plight of other citizens there is growing indifference and a lack of concern, and this lack of social solidarity worries me a lot.”Similar to the advice of Frohman, Yonah said that “creating a more homogeneous society glued together by common values and heritage and future goals” was the only way to create a greater sense of such social solidarity. While both Frohman and Yonah noted some of the more problematic concerns facing Israeli society as the Fast of Av comes round once again, author, lecturer and novelist Yochi Brandes, focused on what she described as a positive development in the country in recent years. 
Speaking to the Post, Brandes, who spoke at an event in Ariel, highlighted what she believes to be the decreasing rigidity in which the majority of the country view their Judaism and their observance of the religion.

<title>Scottish soccer club to face charge over abundance of Palestinian flags</title>
<date>20/8/2016</date>
<content>
A UEFA rule states that political, ideological and religious messages are unsuitable for sports events.The Union of European Football Associations has taken disciplinary action against Glasgow’s Celtic team after its support section abounded in Palestinian flags in a game against Hapoel Beersheba on Wednesday, Al Jazeera reported. 




The case was opened due to a UEFA rule that bans “gestures, words, objects or any other means to transmit any message that is not fit for a sports event, particularly messages that are of a political, ideological, religious, offensive or provocative nature.”Celtic was charged with “illicit banner,” according to the UEFA. The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body is set to deal with the case on September 22.The game, which Celtic won 5-2, was part of the Champions League playoff.Fans had previously announced their plan to wave the flags, stating it was “due to the system of apartheid laws and practices including religious – and ethnic-based colonization, military occupation and segregation of what remains of Palestinian land and over 90 laws which discriminate against indigenous Palestinians who make up 20 percent of the population of current-day Israel.”The UEFA fined Celtic two years ago when fans waved Palestinian flags at a game against Iceland’s KR Reykjavik. UEFA’s Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Committee took action based on Article 16 (2) (e), which states that messages of this sort are unsuitable for sports events.

<title>Senior official: The Arab world is opening up to Israel, so should South Africa</title>
<date>14/3/2016</date>
<content>
South Africa should follow the course now being set by the Arab world and  embrace Israel, Foreign Ministry Director- General Dore Gold said upon his  return from a three-day trip to South Africa.When he landed there on  Thursday, he was the first director-general of Israel Foreign Ministry to visit  South Africa in a decade. Gold had a pitch for the officials that he  met.




“If the Arab world is opening up to Israel, why should South Africa  stay on the sidelines?” Gold asked them during the visit that ended on Saturday  night.The two countries have full diplomatic ties, but an otherwise  ambivalent and stressful relationship, particularly in light of South Africa’s  strong sympathies for the Palestinian people and its stance against Israel’s  hold on the West Bank and east Jerusalem.In addition, feelings still run  deep in South Africa over Israel’s past support for the former apartheid  regime.Gold arrived in South Africa at a particularly stressful moment,  in the midst of “Israel Apartheid Week,” an event that has the support of a  small number of politicians from the governing party, some of whom called for  sanctions against Israel. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement first  emerged in South Africa and remains strong there.Gold met with his South  African counterpart, ambassador Jerry Matjila on Thursday. The two men shook  hands publicly and were photographed standing next to the flags of both their  countries.They also issued a joint statement of cooperation, which the  BDS movement has since asked that the South African government to retract, but  it has not done so.The joint statement said that “officials from South  Africa and Israel will work together on national priority issues such as water,  agriculture, trade and science and technology. The sides also discussed the  situation in the Middle East. The sides emphasized the importance of trade  delegations in both directions.”According to the statement, “The  discussions were held in a positive atmosphere and a shared desire to deepen  dialogue and friendly relations between South Africa and Israel.”One of  Israel’s new foreign policy objectives is to improve its ties with African  countries, Gold told The Jerusalem Post.“Israel is returning to Africa  and Africa is returning to Israel,” Gold said.On Monday in Jerusalem,  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Ghanaian minister of foreign affairs  and regional integration Hanna Tetteh and spoke with her of the common values of  democracy and rule of law that our countries share. They also discussed their  joint battle against Islamic terrorism.The Prime Minister said that our  country’s relationship with Africa is very important and that most African  countries wanted to improve those ties. Netanyahu also told Tetteh that Israel  expected its allies to vote against anti-Israel resolutions at the  UN.Netanyahu is planning a major trip to Africa in July, where he is  likely to visit Kenya and Uganda to mark the 40th anniversary of the Entebbe  raid. He is not scheduled to visit South Africa.Gold said that he  has focused on the South African connection, particularly in response to  initiatives from the South African government, including President Jacob Zuma,  who sent envoys to meet with Gold. That was followed two months ago by an  invitation from the South African Foreign Ministry to visit with its  director-general.“We built on that,” Gold said. “The dialogue  went extremely well. One felt an openness and a willingness to try new  things that have never been tried before,” he said.The trip was also an  opportunity for both sides to describe their national narrative to the other in  an effort to promote better understanding, he said.Gold was careful to  visit sites that were important for post-apartheid South Africans, including  Soweto – the Johannesburg township where mass protests occurred against  apartheid and where former South African president Nelson Mandela lived when he  was the leader of the anti-apartheid movement. His home is now a  museum.“I went to Mandela’s home and I met with students there,” said  Gold.In the guest book, he wrote that he had wanted to show his respect  and that “Zionism is the national liberation movement of the Jewish  people.”He also visited the Liliesleaf Farm, a national heritage site in  northern Johannesburg, which was once a farm where members of the National  African Congress plotted to overthrow the apartheid government.A Jewish  family named Goldreich moved there, pretending to be the owners of the farm, and  Mandela – when hiding out there – played the part of their cook.Gold  said he met with children of some of the Jewish activists from the  farm. He also spoke to Jewish and Christian students at the University of  the Witwatersrand.“We tried to send a message that it is time for Israel  and South Africa to put aside their differences and to build a new  relationship,” he said.“It is important for Israel to show that we have  a strong respect for the struggle for freedom that was waged there,” he  said. “This initial visit represents an important start, but there is  considerable work still to do,” Gold said.Charisse Zeifert of the Jewish  Board of Deputies welcomed Gold’s trip, particularly given that it was during  “Israel Apartheid Week.”
“The Jewish community was very encouraged by his  visit. It showed that greater cooperation between the two countries is  possible,” she said.

<title>BDS presses South African rap-rave duo Die Antwoord to cancel Israel show</title>
<date>17/5/2016</date>
<content>
Die Antwoord, the popular South African rap-rave duo, is being pressured to cancel its scheduled performance in Israel by pro-Palestinian supporters of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.“It has come to our attention and the attention of our Israeli and Palestinian allies that you intend performing in Israel during June 2016,” South African BDS activists wrote in a letter to the group. “As fellow South Africans we are proud of our artists’ international success and, in particular, in the case of Die Antwoord, your innovative musical and performance artistry.”




The history of South Africa and the parallels between apartheid rule in that country and what is taking place in Israel serves as justification for the group to reconsider its Rishon Lezion show, scheduled for June 8.“We humbly request you as fellow South Africans to choose to stand on the side of and abide by the boycott called by Palestinian civil society in their struggle for freedom and justice – a boycott that has received increasing support from Israeli peace activists as well,” the BDS activists wrote.“We trust that you will seriously consider our request not to perform in Israel and that your decision will reflect a commitment to justice, freedom and democratic rights.”Die Antwoord, a South African Afrikaans rap group has taken the Internet by storm with explicit in-your-face lyrics, provocative performances and using cyberspace to promote their music.They perform self-styled "Zef" music - an Afrikaans term loosely meaning redneck - with explicit lyrics in Afrikaans and English which has raised some eyebrows in South Africa's mostly conservative Afrikaans community.The group has gained a significant following on social networking site Facebook and their videos on video-sharing site YouTube have been viewed more than tens of millions of times. The website, www.dieantwoord.com which streams the group's first album, has since been moved to a US-based server to handle the traffic.Die Antwoord has also built up a sizeable following on micro-blogging site Twitter with some tweets comparing the group to top rapper Eminem.

<title>Spanish court overturns regional Israel boycott</title>
<date>25/8/2016</date>
<content>
ACOM, an Israel lobby group working to combat BDS in Spain, successfully  overturned a boycott decision passed by the city council of Vélez-Málaga in the  Costa del Sol region this week.The Málaga court issued a preliminary  restraining order on the boycott decision.




Vélez-Málaga is a city of some  77,800 people in the Málaga province along the southern Mediterranean coast. The  province is home to one the largest Jewish communities in Spain, with  congregations in Málaga, Marbella and Torremolinos.Following the court’s  decision on the claim submitted by ACOM, the city council announced its  intention to annul the boycott against Israel and companies doing business with  the country.ACOM’s president Angel Mas, who has filed court proceedings  against the most prominent boycotts in Spain, said that “even as discriminatory  motions are halted every month, the aggressive boycott campaign continues, with  new anti-Semitic declarations being approved almost every week.”“In view  of the success of our legal actions against them, the BDS campaign has started  concealing to the public opinion these city council approvals in order to avoid  prompt court initiatives,” he explained.Since last week, seven new  cities with a combined population of some 406,000 people have joined the BDS  movement, according to Mas.“We call on every friend of Israel to join us  in this effort to avoid impunity and create effective deterrence,” he  said.To date, Spanish courts have declared six city council boycott  decisions null and void, and seven more have been effectively halted by  preliminary restraining orders, all as a result of court proceedings brought by  ACOM.Ignacio Wenley Palacios, the ACOM lawyer leading the anti-boycott  effort in Spain, said the BDS movement is “thinly disguised under a veil of a  deceiving human rights narrative.”“The boycott campaign is nothing but  plain discrimination on basis of national origin, affinities, and personal  beliefs,” he said. “This anti-Semitic initiative is an attack to our  constitutional rights and freedoms.”Earlier this month, Mas told The  Jerusalem Post that the BDS movement was targeting coastal municipalities as  part of its “summer campaign.”Mas explained that an endorsement of BDS  by the city council essentially commits the city to support the boycott against  Israeli and pro-Israel institutions, companies and organizations, as well as  Spanish nationals associated or sympathetic to the Jewish state.
The  council agreement declares the area a “space free of Israeli apartheid” and  calls on the municipal government to execute the boycott agreement, he said.

<title>Top legal officials: ‘Israel must break through the walls of the legal ghetto’</title>
<date>17/6/2016</date>
<content>
A who’s who of senior Israeli and Jewish legal officials on Thursday cited a  range of strategies for fighting anti-Israel lawfare at the IDC Conference in  Herzliya.Anti-Israel lawfare is a catchphrase which covers litigation  against Israeli officials in foreign courts and by international bodies going  after individuals and delegitimizing Israel generally.




Prof. Eugene  Kontorovich of Chicago’s Northwestern University put the most positive spin on  the current situation, saying that Israel and its allies were having new success  with “going on the offensive.”Kontorovich cited success in passing laws  in nine US states to ban doing business with companies which boycott Israel,  including a tenth state, New Jersey, likely on the way later Thursday.He  argued that being proactive gives Israel an advantage in “picking the time and  place” in which it fights, and will help it “break through the legal ghetto” its  enemies have tried to trap it in.Another positive sign has been Israel  and companies affiliated with it defeating cases against them throughout Europe,  he said.Describing the challenges Israel is up against, former IDF  international law division head Pnina Sharvit-Baruch said a major issue is  facing a “mix of legal criticism and slander.”She said that those trying  to delegitimize Israel have succeeded in defining it in liberal circles globally  as a law-breaker or an apartheid-style state by playing this mix and match game  expertly.They blame Israel at all times for the absence of peace, and  shift framing the conflict from one about land to one about alleged Israeli  human rights violations. The delegitimizers have taken their campaign to the UN,  the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court, she  said.Sharvit-Baruch expressed her frustration that when Israel points  out human rights violations in other countries, such as Syria, the world ignores  this. Israel is held accountable to a higher standard, she said.The  world expects more from Israel because it is a democracy, she  added.Several other speakers also took on the issue.Former  Canadian justice minister Irwin Cotler said the best way to fight anti-Israel  lawfare was by highlighting how it departs from the UN’s own universal human  rights principles.For example, while many note that Israel faces on  average 20 UN resolutions of condemnation annually compared to four for the rest  of the world, many forget that this is not merely a double standard but a  violation of basic due process legal principles.
Sharvit-Baruch’s  predecessor as head of the IDF international law division, Daniel Reisner,  recalled the early days of lawfare in 1999 when he had to defend Ariel Sharon  against an indictment in Belgium.

<title>Edelstein: BDS are Palestinians' real enemies</title>
<date>2/3/2016</date>
<content>
Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein lashed out at the BDS movement Wednesday in a speech to 40 British Parliament members at the House of Commons in London.“The BDS [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions] movement is bad at helping the Palestinians,” Edelstein said. “They are actually the real enemies of the Palestinians. Because of them, factories are moving to the Negev and 800 Palestinian families are unemployed.”




Edelstein complained to Parliament members about the stabbings of Jews throughout Israel and the construction freeze in Judea and Samaria.Anti-Israel activists in London projected written messages on the building housing the Parliament late Tuesday night, accusing Edelstein of being a “racist leader” and calling to boycott and arrest him ahead of his address.A video showing the massive text projections on a wall of the Palace of Westminster also featured a number of demonstrators holding Palestinian flags inscribed with the phrase “Boycott Israel.”“Arrest illegal occupier Edelstein,” read one of the slogans cast upon the iconic London structure.Other projections on the meeting place of both houses of the UK Parliament included: “Edelstein Israel’s apartheid speaker – out!” and “Israel’s racist leader Edelstein not welcome.”In response, Edelstein said he would remain defiant in the face of Israel’s detractors, despite the incident.“Our enemies will not deter me,” he said. “I will find both supporters and opponents together, and this is an opportunity for me to voice Israel’s stance without hesitation.”The Knesset speaker came at the invitation of House of Commons Speaker John Bercow.Edelstein met after press time Tuesday with British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. He thanked Hammond for the British government’s opposition to boycotts of Israel.Edelstein complained that most of the money going to Gaza is being spent on missiles and tunnels rather than on helping the Palestinian people.

<title>Venezuela accuses Israel of war crimes against Palestinians at UNSC</title>
<date>14/10/2016</date>
<content>
Jerusalem responded to the UN Security Council’s special debate on the  settlements on Friday by saying that characterizing the settlements as the  “obstacle to peace” recycles the “scandalous Palestinian demand that Palestine  be cleansed of any Jews.”“In any other case, a demand such as this would  be completely rejected by the international community,” senior sources in  Jerusalem said. “No one, for instance, would even think about saying that a  condition of peace would be that Israel be without Arabs.”




These comments  came in response to a discussion in the Security Council, where left-wing  Israeli NGOs Peace Now and B’Tselem joined an informal meeting, held under a  process known as the Arria Formula, which focused on the question of whether  West Bank settlements are a stumbling block to peace. The debate was convened at  the request of Angola, Malaysia, Venezuela, Senegal and Egypt.“There is  an endless list of human rights violations that the Palestinian people are  victims of, and we are convinced that Israel has committed war crimes against  Palestinians that have to be investigated and punished,” Venezuela’s Ambassador  Rafael Ramirez said.Sources in Jerusalem said that the claim that the  settlements are illegal and an obstacle to peace are baseless, and deny the deep  connection between the Jewish people and its land, similar to what UNESCO did  last week in its resolution denying a Jewish connection to the Temple  Mount.The sources continued, saying, “The settlements are not the root  of the conflict, nor an obstacle to its coming to a conclusion.The true  obstacle to peace is the continued Palestinian refusal to recognize a Jewish  state in any borders. This refusal is expressed by the demand to cleanse Judea  and Samaria of Jews, and in the endless Palestinian incitement toward  terror.”By stating that objection to settlements stemmed from a  Palestinian desire to have a state cleansed of Jews, the sources in Jerusalem  were echoing a controversial video Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released  last month. In that video, Netanyahu said that while Israel has nearly two  million Arabs living inside its borders, the Palestinian leadership “actually  demands a Palestinian state with one precondition: no Jews.”At the UN,  Ramirez vowed to “put an end to Israeli occupation, saying, “We say we reject  any terrorist acts, but we are using that argument to establish an equivalency  between the disproportionate violence of Israel against the Palestinian people  and the isolated acts of violent reactions of the Palestinian people against  Israel.“Here, certainly there can’t be a double standard. We cannot  allow the continuation of settlements and killings of Palestinian people,”  Ramirez continued. “We believe the time has come for this Security Council to do  something specific and concrete.We have had enough rhetoric and  declarations... Israeli settlements are illegal, everything Israel has done in  Palestine is illegal.”Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon responded that  Ramirez’s statement is “hypocritical and laced with anti-Israel  hatred.”Back in May, during another informal Security Council meeting on  the Palestinian question, Ramirez asked if Israel aims to perpetrate a “final  solution” against the Palestinian people, Danon recalled.“Nothing is  more ludicrous than accusing Israel of war crimes. Our record on behalf of human  rights and democracy speaks for itself. We do not accept hypocritical criticism  from countries whose own record on human rights can only be described as  horrendous,” he said.Representatives from Peace Now and B’Tselem urged  the international community to act to stop settlement expansion.Lara  Friedman, director of policy and government relations for Americans for Peace  Now, accused the Israeli government of conducting an “ugly campaign” against  “courageous” NGOs and activists who are against the country’s settlement  policy.“The occupation is a threat to Israel’s security and Israel’s  existence,” she said.“If these policies are not rolled back, they will  destroy the possibility of ever reaching a political agreement between Israel  and Palestine.”The executive director of B’Tselem, Hagai El-Ad, added  that the Security Council has “a moral responsibility” to act on the  issue.“Israel cannot have it both ways,” he said.“You cannot  occupy a people for 50 years and call yourself a democracy.”Netanyahu  slammed both of the organizations for taking part in the “mudslinging choir”  against Israel. Citing El-Ad’s appeal to the UN to take action against Israel on  the issue, he said that “what these organizations did not succeed in achieving  through democratic elections in Israel, they are trying to achieve through  international coercion.“We will continue to defend the righteousness of  our cause and our state against all international pressure,” he  said.Netanyahu spoke Saturday night with coalition chairman David Bitan  about amending the National Service law to prohibit women doing national service  from doing it for B’Tselem.Danon harshly criticized the statements to  the council. “Just two days after anti-Israel forces approved a resolution  intending to sever the historical bond between the Jewish people and Jerusalem,  Israeli organizations chose to slander and besmirch Israel’s good name at an  event organized by the Palestinian delegation,” he said. “We will continue to  fight and tell the truth about Israel, despite the attempts to spread lies about  us.”Another panelist invited to speak was François Dubuisson, a law  professor at the Université libre de Bruxelles. He urged the international  community and member states of the UN to take economic measures to ensure the  end of settlement activities and called on them to ban imports of products  coming from the settlements, end the financing of entities established there and  adopt measures to sanction national companies carrying out economic activities  linked to the settlements.Dubuisson then compared the situation in  Israel to the one in South Africa in the 1970s.“Apartheid was a  violation of international law, a situation which was condemned universally,” he  said. “But because of certain political alliances, no binding measure was able  to be adopted by the Security Council for a long time.
“It’s only with  the pressure of certain states within the United Nations and pressure by civil  society around the world that the Security Council put an arms embargo and  adopted a resolution asking states to take economic measures against the  apartheid regime,” he said. “Today we should be inspired by that precedent.”

<title>Watch: Anti-Israel protesters crash Jerusalem mayor Barkat's speech in San Francisco</title>
<date>7/4/2016</date>
<content>
Amid hostile chants of “Intifada! Intifada! Long live intifada!” and “From the  river to the sea, Palestine will be free!” dozens of anti-Israel protesters  disrupted a lecture from Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat at San Francisco State  University on Wednesday.Waving a Palestinian flag, the activists  denounced Israel as a “terrorist” and “apartheid” state, and demanded an end to  the “Israeli occupation,” and that Barkat leave the campus.




Barkat, who  recently joined Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud Party, and is rumored  to be considering a run for the premiership, is on a US campus lecture tour to  discuss Jerusalem and Israel’s policies, security, and coexistence with  Palestinian citizens.Undeterred by the hecklers, the mayor attempted to  continue his speech and engage his student audience by answering their  questions, the Jerusalem Municipality said in a statement on Thursday, which was  accompanied by a 22-second video of the disruption.“Anyone who thinks  that calls for violence and incitement will be able to silence us or divert us  from our position is mistaken,” Barkat said in response to the  incident.“We will continue to build, develop and strengthen the State of  Israel, and within it a united Jerusalem, and we will continue to voice our  opinions and our legitimacy when we are invited to do so, even in places where  they try to stop us.”Barkat added that he spoke about the protesters’  “shameful conduct” with both the university’s president, Leslie E. Wong, and San  Francisco Mayor Ed Lee.“I told them that they must not allow dangerous  incitement like this in a democratic country in general, and on campuses in  particular,” said Barkat, who is scheduled to speak on Thursday at New York’s  Columbia University.Hillel International’s vice president and general  council, Tracy Turoff, said on Thursday that San Francisco State University  abdicated its responsibility to allow freedom of speech and ensure a civil and  safe environment for Barkat and the students who attended his  lecture.“The students and the faculty who came to hear Nir Barkat last  night had a right to expect that their rights of free speech and academic  freedom would be protected,” Turoff said by phone.“The school had an  obligation to also ensure academic responsibility, and they failed to do so. The  university did not follow its own policy, and we insist they take action and the  necessary steps to deal with the perpetrators because the priority for Hillel is  that students have a safe and respected environment for open  conversation.”Turoff added that Hillel International and its chapter at  San Francisco State University have sent a formal letter to Wong addressing the  matter.
A representative of the university could not be reached for  comment.

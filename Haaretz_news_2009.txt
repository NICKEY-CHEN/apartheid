<title>Alex Sinclair / If you love Israel, then criticize its imperfections</title>
<date>Sun Mar 22 20:20:26 IST 2009</date>
<content>
If you believe, as I do, that loving Israel and criticizing Israel are two acts that can and must go together, then these are tough times. And they're going to get tougher.  
Look around the world today, and you see increasing evidence of bitter, vicious, and outrageous attacks on Israel: Israeli Apartheid week in Canada, Caryl Churchill's ten-minute diatribe-play in England.
In the words of a prominent American Jewish layleader with whom I spoke last week, the American college campus is going in the direction of Europe - it's not quite there yet, but it's on the way.
In environments such as these, how can we do anything other than defend Israel against those who hate it?  
If we express our qualms about certain policies, if we voice our dismay at the right-wing coalition that is in formation, if we "wash our dirty laundry in public," won't it just give further ammunition to the anti-Semites and anti-Zionists?  
I speak from painful personal experience here. Some of my previous pieces that originally appeared on this Web site have been cut and pasted onto sites run by Israel-haters.
I certainly understand those who would mute complexity at a time like this.  But we do ourselves a disservice, and ultimately we do Israel a disservice, if we allow ourselves to let external criticism dull our right - our obligation - to be critically loyal, to be thoughtful lovers of Israel.
In order to strengthen the position of critical loyalty, there is one key area we need to work on: soundbites.  
Complex, nuanced, balanced positions are traditionally thought of as difficult to convey in short, snappy, media-friendly statements.  However, as the following sentences demonstrate, we can convey the gist of the critical loyalty position in easy-to-digest terms, even in atmospheres of intimidation:
 You are right, the current government of Israel has some deeply mistaken policies.  But there are some really impressive figures on the Israeli left and they make me proud to be a Zionist and proud to be a Jew.  Let's talk about the different policies of the opposition parties and how we can strengthen them from abroad.  
I also think Israel should leave the territories and enable the establishment of a Palestinian state; so do thousands (probably millions) of Israelis.  There are some fantastic Israeli non-profit groups that are doing that advocacy work.  Let's talk about how to work with and support those Israelis to make it happen.
What these kinds of statements have in common is firstly, an acknowledgement of Israel's imperfection.  
In confrontational situations, this is a bold step, but it has the advantage of wrong-footing the Israel-hater.  
Secondly, after that acknowledgement comes a statement that destabilizes the monolithic picture of Israel that many non-Jews (and Jews) have. The message is that Israel contains a wide variety of voices and opinions, and while I disagree with some, perhaps even the majority, there are other deeply compelling voices in Israel that I strongly bond with.  
Thirdly, the statements end with another wrong-footing maneuver: A call to co-operate in the spirit of the two-state solution that guarantees statehood for the Palestinians and security for Israel as a Jewish state, based on international documents like the Roadmap, Annapolis, and the Geneva Accords.  
Implicit within the call for co-operation is the demand for recognition of Israel's right to exist, which in confrontational situations must be a basic and first requirement for continued debate.
We have no option but to generate soundbite responses like these.  Increasing numbers of Diaspora Jews are not able to defend the policies of the Israeli government with integrity.  
Unless we offer credible, thoughtful response mechanisms that defend Israel from its haters in a nuanced, complex way, but without muting genuine critique, we will lose an entire generation of left-leaning Diaspora Jews.
As well as saving the Jewish people, this mode of response is also our biggest weapon against Israel-haters.  
We can show them that we can be critical of Israel and still love it;  we can voice our frustration, our anger, and even our disgust with some of its policies, while supporting with unshakeable conviction its right to exist and flourish in peace; we can infuse and enrich our Jewish identities with its cultural and artistic delights even as we bridle at some of its religious extremism.  And we can do all that with soundbites, too.  
Israel: It's imperfect; I love it; help me improve it.

<title>Canada schools blasted for ban on anti-Israel 'apartheid' poster</title>
<date>Thu Feb 26 21:27:01 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Two Canadian universities came under criticism this week for banning a poster which is seen to be depicting Israelis as child-killers and accusing Israel of apartheid. Brazilian politicians and scholars, meanwhile, lambasted a recent student exchange accord between Tel Aviv University and a Catholic academy from Sao Paulo. 
The posters from Canada, which were banned from Ottawa University and Carleton University, are advertisements for an annual series of events labeled as "Israeli Apartheid Week," due to begin on Monday, March 1. The "Israeli Apartheid Week" tradition began in 2005 in Toronto, spreading since to other campuses and cities.
The poster, circulated by pro-Palestinian activists, depicts a gunship with the word "Israel" on it firing a missile at a boy wearing a kaffiyeh and holding a teddy bear. In explaining the ban, Ottawa University said: "All posters approved must promote a campus culture where all members of the community can play a part in a declaration of human rights." 
The poster has roused controversy in Canadian and international press and on campuses, where supporters of Israel said it was unacceptably portraying Israelis as child-killers - an old anti-Semitic theme. 
One student from the Ottawa university, who preferred their names be withheld from this article, told Haaretz that the decision to ban the posters was "a blatant violation of free expression for students speaking out on human rights." 
Activists also circulated letters and emails with phone numbers for the universities' directors, urging students to call and protest. Pro-Palestinian activist Jessica Carpinone argued that Carleton officials have given "no valid reason for banning the poster other than that it's a controversial issue."
B'nai Brith Canada executive vice-president Frank Dimant praised the universities' action but said the colleges should ban the week's entire "hate fest."
"Israel should be treated as an apartheid state"
Commenting on the student exchange agreement between the Brazilian university and Tel Aviv University, Valter Pomar, foreign relations secretary for Brazil's ruling party, the PT, told Haaretz that "now is not the time for such accords." 
The accord was the first signing of a cooperation initiative between a Brazilian and an Israeli university since Israel's operation in Gaza.
Pomar added: "It would be proper to apply to the Israeli government the same treatment that the apartheid government of South Africa had received," said Pomer, who stressed he was speaking in his private capacity and not for the party.
Last month, Pomar cosigned an official announcement by the party accusing Israel of "state terrorism" and comparing its actions in Gaza to Nazi blitzes.
Brazilian priest Jos√© Oscar Beozzo, a prominent theologian from Sao Paulo, also indicated his reservations about the exchange deal, citing "Israel's condemnable massacre in Gaza."

<title>Heavily Jewish Brooklyn food co-op mulls ban on Israel produce</title>
<date>Mon Feb 23 13:04:43 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Located in the heart of Brooklyn, near Prospect Park, the Park Slope Food Coop is at the nexus of the borough's many diverse Jewish populations. From the liberal Jews of Park Slope to the Hasidic Jews of Crown Heights, the coop is one of the few places in Brooklyn where Jews of all denominations converge in a shared mission: to buy natural foods at reasonable prices.
But the co-op's unusual Jewish character is being tested by a proposal to ban products bought from Israel, such as the persimmons and red peppers that are currently in the produce aisle.
Since the Gaza operation, there has been a rash of campaigns around the world to divest from Israel and to boycott its products. At Hampshire College this month, a spat ensued when a pro-Palestinian student group erroneously announced that the school was the first American college to divest from Israel. Israeli tennis star Shahar Peer was denied a visa to play at a major tournament in Dubai, and Britain has experienced ongoing efforts to boycott Israeli academic institutions.
The proposal at the co-op is not likely to be economically meaningful; perhaps a few shipments of vegetables are at stake. But the debate is taking place in a rare hotbed of diverse Jewish life.
"There are so many Jews who shop there, there are so many Israelis who shop there, there's a huge number of frum people from all over Brooklyn who shop there," said Rabbi Andy Bachman of Brooklyn's largest and most active reform congregation, Beth Elohim, "so my guess is that if it passes, and I want to emphasize that I don't think it will, they will lose a lot of members."
Bachman's congregation is known as a hub for Brooklyn's progressive Jews, and it has served as a home for the co-op's monthly meetings, including the one at which the boycott proposal was first raised.
Bachman said he received several e-mails on the subject, a few of which came from congregants asking if the synagogue was taking any action. Bachman said that his only plan is to attend the meeting when the ban is discussed, and place his name on a list of people who would like to speak. He said that if the ban does pass, it is likely that the synagogue will ask the co-op to find a different space to rent for its general meetings.
"It will remain an irrelevant gesture to 5 million Israelis and 2 million Palestinians, but it will make someone in Park Slope feel really good about themselves," he said. That's what this is about; it's about the political purity, which is part of Park Slope?s unique self-absorption."
Bachman does not, though, speak for all Brooklyn Jews, despite having founded an organization with that name. Carol Wald, a Jewish co-op member living in the area, was one of two people to send letters to the co-op's home-grown newspaper, the Linewaiters' Gazette, encouraging the boycott discussion.
"All points of view really need to be heard," she said. "If we start proposing things like boycotts, it'll prompt more discussion, and that'll help educate people."
Since it was founded in 1973, the co-op has grown into a neighborhood institution with a membership of nearly 15,000. All members are required to work monthly shifts. According to Allen Zimmerman, general coordinator and produce buyer at the co-op, that philosophy attracts people from all walks of life.
"A lot of people are here for the tofu, but a lot of people are here for the beef and pork," he said.
On the Jewish side, the co-op has its own kosher committee, which vets purchases of kosher meat and other products.
The push for an Israel boycott adds to the co-op's long history of political action. Nestle products were voted out by the membership, because of the company?s campaign to promote infant formula instead of breastfeeding, and members rallied around a ban of South African goods during the apartheid regime.
The proposal to boycott Israeli goods was first raised by a woman who gives her name as Hima B., a co-op member of South Asian decent, during the "open forum" at the general meeting in January. She faced no vocal opposition, according to people who were there, and was told to create an agenda item for a general meeting in the future.
"She spoke for less than 60 seconds, and nobody questioned it," said Zimmerman, who was in attendance that night, along with an estimated 275 others.
Hima said she has since recruited 10 other members and hopes to put the issue on the agenda for an upcoming general meeting.
"There have been other attempts in the past to call for a boycott of Israeli goods. I don't think it went anywhere," she said. A member for nearly five years, Hima was motivated to take action after learning more about the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians. "Economic sanctions worked in South Africa. Why shouldn't we ask for an end to practices that are violating human rights?" she said.
Though many members are unaware of the proposal - only the most active go to the general meeting, or read the Linewaiters' Gazette - Jewish groups and synagogues have been sending e-mails and making phone calls.
Many believe that such a boycott could never pass, given the co-op's diversity.
Michael Barrish, a 48-year-old Web developer who was shopping on February 17, said the ban is absurd. He believes it would be shouted down by Jews who support Israel, and laughed at by those who find a ban of this nature preposterous. But, Barrish said, "I like being a member of a place in which you can propose what you believe."

<title>Israel supporters protest anti-Israel book launch in London </title>
<date>Sun Jul 12 03:37:01 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
An anti-Israel literary event in London on Thursday drew a strong pro-Israel contingent, according to participants and organizers, who said that some 25 percent of attendees came there to defend Israel.
Despite this, the event's organizers refused to admit one of the top figures of Britain's Zionist Federation.
The event - held on the anniversary of the International Court of Justice's contested 2004 ruling that the West Bank separation fence is illegal - was hosted at Toynbee Hall by an organization called War on Want, a self-described charity that supports boycotting Israel.
A book there by journalist Ben White entitled Israeli Apartheid: A Beginner's Guide had its launch at the event, which was followed by a panel discussion.
According to participants and organizers, some 50 to 80 people attended, more than 15 of whom had come to protest the book and tell Israel's side of the story. Jonathan Hoffman, co-vice chair of Britain's Zionist Federation, was refused entry. 
Hoffman stood outside the venue handing out flyers, in which he accused the author and event organizers of promoting a "farrago of false quotations, inaccuracies and omissions which is aimed at young people."
Author Ben White has argued that Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad did not deny the Holocaust. In 2002, White published an article in which he wrote that he can "understand" why some people are anti-Semitic, though he himself was not.
War on Want praised his new book as an "information-packed, highly readable introduction to understanding the origins of the conflict and how apartheid applies to Palestine."
While standing outside the venue, Hoffman was questioned by police, who then allowed him to continue handing out flyers. Jonathan Sacerdoti, one of the Israel supporters who attended the event, said organizers called the police to complain about Hoffman, but the organizers deny this.
"We didn't call the police," said John Hilary, War on Want executive director. "Organizers of past events told us Mr. Hoffman would create a disturbance and we don't want such people to attend." But Sacerdoti says that "anyone who knows Jonathan Hoffman knows this claim is nonsense." 
Hilary said the discussion was "robust" featuring "strong debate" by people "from all sides, who spoke with passion." He added he welcomed the attendance of people who had come there to oppose the opinions expressed in the book and by War on Want, as they "encouraged and enriched the debate."

<title>JEWISH WORLD / A plea to Jews everywhere, unprepared to fight anti-Semitism</title>
<date>Mon Mar 16 16:43:23 IST 2009</date>
<content>
I have always felt that decency will prevail and that anti-Semitism, racism and hatred wherever they stand will ultimately be contained. 
This is the Jewish way. I have faith that evil will eventually scatter and run, and goodness and tolerance will prevail. I have not been shaken from these beliefs, but I am shaken.
Over the last little while, there has been an abundance of news showing anti-Semitism is on the rise in my country, Canada. 
A court ruling finding a Native 'elder' accused of spreading hatred against the Jewish people has been overturned. Hooliganism against Jews and Israel Apartheid Week is on our university campuses, and a resolution was passed by an Ontario public employees union barring Israeli academics from speaking and lecturing in our universities. 
There is cause for concern and this is Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I can only imagine how the Jews of France must feel. 
Of equal concern is the fact that Jewish communities everywhere are once again unprepared to fight anti-Semitism effectively and our leadership has failed, so far, in developing a community mobilization plan. 
There are no voices emanating from Israel, the Jewish federations, B'nai Briths or synagogue pulpits letting us know that someone somewhere is working on a collective long term strategy to fight anti-Semitism, protect Israel's reputation, and counter the virulent and aggressive language and activities of news bureaus, online bloggers and website authors.  
Simply put, after years of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on Holocaust education and buildings memorializing our 'kedoshim', the six million who died, we seemed to have learned very little. We are still far too comfortable and fooled by the success we have discovered; still too reliant on others to protect us, and still blind to the reality that the Jewish world has the ability to create a worldwide community mobilization plan that could stymie much of the anti-Semitic and anti-Israel filth emanating from dozens of corners and crannies around the globe, from the Vatican to Venezuela.  
So, I call on you, Jewish community members to demand of our leadership a community mobilization plan. Call up your Israel Consular General, Rabbis, leaders of the UJA/Federations, B'nai Briths and other such organizations and ask them where and when you can meet to determine your participation in a plan that will strengthen and protecting the Jewish people. 
Ask them what resources are required to make such a plan a reality. 
Ask them how we can all work together to create a force, composed of Jews of every denomination, together with our non-Jewish friends, to defend ourselves against the upside-down world that sees us as responsible for the economic downturn, the depression of the Muslim world and any other 'flavor of  the month' issue.
Tell them you have some ideas such as: launching a campaign to raise $100 million worldwide to finance this plan ? something we are good at; using the currently available Birthright and March of the Living participants to spearhead a team of young people to counter their anti-Israel and anti-Semitic counterparts; creating a local, national and international team of Jewish bloggers who can counter anti-Semitism online; befriending non-Jews who can aid and assist in our struggle; creating community workshops to meet those people in our community and around the world who are sitting on the anti-Semite fence, or even those who speak negatively about us but can be convinced.
Historically, the Diaspora Jewish communities have never been well prepared to fight anti-Semitism. Israel has been of little help. This is a sad reality and the results have been dismal. But we live in a different world now, one in which battles can be fought over the internet and education of the masses happens through a push of a few buttons. 
We have many friends in the Christian, Muslim, Bahia, Buddhist and Hindu world after years of defending them against human rights abuses. We have colleagues in Aboriginal communities and neighbors who respect us for our safe streets.  
Our friends are everywhere, from Hungary to New Haven. It is time we call on them for a favor, help and support.
It is time we tap into the available philanthropic funds and no-how that has been built up in every major metropolitan centre in the world, to create a fundraising campaign that will underwrite this plan. Despite recent financial woes and the fifty billion actions of a destructive member of our community, funds are still available and a Community Mobilization emergency campaign will prove that. 
If you think this is hyperbole than go to Israel Apartheid Week happening on 42 campuses around the world, and sit in on a lecture or film. Listen closely to the words the speakers will use. You will know the words because they have been spoken before. They are words that marginalize and syllables that when pieced together, stigmatize.  They are words that are not foreign to Holocaust survivors.
Call your Jewish leaders and demand a plan. I beg you to do so. Tell them that we need a responsible and aggressive strategy that includes every man, woman and child - one that will fend off fists that try to beat us, shut the mouths that try to break us, and transform hatred into goodness where we are able.  
Now is the time, to take action. Your children are expecting you to fight, and every Jew who ever suffered or died at the hands of an anti-Semite is calling out to us. 
We will not fail ourselves! We can not. We know too much and are far too talented and resourceful. I believe times have changed. So should you.
I have not been shaken from my beliefs that people are still good, but I am shaken.

<title>Mendel Kaplan, 1936-2009 / Jewish leader, philanthropist, family man</title>
<date>Sun Nov 22 00:56:10 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Mendel Kaplan once told me that the key to success was focus. I witnessed it in all his efforts. Details concerned him greatly, but he never lost sight of the big picture. Indeed, he created the big picture.  
Mendel, who passed away Thursday after suffering a stroke, initiated, led and funded numerous Jewish, Zionist and other projects in South Africa and throughout the Jewish world. He was honorary president of Keren Hayesod and a former chairman of the Jewish Agency's Board of Governors. I know little about Cape Gate, the family business Mendel's father Isaac founded 80 years ago. Tomorrow, we were meant to attend an anniversary gala celebrating eight decades. Instead we should celebrate Mendel's life.  
There is much to celebrate in his 73 years: Cape Gate has been transformed from a modest business selling products like wrought iron and garden benches into a vast conglomerate producing its own steel; it became one of the largest privately owned companies in South Africa. The expansion was largely orchestrated by Mendel and his brother Robert.  
Cape Gate is a family concern. Family was Mendel's passion. Contact was maintained across continents. Newsletters found their way to every relative. Mendel and his loving wife Jill loved reunions. Everyone's progress was followed and appreciated. Mendel encouraged their efforts.  
Board meetings at the Isaac and Jessie Kaplan Centre for Jewish Studies and Research at the University of Cape Town were always exciting. Mendel knew balance sheets were not my strongest suit. But he would leave that alone.  
Projects, conferences and research interested him. There were no formalities. It was down to business. Mendel laughed at the stuffiness of university mores. With uncanny business acumen and total recall, he was able to juggle myriad activities and projects with mesmerizing precision. He cut to the quick.  
Mendel's law degree from the University of Cape Town and his master's in business administration from Columbia University in New York no doubt stood him in great stead. But it was his creativity, vision and focus that set him apart. A working lunch on his lovely patio overlooking False Bay in Cape Town would always be interrupted by calls from abroad - the Jerusalem Zoo, an Israeli cabinet minister, or an old friend from school.  
Mendel was always three steps ahead. He provided direction and ideas. But he also appreciated contestation. Exchanges were often tense but always underpinned by loyalty. Mendel teased me for many years about a rather strong letter a colleague and I wrote to him on the vexed question of representing Jews and apartheid in the South African Jewish Museum, which he established.  
When Mendel set his mind to something, he was unstoppable. He had a passion for matters Jewish. A deeply spiritual man, he was always reading, learning and writing. His most recent book recorded his travels as a young man in East Africa. It was written for his grandchildren.  
Mendel was immersed in South African and international Jewish affairs. His was a household name in the Jewish world. Although he moved in hallowed circles, Mendel always had time for lesser mortals. More than that, he cared for them. On one occasion he was hugely embarrassed when a suburban tabloid innocently published a list of donations following a request for funds to repair the Church roof in St. James, a seaside suburb where Mendel enjoyed his southern summers. Mendel's contribution dwarfed the others. I'm sure this was always the case.  
But he preferred the Maimonidean way. The Kaplan Centre too has appreciated his generosity. I know the Centre meant much to him, although it was only one of many flourishing ventures he created in a life dedicated to the Jewish people, to Israel, to family and to the less fortunate.  
Prof. Milton Shain is director of the Isaac and Jessie Kaplan Centre for Jewish Studies and Research at the University of Cape Town.

<title>Report: Jewish Fatah member nominated for party's Revolutionary Council</title>
<date>Sat Aug 08 21:02:48 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
A Jewish member of Fatah was nominated for a spot on the party's Revolutionary Council on Saturday, the Palestinian news agency Ma'an reported. 
Dr. Uri Davis told Ma'an that one of Fatah's weakest attributes has been its failure to establish ties with international parties, movements and human rights organizations, and promised to step up efforts, if elected.
Born to Jewish parents in Jerusalem, Davis describes himself as a Palestinian Hebrew.
Davis has written a series of books and articles that classify the State of Israel as an apartheid state, alleging that Israel's policies towards Palestinians, including Palestinian citizens of Israel, are comparable to South Africa's apartheid policies.
According to Ma'an, Davis explained that every Fatah member can run for a post on the party's 120-member Revolutionary Council regardless of religion, race or color. 
While it is common for Palestinian Christians to support Fatah and hold positions within the organization, Davis would likely be the first Jewish member of its Revolutionary Council if elected, the news agency said. He already serves as a Fatah-affiliated observer member (non-Palestinian) of the Palestinian National Council, to which he was appointed by the late Yasser Arafat in 1984.
Davis was recruited to Fatah in the 1980s by Palestine Liberation Organization leader and founder Khalil Al-Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad, who was assassinated in 1988 by an Israeli commando unit led by current Defense Minister Ehud Barak in Tunisia, the Palestinian news agency reported. 
"I wasn't convinced that the Israeli left-wing parties were satisfactory because all of them are Zionist parties," Davis explained. "Thus, I examined Palestinian left-wing parties but discovered that most of them adopted Marxism," such as the secular Popular and Democratic Fronts for the Liberation of Palestine.
"However I was pro-socialism rather than Marxism, so I joined Fatah because it contained a liberal framework that encompasses contradictory yet harmonious ideologies," he added. "The movement has struggled to liberate land and people from occupation."

<title>South Africa Jews slam deputy FM's anti-Semitic comments</title>
<date>Wed Jan 28 16:26:18 IST 2009</date>
<content>
South Africa's Jewish community on Wednesday lodged a complaint of hate speech against the country's deputy foreign minister, who earlier this month said that "Jewish money controls America and most Western countries."
Stressing that the South African Jewish Board of Deputies "usually prefers dialogue," the Board's national director, Wendy Kahn, told Haaretz: "Deputy Minister Fatima Hajaig had crossed all limits."
Kahn, who is in Israel to attend the World Jewish Congress in Jerusalem, called Hajaig's comments "a demonstration of anti-Semitism of the oldest and most classical kind."  
The Board filed the complaint against Hajaig to the country's Human Rights Commission - a national institution with some investigative and executive powers, which derives its powers from the post-apartheid constitution. 
In the complaint, the Board quotes what Hajaig said at a pro-Palestinian rally in Lenasia on January 14. "They in fact control [America], no matter which government comes in to power, whether Republican or Democratic, whether Barack Obama or George Bush," Hajaig was heard saying.  
She also said: "The control of America, just like the control of most Western countries, is in the hands of Jewish money and if Jewish money controls their country then you cannot expect anything else." 
The minister, who is out of the country, has so far not commented on the complaint, nor has the government clarified its position on the controversial comments. However, Kahn noted the administration has been "overall more evenhanded toward Israel during the Gaza operation' than during the 2006 Lebanon War." Hajaig's comments, Kahn said, were the exception.  
In the Board's announcement about the complaint, chairman Zev Krengel said that although  the decision "had not been taken lightly," it was necessary because "not since the era of pro-Nazi Nationalist MPs more than half a century ago had such statements been made against Jews by a senior government official." 
The Democratic Alliance of the opposition has called for Hajaig to be sacked if she did not offer an immediate public apology. Party spokeswoman Lindiwe Mazibuko said: "It is incumbent upon Hajaig to immediately apologize to the people of South Africa in general, the Jewish community in particular, and to US President Barack Obama.? 
The Israeli Foreign Ministry also recently complained to the South African government about Hajaig, after she used harsh and "undiplomatic" language in speaking with Israel?s ambassador to South Africa, Dov Segev-Steinberg, during the Gaza operation. 
According to various sources, Hajaig accused the ambassador of bringing a diplomat of Ethiopian descent to the embassy "only because he was black," presumably in order to counter the often-heard accusation in South Africa alleging that Israel is an apartheid state.

<title>South Africa politician apologizes for saying 'Jewish money controls America' </title>
<date>Wed Feb 04 19:35:28 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Following increasing pressure from South Africa's Jewish community, the country's deputy foreign minister apologized on Wednesday to the republic's president for saying last month that "Jewish money controls America."
Meanwhile, the South African dock workers union said its workers would refuse servicing an Israeli ship.
"Deputy Minister [Fatima Hajaig] expressed her deep regret to President [Kgalema Motlanthe]," the government said. "She accepted that the comments were contrary to stated government policy. She subsequently apologized unreservedly and unequivocally for the comments and agreed to withdraw them unconditionally."
The cabinet also termed Haijaig's comment, which she made on January 14 at a pro-Palestinian rally in Lenasia, "anti-Semitic." 
Last week the South African Jewish Board of Deputies filed a complaint of "hate speech" against Haijaig with the Human Rights Commission - a government body with some judicial and executive powers.
"We are quite happy with this apology," the Board's national chairman, Zev Krengel, told Haaretz. "Without a doubt, it's the result of pressure that we've applied." Krengel added the Board has not yet decided on whether to withdraw the complaint against Hajaig. But the cabinet said that the president has accepted her apology "and trusts that the matter has been concluded satisfactorily."
On Tuesday, Hajaig offered an earlier apology over the radio, which the Board rejected, saying it only "served to compound the original insult." In the beginning of the earlier radio apology, Hajaig deplored "the attempts of Zionists to justify policies that have worsened the crisis in the Middle East" and "unmitigated state violence directed against unarmed civilians." She reserved the same criticism for "indiscriminate attacks against Israeli unarmed civilians."
After delivering 300-odd words about her regional vision, Hajaig arrived at the controversial statement and said: "I conflated Zionist pressure with Jewish influence. I regret the inference made by some that I am anti-Jewish."
She added: "To the extent that my statement may have caused hurt and pain, I offer an unequivocal apology for the pain it may have caused to the people of our country and the Jewish community in particular."
Just hours before Hajaig's apology to the president, South Africa's largest trade union federation announced its members intend to refuse to service a ship scheduled to come in from Israel to Durban Port on Sunday. The union  called this a "historic development." 
The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) - which has approximately 1.8 million members ? added that following Israel's military campaign in Gaza last month, it is resolved to "strengthen the campaign in South Africa for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Apartheid Israel."

<title>U.S. Jews blast plan for anti-Israel UN official to attend Holocaust prayer service</title>
<date>Fri Jan 23 19:54:42 IST 2009</date>
<content>
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon will take part Saturday in a prayer service at a Manhattan synagogue to mark "World Holocaust Day".
Local Jewish leaders criticized the fact that President of the United Nations General Assembly Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann plans to take part in the service. 
Brockmann has been criticized heavily for a number of anti-Israel statements he has made in the past, including calling Israel an Apartheid state, and saying that Israel is 'crucifying the Palestinians', a statement that was widely taken to be anti-Semitic and not just anti-Israel.
Brockmann also accused Israel of committing 'Genocide' during the recent IDF operations in Gaza. 
The UN has so far not responded to calls for Brockmann not to attend, saying only that Ban was expected to be present at the prayer service.

<title>Why are American Jews abandoning Israel?</title>
<date>Mon Oct 05 18:22:34 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Why are American Jews abandoning us? Why do American Jews hold Israel to a higher standard than they do any other country in the world - including the one they so proudly call home?
As an American professor on sabbatical in Israel, I field questions like these on a regular basis. The "waning American Jewish love affair with Israel" - as the subtitle of Steven Rosenthal's 2001 book "Irreconcilable Differences?" put it - is big news here.
Israelis, living as they do in a highly dangerous neighborhood, know that they can scarcely afford to lose friends. It is no secret that well-armed terrorists committed to Israel's total destruction lie just over the border in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel is also within Iran's missile range. The specter of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad fingering a nuclear trigger and calculating how many Israelis he can kill in a "first strike" reminds even the most stubbornly self-reliant of Israelis why friends abroad are so vital.
So when the Hebrew Union College sociologist Steven M. Cohen warns of "a growing distancing from Israel of American Jews... most pronounced among younger Jews," Israelis take notice. And well they should. When someone as passionate as Forward columnist Jay Michaelson, who speaks Hebrew and lived for a time in Jerusalem, writes, as he did in a recent essay, of his "waning love of Israel," they know that they face a problem.
To be sure, this is not an Orthodox problem. The young Jews whom Cohen surveyed were almost entirely non-Orthodox. Michaelson and his social circle (where "supporting Israel is like supporting segregation, apartheid or worse") are not Orthodox either. Young Jews who do identify as Orthodox - between 10% and 20% of their age cohort - generally support Israel ardently.
As for other young Jews, Brandeis University researcher Ted Sasson reminds us that young people have for years been more critical than their elders of Israel. Even decades ago, youthful organizations like the New Jewish Agenda and Breira dissented from Israel's policies. Support for Israel, he argues, generally increases with age and experience.
There is, nevertheless, a critical difference between support for Israel in the past and today. For much of the 20th century, the Israel of American Jews - the Zion that they imagined in their minds, wrote about and worked to realize - was a mythical Zion, a utopian extension of the American dream. Proponents conjured up a Zion that they described as a "social commonwealth." They conceived of it both as an "outpost of democracy," spreading America's ideals eastward, and as a Jewish refuge where freedom, liberty and social justice would someday reign supreme.
Louis Brandeis, the great lawyer and Supreme Court justice who for a pivotal time around World War I led the American Zionist movement, served as high priest and chief prophet for this vision of Zion. The Zionist "Declaration of Principles" known as the Pittsburgh Program, produced in 1918 under his direction, called, among other things, for "political and civil equality irrespective of race, sex, or faith"; public ownership of land and natural resources; "the cooperative principle" applied to industry, agriculture and commerce, and "free public instruction."
Brandeis's goal was to create not just a Jewish state, but a utopian Jewish state - one that drew on American experience; took advantage of the latest in social, economic and political thinking, and conformed to prophetic teachings. "Our aim is the Kingdom of Heaven," he once exclaimed, and the declaration reveals much about the kind of Zion that he and many Jews of an earlier era envisaged: nothing less than a heaven on earth.
This dream long outlasted Brandeis. My generation of American Jews was raised to view the Zionist project through similarly rose-colored glasses. Now, though, that dream, which had more to do with the lofty visions of American Jews than with the sordid realities of the Middle East, lies shattered beyond repair. In place of the utopia that we had hoped Israel might become, young Jews today often view Israel through the eyes of contemporary media: They fixate upon its unloveliest warts.
Israelis who question me about the waning American Jewish love affair with Israel nod comprehendingly when I offer them this explanation. After all, they have seen many of their own Zionist dreams ground down by years of war. In both countries, the ardor of young love, with all of its unrealistic hopes and passions and dreams, has given way to middle-aged realities.
When the bloom falls off of young love, there are always those who announce that their relationship is in trouble and prepare for divorce. So it is today with too many American Jews and their "waning love" for Israel. The deepest and most meaningful of relationships, however, survive disappointments. By focusing upon all that they nevertheless share in common, and all that they might yet accomplish together in the future, American Jews and Israelis can move past this crisis in their relationship and settle in, as partners, for the long haul ahead.

<title>Why aren't Jews outraged by Israeli occupation?</title>
<date>Wed Jun 17 16:41:44 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
During this year's AIPAC conference in Washington, Executive Director Howard Kohr warned the 7,000-plus crowd that the global movement to "delegitimize Israel" was gathering steam. 
"These voices are laying the predicate for an abandonment," he said. His sentiments were almost apocalyptic: "The stakes in that battle are nothing less than the survival of Israel, linked inexorably to the relationship between Israel and the United States. In this battle we are the firewall, the last rampart."
The age of Barack Obama has unleashed a global wave of Jewish unease over Israel's future and the Diaspora's relationship to the self-described Jewish state. It's a debate that is long overdue. 
Zionist organizations in Australia campaigned loudly in May against the allegedly "anti-Semitic" play Seven Jewish Children, a ten-minute think-piece written by an English playwright accusing Jews of complicity in violence against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. 
A Jewish columnist for The New York Times, Roger Cohen, argued in June that the key word among Palestinians now is "humiliation."
"It's not good for the Palestinians, the Israelis or the Jewish soul," he wrote. The Jewish Week editor chastised him for such views - for "the anger, blame and one-sidedness of his argument" - and wondered "whose heart?has grown brutal?" 
An upcoming academic conference at York University in Toronto exploring the "one-state, bi-national solution" to the conflict was slammed last week by Gerald M. Steinberg, chair of the Department of Political Science at Bar Ilan University, for  fueling "the vicious warfare and mass terror" against Israelis and Palestinians. 
The decades-old ability of Zionist groups to manage the public narrative of Israeli victimhood is breaking down. Damning critics has therefore become a key method of control. 
But, writes Salon.com's Glenn Greenwald, a leading Jewish-American blogger, "whereas these smear tactics once inspired fear in many people, now they just inspire pity. They no longer work." 
He may be overly optimistic, but alternative Jewish voices are rising who are less concerned with being accused of "self-hatred" or treachery. They see it as their duty to damn what is wrong and not simply support Israeli government policies. 
A thinking, more enlightened Judaism is emerging, a necessity in the face of apartheid realities. The cause is human rights, not Zionist exclusion. 
Obama's recent speech in Cairo reflected the new Jewish consciousness. American Jews were certainly an intended audience because if it this group that must challenge their conservative spokespeople to undo years of following Likudnik thinking. As a candidate in 2008, the then Illinois senator said that, "there is a strain within the pro-Israel community that says unless you adopt an unwavering pro-Likud approach to Israel that you're anti-Israel and that can't be the measure of our friendship with Israel."
Many Jews in the Diaspora have never imagined anything else; it's been an imagined Israel in their minds for decades. Lawless behavior in the occupied territories is ignored through willful ignorance. Tellingly, the most reliable information about these truths in the West is found online, through blogs and activist Web sites, and not generally in the mainstream media. The gate-keepers are clinging on to the Exodus myths for dear life. 
Defining a humane Judaism in the 21st century means condemning the brutal military occupation in the West Bank and resisting the ongoing siege of Gaza. 
Jewish-American blogger Phil Weiss, who recently returned from the Strip, quoted a young Gazan saying in dismay: "We are being experimented on." 
The Palestinian narrative is routinely ignored or dismissed in the U.S. and beyond. This must change quickly for any chance of peace to break out in the Middle East. However, peace without justice is guaranteed to fail. 
After Obama?s speech in Cairo, where which he almost acknowledged the Palestinian "Nakba" without mentioning it by name, most major Jewish-American groups reacted with caution. 
The Anti-Defamation League said it was "disappointed that the President found the need to balance the suffering of the Jewish people in a genocide to the suffering of the Palestinian people resulting from Arab wars." 
This was code for "Nakba"-denial, as pernicious as Holocaust revisionism. 
But the liberal J Street lobby, still clinging to the delusion of a viable two-state solution and a "democratic, Jewish homeland," praised Obama?s "active diplomacy" and claimed that the "overwhelming majority of American Jews" supported an end to the West Bank colonies. 
Consistent polls suggest they are right, but the devil is in the detail. Is there real will to back the necessary steps, namely the removal of hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers in the West Bank? 
Co-Author of The Israel Lobby, Stephen Walt, said recently that he couldn't understand why more American Jews didn't realize the cliff Israel was running toward. Did they not see that repression in the occupied territories had defined Israel in the eyes of the world? Perhaps apartheid didn't bother them. Out of sight and out of mind. Benjamin Netanyahu's recent speech at Bar-Ilan University suggested he wasn't too fussed, either. 
I recently attended the Salute to Israel parade in New York ? picture 100,000 American Jews marching to celebrate the state, waving flags in praise of the IDF. It was a thoroughly depressing affair. Palestinians didn't exist; they were invisible. The world's biggest public display of pro-Israel feeling had no room for 20 percent of the Israeli population (let alone the millions in the West Bank and Gaza.) 
These events are actually a sign of desperate projection, not strength. Mainstream Zionism wants to completely shield Jews from the uncomfortable facts of the Israeli occupation and Palestinian self-determination. Jews were a proud people, a clever people and a victimized people. There was no time to indulge in frivolous Arab trivialities. 
But facts have an uncomfortable way of seeping back into view. Colonel Itai Virob, an IDF brigade commander in the West Bank, recently told an Israeli court that, "a slap, sometimes a punch to the scruff of the neck or the chest, sometimes a knee jab or strangulation to calm somebody [a Palestinian] down is reasonable."
Where is the Jewish outrage over this?

<title>Abbas: Isolate Netanyahu gov't like Hamas </title>
<date>Thu Feb 12 02:07:09 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas has conducted an international campaign in recent weeks aimed at the diplomatic isolation of a right-wing government headed by Likud chairman Benjamin Netanyahu. Abbas has been trying to convince the international community that such an Israeli government must face conditions similar to those faced by the Hamas government.  
A senior political source in Jerusalem said yesterday that the leaders of France, Britain and Italy have promised Abbas that they would not allow any new Israeli government delay or freeze the peace process. The same source said that Netanyahu's statements on continuing the peace process and on "economic peace" are perceived by Abbas and his aides as "empty promises."  
As such the Palestinian Authority prepared a plan for "diplomatic resistance" to Israel. The purpose of the plan is to offer an alternative to the "military resistance" of Hamas and preserve Fatah as a relevant force, even in the absence of a peace process.  
Making the rounds 
Abbas met last week with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and discussed with them his deep concerns about the establishment in Israel of a right-wing government headed by Netanyahu. Abbas stressed that such a development means a death blow to the peace process. He also expressed concern that Netanyahu's leadership would result in renewed expansion of settlements in the West Bank.  
During all his meetings, Abbas compared a right-wing government in Israel to the Palestinian unity government of Fatah and Hamas, which followed the Mecca Accords in 2007. "You refused to fully cooperate with such a government because Hamas did not meet the Quartet's conditions on ending terrorism and recognizing Israel," Abbas told the European leaders. "You will have to adopt a similar stance toward an Israeli government that will oppose the creation of a Palestinian state and genuine negotiations over the core issues of a permanent settlement," he added.  
Abbas demanded that the three leaders adopt the Quartet's clear conditions for a right-wing government in Israel, including the agreement on a vision for two states, the Annapolis process which was backed by UN Security Council resolution 1850, and a freezing of construction in the settlements.  
Seeking sanctions 
The Palestinian leader added that if the new government in Israel does not meet these conditions it should be isolated, and sanctions should be imposed on it similar to those imposed on the Hamas government or the apartheid regime of South Africa.  
Sarkozy, Brown and Berlusconi told Abbas that they will not accept a freeze in the peace process and an abandonment of the vision for the establishment of a Palestinian state.  
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner and his British counterpart David Miliband stressed that "we will not allow Israel to perpetuate the occupation in the West Bank under the guise of economic gestures of good will."

<title>A few words of advice for Israel's new diplomatic face in the U.S.</title>
<date>Sun Jul 12 13:06:57 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
When's the last time the Government of Israel made a decision that really and truly made you proud?   This week's This Hyphenated Life column is dedicated to just such a moment. 
While Bibi's speech to the Arab world in Cairo last month might have done it for some, in most cases, this bloated government is not a source of inspiration.
Yet, I had such a 'wow, that's terrific' reaction after hearing that Michael Oren was appointed as Israel's next ambassador to the United States.  Rather than just echo the initial reactions, let's both provide perspective and look forward.
Not only is it the best thing Bibi's done so far during his current term - in one masterful stroke he helped make up for the off-putting pick of Lieberman as foreign minister - he laid the groundwork for a very different kind of diplomat. 
Let's face it: the usual suspects are either a political appointee who is a friend of the prime minister or a foreign ministry careerist living the good life abroad before being sent back to unlivable wages in Jerusalem.  Dressing in bad suits, speaking bad English, repeating bad policy and too often, making bad impressions.
I know.  I worked for, and with, too many that fit this description. While there are many exceptions including impressive members of the Foreign Ministry, from Israel's Ambassador to Australia, Yuval Rotem, to the Ambassador to France, Danny Scheck - too many official representatives of the state of Israel serving abroad are in need of a makeover. 
That's why Oren's selection has the precision and unexpectedness of a successful pre-emptive strike by the IDF.
It's not just the fact that he's a skilled communicator, but like that other famous American who now lives on Pennsylvania Avenue, he's of similar age, with an Ivy League degree, a professor at a respected university (Georgetown no less), and a fellow author of best selling books.  
If you haven't yet read his Six Days of War, you should. It's a powerful reminder that Oren is an Israeli diplomat who possesses abundant expertise in, imagine that, the real requirement for the job, American and Middle East foreign policy.   
He also has the Israeli cred of fighting in the first Lebanon war, helping to establish the influential think tank the Shalem Center and having a personal demeanor, I'm told, that reflects the best of Israel i.e. unaffected, unpretentious, down to earth.  
I'm standing on the sidelines and rooting for him to meet and surpass expectations. Other than exchanging e-mails a few years back, I've never met Oren, but have to admit that I'd like to and hear his plans and ideas.With Oren's dynamic profile (a paragon for the American-Israeli, Israeli-American) it would be 'chutzpah-like' of me then to lecture Oren on do's and don'ts upon arriving to the nation's capital.
I'll be more 'diplomatic' and ask how Ambassador Oren can take his 'game' to the next level: 
How can he reshape the embassy from a fortress known for political infighting to an inviting center of Israeli creativity and culture?How can he move beyond the established 'leaders of the American Jewish community' to form close relations with others, Jew and non-Jew, who 'think different'? 
How can he transform the embassy into a laboratory for new media that offers real substance and also be a credible go to person for traditional media? 
How can he persuade academic circles in North America to drop the noxious apartheid South Africa analogy before it turns into a cancer?
How can he inspire other men and women of the arts, sciences, business and technology to outsmart the political operatives and be the face of Israel abroad?  
Finally, how can he be a case study for a new type of ambassador for not just Israel but other countries too? 
Contemplating all of those audacious, and very 2009 challenges, the more things change the more they stay the same.  
Oren is a return, in certain ways, to Abba Eban, and the feeling of respect and awe he engendered among us Diaspora Jews.  Unlike Eban, however, who he has studied and written about, Oren projects an intellectual aura without being haughty and above it all that understandably drove the native Israelis nuts.
Plus, Oren enters the stage when 'posting' generally has a far different meaning.   
It's hardly a secret that the status of being an ambassador has been severely diminished ever since world leaders could pick up the phone and speak directly to one another, and it?s already been more than twenty years since the diplomatic cable was made passe by the Cable News Network.  In today's Web 2.0 world, traditional diplomacy has been upended by people to people diplomacy - as we're seeing in the courageous protests in Iran, real people can use new technology to be heard and challenge the status quo.
I asked a friend, Lyon Roth, never at a loss for astute observations, how Oren would be measured.   His response was quick and to the point. 
"Oren's success will depend significantly on whether the Obama administration perceives him as both having Bibi's ear and truly speaking on Bibi's behalf.  If it does, he'll be a rock star. If not, his voice is less likely to have the impact it otherwise might."
My little advice to Oren would be similarly short and summarized in three words: go for it.  
Michael Oren has the opportunity to not just write about history, but to make history and in doing so restore needed relevance to this diplomatic post.

<title>An oud to Nablus </title>
<date>Tue Nov 17 02:40:28 IST 2009</date>
<content>
NABLUS - Anyone can make this Saturday outing to Nablus. You take the Ayalon Highway north and five minutes after the Derech Hashalom exit you turn right, toward Ramat Hasharon and Ra'anana, and keep going straight.  
Before you know it, you're on the best road between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean - Route 505, well-lit and with the highest-quality asphalt, wide shoulders and clear signage. This road cuts east through the West Bank and reaches the Jordan Valley. The fences on either side, separating it from the lands of the Palestinian villages in the area, make it an exemplary apartheid road - for Jews only. And you can fly along at 140 kilometers per hour, from one Jewish settlement to the next.  
The settlements are identified by signs along the road but cannot be seen from it. They are hidden behind hills. Only the fenced roads leading to them from the main road are visible, and they do not slow you down. After less than half an hour you turn north and within 10 minutes you're in the center of Nablus, just 45 minutes from central Tel Aviv.  
And the army checkpoints? On weekdays no one goes in or out of the encircled city, but on weekends the noose is slackened a bit and there is only one roadblock worthy of the name at the entrance to Nablus, and even that is informal: At the same spot where until a few months ago the intimidating Hawara checkpoint, an armed bunker, had blocked the entrance to the city, permitting passage on foot only, on the weekends now there are only two nervous soldiers, unaided even by barbed wire or road spikes. They signal the cars to stop. A short argument, a bit of flattery, fawning and some joking, and they give in and let us through.  
At the end of the day, the final, impassable barrier that prevents Israelis from going to Nablus is psychological. It is reflected in a new sign, as tall as a two-story building, painted bright red with huge letters that warn: "Area A ahead, Entrance to Israelis prohibited, your lives are in danger: You have been warned! Entrance by Israelis into territories of the Palestinian Authority constitutes a criminal offense." Threat and intimidation are the most effective separation walls.  
At the Zafer al-Masri Cultural Center, nothing was perceptibly life-threatening. Mostly there was swelling excitement in anticipation of the concert, part of the Arab music festival that began on Friday and will continue throughout the month in West Bank towns, sponsored and produced by the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music.  
In this encircled city, the most isolated of Palestinian towns, there are very few performances, plays or concerts, and every such event is exciting - especially when it involves a great international name: instrumentalist-composer Simon Shaheen, with an expanded ensemble of 12 musicians playing classical Arab instruments (including oud; qanoun; nai, Arab  flute; and traditional percussion instruments); Western instruments (violins, cello, double bass and flute); as well as two singers, one woman and one man.  
The program for the concert was taken entirely from Egyptian movies of the 1930s and '40s in which Farid al-Atrash, Umm Kulthum and Asmahan sang songs written by the greatest Arab composers of the early 20th century, among them Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Riyad al-Sunbati.  
Their music is performed today, and treated by the audience like Western classical music: As complex, high-art music, meant only to be listened to. The audience involvement is greater than with a Brahms or Beethoven symphony, but there is no clapping along as with music that has a dance beat. Its secrets are revealed only through focused listening; they lie in the melodic relationships rather than in harmonies, as in Western music, but are equally rich. And like classical Western music this music too is an endangered species, with fewer and fewer listeners and students throughout the Arab world, eroded by pop. It too is based on a nonrenewing canon of "great composers" and "masterpieces" that is fading with time.  
The audience that filled the Al-Masri Auditorium was elegant and festive. In a city where the average monthly wage is about NIS 1,000, only those in the upper middle class could afford the NIS 20 ticket price. There were children and teenagers, too, which worried the organizers at first but they settled down to listen as soon as the first notes were played. The friendly charm of Shaheen, who smiled and addressed them directly, asking if they enjoyed themselves.  
From the Galilee to Nablus 
Shaheen was born in 1955 in the Western Galilee village of Tarshiha, and embarked on his musical path early: He began playing oud at the age of five under the tutelage of his father, Hikmat Shaheen, a performer and teacher and a key figure in the world of Israeli-Arab music from the mid-20th century.  
In 1978 Simon Shaheen earned a bachelor's degree studies at Jerusalem's Academy of Music. He studied Western music, like all the students, and the violin. In 1979 he moved to New York, where he studied performance at the Manhattan School of Music and completed studies in music education at Columbia University. He devotes a considerable part of his time to teaching, including giving master classes, some of them at leading American universities.  
Shaheen's multicultural studies are reflected in his musical world; alongside classical Arabic music he performs and composes East-West fusion. In this area he is best known for his 2001 album, "Blue Flame," which mixes jazz and rock with classical and Latin music and was nominated for 11 Grammy Awards. The members of his ensemble, Qantara, which performed on the album, have varied musical backgrounds. Shaheen performs with Qantara at fixtures that include the Newport and Montreal jazz festivals.  
Shaheen remained in New York, where he composes music for films, founded an annual Arab music festival and established an ensemble for classical Arabic music, The Near Eastern Music Ensemble. He has won many awards, including the National Heritage Award, presented to him at the White House in 1994.  
It was only natural, then, that for Saturday's concert he invited a singer with a similar sensibility. Dalal Abu Amna, 26, began singing as a child. Like Shaheen she focused on in classical Arab music while developing a multicultural and "postmodern Arab" style, as she puts it, avoiding Arab pop. She is also studying for her master's degree in brain research at the Haifa Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, and intends to combine being a scientist and performer.  
And thus, in a city with no open movie theater (one is in ruins, the other is closed), there was music from films, reminding older audience members of forgotten pleasures and giving the children - some of them undoubtedly for the first time - an opportunity to hear live music, to see a double bass and a flute being played onstage and to meet an respected international musician like Shaheen, who has opened a Palestinian cultural window to the world.  
The concert ended at 9 P.M. The audience was invited to a reception afterward, with refreshments - bottled water and a slice of knafeh, a sweet concoction of shredded phyllo dough, goat cheese and sugar syrup, the pride of Nablus - served on plastic plates. We get into the car and immediately pass a new pair of tired soldiers, who barely take an interest in our identity. By 10:30 we are back in the middle of Tel Aviv, after a swift, difficult-to-digest segue between two planets.

<title>Anti-Israel poster causes uproar on Canadian campuses </title>
<date>Sun Mar 01 01:13:18 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Hundreds of protesters demonstrated on Thursday at two Canadian universities that recently banned a poster advertising "Israeli Apartheid Week," a series of anti-Israel events due to begin today in over 25 cities and campuses worldwide, including Johannesburg, New York, Caracas, London and Copenhagen.  
About 300 student protesters at Carleton University and Ottawa University accused the two institutions of stifling free speech ahead of the annual event, which began in 2005 in Toronto.  
The banned poster depicts a gunship labeled "Israel" firing a missile at a boy wearing a kaffiyeh and holding a teddy bear. The poster has aroused controversy in Canadian and international press and on campuses, where supporters of Israel said it portrays Israelis as child-killers - an old anti-Semitic theme.  
Tensions have been reported at the University of Toronto, York University and McMaster University, which all permitted displaying the poster.  
In explaining the ban, officials at Carleton and Ottawa universities cited their human rights code, saying the material did not fit that framework. Pro-Palestinian and human rights activists say this does not constitute sufficient grounds. "The link between anti-Semitism and being against Israeli government policies is ludicrous," said Jessica Carpinone, of Students Against Israeli Apartheid, adding that the group includes Jewish students.  
Canadian Jewish organizations warn that the anti-Israeli protests could lead to violence against Jews, adding that levels of on-campus anti-Semitism have increased.

<title>Arab families scuffle with rightist lawmakers during East Jerusalem tour </title>
<date>Mon Aug 10 01:35:02 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Scuffles broke out yesterday between two rightist Knesset members and Palestinian residents of the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah.  
At one point, stones were thrown at MKs Yaakov Katz and Uri Ariel, both from the National Union party, as they toured the contested neighborhood. In addition, the MKs' bodyguards traded blows with protesters.  
"You learned the apartheid laws from South Africa," a member of the Gawi family yelled at the visiting MKs. "East Jerusalem will be free, this is our land. We didn't expel you, why are you expelling us?"  
The Gawis are one of two Palestinian families who were evicted from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah last week, after a court ruled that they had violated the terms of their rental contracts.  
Katz replied that "this whole area belonged to Jews 70 or 80 years ago, and we are returning to it."  
When asked if the same principle would apply to Arab families who fled or were driven from homes in Israel during the 1948 War of Independence, Katz replied: "Any Arab can come forward and make a claim to a house that he thinks belongs to him and his family inside the State of Israel. The claim will be handled by the courts."  
Aryeh King, the right-wing activist who escorted the MKs through the neighborhood, pointed out several houses that had been acquired by the Nahalat Shimon organization or for which documentation existed showing that they belonged to Jews. King vowed that within the next year, the number of Jewish families in the area would increase from 28 to 40.  
Tonight, left-wing activists from Israel and abroad plan to demonstrate in the neighborhood to show solidarity with the evicted families.

<title>Barak to Haaretz: Netanyahu's government will surprise people yet  </title>
<date>Wed Jun 10 01:56:14 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
What is nice about the community centers funded by the National Lottery (Mifal Hapayis) is that they all look the same. The same ugly potted plants in the lobby, the same colorful tiles in the men's bathrooms. 

There are those who are willing to swear that the same is true of speeches by Israeli politicians, except that instead of potted plants and tiles, there are other staples: a little peace, an open hand extended to our neighbors, an existential threat or two. A bit of nuclear weaponry, a bit of demography.  
This particular community center is located in Ramat Gan's Ohel Shem school, and the daily political speech was delivered by Defense Minister Ehud Barak. It is not even a speech - Barak defined it as a "cautious conversation between two speeches." The two speeches are of course U.S. President Barack Obama's Cairo address and the one Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will deliver on Sunday.  
Barak spoke Tuesday night to the Council for Peace and Security, in an auditorium full of veterans of the Israel Defense Forces, the Shin Bet security service and the Mossad - or as one journalist described it, "generations of defense officials. These people led us from disaster to disaster."  
Barak told the audience what he certainly managed to tell Netanyahu: It would be a mistake for Israel to be the one preventing Obama from trying to bring a peace agreement to the Middle East. Whether Netanyahu listened to him and was convinced, we will know only on Sunday.  
Barak spoke of the need for a real solution. If we do not accept the two-state solution, he said, we will find ourselves with an apartheid policy or a state in which we are the minority. But he immediately added that for years, we have tried to reach just such an agreement, but always failed because of the other side.  
The deal that must be signed is a final-status agreement, he said, the kind that cannot be reopened again in the future. But he immediately added that with our neighbors, nothing is truly final, and change could come suddenly and swiftly, through the ballot or the bullet.  
The speech was erudite and precise. The text was pragmatic. But the subtext was depressing: We cannot survive without a treaty, but we have no one to sign one with. We must try, but just between the two of us, it won't work. The word "opportunity" was mentioned repeatedly, but every time, it was accompanied by a sigh. Pessimism is part and parcel of being a rightist leader, but to be a pessimistic leftist leader is unpleasant.  
After the speech, I was given a few minutes to conduct a brief interview with the defense minister. I met him in the school's music room. Barak was unhappy that there were only two chairs in the room. Twice he asked for more chairs be brought in, so that more people could be seated. But there were no chairs available, so the others remained standing.  
I tried to tell Barak that I used to go to this school. But he was busy examining the piano in the corner of the room and paid no attention to my anecdote. The interview began.  
Do you know what Netanyahu is going to say on Sunday?  
"I don't know. I have guesses, but nothing more. The prime minister's discussions are real discussions. This government will surprise people yet."  
Is he pushing for a two-state solution?  
"Today's entire argument over two states for two peoples began during the election campaign. Kadima demanded that Likud say this, but Likud didn't want to, and I think it was blown out of proportion. The minute a government commits itself to its predecessors' agreements - and those include the road map, and the road map talks about two states - what else can it do? And it's not a bad thing that that's included.  
"The road map should be changed now that Hamas is in power. But its foundation [the two-state solution] remains. So I think part of the reluctance to say this is not a matter of principle. Our nation lives in the State of Israel. Where does the other people live? In a cage? A jail? A swimming pool? I don't think there's a real disagreement here."  
So the problem is only the argument with Kadima?  
"Look, Kadima's real place, and I regret saying this ... [is that] decisions are made without them. Therefore, I think Kadima should reconsider whether it was a mistake to stay out [of the coalition]."  
You know there is a never-ending debate over the question of whether Netanyahu has really changed. What is your opinion?  
Barak gave vent to a morose sigh, like those he attached in his speech to the word "opportunity," and then continued with a warm smile, almost heartwarming.  
"Tell me," he said, "have you changed?"  
I left the Ohel Shem school. Twenty-four years ago, when I played ball here, Ehud Barak galloped through Lebanon as the deputy commander of the eastern corps. Since then, he has withdrawn from Lebanon, seen Hezbollah sitting on the border fence and seen us attacking Lebanon once again.  
A few days ago, he saw the moderate left win the Lebanese elections and Obama congratulate them warmly. With a little luck, this same left will win in Iran, too. And only here will a right-wing extremist government remain in power, since in addition to making correct decisions, it also makes sure not to look like a sucker compared to Tzipi Livni.  
And Barak is nothing less than this government's defense minister. So it is no wonder that every time after he says the word "opportunity," he utters a small sigh.

<title>Bringing Baroque to Bethlehem </title>
<date>Mon Dec 21 01:53:21 IST 2009</date>
<content>
It has been nine years since British conductor Tim Brown led a traditional orchestra, with modern instruments, in a performance of a Baroque work. This week and next (at the Tel Aviv Museum, Friday through Sunday; and at venues in Haifa, Jerusalem and Carmiel, Monday through Wednesday) he'll rise to the challenge again, when the Jerusalem Camerata Orchestra performs Bach's "Christmas Oratorio."  
Before their first rehearsal Brown admits that he had serious doubts. "Modern instruments don't weave naturally into the sound of Baroque music," he says. "The contemporary trumpets are too loud, it's hard to play this music on today's French horns. And the traditional instrumentalists on the strings - they have been trained since early childhood to play with vibrato, which blurs the unique outline for every voice in polyphonic music and damages its texture. How could my chorus - the Choir of Clare College, Cambridge - integrate into that sort of orchestra? I was very worried. But after the first rehearsal I realized I had been given a wonderful orchestra and there weren't going to be problems. It's astonishing how an orchestra like this [exists] here."  
With such praise from an international conductor who specializes in the performance of Baroque music on authentic instruments and reproductions of period instruments, the Camerata can and should pat itself on the back. "The musicians in this orchestra play lightly, precisely and with style, without vibrato. The work I had planned to invest in just practicing playing Baroque with them has already been done," Brown says in amazement. "And the fact that they aren't burnt out, and they are eager to perform - for someone who comes from England that's a pleasant surprise."  
Timothy Brown, 63, began his musical path as a choirboy in the Westminster Abbey School - the Gothic cathedral adjacent to the Houses of Parliament in London, where coronations of British monarchs have been held for a thousand years now and where people like Isaac Newton, George Frideric Handel and Charles Darwin are buried.  
"During my lifetime, I have been witness to the development of the early music movement and the playing of authentic instruments," he says. "As a boy, I remember how Otto Klemperer conducted the St. Matthew Passion - slowly and heavily, with great dignity and a huge sound, as though it were a Bruckner symphony. This was beautiful but counter to the way the music was performed in its time and to its character. In 1957, I remember the first time a harpsichord was brought into a performance of a work by Bach. The revolution took place before my eyes. This was a voyage to the discovery of a new music and a new attitude towards it."  
Painting with sound 
Of the "Christmas Oratorio," a cantata cycle Bach composed in Leipzig for each day of the holiday, Brown describes it as a piece of theatrical music. "There are pictures in it that Bach paints with sound, and performed correctly it's possible to present that airy and light simplicity and eliminate the grandiose image it had been accorded. For example in the passage 'Let us go to Bethlehem,'" he continues, "there are a number of voices separated from the choir as though the people are chattering and egging one another on - but at the same time the flute and violins are playing a single melodic line, as though two angels were hovering above the chatter. This is very picturesque."  
His choir's journey to Bethlehem this week, however, has painful aspects to it as well. "Three years ago," says Brown, "I participated in the midnight Mass on Christmas at St. George's Church in Bethlehem and I offered to come and do that this year too, with my choir. Clare College is primarily a church choir and the concerts are the icing on the pie. We sing three times a week at church services. At St. George's they were very happy and all of us were excited, until we encountered the boycott."  
Three years ago, Brown performed in the territories with the Choir of London, an ensemble which worked then in both the territories and Israel. However the choir later joined the cultural boycott declared by many Palestinian organizations against Israel. Members of the Choir of London sent Brown a letter signed by 200 people demanding he cancel his performances in Israel.  
"We discussed this at the college and since there is no international boycott of Israel we agreed unanimously not to boycott and [that we would] sing in Israel just as we had committed ourselves. Three weeks ago a letter came from the Palestinian Authority informing us that if we come to sing on Christmas, our entry into the city will be blocked. Thus the concert was canceled."  
Tim Brown has a great deal of sympathy for both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "And in any case, as a musician I can't judge," he says. "I don't think the Israeli government is more criminal than the English government, for example. What we did in Iraq was shocking, simply a disgrace, ad we have also ignored what is happening in Zimbabwe. Why focus in particular on Israel?"  
"And in the meantime, people are living their lives," Brown continues. "It was important to me that my students go through the roadblocks in the West Bank and come up against the separation wall and become aware of the Palestinians' difficulties - and sing with them. And it was also important to me that they meet the Russian immigrants of the Camerata Orchestra, some of whom may have immigrated to Israel because they had no alternative. The encounter with forms of displacement and immigration, with the tragic side of the world, is important - and altogether I believe in connection between people, not boycott. I believe in music's ability to make the world more beautiful, and that with its help we can love one another. This is what makes people human. And if we were to have boycotted - would anything have changed? Would the walls really have tumbled down?"  
No chance for a love affair 
Prof. Gabi Baramki, the president of the Palestinian Council for Justice and Peace, former acting president of Birzeit University and a steering committee member of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI), spoke with Haaretz about the Choir of Clare College's upcoming appearances in Israel.  
"Communication is important," Baramki says, in explaining why he is not welcoming the choir, "but it can turn into a form of complicity in violations of human rights, if not based on the principle of opposing injustice and advocating equal human rights for all. Performing in Israel, despite its fresh war crimes in Gaza, its ongoing occupation and colonization of Palestinian and Arab land, and its system of racial discriminations against its 'non-Jewish' citizens, in fact contributes to whitewashing Israel's grave violations of international law, particularly in light of the Goldstone report."  
"Mr. Brown's attempt to distinguish between Israeli civil society and government is ill conceived," he continues. "Israeli civil society is, with few exceptions, deeply implicated in Israel's system of oppression against the Palestinian people - since it has largely supported all aspects of occupation, including the slow ethnic cleansing we suffer."  
Why not let the choir members experience the situation on the ground - on both sides?  
Baramki: "There is a difference between the choir coming on a fact-finding mission to experience both sides, and coming basically to Israel to give a series of concerts and then on the side giving a concert to the hapless 'natives.' There was no objection to the members of the choir coming as individuals and participating in the Bethlehem mass within the congregation, not as a performing group."  
Why not let music do what it can: bridge, unite, bring love?  
"We have a situation of occupier and occupied, oppressor and oppressed. Both sides are not equal. It is not a matter of misunderstanding that music needs to clarify and bridge. When we have two equal parties, then this bridge can work. As long as you have an apartheid system, and denial of Palestinian basic rights including the right of return of the refugees, this 'love affair' has no chance to even start."  
Why single out Israel while Britain itself commits terrible deeds throughout the world?  
"It is Israel that is occupying Palestinian land and denying our rights, not Britain," says Baramki. "Yes, the United Kingdom has a lot to account for - we support condemnation of its terrible deeds and action to alleviate the suffering - but it needs the people concerned directly to start first. We have started: This is a specific case where the oppressed are calling for support through boycott - a minimal, non-violent form of resistance. And the Western establishment is singling out Israel indeed: it gives it red-carpet treatment and endless support."  
"Our boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) campaign," Baramki explains, "is primarily focused on ending Israel's impunity and holding it to account before international law; to draw the attention of the world to the grave injustice being committed against the Palestinians, to bring pressure on Israel to make it abide by international law and act according to the resolutions of the United Nations. We are deeply inspired by the South African anti-apartheid struggle, despite the obvious differences." (Noam Ben-Zeev)

<title>Carter: Fighting in Gaza could renew peace talks</title>
<date>Fri Jan 09 03:42:02 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Former President Jimmy Carter said Thursday that Israel's assault on Gaza has been destructive and disproportionate to rocket attacks on Israel but could result in new efforts for a long-term Middle East peace plan.
Carter, in a telephone interview with The Associated Press, said although animosity toward Israel in the Arab world has probably increased dramatically, there may be renewed interest among European leaders in trying to find a lasting resolution.

The former president, who brokered peace between Israel and Egypt 30 years ago, also expressed hope the incoming Obama administration would take a more active role in negotiations. Carter said he discussed the Middle East with President-elect Barack Obama in a meeting this week, but he would not disclose what Obama said.
Publicly, Obama has deferred to President George W. Bush on the Gaza conflict, insisting there can only be one administration at a time. The Bush administration has blamed Hamas for the conflict, citing the continued rocket attacks and smuggling of arms.
Carter, speaking from his hometown of Plains, said the rockets and arms smuggling must be stopped, but the Israelis have destroyed a thousand other sites in addition to tunnels used for smuggling under the Egyptian border.
Almost 750 Palestinians and 12 Israelis, including nine soldiers, have died since Israel's assault began Dec. 27.
"Whether that's an appropriate response, I'll let you make the judgment on that. I don't think it is," said Carter, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.
He said he was hopeful Egypt and France can broker a cease-fire, and that diplomats can resume efforts for a long-term peace plan with a two-state solution.
Later Thursday, Arab and Western leaders drafted a cease-fire resolution that would allow for opening of border crossings to Gaza and called for the UN Security Council to vote on it. Although Israel and Gaza were not parties to the agreement, it was supported by the United States, Israel's closest ally, and Arab nations which have close ties to Hamas.
In talks with Hamas leaders last spring, Carter helped engineer a six-month cease-fire that began June 19. It dramatically reduced the number of Hamas rockets, and Israel allowed resumed shipments of food, fuel and other supplies to ease the plight of the 1.5 million people in Gaza.
The rocket attacks resumed last month.
Carter, whose latest book We Can Have Peace in the Holy Land will be released Jan. 20, will travel to China on Saturday for the 30th anniversary of the U.S. resuming relations with Beijing. He was in Lebanon and Syria last month but has no immediate plans to return to the Middle East.
Carter's last book on the region, Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, drew criticism two years ago from some Jewish groups in the U.S. because of comparisons to Israeli treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza to racial oppression in 20th century South Africa.

<title>Carter: Israel won't need to give up Gush Etzion settlements</title>
<date>Sun Jun 14 17:12:56 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter said on Sunday following a meeting with settler leaders that he did not believe Israel would withdraw from the Gush Etzion settlement bloc.
Carter said that as the West Bank bloc is situated beside the borders set following the 1967 Six-Day War, he imagines it will stay under Israeli control forever.
"This particular settlement is not one that I envision ever being abandoned, or changed over into a Palestinian territory," Carter said. "This is part of the close settlements to the 1967 line that I think will be here forever."
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under pressure from U.S. President Barack Obama to halt settlement construction throughout the West Bank, but has so far refused to do so.
Carter told Haaretz in an exclusive interview on Saturday that Obama would not change his position on the two-state solution and Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Carter added that Israel and the United States are on a collision course if Israel refuses to comply on these two issues.

The former U.S. president, an outspoken critic on Israel's policy regarding Palestinians, said on Sunday that his visit to the settlements has given him a fresh perspective on the issue.
During his visit, Carter reiterated that he remains committed to Israel, adding that enabling the state to exist in peace and security has been the most important project he has taken on in the last 30 years. 
Nevertheless, Carter said, Israel's neighboring countries also deserve peace and security, and should be guaranteed that right as well.
Gush Etzion council leader Shaul Goldstein, who hosted Carter at his home, called the visit significant and said he believed it indeed contributed to a change in the former president's views. 
Carter embarked on the visit to Gush Etzion on Sunday in what he described as a chance to listen and make his views known. There he met with Goldstein and others at the Neve Daniel settlement, south of Jerusalem. 
The former president said he was there to "listen to the settlers," and that he "hoped to make sure they understand my own attitude toward Israel and the Jewish population in the world and toward the Jewish settlers."
Later, Carter sat in Goldstein's living room, positioned under five books of the Hebrew Bible on a bookshelf.
"This is our homeland, but we recognize there are other people living next to us," Goldstein told him, referring to the Palestinians, who view the West Bank as part of a future state.
Israeli settlement in the West Bank is a key point of dispute between Israel and the Palestinians. Much of the international community views settlements as an obstacle to a peace deal and has called for a total freeze to construction there.
Many Israelis view the West Bank as the biblical heartland of the Jewish people and say Israel should not cede it. 
Carter, 85, brokered the historic peace deal between Israel and Egypt in 1979. In a controversial 2007 book, 'Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid', Carter argued that Israel has to choose between ceding the West Bank to the Palestinians in a peace deal or maintaining a system of ethnic inequality similar to that of the apartheid regime in South Africa.
Views like that have made Carter unpopular among settlers and their supporters. A group of local settlers circulated an open letter titled, "Jimmy Carter go home," saying the former president was an "anti-Semite and not welcome here."
"Mr. Carter is an advocate for those seeking to destroy Israel, and the fact that he contributes to that agenda under the guise of a man of good will seeking peace only makes him more dangerous and his efforts more dishonest," the letter said.

<title>'Clown costumes encapsulated absurdity of Durban II' </title>
<date>Fri May 01 01:24:09 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
They say they weren't involved in disrupting the peace at Durban II, but the two coaches of the Geneva response team for the student organization StandWithUs don't sound too upset in describing pro-Israel heckling at the event.  
The founder of the Israel advocacy student group, Roz Rothstein from Los Angeles, even brought back a small but relevant memento from the Swiss city: a red clown nose.  
The nose, she says, has come to signify resistance to the highly controversial UN meeting on human rights, which ended in Geneva last week with organizers singling Israel out as a racist state.  
Sitting at a Jerusalem cafe, Rothstein explains that the nose rose to fame after three French Jewish students, dressed as clowns, heckled Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad when he spoke at the event.  
The clown image caught on because it illustrated the "absurdity" of having human-rights violators such as Libya, Cuba and Iran heading a human-rights event, says Rothstein. "The Jewish protests at Durban II showed we won't remain silent and signified the attitude of 'never again,'" she says.  
StandWithUs, which trains students from campuses around the world in Israel advocacy, sent 15 delegates to the conference. A total of 150 Jewish student onlookers attended.  
Those students had prepared for months to launch a vocal, even vociferous, PR onslaught to delegitimize the event. They feared the meeting would be a repeat of the original 2001 Durban conference, which Arab states and pro-Palestinian groups hijacked to call Israel an apartheid state.  
Unlike the 2001 event, the response to the Geneva follow-up was a well-orchestrated affair. In preparing for the Durban II conference, StandWithUs focused on peoples whose human rights grievances were being "sidelined" because of "the Israel obsession," as Rothstein puts it.  
Michael Dickson, the U.K.-born director of StandWithUs' Israel office, said the organization focused on the plight of people from Darfur, where Sudan is accused of perpetrating genocide.  
This was the reason, he said, for the slogan they used at the event, "The UN remains silent." Rothstein, 58, brought a bag full of posters bearing the slogan to Geneva.  
Some protesters courted news agencies' cameras by duct-taping their mouths while holding the posters. And to counter the apartheid analogy in the media, Dickson and Rothstein relied on people like Lior Meir from Hebrew University, who grew up in apartheid South Africa before moving to Israel.  
One of the group's biggest moments of victory at Durban was when most European delegates walked out on Ahmadinejad's tirade against Israel.  
Rothstein - who cheered on the abandoning delegates - thinks that by attending and then leaving, Europe sent out a stronger message against the conference than it would have by boycotting the meeting in the first place. "It shows a degree of open-mindedness, while at the same time drawing a distinct line in the sand," she says.  
While in Geneva, StandWithUs delegates from Israel, Italy, Finland, Luxembourg and Norway prepared a scathing, English-language protest letter for MK Jamal Zahalka of the Balad party, the "National Democratic Alliance," who participated in anti-Israel protests at Durban II.  
The group protested what they called Zahalka's "use of democratic institutions to undermine the very democracy which he is supposed to represent," and circulated the letter to supporters around the world via social networks.  
MK Zahalka could not be reached for comment.

<title>Durban 2 draft: Israel's Palestinian policy is crime against humanity</title>
<date>Mon Mar 02 19:12:42 IST 2009</date>
<content>
A draft of the closing statement prepared for the upcoming United Nations-sponsored conference against racism, dubbed Durban 2, states that Israel's policy in the Palestinian territories constitutes a "violation of international human rights, a crime against humanity and a contemporary form of apartheid." 
The conference, to be held in Geneva next month, is a follow-up to the contentious 2001 conference in the South African city of Durban which was dominated by clashes over the Middle East and the legacy of slavery. The U.S. and Israel walked out midway through that eight-day meeting over a draft resolution that singled out Israel for criticism and likened Zionism - the movement to establish and maintain a Jewish state - to racism. 
Israel, Canada and the U.S. have already announced that they will boycott the upcoming summit.
The draft statement, obtained by Haaretz, goes on to say that Israel's policy poses "a serious threat to international peace and security and violates the basic principles of international human rights law." 
In the draft, the organizers of the UN summit express "deep concern" over Israel's practices of "racial discrimination against the Palestinian people as well as Syrian nationals of the occupied Syrian Golan and other inhabitants of the Arab occupied territories."
The draft accuses Israel of implementing collective punishment against the Palestinian people, as well as "torture, economic blockade, severe restriction of movement and arbitrary closure of their territories." 
Furthermore, Israel is charged with perpetrating "a foreign occupation founded on settlements, laws based on racial discrimination with the aim of continuing domination of the occupied territories," and is termed a "threat to international peace and security." 
Finally, the draft calls on the international community to protect the Palestinian people against Israel's "racist" policies.

<title>Durban II / Israel's boycott gives its critics the upper hand</title>
<date>Mon Apr 20 11:02:55 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Click here for more about the Durban II conference
To mark the Durban II conference, Haaretz.com asked two of its editors to contribute an opinion piece. The other piece, by Benjamin Hartman, can be found here
Last week, the Syrian ambassador to the United States appeared on Fareed Zakaria's "GPS" show on CNN for an interview as part of a segment entitled "Syria Speaks Out." 
To get things started, Zakaria asked his guest for his take on the election of Barack Obama and how it resonated in his country. A fair, nice, light issue to kick things off before delving into the meatier topics.
Predictably, the ambassador, Imad Moustapha, spoke of the "powerful message" and the "symbolism" in Obama's victory, how America has redeemed itself after eight years of George Bush, how he was encouraged by the conciliatory overtones of the new administration and the turning of a new page with the Islamic world and blah, blah, blah.
Then, something appeared that gave me pause. As the ambassador was speaking, the network flashed a caveat at the very bottom of the screen that was all too telling: "Israeli Ambassador was not available to appear on GPS today." 
His absence left the playing field wide open for Moustapha to tear into Israel for its "atrocities" in Gaza and the West Bank while denouncing the "omnipotent power of the pro-Israel interest groups in Washington." Like a sniper picking off his prey as if it were target practice, Moustapha's broadside went unanswered.
Of course, there are plenty of mitigating circumstances that could account for Israel's latest bit of public relations negligence. True, it was during the Passover holiday period. And yes, this came in the midst of a transition to a new government, so perhaps the ambassador or anyone on his staff were either unable or unwilling to speak on behalf of a regime that did not sanction their posting in the first place. 
Still, neglecting to send a spokesperson to present Israel's position speaks volumes about the importance which this country places in public relations. For years now, Israel's diplomatic corps has been hopelessly outmaneuvered by their Arab opponents. Now it is repeating the same mistake in Geneva, the site of the UN's "Durban II" anti-racism conference.
Whether GPS or Geneva, the needle on Israel's compass seems eternally stuck on the wrong direction. Instead of showing courage and a determination not to allow one voice to drown out the proceedings in Geneva, Israel recoiled, as if it had no worthy response to the venom of the see-no-Palestinian-evil, hear-no-Palestinian-evil crowd. 
Israel is an economic and military power, with an air force that is second to none, a prolific high-tech industry, bustling night-life, world class academics, and a Middle Eastern joie de vivre that transmits a pulsating energy unequalled in the European and American societies that so many in Israel try their darndest to emulate. 
With all these qualities to flaunt, with so much that our robust society can offer the rest of the world, it is mystifying that our government is so frightened of a few shrill lemmings who seek to hijack the agenda of an anti-racism conference. 
In a country that takes pride in relying on its shrewdness and creativity to overcome the most difficult of odds, it boggles the mind as to why we choose to play hapless victim whenever a diminutive bigot - who does not even have final say-so on matters in his country, despite his job title - opens his mouth. Or meets the president of Switzerland. (Think fast: you have five seconds to name the Swiss president) 
Durban II could very well descend into an anti-Israel hate fest. The images of bloodied Palestinian children in Gaza will likely be a fixture in demonstrations by those who "champion the Palestinian cause." Yet, the torch-and-pitchfork mob should not be our target audience. Their minds are made up, and we will simply have to agree to disagree. 
Israel's focus should be on the massive bloc of undecided and uninitiated, those who have yet to be introduced to the catchwords that dominate our lexicons - "occupation", "terrorism", "apartheid", "settlements", "deterrence" - those who will soon have the right to vote in elections for European parliaments and American state assemblies, those who for the first time will open up a newspaper and read the letters to the editor, or click into a blog.
These are the voices that will ultimately determine the texture of Israel's relations with the rest of the world. These are the footsoldiers who comprise the ranks of the "silent majority," people who have yet to be given a reason to take the streets and don a keffiyeh while waving placards that blare "ZIONISM = RACISM." 
And how does our Foreign Ministry plan on reaching the hearts and minds of these folks? Simple. Don't show up. Let the yahoos have the stage all to themselves. We'll just cozy up in our psychological bunker, because, hey, righteous indignation has always been our path of least resistance.
And when we are called upon to explain our actions, we can just whipsaw them with our standard rejoinders - "We suffered through the Holocaust" and "If you criticize Israel, you're anti-Semitic." Hasbara 101. 
Israel ought to send a delegation to Geneva not to dignify the smears, but to introduce the hidden dimensions of our vast (and flawed) society. If a European who has never taken an active interest in the Middle East comes away from Geneva with a negative view of our "racist" and "apartheid" country, how can we blame that person if we had preemptively surrendered the platform to the loudmouths? 
Instead, we ought to tell that person, "Yes, we have an outstanding disagreement with the Palestinians, and the reasons for this are complex and varied, but did you know that Palestinians are permitted to petition the Supreme Court against the government's actions in the territories? And that the same Court has often struck down Israeli decisions to the humanitarian benefit of injured Palestinians?" 
All of sudden, the entire complexion of the argument changes, and the topic shifts from "apartheid" and "occupation" to the Supreme Court and the Israeli legal system, which is considered one of the most advanced and sophisticated in the Western world. There, a whole new world can be opened up in just two sentences. As simple as it is effective. And all that can be done without shouting, or screaming. 
If this country had approached public relations with the ferocity in which it bulldozes Palestinian homes to the ground; if our diplomats could reframe their arguments with the precision that our air force drones home in on "ticking bombs," perhaps we would not be in this mess. Durban II would be a walk in the park, and Ahmadinejad would be cut down to his natural size, that of nothing more than an irritant.

<title>Education Minister slams Israeli lecturer's 'apartheid' op-ed</title>
<date>Sun Aug 23 18:14:26 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Education Minister Gideon Sa'ar on Sunday denounced an Israeli academic who published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times in which he called for an boycott of Israel for being an "apartheid" state
Sa'ar deemed the article by Dr. Neve Gordon, a political science lecturer from Ben-Gurion University, is "repugnant and deplorable."
Veteran left-wing activist Gordon wrote in the op-ed published on Friday that Israel today could most accurately be described as an "apartheid state."
"3.5 million Palestinians and almost half a million Jews live in the areas Israel occupied in 1967," Gordon wrote, "and yet while these two groups live in the same area, they are subjected to totally different legal systems. The Palestinians are stateless and lack many of the most basic human rights. By sharp contrast, all Jews - whether they live in the occupied territories or in Israel - are citizens of the state of Israel." 
"It is indeed not a simple matter for me as an Israeli citizen to call to suspend cooperation with Israel," he further wrote.  "The words and condemnations from the Obama administration and the European Union have yielded no results, not even a settlement freeze, let alone a decision to withdraw from the occupied territories." 
Gordon came to the public spotlight in 2002, during Israel's assault on the Palestinian Authority, as one of the Israelis who stayed with Yasser Arafat in his compound. In 2003, he was a vocal critic of Paratroopers Brigadier Col. Aviv Kochavi. 
Israel's Consul-General in Los Angeles, Yaakov Dayan sent a letter of response to the president of Ben-Gurion University, Prof. Rivka Carmi, in which he said the statements made by Gordon could be potentially damaging to the university. 
"Since the article was published, I've been contacted by people who care for Israel; some of them are benefactors of Ben-Gurion University," Dayan wrote.  "They were unanimous in threatening to withhold their donations to your institution. My attempt to explain that one bad apple would affect hundreds of researchers turned out to be futile."
"I believe that the definitive answer to anti-Zionist lecturers like Gordon is to set up a center for Zionist studies, which unfortunately does not exist in Israeli academia," he continued. "This center would help dispel the lies disseminated by Gordon in the name of your university."
The Ben-Gurion University management in turn denounced Gordon's views. 
"We are appalled by Dr. Neve Gordon's irresponsible remarks, that morally deserve to be completely and utterly condemned," Prof. Carmi said. "We disapprove of Gordon's disastrous views and reject his cynical exploitation of the freedom of speech in Israel and the university."
"This vile and audacious criticism of the state of Israel damages the excellent academic work being done in Israel and its universities," she also said. "Academics with such feelings about their country are welcome to look for another home, whether personal or professional."

<title>European states consider boycotting Durban 2 summit </title>
<date>Sat Feb 28 20:55:36 IST 2009</date>
<content>
European Union member states may follow in the footsteps of the United States which announced Friday it would not be participating in the Durban anti-racism conference set to take place in April.
While several states mull canceling their participation in the conference, senior UN diplomats say the chances for the entire EU body to boycott the summit are slim. 
The U.S. State Department announced on Friday it would not attend a United Nations conference on racism that critics say will be a forum to criticize Israel, and will no longer participate in planning sessions for it.
The U.S. made the decision after its delegation's attempts to change the content of the summit's draft resolutions failed.
A top Western diplomat stated on Friday that several EU member stated may feel uncomfortable remaining indifferent to the U.S.'s decision. 
Israel and Canada have already announced that they will boycott the upcoming World Conference Against Racism in Geneva from April 20-25.
Sources in the UN indicate that Iran and Syria lead uncompromising negotiations with the U.S. delegation in preparing the drafts for the summit. The U.S. envoy to the UN Susan Rice played an important roll in the discussions that took part in Geneva. 
New York diplomats say Israel was careful not to get actively involved or affect the U.S. stance.    
U.S. to boycott Durban 2 conference on racism
The United States will not attend a United Nations conference on racism that critics say will be a forum to criticize Israel, and will no longer participate in planning sessions for it, the State Department announced on Friday. 
The conference is a follow-up to the contentious 2001 conference in the South African city of Durban which was dominated by clashes over the Middle East and the legacy of slavery. The U.S. and Israel walked out midway through that eight-day meeting over a draft resolution that singled out Israel for criticism and likened Zionism - the movement to establish and maintain a Jewish state - to racism. 
President Barack Obama's administration decided to assess the negotiations before making a decision on U.S. participation. 
The decision to drop U.S. involvement comes one day before U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leaves on her first trip to the Middle East in her new capacity, including stops in Israel. 
A U.S. delegation took part in negotiations this month on summit. Referring to the content of draft resolutions formulated during the preparations, the source said that during negotiations "a bad document became worse," prompting the U.S. to end its affiliation with the conference. 
The U.S. decided the final document that will be produced by the conference is "not salvageable," another official said. 
"The document being negotiated has gone from bad to worse, and the current text of the draft outcome document is not salvageable," State Department spokesperson Robert Wood said. "As a result, the United States will not engage in further negotiations on this text, nor will we participate in a conference based on this text. A conference based on this text would be a missed opportunity to speak clearly about the persistent problem of racism." 
"The United States remains open to a positive result in Geneva based on a document that takes a constructive approach to tackling the challenges of racism and discrimination," Wood said. 
Critics of the April conference, say Arab nations will use it as a forum to bash Israel and charge that the draft document will limit freedom of religion and speech. 
Last week, Haaretz learned that the draft resolutions for the conference branded Israel as an occupying state that carries out racist policies. They refer to "the plight of Palestinian refugees and other inhabitants of the Arab occupied territories," apparently meaning Israel itself. 
The senior UN source told Haaretz that the U.S. ended its contact with the nations that drafted the resolutions, which will be voted on during the summit. The Americans did not want a draft resolution reiterating the decisions of the first Durban summit, held in 2001, to be brought to a vote, the source said. 
They also insisted that no country would be specifically mentioned by name in any resolution and even objected to an initiative by Muslim countries to ratify a law banning criticism of any religion in the media, the source added. 
The 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in Durban was meant to lay down a blueprint for nations to address sensitive issues. 
Israel and the United States walked out in protest over a draft text branding Israel as a racist and apartheid state, language that was later dropped. 
The State Department did say though that the U.S. plans to participate in this month's UN Human Rights Council in an observer status though it expressed its reservations over the body's frequent opprobrium of Israel. 
"Our participation as an observer is a sign of the commitment of the Administration to advancing the cause of human rights in the multilateral arena," the State Department said. "We look forward to the help and cooperation of our friends and allies to ensure the Human Rights Council focuses on the pressing human rights concerns of our time." 
Besides the Durban controvery, supporters of Israel will have their hands full. Pro-Palestinian activists plan on staging "Israel Apartheid Week" beginning Monday in New York. Among the prominent participants is Nir Harel, an Israeli member of Anarchists Against the Wall. Events will include "forums, films, cultural events and street protests."

<title>For Israel, a New Year, and a new left</title>
<date>Mon Sep 07 17:08:56 IDT 2009</date>

_____________________
Outside of outright wartime, seldom have the vital signs of Arab-Israeli diplomacy read more bleak. Israel's ruling coalition hinges on a foreign minister so incendiary that his recent prediction that Mideast peace is at least 16 years distant, is as close to moderation as he has yet managed. The Palestinians are rent, geographically, politically, governmentally and religiously, between the West Bank and Gaza. The Israelis are likewise torn, with a minority clinging to the settlement flag, and the majority having opted for an exhausted resignation.
Washington, meanwhile, has precious little to show for efforts to spur Arab diplomatic openness to Israel in return for self-imposed Israeli curbs on West Bank settlement expansion. 
A decade of diplomatic paralysis and brutal military confrontations, coupled with a parallel degeneration of the structures and ideology of Israel's peace camp, have been accompanied by mounting calls by leftists abroad - and to a lesser degree, by leftists in Israel - to mount anti-Israel boycotts as a desperate resort amid stalled domestic Israeli efforts to combat occupation.
Is a permanently broken peace process, then, a foregone conclusion? 
The fact is, there are signs that the Jewish New Year now dawning could signal the beginning of a new alignment of pro-peace forces, one that could spell fundamental progress toward an eventual two-state solution.
1.A new realism on the Israeli left
For the left in Israel to function as more than an insulated elite of the supremely self-admiring, it must take into account the realities of Israeli society, in particular those strengths which can translate into a consensus for a future peace deal. One of the more striking recent examples, one which prompted surprise and even consternation among many of Avneri's followers, is a response by veteran leftist activist Uri Avneri
While maintaining his strong opposition to occupation, Avneri takes issue with condemnations of Israel as an apartheid state, and with the anti-Israel boycotts as a political weapon.     
2. Mounting restiveness in Labor and Meretz.
Another positive sign is an intensive search for new leadership to replace the bullying and the bipolar politics of Labor leader Ehud Barak, and to transfuse and transform the halting and marginal Meretz. Paradoxically, the dismal showing of the two parties in recent elections is likely to be the most effective leverage for new blood in key positions.
3. J Street and the political realignment of U.S. Jewry
For the first time in decades - in sharp contrast to a reality in which many left-oriented Jewish groups were little more than vestigial burial societies or conduits for Israeli fund-raising - a new coalition of groups which are both explicitly pro-peace and pro-Israel is beginning to coalesce, its current centerpiece the national conference of J Street in Washington DC 
The gathering is being held jointly with an unprecedented number of like-minded groups, including Ameinu, Brit Tzedek V'Shalom, and the Israel Policy Forum.
J Street, which has both aided and ridden the Obama wave, is also taking steps to expand its reach and organizational clout
Significantly, the nascent coalition also coincides with:
4. The graying of the Zionist Right
The settler revolution, and its client movements in world Orthodoxy and Israeli politics, has been falling victim to a loss of vigor at a critical time. The watershed 2005 disengagement from Gaza, which pro-settler forces point to as the best proof of their ideology, nonetheless did tremendous damage to the settlement movement's aura of invincibility. Despite the apparent one-off success of Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu [which, despite its anti-Arab rhetoric, has long flirted with out-of-the-box territorial compromise], pro-Greater Israel factions fared poorly in the 2009, with the Jewish Home winning only three votes, and the National Union only four.  
Hamas' curtailing of rocket attacks  [see 6., below] has, for the present at any rate, robbed the settlers of the most effective of their selling points in  fending off calls for a future withdrawal in the West Bank.
One of the most telling indications of the declining vitality of the right are the shopworn, impotent mantras of the pro-settler right ["Settlements are not an obstacle to peace - there were no settlements before 1967 and there was no peace then, either"; "There is no Palestinian people"; "Jews should be able to settle anywhere in the Land of Israel (though Arabs should not)"].  
This phenomenon is, in turn, a result in no small part of:
5. The new centrism in the Israeli consensus
Polls have shown that, with security guaranteed in a satisfactory manner, a majority of Israelis would accept, and in fact, support, a future two-state solution close to that proposed by the Clinton administration: A withdrawal from most of the West Bank, with exchanges of territory bringing the area of a future Palestine equal to that of the pre-1967 war West Bank and Gaza; a Palestinian capital in part of East Jerusalem; equitable administration of holy shrines; and return of refugees to Palestinian territory, with an Israeli declaration of an element of responsibility for the creation of the refugee problem.   
6. A new realism among Palestinians
As Fatah has assumed greater independence and security responsibilities in the West Bank, with a commensurate resurgence of the economy in cities such as Ramallah and Jenin, it has recently signaled that some of the thorniest Israeli-Palestinian issues, including the right of return, could be worked out in the context of formulas like the Geneva Initiative.
Hamas, meanwhile, is under mounting pressure, with its polling numbers down and its problems of governance on the rise. While enforcing a near-complete and self-imposed ban on Qassam rocket attacks against Israel, with beleaguered Gazans loath to see a repeat of the war barely eight months past.
Hamas has had to contend with pressure from a new source: Islamic fundamentalists who view the Hamas government as selling out.  Last month, Hamas forces attacked a mosque stronghold 
7. The Lieberman window.
Prosecutors have said that an indictment against Lieberman on graft charges is now more a matter of when than if. But the "when" could be of paramount importance. If, as some sources suggest, the charges could be filed in a matter of six months, the result could be a major redraw of the Israeli political map. Lieberman's presence in the cabinet is the main stumbling block to a coalition between Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud and Tzipi Livni's even larger Kadima party, which is on record as pushing for a two-state solution.
Even if some Likud MKs made good on implied threats to bolt the coalition if territorial compromise were on the table, a Likud-Kadima-Labor alliance is Barack Obama's best hope for concrete progress toward an Israeli-Palestinian peace.

<title>Galilee communities: We're not racist, we just don't want Arabs </title>
<date>Fri Jun 05 02:16:19 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Residents of the Misgav bloc of communities in the Galilee consider themselves to be liberal, peace-loving people who support coexistence with their Arab neighbors and even root for Bnei Sakhnin, the soccer club based in a nearby Arab town considered a prominent symbol of that community. Which is why they were shocked this week when proposals raised at local council meetings to accept only applicants who shared their Zionist principles drew negative headlines and criticism for alleged racism.  
"The label upsets me," South Africa-born lawyer Michael Zetler, who founded the Misgav community of Manof in 1980 with other immigrants from what was then an apartheid state, said Thursday. "It hurt me. I am not a racist."  
Although few people will say so, the panic that spurred the submission of the controversial proposals are related to the High Court of Justice's ruling two years ago that upheld the right of Ahmed and Fahina Zubeidat, an Israeli Arab couple, to buy a house in the exclusively Jewish community of Rakefet notwithstanding the local admissions committee's objection.  
Since then, some residents of Jewish communal settlements in the Galilee fear that the region's substantial Arab population might seek to buy property in their communities, where the standard of living is far higher, causing Jews to move out. In some areas of the Galilee this has already taken place: Portions of the once-exclusively Jewish town of Upper Nazareth are now populated by newcomers from the nearby Arab city of Nazareth.  
"I agree that there is a problem, but whether this is the right way to deal with it, I am not sure," Zetler said yesterday. "Experience will tell. But there is a problem in the Galilee and people are challenging the political right of [Jewish] communities."  
Unpleasant to be called Lieberman 
Residents of the Misgav bloc are not used to being accused of racism, and dismay at being compared to Jewish settlers in the West Bank. "It's unpleasant and even offensive to wake up one morning and find that you've turned into [Avigdor] Lieberman when in fact it's the other way around," Alon Mayer, another resident of Manof, said, referring to the hawkish Yisrael Beiteinu chairman who proposed that Israeli Arabs be required to take an oath of loyalty to the state.  
Mayer pointed out that the right-wing party headed by Lieberman garnered only 2.5 percent of the town's vote in the last Knesset elections - far below the national average. Despite feeling on the defensive, Mayer will not apologize for supporting the demand that applicants who seek to buy property in the communal settlement should adhere to the locals' basic cultural and political beliefs.  
"When we decided to move to Manof, we sought a community that chose similar basic principles to our own, such as good education for children, culture, celebrating a Jewish communal lifestyle and protecting the environment," a woman from Manof said. "We joined this community knowing it is founded on these values."  
Some Misgav bloc residents accuse Arab rights groups such as Adalah, which would rather Israel be defined as a binational state than a Jewish one and championed the Zubeidats' cause in the courts, of intentionally causing provocations. "An Arab narrative exists that proclaims 'we were not conquered, we did not desert,'" said Danny Ivri, a resident of the Misgav bloc community Yodfat. "They say 'we were manipulated in various ways, such as through military rule and suppressing our development by placing Jewish communities between our own communities."  
Misgav bloc residents also fear increased tensions that could result from Arabs and Jews living in close proximity, and point at the occasional spurts of sectarian violence that break out in nearby non-Jewish towns between Muslims, Druze and Christians. "You can't impose a demographic mix on us that will recreate the sort of friction between Muslims, Christians and Druze that exists in Maghar, Peki'in and Rameh," Mayer said, referring to cities prone to periodic unrest. "High Court justices don't understand what it's like to live in a small community which was founded with great hardships, a community which is trying to hold on to a certain way of life."  
Zionism's bond  of blood 
A few weeks ago a ceremony was held in Yuvalim, the largest town in the Misgav bloc, which exemplified its inveterate ties to the state of Israel. The regional council unveiled a promenade in memory of slain Israel Defense Forces soldier Arbel Reich, whose father was among Yuvalim's founders.  
"It was an emotional ceremony," recalled regional council head Ron Shani. "This event was part of the community's narrative, part of its spirit, just like the fact that we educate our children to serve in combat units. That's what it's like here and we're proud of that.   
"A resident who wishes to join Yuvalim will have to feel comfortable at such a ceremony, and if not he can go elsewhere, where he wouldn't be offended," he said.

<title>Goldstone to Haaretz: U.S. does not have to protect Israel blindly</title>
<date>Fri Nov 13 02:10:37 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Judge Richard Goldstone told Haaretz Thursday that President Shimon Peres' remarks criticizing him were "specious and ill-befitting the head of State of Israel." 
Peres was quoted Wednesday as calling Goldstone "a small man, devoid of any sense of justice, a technocrat with no real understanding of jurisprudence," who was "on a one-sided mission to hurt Israel." 
In Thursday's interview by e-mail with Haaretz, Goldstone said: "I am content to be judged by my actions over the course of my career both in terms of my professional judicial career and my voluntary service." 
Goldstone also said he had anticipated that the report would engender considerable criticism. "After all, no one likes to be accused of committing serious war crimes. However, I was surprised at the many nasty attacks made against me personally. In my view, it was a classic case of attacking the messenger rather than addressing the message." 
Goldstone also rejected the claim that the fact that he is Jewish was exploited to make it more difficult for Israelis to challenge his conclusions. "I was approached because of my experience with regard to the investigation of serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law." 
The Goldstone report is expected to be raised for discussion in the United Nations Security Council in the near future, and Goldstone Thursday discussed the possibility that the United States would veto any resolution that would hurt Israel when it comes to the implementation of the report's findings. "I do not believe that any nation should protect another nation blindly. I would prefer to see the United States furnish reasons for criticizing the report. The United States has supported our call for credible investigations by Israel and by the Gaza authorities, whether the PA or Hamas," he said. 
Goldstone reiterated statements he has made, as well as those made by a number of Israeli human rights groups, inviting an open, public investigation and categorically rejecting a probe by the Israel Defense Forces of the Gaza campaign. "It does not suffice for the military to investigate itself. That will satisfy very few people and certainly not the victims." 
However Goldstone stressed that "in any public inquiry, it would be open to the Israeli government and the IDF to have sensitive security information protected from public disclosure." 
When asked how far up the chain of command he felt such a criminal investigation should go, and whether decision-makers in government be its subject, he replied: "A criminal investigation should go as high up the chain of command, both military and civilian, as the evidence justifies." 
Goldstone, who is widely considered one of the fathers of transitional justice and has extolled its virtues in achieving peace and reconciliation in post-conflict societies, was asked what role he thought a truth and reconciliation commission - which received international recognition as a tool for probing the South African government's actions during apartheid - could play in contributing to a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by establishing accountability in a more constructive fashion than criminal proceedings. Goldstone said he believed it would, "on condition that it is set up to look at allegations on all sides and is established by a democratic process."  
Goldstone was asked how he reconciled his finding that kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit should be accorded the privileges of a prisoner of war, and calling for his immediate release as a humanitarian gesture, with the fact that Hamas is a non-state actor not bound by the Third Geneva Convention, which defines the concept of prisoner of war status. Should not Shalit be defined as an illegal abductee, the victim of a war crime, and his release not subject to the goodwill of Hamas?  
Goldstone replied: "In no way did we regard Hamas as a state party. We decided that it was in the interests of giving greater protection to people in the position of Gilad Shalit to extend prisoner-of-war status to them. We extended existing norms in order to do that. We based this decision on the military operations being controlled by the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention, i.e., that it was an international armed conflict." 
In response to the Israeli allegation that Goldstone's mandate was one-sided, he replied: "This incorrect allegation continues to be made in the attempt to discredit the report despite the fact that it is demonstrably false. The claim is based on a United Nations Human Rights Council resolution that I specifically and explicitly rejected." 
Goldstone also said that he had "demanded and received a balanced mandate to enable me to investigate allegations of war crimes by all sides. The government of Israel clearly knows this, as it is all a matter of public record that I discussed at the press conference announcing the inquiry and its mandate. I believe that the continued reference to the mission's mandate is yet another attempt to avoid addressing the substance of the report." 
Goldstone said he believed that for Israel, "this is unfortunate because the report contains the clearest finding that Hamas and other militant Palestinian groups committed serious war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity. The acceptance of those findings by the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly has been ignored completely by Israel. 
"I suggest that Israel has not acknowledged that because it would confer credibility on the report," Goldstone also said. 
Goldstone called the allegation that the report encourages terror and negates Israel's right to self-defense "quite untrue and a fallacious attempt to win opposition to what is contained in the report. 
"The report is based on the assumption that Israel was entitled to act in self-defense. The investigation was concerned with whether the exercise of the right to self-defense was lawful or unlawful. The condemnation in the report of the rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza is the clearest possible statement against terror, and the endorsement of the report by the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly is probably the first time that the United Nations has recognized Israel's right to act in self-defense against such terror." 
Goldstone also said: "Many Israelis are right to feel that the United Nations and its member bodies such as the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly have devoted inordinate and disproportionate attention to scrutinizing and criticizing Israel. This has come at the price of ignoring violations of human rights in other countries, some of them members of those very same bodies. The time has come for the investigation of all violations of international human rights law and international law whenever they are committed, in any state. 
"However, this disproportionate focus on Israel does not exempt Israel from respecting international law," Goldstone also said. 
"I would suggest that time has come for Israel to look at the allegations not only of the killing and injuring of so many civilians but also the collective punishment meted out to the people of Gaza by the substantial destruction of the infrastructure, and particularly the food infrastructure of Gaza. The debate should continue, not attempt to be silenced."

<title>Group to protest Israel troupe's N.Y. show with dance of its own</title>
<date>Thu Mar 05 23:33:37 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Protesters in New York were set on Thursday evening to demonstrate against an upcoming performance by the Israeli Bat Sheva dance company with a dance of their own.
The dance protest, titled Freedom Dabke vs. Batsheva Dance Company (after the traditional Eastern Mediterranean folk dance), will also feature anti-Apartheid songs, and a performance by the hip-hop artist Invincible. It was to be staged as part of a bid by pro-Palestinian groups to rally support for a boycott of the Israeli dance troupe's show at Brooklyn's Howard Gilman Opera House.
Far-left organizations this week plan to mark the "Israeli Apartheid Week" in 42 cities worldwide, and some groups have called for the protest against the performance, despite artistic director Ohad Naharin's identification with Israel's left and criticism of Israeli policy regarding Palestinians.
Protest organizers explained that Bat Sheva is highly regarded in Israel and receives state funding, serving as an ambassador of goodwill for Israel abroad, and some dancers even serve in reserve military duty.
"New York residents should know the money they pay for tickets will go indirectly to support war crimes and to whitewash Israel's image," one organizer said.

<title>Hamas rejects Carter plea to recognize Israel</title>
<date>Wed Jun 17 21:16:38 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
A senior Hamas official praised former U.S. President Jimmy Carter on Wednesday, a day after he met with the group, but said he failed to persuade the Islamic rulers of Gaza to accept international demands, including recognizing Israel.
Carter visited Gaza on Tuesday and urged Hamas leaders to accept the demands to end an international boycott, which was imposed when the militant group overran Gaza two years ago.
Carter's meeting was itself unusual because of the boycott. The United States, European Union and Israel consider Hamas a terror group and refuse to deal with it directly.
Ahmed Youssef, the deputy Hamas foreign minister, said Gaza's Palestinians were pleased to receive Carter.
"The people think this is a historic visit," Youssef told The Associated Press on Wednesday, describing Carter as somebody very knowledgeable about the conflict and very sincere in the way he understands the conflict.
But Youssef said Hamas turned down Carter's policy requests.
"The visit has not led to a significant change. Hamas finds the conditions unacceptable, he said. Recognizing Israel is completely unacceptable."
According to Hamas ideology, there is no room for a Jewish state in an Islamic Middle East. The militant group has sent dozens of suicide bombers into Israel, killing hundreds.
Even so, some Hamas officials have indicated they could support creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, implying a form of tacit acceptance of Israel.
Youssef said the other two international conditions - renouncing violence and accepting past agreements between Israel and the Palestinians - are irrelevant. He said Israel broke a cease-fire, killing many Palestinians, and the state outlined in the partial peace accords would have no substance, no borders and nothing that a real state is.
Carter has said that despite the world boycott, Mideast peacemaking efforts must include Hamas, which took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, expelling forces loyal to Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose government now effectively rules only the West Bank.
Although then-president Carter brokered the 1979 peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, the first between Israel and an Arab country, he is perceived by many Israelis as anti-Israel, siding with the Palestinians in their conflict.
He antagonized many Israelis with his 2007 book, Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, in which he argued that Israel must choose between ceding the West Bank to the Palestinians or maintaining a system of ethnic inequality similar to that of the apartheid regime in South Africa. Most Israelis strongly reject the comparison.

<title>Host of UN Holocaust memorial skips event after U.S. Jews threaten walk-out</title>
<date>Tue Jan 27 12:13:39 IST 2009</date>
<content>
UN General Assembly President Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann on Tuesday skipped the world body's ceremony marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day, after American Jewish leaders threatened to demonstratively exit Tuesday's if he used the podium to attack Israel.
D'Escoto, who has repeatedly made virulently anti-Israel statements, was to be the event's host by virtue of his official position and was scheduled give the opening speech.
Last year, the General Assembly president likened Israel's actions in the West Bank and Gaza to "the apartheid of an earlier era," and tried to ban Israel's envoy to the UN from speaking at a ceremony to mark 60 years since the institution adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
D'Escoto did send a message to the assembly via the Rwandan envoy to the UN, whom he had asked to serve as his representative. "All genocides, all holocausts start with alienation, denominization and marginalization of others," D'Escoto was quoted as saying in his absence.
AJC Executive Director David A. Harris told Haaretz that d'Escoto had chosen not to attend the event because he knew "he did not belong" there. Harris said D'Escoto also mostly likely understood that "his presence would have insulted the event because of his viscious attacks on Israel."
Professor Gabriela Shalev, Israel's ambassador to the UN, had also threatened to quit the ceremony should d'Escoto lash out at Israel.
Several American Jewish groups, including the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, had earlier sought to have D'Escoto excluded from the ceremony, but to no avail.
In her speech to the assembly, Shalev said the world has the "responsibility not to remain silent" to the genocide perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II. 
"We have the responsibility not to allow genocide of the Jewish people, nor of any other peoplem," she said. "We have the responsibility to learn and to teach the lessons of the Holocaust, to prevent it from ever reoccurring."
"We have the responsibility not to remain silent. For, to remain silent and indifferent to the horrors of the Holocaust is probably the greatest sin of all, let alone denying it," she said, adding: We have the responsibility to act against the forces of anti-Semitism, bigotry, and racism in any form."
UN Chief Ban Ki-Moon, who was unable to attend the ceremony due to an engagement in Madrid, urged the international community to examine why the Holocaust was not stopped in order to prevent future genocides.
"We must continue to examine why the world failed to prevent the Holocaust and other atrocities since," Ban said in a statement. "That way we will be better armed to defeat anti-Semitism and other forms of intolerance."
Some 1,600 guests were expected to attend the event, ranging from Holocaust survivors to UN ambassadors.

<title>In West Bank, Carter speaks of his love for the Palestinians</title>
<date>Sat Jun 13 22:37:54 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was honored by the Palestinian government Saturday and pledged to support the Palestinians' campaign for independence to the end of his days.
In his acceptance speech, Carter urged the Palestinians to end their internal divisions and stop persecuting their rivals.
He was referring to the growing rift between the Islamic militant Hamas group, which controls Gaza, and Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, in charge of the West Bank. Each side has been cracking down on the other's supporters, particularly since Hamas violently overran Gaza two years ago.
Carter met with Hamas' exiled leadership in Syria on Thursday and is to head to Gaza on Sunday, after meeting with Israeli officials. Carter has said peace between Israel and the Palestinians is impossible without involving Hamas, but reiterated in Syria that he was not representing the Obama administration.
Hamas is being shunned by most of the international community, including the U.S., for refusing to recognize Israel or renounce violence, though Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal has said repeatedly in recent weeks that his group wants to be part of a Mideast solution.
In the West Bank, Carter was awarded the Palestine International Award for Excellence and Creativity. Previous recipients included two former international envoys, James Wolfensohn and Peter Hansen.
Carter brokered the Israeli-Egypt peace accord of 1979 and several years ago wrote a book, Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, that is sharply critical of Israeli policies in the occupied territories.
"I have been in love with the Palestinian people for many years," he said Saturday, adding that this is a feeling shared by members of his family.
"I have two great-grandsons that are rapidly learning about the people here and the anguish and suffering and deprivation of human rights that you have experienced ever since 1948," he said.
Referring to President Barack Obama's call for an Israeli settlement freeze, Carter said that "in the future, I am sure, he will call for the dismantling of the settlements that exist."
But he noted that Obama also called for an end to violence against Israelis and for Arab acceptance of Israelis' right to their own nation. Carter said such acceptance is painful for displaced Palestinians, but that there has to be an accommodation in the political world.
Carter, 85, pledged his assistance, "as long as I live, to win your freedom, your independence, your sovereignty and a good life."

Government officials in Jerusalem harshly criticized the new European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, for her scathing remarks about the "Israeli occupation" in her maiden speech. 
Ashton on Tuesday leveled scathing criticism at Israeli policy in her first speech as the European Union's first high representative for foreign affairs and security policy.
The government officials in Jerusalem said they were surprised, dissatisfied and concerned that such a senior figure had expressed criticism before visiting Israel and learning the facts. 
They said the remarks cast a pall over relations with the European Union, and that they were particularly angry that she had not welcomed the settlement construction freeze, as had her European colleagues. 
The British stateswoman, who has also served as the Commissioner for Trade in the European Commission, said that in the EU's view, "East Jerusalem is occupied territory, together with the West Bank."
Ashton demanded that Israel immediately lift its blockade on the Gaza Strip, and reiterated that the union opposes the existence of the West Bank separation fence, as it opposes evictions of Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem.
The stateswoman, whose full title is Baroness Ashton of Upholland, also only defined Israel's partial freeze of West Bank settlement construction as a "first step," as opposed to the warmer description of the move by EU foreign ministers, who last week took "positive note" of it. 
In her address to MEPs in Strasbourg, Ashton, who was only recently appointed to the new position, said she had spoken with Israelis, Palestinians and the U.S. Secretary of State about the role the Quartet of international mediators, and that of its special envoy to the region, Tony Blair.
Ashton said she had told Blair personally that, "The Quartet [a special group set up by the U.S., EU, UN and Russia] must demonstrate that it is worth the money, that it is capable of being reinvigorated."
Following her comments, a number of MEPs from the Liberal side of the house called for punitive measures against Israel, including the suspension of the EU's Association Agreement. Irish centre-left member Proinsias De Rossa, who visited the West Bank last week, called Israel's treatment of Palestinians a form of "apartheid."
This time it was neither the "infamous" Swedish president who pulled the EU toward an anti-Israel resolution, nor a "daydreaming judge" in Britain who issued an arrest warrant against an Israeli foreign minister. Criticism of Israel has become the language of choice in European discourse.
When the Israeli government offers new benefits to settlers, and peace talks with the Palestinians are deadlocked, even the superpower's long arm is helpless. Even former U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk, a devout Jew who serves as an external advisor to U.S. President Barack Obama, does not hide his chagrin with the settlements policy.
Indyk has recently told Haaretz in an interview that statements by figures like Minister without Portfolio Benny Begin, according to which settlement construction will continue despite the moratorium, are damaging to Israel's interests. He said these comments, as well as the decision to pump funds into isolated settlements, strengthen the impression that the declaration of the freeze is not worth the paper it is written on. He warned that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will pay a political price for the move, without gaining the benefits which it was intended to grant Israel in the international arena.
The interview with Indyk will be published in Haaretz's Sunday edition.

<title>Israelis fight fire with fire over Apartheid Week</title>
<date>Fri Mar 06 03:07:36 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Inspired by a controversial "Israeli Apartheid Week" poster, two local artists released a spoof they dubbed "Hypocrisy Week." 
The poster created by David Guy and Guy Gurfinkel
The original Canadian poster was an advertisement for an annual series of anti-Israel events held on campuses around the world. 
It shows a gunship bearing the word "Israel" firing at a kaffiyeh-clad boy holding a teddy bear. 
The poster was banned from two Ottawa universities over complaints that it displayed Israelis as child-killers. 
The spoof shows the same boy being used as a shield by militants launching rockets at Israel, while journalists film the boy. 
It was created by Australia-born David Guy, 54, from Rehovot, and his son's best friend, 23-year-old Guy Gurfinkel from Shoham, who will begin studies at the Bezalel Academy of Arts next year. 
"I've arranged the pieces, but Gurfinkel's the real artist," David Guy told Haaretz.

<title>Israelis must stand with Ethiopian students over school ban</title>
<date>Sun Aug 30 03:36:54 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
There is only one subject that doesn't have to be studied, that is best lived, experienced. Math, English, even Bible study cannot be traded for life experience, and doesn't need to be. Civics is the only subject that can and should be put to the test of daily life.  
The new school year starts on Tuesday, and we are already being tested. This year we cannot respond as we did last year. There is no rest for the wicked, and the wicked are those who schemed to leave children of Ethiopian descent outside the fence, looking in, longing to be on the other side. Tell it not in Stockholm, publish it not in the streets of Oslo, lest the newspapers of the uncircumcised rejoice.  
In two days' time Israeli society may be facing a badly timed window of opportunity, one we never imagined in our worst nightmares but which, to our shame, is before is. It is an opportunity for the entire educational system to practice what it preaches in civics classes.  
It is an opportunity for the education system to teach a chapter of immeasurable value in good citizenship, a lesson so important that it could replace an entire year of civics lessons and thereby save valuable classroom hours.  
If religious schools in Petah Tikva or anywhere else insist on refusing to admit Ethiopian students, if all of the pleading and threats of the education minister don't help, then every Israeli will have no choice but to identify with the Ethiopian children in whose faces the gate of apartheid has been slammed. No one will be able to make do any longer with admonishments and reproofs.  
The entire education system will go on strike in solidarity with the little girl who stands and asks why. There is no value in education for values if one black boy remains shunned and shamed.  
A thousand outstanding teachers and ten thousand outstanding lessons would not erase this black mark if we discharge our duty with lip service. The education minister's most recent sermon, in which he said "the most important thing is to strengthen education of Jewish, Zionist, democratic and social values," will ring hollow, worthless and embarrassing.  
And so, with public opinion firmly behind us - including including students, parents and teachers - we shall lock the gates of every school. If the Ethiopian children are not allowed in, then we too, all of us, will remain outside with them, until a gate of hope ("Petah Tikva") opens to an Israeli society that is before our eyes becoming ugly to the point that it is unrecognizable, and which we must change.  
If a general strike is too much for some parents who are already preparing their children ready for school, I have an alternative: All the celebrities that Education Minister Gideon Sa'ar invited to teach at schools on Tuesday should devote their remarks to those same children who don't have a classroom, or a teacher, or classmates.

<title>Israeli tennis star Shahar Peer faces Gaza protest while playing in New Zealand</title>
<date>Thu Jan 08 07:21:16 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Israeli tennis player Shahar Peer, 22, was subject to a small but noisy protest over her country's invasion of Gaza when she played a quarter-final match at the ASB Classic tournament in Auckland on Thursday.
About 20 protestors waving anti-Israel placards yelled slogans outside the stadium's main entrance opposed by a lone Israeli demonstrator with a sign saying, "Hamas murders hope."
Security was tight and the demonstrators moved on before the start of Peer's match, which she lost to number one seed Elena Dementieva of Russia in 63 minutes.
Peer, who earlier rejected calls to withdraw from the tournament, said later, "I am not the government of Israel and I not representing Israel in politics. I am a tennis player and that's what I represent now."
Protest organizer John Minto, who led a campaign against New Zealand's sporting contacts with apartheid South Africa in the 1970s, said the demonstration would make New Zealanders think more deeply about what their country could do to support the Palestinian struggle.
Minto called Wednesday for a shoe-waving protest against Peer's participation in the tournament but this did not happen.
Peer, who was making her third appearance at the Auckland tournament, said she had never been targeted by protestors anywhere before.

<title>Israel rejects revised draft of Durban II statement</title>
<date>Wed Mar 18 20:10:38 IST 2009</date>
<content>
A senior Foreign Ministry source said Wednesday thay Israel rejects the latest draft of the closing statement for the "Durban 2" anti-racism conference, despite revisions aimed at dropping direct criticism of Israek.
While all direct references to Israel and the Israel-Palestinianconflict have been removed in an attempt to keep the European Unionfrom boycotting, it still implicitly singles out Israel.
"The first clause in the new document reaffirms the declaration of'Durban 1,' which calls Israel a racist state, and the change iscosmetic only. The essence remains the same," the official said. "Thisis a diplomatic ruse intended to blur matters and introduce criticismof Israel by the back door."
The statement will be issued at the end of the second United Nationssponsored World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination,Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, to be held in Geneva on April 20.
The previous version of the "Durban 2" closing statement led theUnited States, Canada and Italy to announce they would be boycottingthe conference. Other EU countries, as well as Australia and NewZealand, also threatened to boycott.
The edited version was crafted by a committee headed by Russia, withthe goal of preventing the boycott.
While all direct references to Israel and the Middle East have beeneliminated, the Foreign Ministry says it references the closingstatement from Durban 1, which was held in 2001 in Durban, SouthAfrica. That document presented Israel as an "apartheid state," andsingled out Israel as racist.
Israel and the United States walked out of the 2001 Durban conferenceto protest draft conference texts branding Israel as a racist andapartheid state language that was later dropped. The Foreign Ministryon Tuesday instructed its envoys to continue asking their hostcountries to boycott the conference.

<title>Israel tells El Al: Call it a separation fence, not a wall</title>
<date>Tue Jun 09 01:56:08 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
El Al passengers have received maps of Israel marking out a "separation wall" along the West Bank, but the Foreign Ministry has asked the airline to change the classification to "security fence," Haaretz has learned. New maps are to be distributed soon.  
The ministry learned of the maps from the consul general in Los Angeles, Yeki Dayan, who visited Israel several weeks ago.   
When he boarded a flight, he received a map of Israel with his newspaper and found that the line along the West Bank had been termed "separation wall."  
When he returned to the United States, Dayan approached El Al's offices in Los Angeles and told them the government preferred "security fence." In Israel, the Foreign Ministry had a similar discussion with the company's headquarters.  
The naming of the barrier has been a bone of contention between Israel and its critics; the barrier is sometimes a fence, sometimes a wall.  
Israel officially uses the term "security fence," saying it aims to prevent terror attacks in Israel. The Palestinian Authority, many European and Arab governments, and many left-wing organizations around the world use the term "separation wall." Some of them use the term "apartheid wall."  
El Al said in a statement yesterday that the maps were prepared by a company under contract. "As soon as the Foreign Ministry approached us we withdrew those maps and ordered new ones," the company said.

<title>Israel to face 'catastrophe' without Palestinian state, says Jimmy Carter</title>
<date>Tue Jan 27 08:48:48 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Former President Jimmy Carter said Monday that Israel will face a "catastrophe" unless it revives the Mideast peace process and establishes an independent Palestinian state.
In an interview with The Associated Press, he said Arabs will outnumber Jews in the Holy Land in the foreseeable future.
"If we look toward a one-state solution, which seems to be the trend - I hope not inexorable - it would be a catastrophe for Israel, because there would be only three options in that case," Carter said.
One would be to expel large numbers of Palestinians, which he said would amount to "ethnic cleansing."
The second would be to deprive the Palestinians of equal voting rights, which he said would amount to "apartheid."
The third would be to give the Palestinians equal voting rights, and therefore the majority, he said.
"And you would no longer have a Jewish state," Carter said. "The basic decisions would be made by the Palestinians, who would almost very likely vote in a bloc, whereas you would have some sharp divisions among the Israelis, because the Israelis always have different points of view."
Carter spoke to The Associated Press as his new book, "We Can Have Peace in the Holy Land," was released.
His wording on Israel's options was not new. His 2006 book, "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid," provoked a hail of criticism, particularly from Jewish-Americans who felt it unfairly compared Israeli treatment of Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza to the legalized racial oppression that once existed in South Africa.
Carter still believes a two-state solution is the best option, with all of Israel's Arab neighbors recognizing its right to exist in peace, and Israel withdrawing from most of the land it captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War to create an independent Palestine.
Carter brokered the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt 30 years ago, and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.

<title>Jerusalem & Babylon / The story that got away </title>
<date>Fri Dec 18 01:11:18 IST 2009</date>
<content>
I met this week a senior IDF general who had been intimately involved with the planning and execution of last year's Operation Cast Lead. I asked whether he was planning a trip to London any time soon. "I never went on vacation in Britain, even before the arrest warrants began," he answered half jokingly. "My parents were in the [pre-state underground militia] Etzel - MI5 still has a file on my family."  
While I was busy chatting with the general, the biggest story of the week was staring me in the face and I missed it. It could have been mine days earlier; but instead, Al Jazeera was first.  
A week earlier I had learned that Tzipi Livni would be speaking at a Jewish National Fund event in London, and then heard she had apparently canceled. It should have been obvious to me that some pro-Palestinian lawyer was going to try and slap her with an arrest warrant, and I probably could have confirmed this in a couple of phone calls to London. But somehow I missed it, my usually keen journalistic instincts somehow dulled by a backlog of work and other pressing tasks.  
Another story that got away, only to scream its obviousness at me once it came out elsewhere. Obvious to me, that is.  
What I still find very surprising about the Livni-war crimes-arrest warrant story is the number of Israelis, normally very aware and in touch with life outside the bubble, who were themselves surprised by the entire episode. They seemed to feel that the former foreign minister being threatened with arrest somehow moved the whole issue up a notch.  
Why? Because she is a woman? Because according to Israeli politics, Kadima lead by Livni is pegged as a centrist, even centrist-left party? Does that make her any different from all the ex-generals who have so far been threatened with international jurisdiction and surprise arrests for war crimes? For god's sake, she was part of the innermost forum that decided on the exact dates and stages of Cast Lead, along with Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert (and according to some reports, of the three, she was most in favor of extending and prolonging the operation).  
Ultimately, Livni is responsible for what at least one highly regarded international jurist claims was a series of war crimes. Why did anyone expect her to get preferential treatment? Why does anyone think she should somehow be exempt from responsibility, while for the last four years just about every senior Israel Defense Forces officer - in active service or the reserves - has been forced to give up shopping on Oxford Street and Knightsbridge? And Britain is just one country - the same is true of visits to many other western European nations. Scandinavia, Spain and Belgium are all off-limits to the entire senior class of IDF officers as well as a select group of politicians.  
There is a much wider issue at stake here, beyond former ministers' and generals' lecture engagements and holiday plans. Those who say that this is Israel's battle for international legitimacy are only telling us part of the story. The reality is that in many countries, that battle is over, that battle has been lost. In some of the most "enlightened" nations of the Western world, identifying Israel as a racist, warmongering apartheid state is no longer a radical view, shared mainly by anti-Semites and "Arab lovers" - it has become the mainstream opinion.  
Three years ago, then prime minister Tony Blair promised his Israeli counterparts that the legislation allowing private citizens in Britain to obtain arrest warrants for foreigners suspected of carrying out war crimes would be amended. And he meant it. No one had to point out to Mr. Blair that with the wars taking place in Iraq and Afghanistan, he, his colleagues and the officers of the British Army and their American allies could also find themselves in the dock. Blair's successor Gordon Brown has also made similar promises.  
So why was this amendment never put into effect? Not because the Labour government could not find the necessary majority in parliament. And the leaders of the Conservative Party have also privately assured the Israeli embassy in London that it would support such a motion. No, the British government hesitated and prevaricated because they knew full well just how downright unpopular such a move would be. They would have been eviscerated by the local press, by every single human-rights movement, by the Archbishops, the professors and by the great majority of their own grassroots memberships.  
For a weak and deeply unpopular government, this was too much to contemplate. In other words, while Israel may be able to comfort itself with a degree of sympathy from Britain's political leadership, it has lost the understanding of the rest of the country's opinion makers.  
Some of you may be asking, So what? Britian's days as a superpower are long over. True, but in the arena of international media and public opinion, Britain still punches way above its natural weight. The maiden speech given by Catherine Ashton - who is from Britain and the European Union's new high representative for foreign affairs and security policy - in which she roundly criticized Israeli policies is just the latest striking example. The response from Israeli politicians, a proposal to boycott British products, already signed by a third of the Knesset, is risible. Just as the connection Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman made between global anti-Semitism and the arrest warrants in his speech on Wednesday is pointless, neither is another round of moaning about Israel's "hasbara failure" going to get us anywhere. The point at which a change in PR tactics might have remedied Israel's international situation has long passed.  
No amount of explanation as to why there is no room for comparison will help any more. As far as much of the world is concerned, Israel today is the South Africa of yesteryear. And as it was with the end of apartheid, the only remedy here is relinquishing control of the West Bank and part of Jerusalem and establishing a viable Palestinian state. The alternative is accepting our status as a pariah state.  
I happened to be in Britain both during the opening week of the Second Lebanon War and the first days of Operation Cast Lead, and naturally I followed the media coverage closely. My unscientific observation was that in the second case, Israel's official spokesmen were actually given wider opportunity to explain its position than they had been two and a half years earlier, and on the whole, while still generally critical, the tone in the media seemed to be less anti-Israel during the Gaza operation.  
Belatedly, I realized this wasn't a greater acceptance of Israel's actions, it was simply acceptance by the British reporters and broadcasters that Israel, as far as they are concerned, is a rogue nation - perpetually engaged in bloodshed, certainly no better than its Hamas adversary. We can continue to huff and puff as much as we like, but for the rest of the world, an arrest warrant against an Israeli politician isn't a shocking news story, it is simply a fact of life.

<title>Jerusalem-born Jew elected to Fatah Revolutionary Council</title>
<date>Sat Aug 15 20:37:17 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
The official list published Saturday of winners in elections to the Revolutionary Council of the Palestinian Fatah movement included 67-year-old Dr. Uri Davis, a Jerusalem-born Jew.
He was the first Jew to become a member of the Revolutionary Council since it was established in 1958.
Davis, who in the 1980s abandoned his Israeli citizenship in protest over Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and later received Palestinian citizenship, was the only non-Arab to run for a seat in the Revolutionary Council, Fatah's legislative body.
When his name was announced as number 31 on the list of winners, members in the auditorium of the Bethlehem school where the conference held its meetings applauded long and loud.
Davis, who considers himself anti-Zionist and who after renouncing his Israeli citizenship joined Fatah because he says he saw it as a socialist movement, was among more than 600 Fatah activists who competed for 80 seats of the council.
Author of the books "Israel: An Apartheid State," published in 1987 and "Apartheid Israel: Possibilities for the Struggle Within," published in 2004, Davis prefers to identify himself as a Palestinian Hebrew.
Speaking perfect Arabic, he teaches Jewish studies at the Palestinian al-Quds University in Abu Dis, located just outside an eight-meter high concrete wall Israel has built around occupied East Jerusalem to separate it from its West Bank environs.
Davis said in Bethlehem last week as he was campaigning for a seat in the Revolutionary Council that he wants to see more anti-Zionist Israelis and internationals take up leading posts in Fatah.
Fatah opened its sixth congress, the first in 20 years, in the West Bank city of Bethlehem on August 4.
After a week of deliberations, over 2,000 delegates voted for 18 seats on the 23-seat Central Council, whose official results were announced on Wednesday, and for 81 seats of the 128-seat Revolutionary Council.
The results showed at least 70 new members entering the Revolutionary Council, with members from the Gaza Strip winning 20 seats and women winning 11.
The highest number of votes went to a woman who spent many years in Israeli jails for her role in the resistance. Christian members won four seats.
New members include a number of Fatah activists from the diaspora, including Samir Rifai, Fatah's secretary in Syria, and Khaled Abu Usba, who participated in a terror attack in the 1980s in which at least 30 Israelis were killed.
They also include Fadwa Barghouti, wife of jailed Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, who is serving five life sentences in Israel for his role in the second Intifada, and who has been elected to the Fatah Central Committee.
Addressing the winners, Abbas declared Fatah's sixth congress "a new launch for Fatah," saying: "We have great work ahead of us."
He urged the members to work toward "reviving Fatah, which today more than any previous time needs the efforts of its young members to lead the movement into the future."
Abbas said he will convene the PLO's parliament-in-exile, the Palestinian National Council, for an "extraordinary meeting" in the next few days in an effort to start work on reforming the Palestinian umbrella organization.

<title>Jerusalem: EU foreign policy chief's remarks 'cast a pall' over relations </title>

The interview with Indyk is to be published on Sunday.

<title>Jimmy Carter to U.S. Jews: Forgive me for stigmatizing Israel</title>
<date>Tue Dec 22 09:52:28 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter has apologized to the American Jewish community for 'stigmatizing Israel' and asked for forgiveness for his actions, the JTA reported on Monday.
"We must recognize Israel's achievements under difficult circumstances, even as we strive in a positive way to help Israel continue to improve its relations with its Arab populations, but we must not permit criticisms for improvement to stigmatize Israel," Carter wrote in a letter to the JTA.
"As I would have noted at Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, but which is appropriate at any time of the year, I offer an Al Het for any words or deeds of mine that may have done so," Carter wrote, referring to the prayer said on Yom Kippur in which Jews ask God for forgiveness for any sins. 
Carter has angered American Jews in the past by likening Israeli policy in the West Bank to apartheid South Africa in his book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid".
According to the JTA, Anti-Defamation League national director Abraham Foxman, who in the past claimed Carter's comments bordered on anti-Semitism, welcomed the former president's statement. 
"We welcome any statement from a significant individual such as a former president who asks for Al Het," Foxman said. "To what extent it is an epiphany, time will tell. There certainly is hurt which needs to be repaired."

<title>Ken Loach slams Lev Cinemas over profit gesture </title>
<date>Mon Oct 19 01:21:10 IST 2009</date>
<content>
British film director Ken Loach responded sharply last week to a statement by Lev Cinemas CEO Nurit Shani, who said that profits from Loach's films in Israel would be dedicated to promoting Israeli films at home and abroad.  
Loach is a strong advocate of boycotting Israeli films to protest Israel's policies in the territories.  
In his response, published in "Screen Daily," he criticized Shani for political and cultural reasons, and said profits from his films should support artists who back the cultural boycott, "those brave free spirits" who refuse to accept money from the Israeli government.  
Shani made her comments before Loach's latest film, "Looking for Eric," was aired at the Haifa Film Festival over Sukkot this month, while describing Loach's energetic efforts to impose a comprehensive boycott on films made in cooperation with Israel or with Israeli government funding.  
Loach responded: "Who knows, perhaps some time in the future Shani's vision will help kick-start projects about those courageous Israeli soldiers who formed the group Breaking the Silence and spoke out against the 'reckless and gratuitous use of white phosphorous' in civilian areas in Gaza, and were appalled by the use of Palestinians as human shields?"  
His response was also credited to the film's producer Rebecca O'Brien and screenwriter Paul Laverty.  
"Perhaps too we will be fortunate to watch films about those young men and women in Israeli prisons who refuse to join the Israeli army because of the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands. And why not include Palestinian film makers or is Israel really an apartheid state?"  
Loach also complained that Shani did not have the good manners to inform him that his film would be screened at the Haifa festival, as is accepted practice.  
In conclusion, he quoted the Israeli poet, Aharon Shabtai, who said: "I do not believe that a state that maintains an occupation, committing on a daily basis crimes against civilians, deserves to be invited to any kind of cultural (event)."  
Loach's other recent actions against Israeli cinema have included his call for a boycott of the Edinburgh international film festival in May, because the Israeli government had paid the travel expenses of Israeli director Tali Shalom Ezer, whose film, "Surrogate," was being shown there.

<title>L.A. Jews mull boycott of Israel university over 'apartheid' op-ed</title>
<date>Sat Aug 22 22:43:56 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Members of the Los Angeles Jewish community have threatened to withhold donations to an Israeli university in protest of an op-ed published by a prominent Israeli academic in the Los Angeles Times on Friday, in which he called to boycott Israel economically, culturally and politically.
Dr. Neve Gordon of Ben-Gurion University in Be'er Sheva, a veteran peace activist, branded Israel as an apartheid state and said that a boycott was "the only way to save it from itself."
Gordon, a political scientist, said that "apartheid state" is the most accurate way to describe Israel today. 
"3.5 million Palestinians and almost half a million Jews live in the areas Israel occupied in 1967," Gordon wrote, "and yet while these two groups live in the same area, they are subjected to totally different legal systems. The Palestinians are stateless and lack many of the most basic human rights. By sharp contrast, all Jews - whether they live in the occupied territories or in Israel - are citizens of the state of Israel." 
"It is indeed not a simple matter for me as an Israeli citizen to call to suspend cooperation with Israel," he further wrote.  "The words and condemnations from the Obama administration and the European Union have yielded no results, not even a settlement freeze, let alone a decision to withdraw from the occupied territories." 
Gordon was in the public spotlight in 2002, during Israel's assault on the Palestinian Authority, as one of the Israelis who stayed with Yasser Arafat in his compound. In 2003, he was a vocal critic of Paratroopers Brigadier Col. Aviv Kochavi. 
In the wake of the publication of the article, Israel's Consul-General in Los Angeles, Yaakov (Yaki) Dayan sent a letter to the president of Ben-Gurion University, Prof. Rivka Carmi, in which he said that such statements may be detrimental to the university. 
"Since the article was published I've been contacted by people who care for Israel; some of them are benefactors of Ben-Gurion University," Dayan wrote.  "They were unanimous in threatening to withhold their donations to your institution. My attempt to explain that one bad apple would affect hundreds of researchers turned out to be futile."
"I believe that the definitive answer to anti-Zionist lecturers like Gordon is to set up a center for Zionist studies, which unfortunately does not exist in Israeli academia," he continued. "This center would help dispel the lies disseminated by Gordon in the name of your university."

And yet while these two groups live in the same area, they are subjected to totally different legal systems. The Palestinians are stateless and lack many of the most basic human rights. By sharp contrast, all Jews - whether they live in the occupied territories or in Israel - are citizens of the state of Israel."  
"It is indeed not a simple matter for me as an Israeli citizen to call to suspend cooperation with Israel," Gordon wrote. "The words and condemnations from the Obama administration and the European Union have yielded no results, not even a settlement freeze, let alone a decision to withdraw from the occupied territories."  
In the wake of the article's publication, Israel's consul-general in Los Angeles, Yaakov Dayan sent a letter to the president of Ben-Gurion University, Prof. Rivka Carmi, in which he said such statements could be detrimental to the university.  
"Since the article was published I've been contacted by people who care for Israel; some of them are benefactors of Ben-Gurion University," Dayan wrote. "They were unanimous in threatening to withhold their donations to your institution. My attempt to explain that one bad apple would affect hundreds of researchers turned out to be futile."  
"I believe the definitive answer to anti-Zionist lecturers like Gordon is to set up a center for Zionist studies, which unfortunately does not exist in Israeli academia," he continued. "This center would help dispel the lies disseminated by Gordon in the name of your university."

<title>Meretz leader to Haaretz: Two-state solution on last legs </title>
<date>Fri Feb 06 01:45:52 IST 2009</date>
<content>
You gotta love Jumes. You can disagree with him and you can get mad him, but in the end, you have to have great warmth for him. In the age of Lieberman's nationalism and Eyal Arad's spin, Meretz chair Haim Oron is like an antibody. Even when he goofs, he goofs with his heart in the right place.  
If any two numbers reveal just how awful this election is, it's these: Lieberman 20, Meretz five. The Lieberman-Meretz gap raises serious questions about the future and the present of the state of Israel. From his Tel Aviv campaign headquarters, Jumes is still fighting to change both.  
Why Meretz? For half their lives, half of Haaretz's readers have been voting Meretz and nothing good has come of it.  
Meretz is a kind of start-up. It tosses out ideas that catch on later and other people implement them. But I don't accept that division of labor any more. It's not okay with me that there is an incubator for ideas in one place and they sprout somewhere else. There should be one political entity that represents the social-democratic and peace positions. And that entity is Meretz.  
But Meretz isn't having an easy time in this election. Barak and Livni are gnawing at your position from one side, Hadash is chewing on the other. Let's start with Labor chair Ehud Barak. Why not Barak?  
Barak is running in 2009 as a successful defense minister who rehabilitated the army and conducted an operation in Gaza. He is not running as the leader of the peace camp.  
So maybe Kadima chair Tzipi Livni is the leader of the peace camp. She promises a dove with an olive branch. Just open the window and let her in.  
Livni saved herself the question of right and left by not going where she has to decide if she is right or left. She hasn't gotten to dividing Jerusalem and hasn't gotten to resolving the refugee problem. She might have a clearer picture in her own mind. Livni talks about the courage to tell the public the truth. And I say: 'Tzipi, with all due respect to your courage, the question is what you tell Palestinians behind closed doors about Jerusalem.' I don't know what she says. She isn't where Bibi is but she hasn't even gotten to the places that Olmert has. I think both she and Barak make comments from the hazy center that blur the truth. That haze harms the foundations of democracy. It makes political parties into unions of interested parties. It makes the public fed-up with politics because people figure politicians don't say what they really think.  
Then Hadash. Dov Khenin says what he really thinks. He is clearer and sharper than Meretz. He has a kind of charisma.  
Black-and-white positions look sharp, but reality is not black-and-white. I oppose the injustices that took place in Gaza but I do not accept that Israel doesn't have the right to self-defense. But the underlying conflict between Meretz and Hadash is more substantial. I am a Zionist. I see Israel as a Jewish state that must be democratic and must be for all its citizens. Anyone who says there is tension here is right. It is the tension we live with here. Khenin releases himself from that tension by defining himself as the non-Zionist left. I believe that dealing with the complexities of life in Israel is more moral than disengaging.  
Let's admit the truth, Jumes. The warfare in Gaza hurt Meretz twice. On the one hand it brought Labor back into the game and on the other it boosted Hadash. You guys look hesitant.  
There is no way a left-wing party like ours doesn't come out of war bruised. There was an option of calling the war right and just, and anything done in it was good. There was an option to say that Israel doesn't have the right of response even after 60, 80, 100 rocket strikes. I think both options are oversimplified. So Meretz took the position that a focused military action against Hamas was justified, but it is not okay to cross lines in the sand. And in this war there were lines in the sand.  
Your sons fought in an operation that some of your voters believe was a war crime.  
I told you, I live in the tension between poles. One the one hand is the need to remove the threat, but on the other there were tractors that demolished Gaza neighborhoods in the last days of the ground operation. I do not accept that. I believe there is a line that we cannot cross if we want to remain who we are.  
Do you still believe in peace? Has the word "peace" been erased from your campaign?  
Neither the word nor belief in peace have been erased. The lack of peace and the continued occupation are the greatest dangers to the future of Israel.  
Is the two-state solution viable? Can it still be implemented?  
The two-state solution is on its last legs. That is why this election is so important. If we do not quickly implement the partition into two states, that solution will evaporate and Zionism will be stuck its worst crisis ever. This could turn into a bad cross between Rhodesian apartheid and Somalian bloodshed.  
That bad?  
Let me tell you a story. A few days after Sari Nusseibeh retracted his position on two states, I went into Ehud Olmert's office and told him that he should take the report of Nusseibeh's comment like he would take the news that an Arab state has a nuclear bomb.  
For decades I have fought for peace. In Peace Now, in Mapai and in Meretz. The two-state solution is the only solution. And I live in fear today. I see the light fading. Why did my parents come here? To what have I devoted my life? For what am I here? For a Jewish and democratic state. And if there is no Jewish and democratic state, what am I left with?  
If the situation is so dramatic, maybe it's better not to vote for a small party like Meretz.  
Not true. There is no one else like Meretz now. We are the only leftist Zionist alternative that believes in peace, human rights and social democracy.  
Some say Amos Oz has become your guru. You are the Eli Yishai of Meretz and Oz is your Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.  
Amos and I have a very close relationship. We do and our families do. But there is no spiritual leader here. There is no authority. We are attentive, not authoritative.  
Would you join a unity government with Netanyahu?  
We won't sit in a government with Netanyahu as prime minister.  
And a unity government with Livni?  
If it is possible to create a center-left government we would be a substantial factor. If it is a unity government of mutual paralysis, we would rather serve the public from the opposition bench. Against the rise of the right and the Israeli racism of Lieberman, Meretz will provide an ideological and political platform that will become an alternative.

<title>New Durban 2 statement still singles out Israel </title>
<date>Thu Mar 19 01:09:50 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Israel rejects the latest draft of the "Durban 2" anti-racism conference closing statement, a senior Foreign Ministry source said.  
While all direct references to Israel and the Israel-Palestinian conflict have been removed - in an attempt to keep the European Union from boycotting - it still implicitly singles out Israel.  
"The first clause in the new document reaffirms the declaration of 'Durban 1,' which calls Israel a racist state, and the change is cosmetic only. The essence remains the same," the official said. "This is a diplomatic ruse intended to blur matters and introduce criticism of Israel by the back door."  
The statement will be issued at the end of the second United Nations-sponsored World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, to be held in Geneva on April 20.  
The previous version of the "Durban 2" closing statement led the United States, Canada and Italy to announce they would be boycotting the conference. Other EU countries, as well as Australia and New Zealand, also threatened to boycott.  
The edited version was crafted by a committee headed by Russia, with the goal of preventing the boycott.  
While all direct references to Israel and the Middle East have been eliminated, the Foreign Ministry says it references the closing statement from Durban 1, which was held in 2001 in Durban, South Africa. That document presented Israel as an "apartheid state," and singled out Israel as racist.  
The Foreign Ministry yesterday instructed its envoys to continue asking their host countries to boycott the conference.

The renowned Portuguese author Jose Saramago and dozens of leading opinion-shapers were listed as cosignatories in an "urgent" petition for removing Hamas and all Palestinian "liberation organizations" from the European list of terrorist groups. The initiative's organizer, Nadine Rosa-Rosso, signed on other notables such as Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Maguire and author Danny Morrison from Ireland and South Africa's former intelligence minister, Ronnie Kasrils. The petition was circulated as pro-Palestinian activists around the world launch the fifth "Israeli Apartheid Week." (Cnaan Liphshiz)  
The largest Jewish body in the United States yesterday lauded the Obama administration's decision not to participate in a United Nations anti-racism summit known as Durban II, which it fears will be used as a forum to criticize Israel. Alan Solow, Chairman, and Malcolm Hoenlein, Executive Vice Chairman, of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, said they greatly appreciate the decision of the Obama administration not to participate and urged the European Union to follow its lead.

<title>New Yorkers call for boycott of Motorola over dealings with IDF</title>
<date>Thu Jul 23 22:35:52 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Protesters in the New York borough of Queens held a rally last week to call for a boycott of Motorola over the firm's business dealings with the Israel Defense Forces.
At the demonstration, which was organized by the New York Campaign for the Boycott of Israel, protestors waved Palestinian flags and signs saying: "Goodbye Moto, Goodbye Apartheid," and "Boycott Motorola, Free Palestine."
The group also wrote songs and conducted street theater to draw the attention of passersby.
The organization's spokesperson, Aaron Levitt, told Haaretz this week that over 300 people have signed a petition for a boycott of Motorola after just four events in New York City.
"Every time we go out to flyer, we meet many people who express support for the campaign and even sign our pledge to boycott Motorola," said Levitt. His organization has more events planned for the coming month.
In June 2007, the New England United Methodist Church named Motorola as one of a number of firms that supported Israel's occupation of the West Bank. Who Profits, a project of the Coalition of Women for Peace, also lists the company as profiting from Israel's activities in the Palestinian territories.
Motorola has been active in Israel since 1964; it currently provides the IDF with a cellular network through a subsidiary, MIRS.
MIRS provided the IDF with a military-encrypted cellular communication system, nicknamed "Mountain Rose," which is worth $100 million and was especially constructed for field conditions.
The company's radar detectors' and surveillance systems have been reportedly installed in West Bank settlements. Both of these systems had a price tag of more than $90 million.
The department responsible for installing these systems was sold in April 2009 to an Israeli company, Aeronautics Defense Systems, after Motorola had come under fire from several groups in the U.S. over its activities in Israel. 
Motorola spokesman Rusty Brashear said the sale of the unit was not triggered by the protests, but because "it primarily doesn't fit in our portfolio."
The groups the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, the Palestinian National Committee and other organizations worldwide also support a boycott of the phone company.
Motorola was previously boycotted due to its support for the apartheid regime in South Africa. The company supplied South African police with mobile radio transmitters used to suppress demonstrations against the government.

<title>Obama leaves settlers with stark choice - apartheid or a bi-national state</title>
<date>Tue Jun 09 02:30:46 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
American pressure is penetrating the hearts of mainstream settlers. People like Uri Elitzur - who saw from a government office what many settlers do not see from the West Bank - understand that Barack Obama has changed the rules of the game between the United States and Israel, and that despite the right's victory in the elections, the Palestinians are not planning to go anywhere. What this means is that after 42 years of occupation, the time has come for the settlers to choose between Jewish land and a Jewish state. 
A hint of this could be found in remarks made by Elitzur last Friday, the day following Obama's Cairo speech. Elitzur, who headed Benjamin Netanyahu's bureau during the latter's first term as prime minister, was once one of the leaders of the Gush Emunim settlement movement; today, he is deputy editor of the newspaper Makor Rishon. On Friday, he debated Gadi Baltiansky, director general of the Geneva Initiative, at a seminar for parliamentary assistants organized by the Geneva Initiative at Ma'aleh Hahamisha, outside Jerusalem. 
Elitzur rejected Obama's notion of a two-state solution, saying a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders would be a hotbed of terror. However, the status quo - which, he said, means an apartheid state - is also unacceptable to him. So what does that leave? A binational state. 
Elitzur proclaimed that the Land of Israel is more important than the State of Israel, and a Jew's right to live any place in his land is more important to him than the desire for sovereignty. In order to make this concept more concrete, he compared the Land of Israel to his wife and the state to a cleaning woman. "I married my wife, not the cleaning woman," he said. 
Elitzur is not the only veteran settler who would choose the Greater Land of Israel even at the price of the state losing its Jewish majority. Former MK Hanan Porat and other settler leaders have recently prophesied in a similar vein. If you like, this is nothing but a post-modern version of post-Zionism. 
Multiple obstacles 
Natural increase appears to be unique to Jewish settlers. Otherwise, how can we explain the Israeli occupation authorities' refusal to expand the living space of Palestinians? Most Palestinians are crowded into what the Oslo Accords termed Areas A and B; they are not permitted to build in Area C, which constitutes about 60 percent of the West Bank. And as if that were not enough, the expansion of the settlements and the illegal outposts comes at the expense of our Palestinian neighbors' freedom of movement. 
A new report by the United Nations' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, covering September 2008 through the end of March 2009, states that the settlements are the most important factor in determining movement restrictions in the West Bank. The report demonstrates a high correlation between the location of impediments to movement, including the separation fence, and the location of settlements and settlers' roads. Paving alternative roads requires expropriating lands, and in this way, the area available to Palestinians for development is reduced. 
OCHA field workers mapped and documented 634 physical barriers, 93 of which were manned. And contrary to Defense Minister Ehud Barak's claim that the Israel Defense Forces recently evacuated several outposts, the workers reported that activity to expand settlements had actually intensified along the western side of the fence. 
In addition, the report noted, stepped-up violence by settlers has reduced Palestinian farmers' ability to work their lands near certain settlements. And in parts of the Jordan Valley and the eastern slopes of the Bethlehem and Hebron districts, Palestinian farmers and shepherds have seen their access to their lands restricted even further over the past few months, because these areas have been declared closed military zones or nature preserves. Some 28 percent of the West Bank is defined as either a closed military zone or a nature reserve. 
An old-school lawyer
Although he is quite a young man, Yosef Havilio, the Jerusalem municipality's legal advisor, belongs to the old school of lawyers for whom honesty and justice were paramount, no matter what. He, too, has presumably noticed that leaders of right-wing organizations are constantly in and out of the office of Mayor Nir Barkat, their new partner in the vision of Judaizing the Old City and its surroundings. But this did not prevent him from issuing a professional opinion, in response to an inquiry from Meretz city councilman Pepe Alalo, that sealed the fate of the Elad organization's plans for new construction in the City of David. 
At last week's meeting of the local planning and building committee, Havilio's representative, attorney Shirin Barghouti-Milham, told the committee it had no authority to approve the plan over the legal adviser's objections. Before voting with the majority in favor of the plan, Likud councilman Elisha Peleg vented his anger at Barghouti-Milham. 
But Havilio was not deterred by this outburst. In an unusual step, he told the city engineer, Shlomo Eshkol, that the committee's decision was illegal and forbade him to issue a building permit. He also sent a letter to Barkat stating that Peleg may have committed a criminal offense - either insulting a civil servant and/or inciting to racism - when he shouted at Barghouti-Milham: "Get out of here ... You're a low-level clerk, you systematically object to building in the eastern part of the city ... You want to help the Palestinians all the time." 
A municipal spokesman said Barkat has demanded that Peleg apologize to the attorney and will decide on further steps depending on how Peleg responds. Peleg wrote back to the mayor saying he never referred in any way to Barghouti-Milham's origins, and his words were distorted by Havilio, who was not present at the time. He also denied that the mayor asked him to apologize and said he has no intention of doing so. Six city councilmen have complained to Barkat about Havilio's letter.

<title>Obama officials meet U.S. Jews to explain their Durban II policy</title>
<date>Tue Feb 17 14:52:51 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Officials from the Obama administration met with U.S. Jewish leaders on Monday to explain why the government has decided to participate in planning the controversial World Conference Against Racism, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported.
Jerusalem fears that the "Durban II" summit, set to be held in Geneva this April, will be used by Arab nations and others as a forum to criticize Israel as was its predecessor in 2001.
The closed-door talks were led by the White House and the State Department, according to the JTA, and the content of the meeting was off-the-record.
The meeting was held after the State Department sent a high-level team to an informal preparatory session in Geneva this week, but declared that a "change in direction" was required before it could commit to full participation in the April meeting.
"If you are not engaged, you don't have a voice," State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said on Tuesday.
"We wanted to put forward our view and see if there is some way we can make the document a better document than it appears it is going to be," he said. "That does not mean, however, that we will take part in future meetings or indeed in the conference itself."
Delegates to the talks on Monday told the JTA they were organized to give the Jewish leaders a chance to voice their concerns and for the Obama administration to explain its policy about the controversial event.
The decision to attend the planning sessions sparked some criticism from Jewish groups but drew praise from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who urged all member states "to engage constructively on all the outstanding issues" at the conference.
Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said the Durban process was biased against Israel.
"While we understand the pressure on the U.S. to go to Geneva, we urge America not to participate in a fatally flawed UN racism conference that demonizes Israel by singling it out for condemnation," he said. 
U.S. human rights organizations have been urging the Obama administration to engage in the conference in order to tackle the issues that will be discussed during the meeting.
Human Rights First, the leading human rights organization in the U.S., on Tuesday issued a statement welcoming Obama's intention of participating in the summit.
"We urge the administration to work to ensure that the conference advances rather than undermines the protection of fundamental rights, and to engage with others to press for that outcome," the statement reads.  
"This session provides an opportunity for the United States to lead efforts to address problems with language proposed for the current draft of the outcome document," said the statement. "The United States should also encourage states to review the implementation of their international commitments to combat racism. Although this is the stated purpose of the conference, states have put in very little effort so far to engage in any meaningful review."
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni on Monday appealed to the U.S. not to participate in the UN-sponsored conference. Speaking before a delegation of visiting American Jewish leaders, Livni said that "Israel expects the free world not to participate in Durban II."  
Israel and Canada have announced they are boycotting the April 20-24 conference in Geneva, a follow-up to an acrimonious meeting in 2001. Canada said the conference was likely to descend into anti-Semitism while Israel said it would be an "anti-Israel tribunal".
European Union (EU) countries including Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands are under pressure from Jewish lobbies to follow suit. But they have stayed engaged while struggling to tone down a final UN text to be issued by the conference, diplomats say.
The 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in Durban was meant to lay down a blueprint for nations to address sensitive issues.
Israel and the United States walked out in protest over a draft text branding Israel as a racist and apartheid state, language that was later dropped.

<title>Obama's Cairo speech signals end of the 9/11 era</title>
<date>Fri Jun 05 02:16:30 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
If Barack Obama fulfills even some of the promises he made during his important address in Cairo Thursday, June 4, 2009 will be remembered in world history as the last day of the 9/11 era. Instead of a clash of civilizations, we will have a dialogue of cultures. Instead of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict being pushed to the sidelines of the struggle against Islamic terrorism, we will get a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders, with agreed territorial adjustments, and normalized relations between Israel and the Arab states. Instead of a balance of nuclear terror between Iran and Israel, both of them will be signatories in good standing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  
Obama's speech was not a collection of empty rhetoric. Before the entire world, he put his signature to a bunch of checks that have deadlines for being cashed. In his talks with his aides in recent weeks, a consensus has emerged that November 2010 - the date of the next congressional elections - should be the target date for realizing the two-state solution. By then, we will know how much of an impression Obama's speech made on Iran's president. Who knows: Perhaps Iranian voters will be convinced that they have before them a U.S. president who is genuinely interested in reconciliation with Islam, and will use their upcoming election to replace their current president with a more conciliatory one. By then, we will also know whom Benjamin Netanyahu is more afraid of - the U.S. president or the chairman of the Yesha Council of settlements, Benny Begin or Tzipi Livni.  
Alongside many questions, the address provided many exclamation marks. Thursday, the era of formal imbalance in the trilateral relationship between the U.S., Israel and the Arab world gave way to an equilateral triangle. Obama left Egypt with two tablets of the commandments - one for Jews and the other for Muslims. He left no room for doubt: An Israel that continues to discriminate against Palestinians and prevent them from exercising their rights to self-determination and freedom of movement cannot expect affirmative action from the U.S. It is hard to believe that Obama simply forgot to mention the words "Jewish state." The president believes that the nature of the State of Israel is something only the State of Israel can decide.  
Obama placed violence against Israel on a par with the settlements and the humiliation of Palestinians in the territories. He spoke in the same breath about the struggle of Palestinians who lost their homes more than 60 years ago and the struggle of African slaves in the U.S. The Israelis could see themselves in the sentence that mentioned the apartheid state of South Africa.  
Having granted Israel several weeks to formulate its policy, Obama could not present a detailed program for realizing the two-state solution. However, the two documents that he did mention - the road map and the Arab Peace Initiative - suggest a framework from which there can be no deviation: No more formulas like Resolution 242, whose interpretations vary, or loopholes for continuing the settlement building. Nor is it an accident that he failed to mention "natural growth": He was hinting that if Israel adopts a two-state solution, most of the settlements will become history anyway.  
Obama gave Israel the following choices Thursday: Either the conservative Israeli government will adjust itself to the American people's choice in electing a liberal president, or the speech will be the lightning that precedes the thunder.

<title>Palestinian activists plan massive graffiti protest on West Bank fence</title>
<date>Thu Apr 16 01:19:05 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
The separation barrier will receive its largest piece of graffiti yet when Dutch and Palestinian activists scrawl on it a 2,000-word letter by a South African scholar arguing that "Israeli apartheid" is "far more brutal" than Pretoria's was.  
The letter by Farid Esack will be put on the eastern face of the wall this week by activists belonging to Sendamessage - a Dutch group that collects money over the Internet for painting messages to protest against the barrier Israel is building along the West Bank.  
According to Israel, the barrier is designed to keep Palestinian suicide bombers out, but Palestinians say it juts into their land. The letter, to be sprayed in a single line against a white-paint background, is expected to take up over 2,500 meters of concrete beginning near Ramallah.  
"Have our Jewish sisters and brothers forgotten their humiliation?" Esack writes to Palestinian readers. "In your land, we are seeing something far more brutal, relentless and inhuman than what we have ever seen under apartheid."  
In another segment, he writes: "The apartheid police never used kids as shields ... nor did the apartheid army ever use gunships and bombs against largely civilian targets."  
Esack is a Muslim writer and political activist appointed by Nelson Mandela to preside as gender equity commissioner. His text, which deplores Israel's "targeted killings of those who dare to resist," does not mention Hamas' anti-Semitic ideology, the Palestinians' firing of rockets on Israeli civilians or suicide bombings.  
"We chose this letter because it holds no provocation, but is a balanced and academic text, not cheap propaganda," the Dutch site's operator and concept designer, Justus van Oel, told Haaretz.  
"We do not contest that the wall is protecting Israelis from attacks. But it's a short-term solution. Apartheid can never be a long-term solution," said van Oel, who works in part as a communications consultant.  
He added that the cost of the letter project is estimated at 12,500 euros and that advertisers and private individuals sponsor 1.5-meter segments. The sponsors' signatures will be sprayed at the bottom of Esack's text.  
The spraying, which begins Thursday, will be the work of Sendamessage's three Palestinian partners, led by Faris Arouri. "We think that we can get it done within eight full days," van Oel said. "It's impossible, but it's no reason not to do it." A documentary on the project will be filmed by Federico Campanale and Iona Hoogendoorn.  
The open letter will be sprayed along with Sendamessage's other works, in which the spraying team puts up messages they receive from clients through the Internet for 30 euros. Since the group came into being in December 2007, it has put some 850 messages on the wall for around $33,500, according to van Oel.  
Part of the money Sendamessage receives stays in Holland "to cover the minimal costs," van Oel says, with the bulk of the profits going to Palestinian non-governmental charities. "All recipients are linked to the network of ICCO, a large Dutch-Christian nonprofit, which only accepts legal organizations," he said.  
Asked whether the money could go to educational projects that could be seen as hateful to Israelis and Jews, van Oel said: "I don't have an intelligence service there. It's about trust, and I do trust the people involved in this project."

<title>Palestinian anger with Barenboim prompts him to cancel Ramallah visit </title>
<date>Thu Jan 01 00:03:43 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Unlike the cancellation of Leonard Cohen's concert in Ramallah, which got a lot of press, the cancellation of conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim's visit to the West Bank city has been kept almost secret. 
Both cancellations were spurred by different Palestinian groups which warned against what they described as the normalization with the occupation and with Israel.
Barenboim, who has performed in Ramallah several times in violation of military orders banning Israelis from entering, was not going to give a concert this time. He was going to Ramallah to attend an opera in Arabic, written to the music of the Basque composer Juan Crisostomo de Arriaga who died at age 20 in 1826.
The performers, most of them children, are members of the Children & Youth Choir of the Barenboim-Said Foundation, the Choir of the Arab Evangelical School in Ramallah and the Youth Orchestra of the Barenboim-Said Foundation and Al Kamandjati.
Barenboim started the foundation along with his friend, the Palestinian theorist Edward Said, in 2003, not long before the latter's death. The foundation, which saw the creation of the music schools in Ramallah and Nazareth among other projects, declares as its main objective the "integrat[ion] of music into the fabric of society, from which it distanced itself throughout the course of the 20th century as a result of a general trend of specialization."
Last March, as soon as word got out that the school intended to perform the opera in Ramallah's cultural Palace, opposing voices surfaced demanding the city refuse to rent out the space. The Barenboim-Said Foundation learned by mid-June that the city council had decided against leasing the hall, with a vote of 6 to 5.
With time, however, it became apparent that the various political forces influencing the municipal arena did not see eye to eye. The parents of the children, who spent months rehearsing, were also opposed to the city's ruling. 
Pressure was also exerted from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' office, which requested that the city reverse the decision. On July 4, 10 days before the scheduled premiere, the municipality agreed to allow the performance to take place in its hall.
Although the city had made it clear that Barenboim would be welcome to attend, he ultimately decided not to come, citing his busy schedule as the reason for his own cancellation. His associates in Ramallah were concerned that protests outside or inside the hall would dampen the children's happy event.  
The bulk of dissent across Ramallah was not just over the performance, but over the very existence of the Barenboim-Said Foundation.   
A leading activist in the Palestinian movement for a cultural boycott of Israel told Haaretz that the foundation's publications make it clear that it "does not take any position against the Israeli occupation or apartheid policies. They talk about promoting mutual understanding and coexistence through dialogue, music, etc. This is an attempt to give a normal image to a very abnormal, colonial situation."
But a great share of the criticism, especially heard in the streets of Ramallah and in e-mail circulation, was directed at Barenboim himself. The criticism focused on three articles he has published over some years, particularly in his latest piece published by the British Guardian during the height of Operation Cast Lead. His critics accused him of referring to Israel's offensive in Gaza as an act of "self defense."
Opposition to Barenboim and his foundation is nothing new, but the status of the Israel boycott movement has strengthened since the offensive against Gaza.  Yet, as the activist said, the opposition to the Foundation's activity is not a top priority. 
Mariam Said, the late theorist's widow who has took her husband's place in directing of the foundation , told Haaretz on Thursday that Edward had always insisted that "this project has nothing to do with politics, governments, any of the current solutions or entities. It is a purely individual endeavor to break barriers."
Said said she is proud of the foundation's contribution to the musical and cultural education of Palestinian children, and has enormous appreciation of Barenboim's contribution to that process, as well. During the premiere of the opera, Said read a letter Barenboim had written to the audience and to the performers.

<title>Pro-Israel group: Carter's apology to Jews a 'publicity stunt'</title>
<date>Thu Dec 24 22:47:50 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The holiday season brought U.S. Jews a surprising gesture from former president Jimmy Carter recently, when he issued a letter of apology for "stigmatizing Israel"
The letter, published by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, raised many eyebrows in the Jewish community, with many wondering how sincere the apology really was, and others demanding that Carter prove his sincerity with actions to minimize the damage he had already incurred. 
The pro-Israel group Shalom International on Thursday called Carter's apology a publicity stunt. The group's Bob Kunst said that Carter has sought to build a global movement against Israel. He said Carter's apologies were questionable and fall on deaf ears.
Kunst's Miami-based advocacy group fights anti-Semitism through protests and rallies.
Other Jewish groups, including the Anti-Defamation League, welcomed Carter's apology. Carter offered an Al Het, a Hebrew plea for forgiveness, to the Jewish community this week for any words or deeds that may have stigmatized Israel.
One theory made the connection between Carter's apology and his grandson's bid for the Georgia Senate seat. The uneasy relationship between Carter and American Jews could make it harder for 34-year-old Jason Carter to win the election in a district rife with Jews. The outgoing Georgia senator, whose seat Jason is vying for, is Jewish. 
The younger Carter tried to dispel the allegations, saying that though he welcomes moves toward reconciliation, his grandfather's letter has nothing to do with his campaign. 
The crisis between Carter and the Jewish community came to a head three years ago with the publication of his book Palestine: Peace, not apartheid. After the book was published, 14 Jews resigned from the Carter Center. 
His recent visit to Gaza and his meetings with Hamas leaders coupled with his apathetic tone during a meeting with the father of captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, all have made Carter unwelcome in synagogues. 
In his letter, the former president offered Jews an "Al Het" for all his remarks, or actions, that may have contributed to this split.

<title>Reggae star Alpha Blondy in Israel to meet 'big brother Jesus'</title>
<date>Sun Dec 06 22:48:50 IST 2009</date>
<content>
"Bonjour maman" were the first words that Ivorian reggae star Alpha Blondy said Sunday when he arrived in Israel and entered the VIP reception room at Ben-Gurion Airport.
Blondy, a social activist from Cote D'Ivoire who rose to fame as one of reggae's best known performers when he came out against apartheid, was addressing Israeli ex-ambassador Dr. Tamar Golan, who came to the airport to greet him.
After hugging his host and longtime friend, Golan, who let out a few yelps of maternal joy upon seeing him, Blondy introduced his wife, Ran Young Hong Kone to her and to his country's ambassador to Israel, Prof. Koudou Kessie Raymond, who came to the airport at 3 A.M. with the embassy's entire staff.
For Alpha Blondy, who will perform on Wednesday at the inauguration ceremony of a Ben Gurion University's Africa Centre headed by Golan, this is his "fifth or fourth" visit in Israel. But it's a first for his wife.
"We have to go to Jerusalem to say hello to my big brother Jesus," he told her in his booming voice. "I've been here a few times before, you see, so I know where we can find him."
In his performance at the two-day inauguration event at BGU, Blondy plans to sing the eulogy he wrote for slain former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, as well another hit number entitled "Jerusalem."
"I wrote 'Jerusalem' in 1985 on my first visit, after thinking about Jesus," reminisced Blondy, who was born to a Muslim mother and a Christian father. "When I arrived at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, I thought that if I tell people back home that I saw the grave of Jesus, they will tell me: 'Alpha, you better stop smoking ganja.'"
A vocal critic of social injustice and war crimes during the Ivorian Civil War, back home Blondy is seen not only as a singer, but as a social activist, according to some of the 10 diplomats present. 
A few weeks ago Blondy announced his support for Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo, who declared last week he will run for office early next year in the recovering country's first election since 2000. The country remains divided following a civil war which erupted following a botched coup d'etat against Gbagbo's regime in 2002.
"I support Gbagbo because I support peacemakers and not warmongers," said Blondy, in an apparent reference to Gbagbo's elections rival and prime minister, Guillaume Soro, head of the former rebel New Forces.

<title>Rightist MKs scuffle with Arab families in East Jerusalem</title>
<date>Sun Aug 09 21:25:39 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Scuffles broke out Sunday between two rightist MKs and members of a Palestinian family in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, while the MKs toured the contested area.
At one point, stones were thrown at Yaakov Katz and Uri Ariel, both from the National Union party, and the MKs' bodyguards traded blows with protestors.
While the MKs were touring the neighborhood, a member of the Gawi family yelled at them "you learned the Apartheid laws from South Africa. East Jerusalem will be free, this is our land. We didn't expel you, why are you expelling us?"
The Gawi family is one of two Palestinian families in the neighborhood who were evacuated from their homes last week.
MK Katz said "all of this area belonged to Jews between 70 to 80 years ago and we are returning to it."
When asked if the same principle would apply to houses belonging to Arab families that were deserted during the 1948 Israeli War of Independence, Katz replied "on the contrary, let an Arab come forward and make a claim on a house that he thinks belongs to him and his family inside the state of Israel. This claim will be handled by the court."
Right-wing activist Aryeh King, who escorted the MKs through the neighborhood, pointed out a number of houses that had been acquired by the Nahalat Shimon organization or that were subject to documents saying they belonged to Jews. King vowed that in another year, the number of Jewish families in the area will increase from 28 to 40. 
On Monday night, left-wing activists from Israel and abroad will hold a demonstration in the neighborhood to show solidarity with the evacuated families.

<title>S. African minister accused of 'hate speech' </title>
<date>Thu Jan 29 01:47:11 IST 2009</date>
<content>
South Africa's Jewish community yesterday lodged a complaint of "hate speech"  against the country's deputy foreign minister, who earlier this month said that "Jewish money controls America and most Western countries."  
Stressing that the South African Jewish Board of Deputies "usually prefers dialogue," the board's national director, Wendy Kahn, told Haaretz: "Deputy Minister Fatima Hajaig has crossed all limits."  
Kahn, who is in Israel to attend the World Jewish Congress in Jerusalem, called Hajaig's comments "a demonstration of anti-Semitism of the oldest and most classic kind."  
The board filed the complaint against Hajaig to the country's Human Rights Commission - a national institution with some investigative and executive powers, which derives its powers from the post-apartheid constitution.  
In the complaint, the board quotes what Hajaig said at a pro-Palestinian rally in Lenasia on January 14. "They, in fact, control [America], no matter which government comes in to power, whether Republican or Democratic, whether Barack Obama or George Bush," Hajaig was heard saying.  
She also allegedly said: "The control of America, just like the control of most Western countries, is in the hands of Jewish money and if Jewish money controls their country then you cannot expect anything else."  
The minister, who is out of South Africa, has so far not commented on the complaint, nor has the government clarified its position on the controversial comments. However, Kahn noted the administration has been "overall more evenhanded toward Israel during the Gaza operation than during the 2006 Lebanon War." Hajaig's comments, Kahn said, were the exception.  
In the board's announcement about the complaint, chairman Zev Krengel said that although the decision "had not been taken lightly," it was necessary because "not since the era of pro-Nazi Nationalist MPs more than half a century ago had such statements been made against Jews by a senior government official."  
The Democratic Alliance of the opposition has called for Hajaig to be sacked if she does not offer an immediate public apology. Party spokeswoman Lindiwe Mazibuko said: "It is incumbent upon Hajaig to immediately apologize to the people of South Africa in general, the Jewish community in particular, and to U.S. President Barack Obama."  
The Israeli Foreign Ministry also recently complained to the South African government about Hajaig, after she used harsh and "undiplomatic" language in speaking with Israel's ambassador to South Africa, Dov Segev-Steinberg, during the Gaza operation.  
According to various sources, Hajaig accused the ambassador of bringing a diplomat of Ethiopian descent to the embassy "only because he was black," presumably to counter the often-heard accusation in South Africa that Israel is an apartheid state.

<title>Senior UN official skips Holocaust memorial amid accusations of anti-Israel bias, threats from U.S. Jews  </title>
<date>Wed Jan 28 02:03:05 IST 2009</date>
<content>
NEW YORK - UN General Assembly President Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann skipped the world body's ceremony marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day yesterday, after American Jewish leaders threatened to demonstratively exit the event if he used the podium to attack Israel.  
D'Escoto, who has repeatedly made strongly anti-Israel statements, was to be the event's host, by virtue of his official position, and he was scheduled give the opening speech.  
Last year, d'Escoto (who began his one-year term as president last September) likened Israel's actions in the West Bank and Gaza to "the apartheid of an earlier era," and tried to ban Israel's envoy to the UN from speaking at a ceremony to mark 60 years since the institution's adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  
Gabriela Shalev, Israel's ambassador to the UN, had also threatened to quit yesterday's ceremony should d'Escoto lash out at Israel.  
Several American Jewish groups, including the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, had earlier sought to have d'Escoto excluded from the ceremony, but to no avail.  
In her speech to the assembly, Shalev said the world has the "responsibility not to remain silent" to the genocide perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.   
"To remain silent and indifferent to the horrors of the Holocaust is probably the greatest sin of all, let alone denying it," she said.   
"We have a responsibilty to act against the forces of anti-Semitism, bigotry and racism in any form."  
Some 1,600 guests were expected to attend the event, ranging from Holocaust survivors to UN ambassadors.

<title>South Africa: Israel actions in East Jerusalem akin to apartheid</title>
<date>Thu Nov 26 02:37:11 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The South African government has issued an unusually harsh statement condemning Israel for approving 900 new housing units in Gilo and evicting Palestinians from their East Jerusalem homes, comparing Israel's actions to the "forced removals" of the apartheid era.  
"We condemn the fact that Israeli settlement expansion in East Jerusalem is coupled with Israel's campaign to evict and displace the original Palestinian residents from the City," the statement said. "South Africa is deeply concerned that these activities by Israel will only serve only to deepen the cycle of violence in the region."  
Israeli officials and Jewish leaders in South Africa condemned the statement.  
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said: "We deeply regret this unexplainable statement, which ignores key facts while presenting as realities nonexistent matters. It is highly misleading not to take cognizance of Israel's repeated calls to renew peace talks unconditionally and without deferral. It is simply unjust to call the neighborhood of Gilo a 'settlement,' or to conjure a phantasmagorical 'campaign to evict Palestinians.'"  
"One cannot equate building new homes for Israelis... in Gilo with the forced removals that occurred under apartheid," said David Saks, the associate director of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies. "In the latter case, many thousands of non-whites were forcibly evicted from their homes to make way for white settlement; in Gilo, by contrast, no one is being forcibly removed to make way for new developments."  
Israel says the two Palestinian families evicted from homes in East Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood over the summer were living in buildings that have been owned by Jews since before Israel's founding, and that a court ordered the evictions because the families had violated the terms of their leases.  
Another leader of the South African Jewish community said that while individual government officials have occasionally invoked the apartheid comparison, it's unusual for the government itself to do so.  
A spokeswoman for the South African Zionist Federation, Bev Goldman, said the group "questions again why Israel is always judged to a standard different from that of the rest of the world." She said the statement would "do little more than create and heighten tensions within the local Jewish community and with South Africa's radical pro-Palestinian elements."

<title>South Africa Jews welcome minister's apology over 'Jews control America' jibe</title>
<date>Thu Feb 05 10:59:12 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The South Africa Jewish Board of Deputies (SAJBD) on Thursday issued a statement thanking South African President Motlanthe for ensuring an apology from Deputy Foreign Minister Fatima Hajaig, who said last month that "Jewish money controls America."
The South African cabinet termed Hajaig's comments, which came at a pro-Palestinian rally on January 14th in Lenasia, "anti-Semitic".
Last week the SAJBD filed a complaint of "hate speech" against Haijaig with the Human Rights Commission - a government body with some judicial and executive powers.
The SAJBD had rejected an earlier statement issued by Hajaig, saying that she "very clearly avoided addressing, let alone repudiating, the blatantly anti-Semitic sentiments originally expressed by her." 
The SAJBD praised the government for their "firm commitment to combating all forms of racism and prejudice in our society, including Anti-Semitism."
In the beginning of the earlier radio apology, Hajaig deplored "the attempts of Zionists to justify policies that have worsened the crisis in the Middle East" and "unmitigated state violence directed against unarmed civilians." She reserved the same criticism for "indiscriminate attacks against Israeli unarmed civilians." 
After delivering 300-odd words about her regional vision, Hajaig arrived at the controversial statement and said: "I conflated Zionist pressure with Jewish influence. I regret the inference made by some that I am anti-Jewish." 
She added: "To the extent that my statement may have caused hurt and pain, I offer an unequivocal apology for the pain it may have caused to the people of our country and the Jewish community in particular." 
Just hours before Hajaig's apology to the president, South Africa's largest trade union federation announced its members intend to refuse to service a ship scheduled to come in from Israel to Durban Port on Sunday. The union called this a "historic development." 
The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) - which has approximately 1.8 million members - added that following Israel's military campaign in Gaza last month, it is resolved to "strengthen the campaign in South Africa for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Apartheid Israel."

<title>South African deputy minister apologizes for 'anti-Semitic' slur </title>
<date>Thu Feb 05 01:17:06 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Following increasing pressure from South Africa's Jewish community, the country's deputy foreign minister yesterday apologized to the republic's president for saying last month that "Jewish money controls America." Meanwhile, the South African dock workers union said its workers would refuse servicing an Israeli ship.  
"Deputy Minister [Fatima Hajaig] expressed her deep regret to President [Kgalema Motlanthe]," the government said. "She accepted that the comments were contrary to stated government policy. She subsequently apologized unreservedly and unequivocally for the comments and agreed to withdraw them unconditionally."  
The cabinet also termed Hajaig's comment, which she made on January 14 at a pro-Palestinian rally in Lenasia, "anti-Semitic."  
Just hours before Hajaig's apology to the president, South Africa's largest trade union federation announced its members intend to refuse to service a ship scheduled to come in from Israel to Durban Port on Sunday. The union called this a "historic development." The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) - which has approximately 1.8 million members - added that following Israel's military campaign in Gaza last month, it resolved to "strengthen the campaign in South Africa for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Apartheid Israel." Last week, the South African Jewish Board of Deputies filed a complaint of "hate speech" against Hajaig with the Human Rights Commission - a government body with judicial and executive powers.  
"We are quite happy with this apology," the Board's national chairman, Zev Krengel, told Haaretz. "Without a doubt, it's the result of pressure that we've applied." Krengel added the Board has not yet decided on whether to withdraw the complaint against Hajaig. But the cabinet said that the president has accepted her apology "and trusts that the matter has been concluded satisfactorily."  
On Tuesday, Hajaig offered an earlier apology over the radio, which the Board rejected, saying it only "served to compound the original insult." In the beginning of the earlier radio apology, Hajaig deplored "the attempts of Zionists to justify policies that have worsened the crisis in the Middle East" and "unmitigated state violence directed against unarmed civilians." She reserved the same criticism for "indiscriminate attacks against Israeli unarmed civilians."

<title>South African Jews mixed on Zuma rise and election victory </title>
<date>Fri Apr 24 01:40:13 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
While leaders of South Africa's Jewish community expressed cautious optimism regarding Jacob's Zuma's rise to power on Thursday, other community voices described his presidency as a "depressing defeat" for democracy.  
The African National Congress on Thursday evening had a 64.73 share of the votes, making the party's controversial yet charismatic candidate the republic's next president. Zuma won the elections after overcoming a rape charge and numerous corruption charges.  
"No one can make predictions," South Africa's chief Orthodox rabbi, Warren Goldstein, told Haaretz. "But there are encouraging signs: The financial crisis hasn't hit the country so badly and Jewish emigration is down compared to last year."  
While remaining equally noncommittal, Ze'ev Krengel, chairman of the South African Board of Governors, mentioned that thanks to the "contacts between Goldstein and Zuma," the Jewish community could enjoy improved accessibility to the presidency.  
At Goldstein's request, earlier this year Zuma spoke before the community, and even presented the Jewish leadership with a document affirming the party's support for a two-state solution in the Middle East.  
But Steve Magid, the publisher of the popular Jewish affairs blog "It's Almost Supernatural," says Zuma's presidency could help one of the country's most anti-Israel bodies: South Africa's largest trade union COSATU, where Zuma is reported to have a "strong base of support."  
"Zuma's style is to tell everyone what they want to hear," said Magid, who called on readers to "try and stop the ANC," on his blog, which he runs with Michael Kransdorff. They both say they believe Zuma overcame his corruption charges by illegitimate means that relied on the ANC's power.  
"I was depressed to see Zuma might pass two-thirds of the vote. It's a defeat for democracy," Magid said.  
Goldstein argues COSATU's rank and file "are not interested" in Israel, and that the Israel boycotts promoted by COSATU are orchestrated by a "few people with limited influence, regardless of who's in power."  
The fact that the transition of power occurred smoothly attests to the resilience of democracy in the country, he said.  
Another concern by some pro-Israelis in South Africa is that Zuma may appoint Blade Nzimande from the Communist Party, known for making hostile statements about Israel, as foreign minister.  
"We will have to wait and see," said Krengel. "We'll know more about where Zuma's heading when we see his cabinet. Until then, he's done no wrong and he's done no right."  
South Africa's Ambassador to Israel, Ismail Coovadia, told Haaretz his country and Israel would continue to enjoy "excellent relations."  
"The whole world is witnessing the fact that South Africa has come a long way in fulfilling the vision to safeguarding the democratic principles for which we struggled so hard over so many decades: a non-racist, non-sexist, democratic society where people of all colors. Like any true democracy, national interests will take priority," he said. "All South Africans, irrespective of their party or political persuasions, treasure the constitution as the highest, collective, home-grown achievement of the struggle against the abominations of apartheid. As for its relations with Israel, South Africa will continue to build on the excellent relations we enjoy on many fronts: trade, person-to-person contact, increased diplomatic representivity and a continuing commitment to contribute to share our rich experience in the processes to end the conflict between the African National Congress and the apartheid regime."

<title>The cowardice, the vanity, the sin of boycotting Israel</title>

Click here for more articles by Bradley Burston
Live in this tainted Holy Land long enough, and you come to learn that there are two kinds of political activists, much as there are two kinds of artists. 
The first kind, the kind who changes the world, points to something that has yet to have been seen, something that seriously needs to be seen, and cries out, "Look at this."
The second kind, the kind who changes nothing, barks in a voice every bit as insistent, "Look at me."
I was privileged this weekend to attend a marriage of art and activism of the first sort, the new film "Ajami." Jointly directed by an Israeli-born Palestinian and a Jewish Israeli, spoken mostly in an Arabic salted with Hebrew, Ajami is an overwhelming work, clenched, compassionate, violent, perplexing, complex beyond facile comprehension. It is a creature of this place. It rings true.
Given the depth and breadth of its lens, and the fact that the directors worked for seven years to fit their story into two hours, it is all the more galling that earlier this month, political activists very much of the second sort, bluntly caught Ajami in the collateral damage of a scattershot anti-Israel campaign.
Ajami was among a number of dark and critical Israeli films, among them "Lebanon" and "Jaffa," which were effectively sniffed at and dismissed by the strident, star power-chasing protest at the Toronto International Film Festival, a protest so shallow and so misplayed, that it has had the effect of doing the occupation a distinct favor.
There is something in Ajami's nuance that helps explain why the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel, of which the Toronto protest was an ingenuously unacknowledged bastard cousin, has proven a wholesale failure. 
What Ajami shows, in continually surprising revelations, is the essential core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: people on both sides trying to protect their loved ones and keep them alive, often with heartbreaking consequences.
This is what the BDS movement and the Toronto group cannot begin to accept. This is why they continue to alienate peace activists
The Toronto Declaration
Jane Fonda, a headliner of the celebrities who signed the Toronto group's declaration, came to recant her support
She added that "it can become counterproductive to inflame rather than explain and this means to hear the narratives of both sides, to articulate the suffering on both sides, not just the Palestinians. By neglecting to do this the letter allowed good people to close their ears and their hearts." 
The Toronto group was unmoved by Fonda's words. They had achieved their goal, that of turning the spotlight away from Israel and, if only briefly, toward the real martyrs for Palestine - themselves. The web flowed with praise - and even petitions - hailing the courage of the "true heroes" of the Toronto Declaration.
The progression was shocking to watch. The vanity of the movement is matched only by its cluelessness.  On the Declaration's blog site, one of the links following the text of the open letter and its framer's protestations that they were not calling for a boycott, was a statement by the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel: "We encourage filmmakers and audiences to boycott the Spotlight as it extends a gesture of 'goodwill' to a colonial and apartheid regime which is violating Palestinian human rights with utter impunity."   
One of the founding members of PCABI is Omar Barghouti, who, while arguing for a crippling academic boycott against Israel, is currently studying for his master's degree at Tel Aviv University. Asked by the Forward about his affiliation with an institution he wants boycotted, "Barghouti said he would not discuss his personal life."
Citing Barhjouti's refusal to walk the walk, the left-leaning weekly did not mince words in denouncing the BDS movement in an editorial this week. The movement's adherents, it said, "seem uninterested in performing any personal sacrifice, or even measuring their 'success' by hard numbers. They are most intent on sullying Israel's name and bullying anyone who might suggest another path toward peace in the troubled region."
There was something altogether fitting about going to see Ajami on the weekend before Yom Kippur, the time of year when Jews are commanded to re-examine themselves in the harshest of light.  Radical in its shifts across borders, language, and time, it forces shaken moviegoers to reconsider their preconceptions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and, no less, about themselves.
The BSD movement and the Toronto Declaration group, might consider doing no less. This has been a particularly self-defeating period for the boycott movement. It has shown itself to be mean of spirit and narrow of vision. 
When singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen sought to dedicate concerts in Ramat Gan, Israel, and the Palestinian city of Ramallah to the cause of reconciliation, donating the proceeds to Israeli-Palestinian groups working against all odds toward that goal, boycott activists, many from the U.K., forced the cancellation of the Ramallah concert. Many Palestinians were horrified, and said so publicly, no less when the boycott proponents succeeded in getting Amnesty International to cancel its plans to play a role in fostering the distribution of the proceeds.
This week we observe the ancient boycott known as Yom Kippur. We ask forgiveness for sins of a hardened heart, of judgmentalism and hatred, of a willful deceit of others and an unknowing deceit of ourselves.  
For the sin of demanding that only others search their souls and repent. And for the sin of finding others guilty and passing sentence, without having the courage to allow the accused to face their accusers.
To the BDS people and their spiritual kin in Toronto, let me say just this: When you criticize Israel, for God's sake - if only for the Palestinians' sake - tell the truth. The whole truth. Not just your carefully composed cardboard cutout, the cartoon of the Jewish villain and the Arab martyr. And not from a distance.
Come here. Do the work. Take the risks. Put your slogans and your posters and your buttons and signs and t-shirts and open letters to the test. Put your life where your sloganeering is. 
You despise Israel, we get that. You dismiss the capacity of Israelis for good faith and humanism. We get that too. But if you talk struggle in Toronto and San Francisco and Irvine, it's no more than talk, and wasted breath at that. You can boycott away, all you like. In the end, you're  only drumming up more business for Israel.
Alternatively, as a first step, you might go see Ajami. If it's hard as hell for you to understand, then you've made a beginning. See it again. 
It's Yom Kippur. It's time to get rattled. Just as in the cartoons, when you run off a cliff, it's only when you look down, that you begin to plummet. 
Look down. We're all falling here. We're all trying to keep our families and friends, our children and our elders, from the cliff. Until you understand that, you understand nothing.
[Late Saturday, after these words were written, Ajami won the Best Picture Award at the Ophir Awards ceremony, Israel's version of the Oscars. It will thus be Israel's entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was the first time a primarily Arabic language film has won the Ophir for Best Picture.]

"We encourage filmmakers and audiences to boycott the Spotlight as it extends a gesture of 'goodwill' to a colonial and apartheid regime which is violating Palestinian human rights with utter impunity.   
One of the founding members of PCABI is Omar Barghouti, who, while arguing for a crippling academic boycott against Israel, is currently studying for his master's degree at Tel Aviv University. Asked by the Forward about his affiliation with an institution he wants boycotted, "Barghouti said he would not discuss his personal life."
Citing Barhjouti's refusal to walk the walk, the left-leaning weekly did not mince words in denouncing the BDS movement in an editorial this week. The movement's adherents, it said, "seem uninterested in performing any personal sacrifice, or even measuring their 'success' by hard numbers. They are most intent on sullying Israel?s name and bullying anyone who might suggest another path toward peace in the troubled region."
There was something altogether fitting about going to see Ajami on the weekend before Yom Kippur, the time of year when Jews are commanded to re-examine themselves in the harshest of light.  Radical in its shifts across borders, language, and time, it forces shaken moviegoers to reconsider their preconceptions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and, no less, about themselves.
The BSD movement and the Toronto Declaration group, might consider doing no less. This has been a particularly self-defeating period for the boycott movement. It has shown itself to be mean of spirit and narrow of vision. When singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen sought to dedicate concerts in Ramat Gan, Israel, and the Palestinian city of Ramallah to the cause of reconciliation, 
This week we observe the ancient boycott known as Yom Kippur. We ask forgiveness for sins of a hardened heart, of judgmentalism and hatred, of a willful deceit of others and an unknowing deceit of ourselves.  
For the sin of demanding that only others search their souls and repent. And for the sin of finding others guilty and passing sentence, without having the courage to allow the accused to face their accusers.
To the BDS people and their spiritual kin in Toronto, let me say just this: When you criticize Israel, for God's sake ? for the Palestinians' sake ? tell the truth. Not just your carefully composed cardboard cutout, the cartoon of the Jewish villain and the Arab martyr. And not from a distance.
Come here. Do the work. Take the risks. Put your slogans and your posters and your buttons and signs and t-shirts and open letters to the test. Put your life where your sloganeering is. 
You despise Israel, we get that. You dismiss the capacity of Israelis for good faith and humanism. We get that too. But if you talk struggle in Toronto and San Francisco and Irvine, it's no more than talk, and wasted breath at that. You can boycott away, all you like. In the end, they only drum up more business for Israel.
Or, as a first step, you might go see Ajami. If it's hard as hell for you to understand, then you've made a beginning. See it again. 
It's Yom Kippur. It's time to get rattled. Just as in the cartoons, when you run off a cliff, it's only when you look down, that you begin to plummet. 
Look down. We're all falling here. We're all trying to keep our families and friends, our children and our elders, from the cliff. Until you understand that, you understand nothing.

The Gaza War 'victory' - Has Israel grown dependent on terror?

<title>The Guardian publishes obituary of Hamas terror chieftain killed by IAF </title>
<date>Mon Jan 05 20:07:57 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The Guardian, eulogizing a Hamas terrorist commander killed by Israel, branded the fierce supporter of suicide bombings who sent his own son on such a mission as "a man of the street" and "something of a hero." 
Nizar Ghayan was killed last Thursday along with his family, and had refused to seek shelter, despite pleas by Hamas leaders who knew his Gaza home was a target for Israeli warjets. 
The obituary lauds Ghayan as "one of Hamas's top five decision-makers," and that he had been viewed by many to be more significant than Hamas prime minister Ismail Haniyeh. It says Ghayan, primarily associated with the Hamas military wing, was "highly regarded as an Islamic academic."
The piece says that Ghayan "strongly advocated" suicide bombings, and states that he sent his son on a suicide mission at the Israeli settlement of Elei Sinai in 2001, where he killed himself and two Israelis.
"We will never recognize Israel," Ghayan is quoted as saying in the paper. "There is nothing called Israel, neither in reality nor in the imagination." 
The final line of the obituary reads: "Nizar Rayan, political leader, born 6 March 1959; died 1 January 2009".
Israel's Ambassador to the Court of St. James, Ron Prosor, said he was not surprised by the tone of the obituary. 
"This is not the first obituary and it seems it won't be the last that The Guardian grants to Hamas terrorists." 
Others recently honored by an obituary in The Guardian include Clash of Civilizations author Samuel Huntington, South African anti-apartheid activist Helen Suzman and British Jewish playwright Harold Pinter.

<title>Top Israeli educator: Israel should probe Gaza war before it's forced to</title>
<date>Wed Sep 30 01:08:06 IST 2009</date>
<content>
If Israel does not investigate its most recent military operation in Gaza, it will be forced to do so by the international community, Prof. Uriel Reichman, president of the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, said yesterday.  
"A commission headed by a Supreme Court justice must immediately be established to examine Operation Cast Lead. And although the [Goldstone] report is very much not fair and borders on incitement, it also raises questions regarding our actions in Gaza," Reichman said.  
Reichman called for a probe in a joint statement with former education minister Amnon Rubinstein, a fellow jurist who is also affiliated with the Interdisciplinary Center.
"The situation requires balance between protecting our existence and the humanist heritage of our people. The harsh accusations of the Goldstone report being disseminated worldwide cannot be ignored. We must investigate Israel's conduct in Operation Cast Lead to stand guard over the combat morality of the Israel Defense Forces," he said.  
Reichman said one unfair conclusion of the report is that Israel planned to harm innocent civilians.  
"Israel is presented as a murderous country. Without saying so outrightly, [the report] describes Israel as an apartheid state. It says the Israeli justice system is unreliable in overseeing the military and in its attitude toward the Arab minority. It determines that the Arab minority lacks freedom of expression and protest.  
"The most infuriating thing is the invalidation of the legal system. After the Israeli legal system has been attacked from within for interfering too much, the Goldstone report now argues that it does not interfere enough," the statement said.

<title>Toronto Film Fest deflects criticism of Tel Aviv spotlight</title>
<date>Fri Sep 04 10:42:23 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Organizers of the Toronto International Film Festival this week defended their decision to present a series of films spotlighting the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, which a group of high-profile artists and celebrities say constitutes complicity in "the Israeli propaganda machine."
"If there are issues that have been raised by these films, that's exactly what the festival should be about, to show work that's challenging, work that raises questions, work that's contemporary, work that deals with today's issues," Festival director Piers Handling. The films speak for themselves, he said, and are meant to promote discussion. 
Several Canadian filmmakers plan to withdraw their movies from the festival, claiming that the screenings of 10 Tel Aviv films will show Israel in a positive light instead of creating a critical forum in which to discuss the occupation. 
The Tel Aviv-centric week launches the Toronto Festival's new City to City event and is intended to celebrate Tel Aviv's centennial. 
According to the protesting artists, including culture critic Naomi Klein and director John Greyson, the problem is not the official participation of Israeli films at the festival but the character of the forum in which they will be screened. 
Greyson last week pulled his documentary "Covered" from the festival in protest, and a statement published online on Thursday and signed by more than 50 artists, academics, and filmmakers likened the program to a celebration of apartheid-era South Africa. 
"This program ignores the suffering of thousands of former residents and descendants of the (Tel Aviv) area who currently live in refugee camps in the Occupied Territories or who have been dispersed to other countries," say the signatories, which also include actors Jane Fonda and Danny Glover and filmmaker Ken Loach. 
They accuse the festival of taking direction from the "Brand Israel" campaign, which seeks to improve the country's image and has focused on Toronto as a test city. 
"We do not protest the individual Israeli filmmakers included in City to City, nor do we in any way suggest that Israeli films should be unwelcome at TIFF," they say. 
"However... we object to the use of such an important international festival in staging a propaganda campaign." 
With a diverse multicultural population, including sizable Jewish and Arab groups, Toronto frequently sees public demonstrations of support for both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict. 
Earlier this year, the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees passed a resolution to boycott Israeli academic institutions, while "Israeli Apartheid Week", founded in Toronto in 2005, is held annually on several Canadian university campuses. 
In a blog posting last week, City to City festival programmer Cameron Bailey said he was attracted to Tel Aviv because "the films being made there explore and critique the city from many different perspectives". 
He also said the series was conceived independently and was not the object of pressure from any outside source.

<title>UN General Assembly President accuses U.S. of demonizing Iran</title>
<date>Wed Mar 18 05:31:19 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The outspoken president of the UN General Assembly on Tuesday accused the United States of demonizing Iran's president and criticized the International Criminal Court for issuing an arrest warrant for Sudan's leader for war crimes in Darfur.
Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, a Roman Catholic priest from Nicaragua with openly leftist views, also reiterated that the more he thinks about the conditions that Israel imposes on the Palestinians, the more he tends to think about apartheid.
During a wide-ranging press conference, d'Escoto insisted he wasn't being divisive or promoting his own agenda - but was just fulfilling his duty as president of the 192-member General Assembly to uphold the UN Charter and promote peace and non-violence.
Briefing reporters on his recent three-week trip that included a stop in Tehran, d'Escoto said he was struck by the great support and respect for Iran from its neighbors at a summit meeting of the Economic Cooperation Organization - a regional body founded in 1985 by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan - especially for helping to alleviate the plight of Afghan refugees in Iran.
"That was a very wonderful experience to see that, in contrast to the attitude that we find, sadly, here where we are," d'Escoto said.
"I don't think anyone can doubt that in our part of the world ... (President Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad has been demonized," he said. "The United States has been in the business of the demonization of people forever and the canonization of the worst of dictators.
D'Escoto singled out Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, Nicaragua's Anastasio Samoza and Chile's Augusto Pinochet. Asked whether he approved of Ahmadinejad saying he wants to wipe a UN member state - Israel - off the map, d'Escoto said if he said that, "it's lamentable," but he quickly added that words as such don't kill and it's the actions that have to be watched.
"I don't hate Israel, much less do I hate the Jewish people," d'Escoto added. "In fact they are very high on my list of people that I love."
But he said that won't keep him from criticizing Israeli actions, especially in the recent war in Gaza where some 1,400 Palestinians and just 13 Israelis were killed.
D'Escoto served as foreign minister in the 1980s during the rule of the Sandinistas, who aligned themselves with Fidel Castro and the Soviet Union. Since assuming the one-year General Assembly presidency in September, he has been a stern critic of the United States, and of Israel.
He criticized the United States on Tuesday for acting on its own rather than multilaterally as the UN Charter calls for, and singled out former President George W. Bush for going to war in Iraq in 2003 without Security Council approval and for then accusing the Sudanese government of committing genocide in Darfur.
"The United States dares to stick its tongue out to the Security Council and says you either give me the green light to commit the aggression that I want to commit, or I shall declare you obsolete, irrelevant," d'Escoto said.
Mark Kornblau, spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, when asked to comment on the criticism of the U.S., said: "It's hard to make sense of Mr. D'Escoto's increasingly bizarre statements."
D'Escoto called the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity unfortunate and lamentable because the African Union and the Arab League had asked the Security Council to delay the warrant for a year to pursue peace efforts in Darfur.
"It helps to deepen the perception that international justice is racist because this is the third time that you have something from the ICC, and for the third time it has to do with Africa," d'Escoto said.
Answering critics who said it's not his role to speak out against the court over the warrants for the Sudanese leader, d'Escoto noted that Bush first raised the issue of genocide in Darfur.
"That should tell you quite a bit already," he said. "Can you imagine (Chicago gangster) Al Capone phoning the police to say that somebody stole milk from the market? It's Al Capone standing up for uprightness."
D'Escoto said the United Nations needs the United States but it needs a United States with it, not against it, a United States committed to multilateralism, a United Nations committed to respecting the sovereign equality of all member states.
He said it was very good that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had raised the possibility of Iran attending a meeting on Afghanistan on March 31 in the Netherlands.
"If they're invited, they will participate ... that's what I gather," d'Escoto said.

<title>U.S. reconsiders boycott of Durban II anti-racism summit</title>
<date>Mon Apr 13 22:47:48 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
The Obama administration is reconsidering its planned boycott of a controversial United Nations racism conference that is deeply opposed by Israel and Jewish groups and will be attended by Iran's president, the State Department said late Monday.
In a move likely to upset its staunchest Mideast ally and its supporters, the department said the administration was pleased by a diplomatic push to revise an objectionable document that the meeting will adopt and suggested it could attend the meeting if the efforts succeed.
In February, after attending preparatory meetings for the follow-up conference, the Obama administration said it would not attend Durban II unless the meeting's final document was changed to drop references to Israel, defamation of religion and demands for reparations for slavery.
A State Department spokesman said Monday that there had been substantial improvements to the draft but that there were elements that continue to pose significant concerns, including the affirmation of the Durban declaration and a portion on incitement to religious hatred that the U.S. sees as suggested support for restrictions on freedom of expression.
The U.S. State Department later said in a statement, "We hope that these remaining concerns will be addressed, so that the United States can re-engage the conference process with the hope of arriving at a Conference document that we can support."
Israel and Canada already have announced they will boycott the meeting.
Israel, which was deeply concerned when the administration sent a delegation to the preparatory meeting, has lobbied hard for the U.S. to stay away from the conference.
Ahmadinejad to attend Durban 2 anti-racism conference
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will attend the United Nations anti-racism conference in Geneva in late April, Iran's state-run media reported Monday.
The IRNA website said Monday "the review conference is the follow-up to the 2001 First World Conference on Racism in South Africa which strongly condemned the racist policies of the Zionist regime."
Israel, Canada, and Italy have both decided to boycott the conference, while the United States is reportedly considering
The conference, to be held in Geneva next month, is a follow-up to the contentious 2001 conference in the South African city of Durban which was dominated by clashes over the Middle East and the legacy of slavery. 
The U.S. and Israel walked out midway through that eight-day meeting over a draft resolution that singled out Israel for criticism and likened Zionism - the movement to establish and maintain a Jewish state - to racism.
An original draft of the closing statement for the conference stated that Israel's policy in the Palestinian territories constitutes a "violation of international human rights, a crime against humanity and a contemporary form of apartheid." A later draft was released

<title>U.S. to boycott Durban 2 conference on racism</title>
<date>Fri Feb 27 21:30:44 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The United States will not attend a United Nations conference on racism that critics say will be a forum to criticize Israel, and will no longer participate in planning sessions for it, the State Department announced on Friday. 
The conference is a follow-up to the contentious 2001 conference in the South African city of Durban which was dominated by clashes over the Middle East and the legacy of slavery. The U.S. and Israel walked out midway through that eight-day meeting over a draft resolution that singled out Israel for criticism and likened Zionism - the movement to establish and maintain a Jewish state - to racism.
Israel and Canada have already announced that they will boycott the upcoming World Conference Against Racism in Geneva from April 20-25, known as Durban 2, but President Barack Obama's administration decided to assess the negotiations before making a decision on U.S. participation.
The decision to drop U.S. involvement comes one day before U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leaves on her first trip to the Middle East in her new capacity, including stops in Israel.
A U.S. delegation took part in negotiations this month on summit. Referring to the content of draft resolutions formulated during the preparations, the source said that during negotiations "a bad document became worse," prompting the U.S. to end its affiliation with the conference. 
The U.S. decided the final document that will be produced by the conference is "not salvageable," another official said.
"The document being negotiated has gone from bad to worse, and the current text of the draft outcome document is not salvageable," State Department spokesperson Robert Wood said. "As a result, the United States will not engage in further negotiations on this text, nor will we participate in a conference based on this text. A conference based on this text would be a missed opportunity to speak clearly about the persistent problem of racism."
"The United States remains open to a positive result in Geneva based on a document that takes a constructive approach to tackling the challenges of racism and discrimination," Wood said.
Critics of the April conference, say Arab nations will use it as a forum to bash Israel and charge that the draft document will limit freedom of religion and speech.
Last week, Haaretz learned that the draft resolutions for the conference branded Israel as an occupying state that carries out racist policies. They refer to "the plight of Palestinian refugees and other inhabitants of the Arab occupied territories," apparently meaning Israel itself. 
The senior UN source told Haaretz that the U.S. ended its contact with the nations that drafted the resolutions, which will be voted on during the summit. The Americans did not want a draft resolution reiterating the decisions of the first Durban summit, held in 2001, to be brought to a vote, the source said. 
They also insisted that no country would be specifically mentioned by name in any resolution and even objected to an initiative by Muslim countries to ratify a law banning criticism of any religion in the media, the source added. 
The 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in Durban was meant to lay down a blueprint for nations to address sensitive issues. 
Israel and the United States walked out in protest over a draft text branding Israel as a racist and apartheid state, language that was later dropped.
The State Department did say though that the U.S. plans to participate in this month's UN Human Rights Council in an observer status though it expressed its reservations over the body's frequent opprobrium of Israel.
"Our participation as an observer is a sign of the commitment of the Administration to advancing the cause of human rights in the multilateral arena," the State Department said. "We look forward to the help and cooperation of our friends and allies to ensure the Human Rights Council focuses on the pressing human rights concerns of our time."
Besides the Durban controvery, supporters of Israel will have their hands full. Pro-Palestinian activists plan on staging "Israel Apartheid Week" beginning Monday in New York. Among the prominent participants is Nir Harel, an Israeli member of Anarchists Against the Wall. Events will include "forums, films, cultural events and street protests."‚Ä¨

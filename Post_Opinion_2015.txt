<title>67-plus-one new reasons I love Israel</title>
<date>16/4/2015</date>
<content>
I’ve been writing these columns in honor of Independence Day for a decade and a  half, but I never run out of new reasons I love Israel.Here they are,  for Yom Ha’atzmaut 2015, in no particular order: 1. Who says we’re not  traditional? We consume 1,600 tons of honey and 15,000 tons of apples on Rosh  Hashana.




The custom includes Ethiopian immigrants who eat yemarima  yewotet bread, sweetened with honey and favored with spices.2. Who says  we’re not traditional? Seventy- three percent of us fast on Yom Kippur, 84% in  Jerusalem.3. Diabetic teens want to fast on Yom Kippur and Ramadan. A  new protocol was invented at Hadassah University Medical Center to allow them to  take part in the national abstinence.4. My supermarket features pins and  tape at the entrance before Succot, anticipating the need to hang up children’s  artwork in the tent-like booths.5. When ladybugs flew into the swimming  pool on Passover, someone shouted, “Look, Moshe Rabbenu [our teacher Moses] in  the water!” because that’s what you call ladybugs in Hebrew.6. At Monday  night women’s swim, the hijabs and sheitels (wigs) share space on the  locker-room benches.7. Robotic vacuum cleaners are advertised constantly  before Passover.8. The entire Cinema City in Jerusalem changed over to  Passover mode on the same day.9. When a new pharmacy opened on a trendy  Jerusalem street, across from an old one, the buzz was about whether such close  competition was allowed in Jewish law.10. Israeli invention: a  featherless chicken.11. Far afield: An Israeli start-up is to going to  build a wave-energy power plant off the Chinese coast. Israel’s GAL Water  technology is purifying water for the Marshall Islands.12. Our  political, security and economic situation is serious, but politicians used  humor to speak to voters.13. Everyone in the country knows the prime  minister’s favorite flavor of ice cream.14. Seder guests brought me  matza baked by the prime minister! 15. The news announcers say, “Moadim  l’simha,” during Passover, and everyone knows that the greeting refers to the  intermediate days of the holiday.16. When a famous Hebrew singer dies,  his/her music is played all day as a memorial.17. We treat over 90% of  our wastewater, more than any other country. Our biggest garbage dump has become  a terrific park.18. Our average public healthcare is ranked superior to  that of the United States, and everyone, employed or not, has  coverage.19. Specials at trendy cafés and cinemas for seniors are called  “Tuesday with Suspenders.”20. We take in refugees from both Islamic  State and al-Qaida and give them medical care – Sunni and Shi’ite.21.  When I filled up at an Israeli Arab-run gas station, a huge freezer of ice cream  bars was marked “Kosher for Passover.”Gas stations give out Haggadot,  too.22. Matza is a big seller in Arab neighborhood corner  stores.23. Reported in the newspaper: A speeding driver stopped by  police explained that it was almost too late to burn hametz (the symbolic  process of getting rid of leavened products on the morning of the  Seder).24. A new Israeli stamp features the Cyrus Declaration from 538  BCE, in which the Persian king allowed a return to Israel, as reported in the  Book of Ezra.The glue on the stamp is kosher.25. Big signs off  highways announce: “Shmita is observed here” – leaving the land fallow – and  many hurried to plant before the sabbatical year began.26. Keren  Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund suspends tree-planting for a shmita  year.27. Importing vegetables from Hamas farms isn’t a peace initiative  – it’s a shmita initiative.28. An Israeli porcupine dug up a  1,400-year-old oil lamp.29. Israeli invention: a suit that lets you  rappel from your apartment building in case of fire.30. Israel  inventions: supermarket carts with smartphone chargers.31. Our beggars  frequently bless us.32. The advertisement to encourage voting says you  forfeit your right to gripe if you don’t vote. Over 72% of us vote, Jews and  Arabs together.33. El Al ground crew and flight attendants dress up for  Purim.34. TV news anchors wear costumes on Purim; TV marks Purim with  Monty Python movies.35. Our national junk food Bamba can prevent a child  from developing peanut allergies.36. Our tech companies had more than 75  “exits” last year, being bought out by international corporations. According to  London’s Center for Policy Studies, we rank second in the world in producing self-made billionaires per  capita.37. When a Nigerian man insisted on giving his kidney to an  Israeli, only an ultra-Orthodox rabbi believed him. The recipient was a Druse  law student.38. The mayor of Jerusalem tackled a terrorist to the ground  and protected the city.39. No hametz allowed. There’s a hametz guard  keeping bread out of the hospitals on Passover, and certain seafood restaurants  didn’t serve beer over the holiday; non-kosher McDonald’s branches switched to  matza buns.40. Israel news headline: Holocaust survivor has 100th  great-grandchild.41. Israel news headline: Baby saved from café terror  attack grows up to serve in IDF.42. Despite complaints about cost of  living and security threats, we have nearly twice as many babies, three per  woman, as the average in other developed countries.43. Seven species:  Israeli scientists have figured out how to grow grapes in winter – and they’re  seedless, too.44. Seven species: Israeli scientists have shown that  pomegranates help fight hypertension, heart disease, brain deterioration and  heart disease – not quite 613 cures, but getting close.45. Upbeat  Israeli research suggests – with cautious optimism – that cannabis may kill or  slow the development of cancer cells, not just ameliorate the tough  treatment.46. We have a gazelle herd in a park in the middle of  Jerusalem.47. Israeli invention: a robot that picks  watermelons.48. Don’t tell those who shout “apartheid”: Gaza farmers  attended a seminar in northern Israel and learned to double their watermelon  crop.49. Israeli designers of Pastel Brasserie and Bar at the Tel Aviv  Museum of Art won the 2014 International Space Design Award – Idea prize for the  world’s best-designed restaurant.50. No wonder folks in Tel Aviv enjoy a  beer. Bronze-Age beer mugs were recently discovered in the city.51.  Saveur Culinary Travel Awards 2014 named Israel’s airline a winner of the  Inflight Wine award.52. National Geographic listed Tel Aviv as one of  the top 10 seafront city meccas.53. In 2014, Twitter users from around  the world labeled Tel Aviv one of the top 10 hottest destinations to visit that  year.54. Despite all the beer, beaches and partying, Tel Aviv won the  World Smart City award as part of Smart City Expo in Barcelona, beating 250  competitors.55. Nonetheless, the biggest export city isn’t Tel Aviv;  it’s the pioneering city of Petah Tikva, literally the “opening to  hope.”56. The Israeli bridge delegation beat out professional players  from around the world, taking the gold medal at the Sportaccord World Mind Games  in Beijing.57. In Jerusalem, Hebrew University professor Elon  Lindenstrauss won the Fields Medal, the “Nobel Prize” in math.58. Yshai  Oliel won the prestigious Junior Orange Bowl games in Coral Gables, Florida –  considered the unofficial world championships for tennis. He’s from  Ramle.59. When in Rome: Noa Raviv was chosen as the “Best Fashion  Designer of the Year” at the international 3D Printshow in Paris. Sarah Avraham  of Kiryat Arba won the Women’s World Thai-Boxing Championship in Thailand;  Vladislav Bykanov won the gold medal at the European Short Track Speed Skating  championship in Holland.60. The IDF gives telephone and roof-knocking  warnings to civilians to evacuate areas while warfare is going on.61.  The Knesset has the largest solar field of any parliament in the  world.62. The Israeli drama Shtisel, about a family living in  Jerusalem’s Mea She’arim neighborhood, was purchased by a Swedish TV  channel.63. The Pango app lets us pay parking fees from afar and helps  New Yorkers reserve a spot at Lincoln Center.64. Simha. We score high on  the world’s happiness tests.65. We offer sports tours, wine tours,  chocolate tours and now the healthy Salad Trail tour of our country.66.  Israeli road safety company Mobileye (MBLY) raised $1 billion on NASDAQ. It  helps us avoid accidents, but it also showed a car could go 900 km., from  California to Nevada, without a driver. Israel is also the largest exporter of  unmanned aerial systems, surmounting aerospace giants in the US.67.  Jewish Deaf Multimedia produced a YouTube clip of the Four Questions for  Passover, “Why is this night different from all other nights?” in sign  language.68. Jewish Agency statistics for 2014 show that immigration to  Israel hit a 10-year high with the arrival of about 26,500 new immigrants, the  largest group arriving from France. Welcome my brothers, welcome my sisters.

<title>A Fresh Perspective: Standing up for Israel’s rights</title>
<date>4/6/2015</date>
<content>
Imagine if there  was a country you had no personal connection to that people accused of being an  apartheid state. This state was constantly condemned all over the world, and in  the UN, for war crimes and human rights violations. Imagine if this country was  claimed to be founded on colonialist principles, and was accused of systematic  racism.In its defense, this state simply emphasized the fact that it is  a leader in hi-tech and innovation, and that it invented things such as the  cherry tomato, ICQ and the flash drive.





 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}Whose side would you be on? This  is Israel’s image as seen in today’s world.When thinking about the  Jewish state’s public diplomacy, one must think about what the unengaged,  ordinary person sees, not what the educated activist sees. Today, Israel is  violently attacked by its haters through vicious delegitimization campaigns;  these are of course based on lies, but the ordinary, unengaged person does not  necessarily know that. Israel’s response to this campaign is simply  unconvincing.Israel needs to refocus its message and debunk the lies  thrown at it, such as these accusations of war crimes, apartheid and racism. It  must cultivate a parallel ethical discourse, one that is no less passionate than  the one promoted by the supporters of the Palestinians, based on the principles  of freedom, historical justice and legal justice. This discourse is the only way  to compete with the lies thrown at Israel because, although they are lies, they  base themselves on the deepest levels of human conscience and cannot be rejected  without proposing an alternative ethical foundation.The moral case for  Israel is a strong one; however, no one seems to be making it. As such, a moral  person who doesn’t actively educate himself on the conflict is fed a narrative  which leads him to oppose Israel virulently.
A new wind blows in the  Foreign Ministry Hotovely surprised a lot of people in her first speech after  taking office. The reason why people were surprised was not the right reason,  though.People raised eyebrows when Hotovely quoted parts of the Jewish  scripture, and its commentators, when talking about Israel’s right to the Land  of Israel.Yet the real surprise was a very pleasant change in Israel’s  core diplomatic discourse. For the first time in years, there was a high-ranking  official in the Foreign Ministry saying: “We are just. This land is  ours.”Hotovely said: “Many times it seems that in our international  relations, more than emphasizing the rightness of our cause, we are asked to use  arguments that play well diplomatically.But at a time when the very  existence of Israel is being called into question, it is important to be right.  The international community deals with considerations of justice and morality.  We need to return to the basic truth of our right to this land. This country is  ours, all of it.”After years of going around in circles and trying to  find diplomatic ways to get the world to love Israel without actually claiming  the rights which are rightfully ours, Hotovely asked that we start talking about  these rights again.The only way the world is going to accept Israel is  if it believes Israel has a right to exist. As long as Israel is afraid to talk  about its legal, historical and moral rights to its land, the world will keep on  questioning its existence and will move closer to the Palestinians, who are not  afraid to speak about their claim to the land.Dan Margalit, a leading  left-wing Israeli journalist who is very close to Hotovely on a personal level,  said he often tells her: “You are right, we have rights to the land, but the  Palestinians also do! Why not discuss this as well?” Hotovely answers: “I have  never heard Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas talk about Israel’s  rights to the land. Why should I talk about theirs?” Instead of trying to be  neutral, and shying away from controversial issues, Israel’s diplomatic corps  need to be pro-Israel. It might sound self-evident, but it is not. Israeli  officials are not UN officials, they are here to advocate for the Jewish state,  to defend its rights and protect its interests. In order to do so, they must  stand up for Israel’s rights, and only Israel’s rights.If they don’t,  Israel’s rights will never be a part of the public discourse and we will be left  with our current, warped situation: Where the Palestinians fill this vacuum by  constantly attacking Israel and talking about their rights, while Israel is  afraid to stand up for its own rights to its land.
The importance of the  legal rights discourse At the end of the day, the question of Israel’s  legitimacy comes down to the legal issue: Does Israel have a legal basis for its  presence in Judea and Samaria? Israel can try to justify its stance with  security concerns, but this will only bring the world to the conclusion that  Israel had good reasons to temporarily break the law. The world will still see  Israel as a state that is breaking the law, and in the long term it will not be  able to accept this. After a few years, the world will say: “If you keep  breaking the law, then despite whatever reason you might claim to have, you are  still a criminal.”The truth is that Israel has an outstanding legal case  to make about its right to the entire Land of Israel, including Judea and  Samaria. After all, the last legally binding document relating to this area of  the world is the British Mandate, which clearly states this area is meant for a  Jewish state.No other binding document was ever drafted: The Partition  Plan was unbinding, and rejected by the Palestinians. The Armistice Line of 1949  was never recognized by the world. Judea and Samaria, in legal terms, lay there  waiting for the British Mandate to be applied and for this area to be part of  the Jewish state, the State of Israel. In purely legal terms, in 1967 Israel did  not occupy a foreign land, but rather liberated Judea and Samaria from Jordanian  occupation.Those who claim there is an occupation in Judea and Samaria,  including global bodies such as the International Red Cross, look at the world  in a flawed way: If a shirt belonged to Johnny and George took it by violent  force, then when Johnny took it back from George, would this be called stealing?  Would Johnny be called a criminal? So too Israel just took back what was  originally meant to belong to it, according to the last binding legal document  relating to this region.
A new hopeHotovely started her term in the  Foreign Ministry on the right foot, by making a precise diagnosis of the problem  with Israel’s diplomacy: Its tendency to prefer to duck the tough ethical  questions rather than to stand up for Israel’s rights and the values it  represents.The next step in the right direction would be to reaffirm  Israel’s legal rights, which are strongly entrenched in international law.

<title>American Jews must stand with Israel against its enemies</title>
<date>27/8/2015</date>
<content>
19th century philosopher Max Nordau once reportedly told Zionist leader Ze’ev  Jabotinsky that “the Jew learns not by way of reason, but from catastrophes. He  won’t buy an umbrella merely because he sees clouds in the sky. He waits until  he is drenched and catches pneumonia.”Israel today faces many dangers –  an Iran nearing full nuclear capabilities, Islamic State close to its tiny  borders, Hamas devoted to its destruction, a hostile United Nations, as the  worldwide Jewish community faces an anti-Semitism unprecedented since World War  II.




Meanwhile, the American Jewish community sees overwhelming  assimilation and intermarriage, a reported two-thirds of Jews do not belong to a  synagogue – and yet so many in the American Jewish community respond to the  clouds facing the Jewish people by giving money to the New Israel Fund, an  organization devoted to harming Israel.NIF raises $30 million annually  from American Jews – to pursue an agenda which involves advocating and working  on a boycott against Israel, weakening the Israel Defense Forces, both on the  ground and via “lawfare,” and through various other mechanisms, including  advocating for terrorists’ families and collaborating with the United Nations to  attack Israel. If it harms Israel, count on the NIF to be part of it. Yet, in  the face of catastrophe there are those standing with the enemies of the Jewish  people.That’s the way so many in the American Jewish community have  chosen to respond to the catastrophes the Jewish people face.As  communications professionals – and proud Jewish-Americans – we support Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who said we must said stand together to “fend off  the attackers” pushing for a boycott of Israel. As Netanyahu noted, “As far as  those leading the boycott calls are concerned, the settlements in Judea and  Samaria are not the focus of the conflict, but rather our settlements in Tel  Aviv and Jaffa, in Haifa and Jerusalem.”We have different political  opinions, but across the political spectrum in Israel – from Labor to Likud,  Bayit Yehudi to Yesh Atid – on the issue of boycott and the IDF, we must stand  together. As Netanyahu said, we as supporters of Israel must stand, “Against  attempts to attack Israel with lies, false accusations and boycotts, we must  line up – Right and Left – to rebuff the pressure, expose the lies and attack  those who attack us.”With all going in the world, we ask how can  American Jews fund the enemies of Israel? How can they fund campaigns that  weaken the Israel Defense Forces and support a boycott of Israel? To Alisa  Doctoroff, president of UJA-Federation: stop giving money now.To Karen  R. Adler, and The Jewish Communal Fund: we urge you to serve the interests of  the Jewish people and say “No money to organizations that harm the Jewish  community.”To foundations like The Jim Joseph Foundation, the Russ  Berrie Foundation & The Leichtag Foundation who do so much positive work in  so many areas of the community, we say: review the work of Alma Biblash, the  executive director of the Human Rights Defenders Fund (HRDF), an organization to  which the NIF authorized grants worth $332,625 from 2011-2013. She has called  Israel “racist” and “murderous” and described the country as a “temporary Jewish  apartheid state.” Biblash supports Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)  campaigns and promotes the Palestinian Arab “right of return.” You are partners  with her work. Is this what your foundations wish to be known for? To a  six-figure NIF donor, the Lisa and Douglas Goldman Fund: you give money to the  Friends of Israel Defense Forces, a great organization – how can you also fund  the NIF which harms the IDF so much? As deputy Knesset speaker Yoni Chetboun  said, “The main goal of the NIF is to undermine the Israeli army, by knowingly  financing left-wing Israeli groups that try to get young Israeli soldiers  prosecuted for war crimes.”To the Stella and Charles Guttman Foundation,  who believe in “Arab-Israeli co-existence,” we say: the Jewish people all strive  for peace and co-existence. Stop funding extremist organizations like NIF who do  not recognize that Israel must remain a Jewish state.The extremists of  the NIF must be countered, and those who write checks must be challenged. Israel  is in the midst of an unprecedented storm.Simply we stand with Israel.  Today, we stand with Prime Minister Netanyahu who said in a recent cabinet  meeting, “We will gather forces in Israel and around the world to shatter the  lies of our enemies, and we will fight for Israel’s right to live in peace and  security, to live at all.”

<title>American Jews send millions to organization Israeli justice minister says is anti-Israel</title>
<date>22/10/2015</date>
<content>
For those still unsure  whether the New Israel Fund is aligned with factions devoted almost exclusively  to seeing Israel weakened, and worse, eliminated from the world stage, Justice  Minister Ayelet Shaked recently made the point even clearer.Shaked noted  in an interview that prior to meeting foreign elected leaders, she reviews their  government’s contributions to NGOs, and when she meets them, she urges them to  stop supporting anti-Israel NGOs – among them three grantees of the New Israel  Fund: Bimkom, Breaking the Silence and Hamoked.




Shockingly, these groups  are among the many funded by NIF to the tune of $30 million annually by American  Jews, including the president of UJA-Federation, Alisa Doctoroff, and the  president of the Jewish Communal Fund, Karen R. Adler. Israel fights terrorism,  the minister of justice asks foreign nations to stop giving to anti-Israel  organizations, yet extremist American Jews help Israel’s enemies.  Shameful.Bimkom – Planners for Planning Rights, an Israeli NGO, actively  pushes the “apartheid rhetoric” against Israel, and ties it into the BDS effort  – as if to make the comparison to the former anti-apartheid boycott campaigns  against South Africa.Breaking the Silence, an Israeli NGO founded with  the purpose of criticizing Israeli policy, pushes “war crimes allegations,  lobbying the EU and UN.” Its goal is to see Israeli soldiers and officials  brought before war crimes tribunals and arrested if they should travel  abroad.Then Hamoked: Center for the Defense of the Individual, an  Israeli human rights organization with a main focus assisting Palestinians of  the “occupied territories” whose rights they believe are violated by Israel,  also pushes the apartheid rhetoric and legal actions against Israel – which  brings it back to promoting BDS.Shaked is confronting world leaders who  may be giving without knowing that some groups harm Israel, but believe they are  giving to a “human rights organization.”As she clarified, these are  anti-Israel groups. While the European ministers she speaks with may not know  the intricacies of the harm being caused by these groups, the same cannot be  said of the New Israel Fund, its leadership and its donors.The NIF has  consistently put its support behind each of these groups, in addition to many  others not mentioned here, and has gone to bat for them publicly to explain how  the anti-Israel work that they do is a supposed positive step for  Israel.When Breaking the Silence issued a one-sided, biased and  inaccurate report about alleged war crimes committed by the IDF in Gaza, NIF  promoted the report and went on a fund-raising tour.Hamoked also issued  a report accusing Israel of war crimes in 2014, and the New Israel Fund promoted  it when appealing for additional support, and Bimkom’s executive director Hedva  Radovanitz formerly served as NIF Israel’s associate director – and was quoted  in a WikiLeaks document telling an American diplomatic officer that “... she  believed that in 100 years Israel would be majority Arab and that the  disappearance of a Jewish state would not be the tragedy that Israelis fear  since it would become more democratic.”Radovanitz went on to say that  “the NIF was currently reevaluating its strategy and was hoping to create a  movement rather than just a lot of NGOs.”When Israel’s justice minister  makes a point of asking foreign counterparts to stop giving to these NGOs –  foreign leaders who undoubtedly have countless concerns on their minds – is it  such a reach to expect that a group devoted entirely to Israel issues stop  funding these NGOS as well? Still, the NIF continues.While these facts  have been written about many times, NIF donors such as the Jim Joseph  Foundation, Lopatin Family Foundation, Barbara and Eric Dobkin, William and  Serra Goldman, and Carole and Saul Zabar choose to ignore them, and continue  sending money to the major funder of organizations seeking to undermine Israel.  If the highest levels of diplomatic communications are not enough to bring  proper attention to the matter, what will it take?

<title>Another Tack: Abu Mazen proved Ezer wrong</title>
<date>8/10/2015</date>
<content>
Back when late president Ezer Weizman was still the  witty commander of the Israel Air Force, given to rolling cool quips off his  tongue, he elaborated only semi-facetiously on a staple quote from the First  Book of Samuel: “the Eternity of Israel shall not deceive” (1 Samuel 15-29). To  the promise of unfailing divine providence for Israel, Weizman added: “and the  Arabs won’t let us down.”In other words, we can count on our  quick-tempered neighbors to extricate us out of any tight spot via their  shortsighted intransigence. Less flippantly, Weizman’s contemporary, ultra-dove  Abba Eban, hinted at an obliquely related reality when he judged that to their  distinct disadvantage the Arabs “never missed an opportunity to miss an  opportunity.”




That said, niggling doubts persisted all along at the back  of our minds. There always preyed the bothersome hypothetical of what would  happen if the Arabs Ezer wisecracked about would wise-up and quit being too  pigheaded for their own good.Now it seems that what we distantly dreaded  has finally come to pass.If things truly went our way, Palestinian  Authority figurehead Mahmoud “Abu Mazen” Abbas would for sure have announced  unequivocally from the UN General Assembly podium that he is revoking the Oslo  Accords with immediate effect.Without much ado, he would have torn up  the documents on which Oslo’s convoluted clauses, subsections, stipulations and  provisos are listed. That would have been dramatic and would have left no  uncertainty in anyone’s cerebral recesses that Oslo has at long belated last  been ignominiously dispatched to the netherworld.In fact, Oslo has been  a smelly decomposing cadaver for years but no one, least of all diplomatically  timid Israel, dared say it like it is.Across the Green Line, Abbas and  his front men hectored ominously in a refrain of irascible rants. If we don’t  bow to Ramallah’s diktats, we were warned, Abbas will do the unthinkable and  actually bury Oslo’s putrid remains.Presumably that should have sent us  all into a tizzy of trepidation.In fact, though, Israel would have  heaved a sincere sigh of relief had Abbas actually done the decent thing for  once and pronounced the demise of the evil poltergeist that imperils our  self-preservation prospects.But it was apparently way too good to be  true. Perhaps in a rare moment of clarity amid his petulant outbursts about  “filthy Jewish feet contaminating Arab Jerusalem’s sanctity,” Abbas understood  that he’d only be doing the “filthy Jews” a favor by taking them off the Oslo  hook.So he stopped short of carrying out what was hyped to intimidate  us. Instead, all we got is yet another conditional caution that Abbas intends to  be really naughty if we don’t stop him ASAP. That in no way comes even remotely  close to bearing out Ezer’s premise that “the Arabs won’t let us  down.”But perhaps we were just daft to hope.After all, Abbas has  been cantankerously barking the identical threats for years. Each time he puts  Israel severely on notice that if we don’t clean up our act and commit national  suicide forthwith, he will walk away from Oslo and maybe even resign the  position to which he was last elected (well, sort of) in January 2005 – for just  a four-year term.Abbas puts on the same horror show at exactly the same  season annually – roughly coinciding with the Jewish High Holy Days (when  incitement over Jerusalem’s sacred sites is most expedient and most effective)  and the General Assembly session (when Abbas expects greatest international  exposure).Only minor details ever change – like those involving  immediate sources of discomfiture for Abbas on his Ramallah turf or specific  exasperating circumstances in the greater Arab realm. Other that, what was is  almost precisely what is.It just doesn’t necessarily seem so because our  memory receptacles in this region are filled to capacity and overflowing. We are  constantly inundated with new sensations hot on the heels of only yesterday’s  headlines.We become inured and unable to retain more incoming  information.On top of this, tendentious media everywhere are hardly  reliable memory custodians.Often, they amplify and exaggerate reruns of  bygone cliffhangers and recycle them as new gripping attractions. Headline-  pushers and ratings-grabbers don’t want us to connect the dots and deduce that  nothing new is on offer.Good retentive faculties among members of the  public are altogether undesirable in the eyes of many practitioners of advocacy  journalism. Their preferred agendas might be foiled were news-consumers to  demonstrate even fair to middling powers of recall.The truth is that  Abbas’s latest threats were old hat, an almost literal repetition of his oft  rehashed histrionics.If any proof were needed, a verbatim transcript  below of an editorial I wrote three years ago should provide it. True, it  includes references to economic protests rather than to the Syrian mayhem that  currently steals the Palestinian thunder. Other than that, however, the old text  appears oven-fresh. It could have been written this morning.Here, in  full, is The Jerusalem Post’s September 27, 2012 editorial: Of late Mahmoud  Abbas’s PA appears to be staging recurrent verbal thrills-andspills  extravaganzas. It’s almost as if, when nothing else works, generating headlines  constitutes a viable alternative to actual policy and governance.And so  the latest bombshell Abbas attempted to toss was the suggestion that Ramallah  might abrogate the Oslo Accords with Israel. It’s difficult to fathom who Abbas  supposes he may be frightening.If any side had benefitted from Oslo, it  was his. After 19 years, Israel can definitely pronounce itself the outright  loser of its own risky experiment.From our vantage point, not only was  there no gain but there was a surfeit of inordinate pain. We had lost over 1,500  lives – once cynically referred to as “victims of peace.” We had nosedived into  a diplomatic nadir of unparalleled detriment.We had constructed two  inimical entities – Ramallah and Gaza – within a stone’s throw from our  vulnerable population centers.We had imported between 40,000 to 50,000  armed Fatah terrorists from Tunis and given them and their Hamas rivals  legitimacy at the expense of our own legitimacy. We had made the creation of a  Palestinian state axiomatically accepted everywhere while our own existence is  being increasingly questioned.Worst of all, peace seems more distant now  than it did in September 1993, when our situation was incomparably  better.Therefore, at this point in time Oslo should no longer be dear to  any sober Israeli, which brings up the question of why Abbas assumes that he  would be startling us with the move he now purports to be seriously  weighing.Yet according to PLO Executive Committee member Wassel Abu  Yusef – and he is hardly the first to float this thinly-veiled threat – Abbas  has been raising the idea of “cancelling the Oslo agreement as well as the  associated economic and security arrangements,” in PA leadership  consultations.To delve beneath the surface of Abbas’s bluster it would  help to note what accompanies his chatter about nullifying Oslo.Two  themes crop up consistently in this context. The first is that Abbas’s sole  substitute for a Palestinian state is a bi-national state which Israel would  initially run as an apartheid state – prior presumably to being overrun by Arabs  and losing Jewish sovereignty.This skewed presentation isn’t an Abbas  original. It had long been the hallmark of Israel’s domestic left-wing  discourse, geared to argue that the two-state solution is the best offer Israel  has, indeed that it’s indispensable.Abbas not only picks on that thread.  By stressing the apartheid motif, he again resorts to his persistent ploy of  demonizing Israel. He misses no opportunity to blacken our image in a manner far  more suggestive of an implacable foe than of a committed peace  partner.Directly in tow, is his appeal for greater international-donor  handouts. The PA is in dire straits. Despite all the moneys sunk into it from  abroad, it had failed to erect a credible functioning economic  infrastructure.Hefty foreign contributions seem to have disappeared down  Ramallah’s drain of corruption and/or incompetence. Right now, the PA can’t so  much as pay its bills.All this has taken a menacing turn following  near-riots over cost-of-living hikes.And so Abbas has opted for his  serial remedy – blame Israel, while demanding its assistance. To try and compel  Israel into bankrolling him, Abbas now agitates for renegotiating the Paris  Protocol, the 1994 addendum to the Oslo Accord that governs economic ties  between the two sides.This isn’t a request of minor  substance.It’s hardly a matter of yet another one-sided concession  squeezed out of Israel in keeping with the pattern whereby it behooves Israel to  repeatedly “demonstrate goodwill.”We can only hope that the government  will not be tempted at a moment of weakness to agree to amend the Paris  Protocol.Not only would it lose Israel the paltry control it retains,  but it would embolden Abbas to press for more without honoring his part of the  Oslo bargain.Herein lies the problem: Ramallah has consistently betrayed  its Oslo obligations.Having serially sponsored terror, incitement and  hostile international campaigns, it has plainly tried everything but  peace.Bottom line: Has anything changed between September 27, 2012 and  now? Heck no! Would ridding us of Oslo have injured us in any shape or form in  2012? Heck no! Could ridding us of Oslo injure us in any shape or form in 2015?  Heck no! No matter how one scrutinizes the annual Abbas melodramas, there’s no  getting around the fact that he seeks to scare us over and over with the same  second-hand dud. His only marketable skill is staging a pathetic pageant and  performing the same pitiable stunt of tossing a bombshell that might maybe in  future detonate.Too bad Abu Mazen proved Ezer wrong.Replay after  replay of the same formulaic skit, and we are still formally dogged by the  deceased and decayed Oslo. So far, for 22 volatile years, the Arabs have only  let us down – their commotion to the contrary  notwithstanding.www.sarahhonig.com

<title>Anti-Semitism and Jewish destiny</title>
<date>20/5/2015</date>
<content>
On Sunday, Robert S. Wistrich – the director of the Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem – emailed the following column to ‘Jerusalem Post’ Editor-in-Chief Steve Linde, asking that it be published in the coming week. Wistrich died suddenly on Tuesday. We dedicate his last column to perpetuating his memory. May his words live on.There are few topics of more pressing concern today to Jewish communities around the world than the current resurgence of anti-Semitism. Thus, there could have been no more appropriate time for the 5th Global Forum for Combating Antisemitism to meet than last week in Jerusalem. It was a large and impressive gathering of participants from all over the world, initiated by the Foreign Ministry, together with its Diaspora Affairs Department.




In my own remarks to the conference I emphasized the need to free ourselves from certain outdated myths. My first point was that even today, Jews in Israel and the Diaspora are fixated on the dangers of far-right traditional anti-Semitism – whether racist, religious or nationalist. While neo-fascism has not altogether disappeared, it is in most cases a secondary threat.Second, there is an illusory belief that more Holocaust education and memorialization can serve as an effective antidote to contemporary anti-Semitism. This notion, shared by many governments and well-meaning liberal gentiles, is quite unfounded. On the contrary, today “Holocaust inversion” (the perverse transformation of Jews into Nazis and Muslims into victimized “Jews”) all-too-often becomes a weapon with which to pillory Israel and denigrate the Jewish people. Hence the approach to this entire subject requires considerable rethinking, updating and fine-tuning.Third, we must recognize much more clearly than before that since 1975 (with the passing of the scandalous UN resolution condemning Zionism as racism) hatred of Israel has increasingly mutated into the chief vector for the “new” anti-Semitism.
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}By libeling the Jewish state as “racist,” “Nazi,” “apartheid” and founded from its inception on “ethnic cleansing,” its enemies have turned Zionism into a synonym for criminality and a term of pure opprobrium.Hence, every Jew (or non- Jew) who supports the totally “illegitimate” or immoral “Zionist entity” is thereby complicit in a cosmic evil.Fourth, today’s anti-Semitism is a product of a new civic religion that could be termed “Palestinianism.”The official Palestinian narrative seeks to supplant Israel with a judenrein Palestine from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. In the case of Hamas, this intent is absolutely explicit. With Fatah, it is partly veiled for tactical reasons.But when it comes to the Palestinian ideology and the millions around the world who support it, virtually all actions of self-defense by Israel are instantly classified as “genocide,” demonized and treated as part of a sinister Jewish-imperialist conspiracy. Not surprisingly, then, pro-Palestine demonstrations, beginning in the summer of 2014, were often accompanied by ugly chants of “Death to the Jews” and anti-Semitic incidents.My fifth point is closely related to this reality. Since the turn of the 21st century, anti-Semitism has undergone a process of growing “Islamicization,” linked to the terrorist holy war against Jews and other non-Muslims with its truly lethal consequences.Yet most debates skirt around the issues of Iran and radical Islam.However, if we do not confront the prime danger posed by radical Islamist and genocidal anti-Semitism, how can our common struggle hope to succeed? One of the symptoms of this vain policy of appeasement pursued by America and Europe is the almost Pavlovian reflex after every terrorist, anti-Semitic outrage to immediately disconnect it from any link to Islam. Of course, Islamist is not identical with Islam, only a minority of Muslim believers support terrorism, and stigmatization is wrong. Equally, we must empower moderate Muslims wherever we can.But denial does not work. Levels of anti-Semitism among Muslims clearly remain the highest in the world, and the horrific consequences of jihadi movements like Islamic State for all minorities are impossible to ignore. Nothing can be gained by sweeping this threat under the carpet.The Islamists are the spearhead of current anti-Semitism, aided and abetted by the moral relativism of all-too-many naive Western liberals.My sixth observation relates to the need for Israelis and Diaspora Jews to rediscover, redefine and reassess their Jewish identity, core Jewish values and the depth of their own connection to the Land of Israel as well as to their historic heritage. I was privileged to have authored two years ago the exhibition “People, Book, Land – The 3,500-Year Relationship of the Jewish People to the Holy Land” for the bold project initiated by the Simon Wiesenthal Center together with UNESCO. Against all the odds and in the face of predictable opposition, it opened at UNESCO headquarters in Paris in June 2014.In April 2015, the exhibit was even shown at UN Headquarters in New York, and it will soon come to Israel. This is not merely a historical exercise, for it shows the extraordinary tenacity, cultural vitality, spirituality, and metaphysical as well as physical bonds of Jews and Judaism to the Land of Israel. None of this was intended, it should be emphasized, to negate the historical presence and significance of Christianity and Islam in this land.But it sets the record straight.My final reflection flows from this experience. I believe that in an age of Jewish empowerment, living in a sovereign and democratic Israeli state, we can and must first clarify for ourselves our vocation, raison d’être, moral priorities, and the deeper meaning of our near-miraculous return to the historic homeland.This is the other side of the coin in our essential and relentless fight against anti-Semitism. As we celebrate Jerusalem Day let us be worthy of the scriptural promise that “the Torah will come forth from Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”
Here, in the beating heart of the Jewish nation, where its body and soul come together in the City of Peace, we must be true to the national and universal vision of our biblical prophets. Anti-Semitism, the long shadow which has for so long accompanied our bi-millennial Diasporic tribulations, and nearly 70 years of renewed statehood, is neither “eternal” nor must it prevent Jews from fulfilling their ultimate destiny to one day become a “light unto the nations.”

<title>Anti-Semitism on campus: Old wine in new bottles</title>
<date>4/5/2015</date>
<content>
As  someone who has been critical about the sometimes overheated reaction to what is  taking place regarding Jews on campus, I also believe it is vital to monitor the  situation closely and to be able to reevaluate as things may change.I  still believe that the vast majority of Jewish students have normal lives on  campus where they can be comfortable in their own skins and with their Jewish  identities.




That is why a recent survey suggesting that more than 50  percent of Jewish students experienced anti-Semitism in one form or another was  disturbing. This survey – which in my opinion was flawed – was not a helpful  reading of what is going on.And yet, something is changing. We need to  identify what it is and deal with it – without declaring the sky is  falling.Historically, many campuses, particularly when it comes to  faculty, have a reputation of being left-wing or at least very liberal. Since  the vast majority of the Jewish community has identified itself in a similar  fashion for decades, there seemed to be no problem.Together with this,  however, polls of the American people in the last few years appear to indicate  an increasing gap in attitudes toward Israel between those who identify  themselves as conservatives and those who identify themselves as liberals. The  latter are increasingly questioning Israeli policies and expressing interest in  a more balanced American approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.It  is this evolving phenomenon which, I believe, is lending force to the  anti-Israel forces on campus. Let’s be clear: There has always been a measure of  left-wing opposition to Israel on campuses, whether from faculty or some student  groups.For sure they are more organized today. Students for Justice in  Palestine, the main organizing force behind the boycott, divestment and  sanctions campaigns, has refined and intensified its tactics and is popping up  on new campuses every month or so. Regardless of the fact that the BDS campaign  has not gained much traction on campus in terms of having any impact against  Israel – many, if not most, of the boycott votes have been soundly defeated – it  is creating a great deal of noise on campus and beyond, raising a lot of  attention, and contributing to the sense of discomfort of Jewish  students.But the biggest change is the fertile ground in which the  anti-Israel community is sowing its seeds.The trends that are appearing  relate to the perception of Jewish students and their relations with other  minority communities. There are suggestions that Jews do not qualify for  participation in minority community activity on campus, for two reasons: 1) They  are deemed people of privilege, not minorities worthy of special attention; and  2) their assumed support for “colonialist, apartheid” Israel puts them in the  camp of would-be oppressors rather than targets and opponents of  prejudice.Recent incidents at UCLA and Stanford bring this disturbing  phenomenon into focus. At UCLA, a student leader had her qualifications for a  Judicial Board position come under question due to her Jewish identity and  affiliation with the Jewish community on campus. At Stanford, a Jewish student  running for a position in student government was asked how her Judaism might  influence her position on divestment from Israel.What was so stunning to  the student applicants was not that they were asked about their views on Israel  – they were aware that, unfortunately, these bodies supported boycott actions  against the Jewish state. Rather, that there was no shame in introducing the  candidates’ Jewishness as the critical factor in assessing the  candidacy.It is this linking of attitudes toward Israel and attitudes  toward Jews that raises concern about the future of Jewish life on campus. Larry  Summers, when president at Harvard, foresaw this back in 2002 when there was an  effort to bring a divestment campaign to the university.He, most  importantly, rejected it, decrying the abhorrent comparison of democratic Israel  to apartheid South Africa. He then went on to explain that while not all who  advocated divestment from Israel were motivated by anti-Semitism, even those who  weren’t created a climate making anti-Semitism more palatable by the assault on  the good name of the Jewish state.In effect, the attacks on Israel on  campus are unleashing inhibitions against expressions of anti-Jewish prejudice  and beginning to legitimize attacks on Jews on campus.While much of this  is in a nascent stage, it is important to deal with it now on several  levels.First, greater efforts must be made to generate a more balanced  view of Israel and the region among minority students. Some are undoubtedly  locked in to their anti-Israel perspective for ideological reasons. But many  others are certainly open to hearing a different take on the Middle East. Not  one in which Israel is always in the right, but a complicated narrative about  competing interest and needs.Second, it must be made clear that whatever  one’s views on the conflict, treating Jews differently is unacceptable and it is  what it is, anti-Semitism. University officials must speak out clearly and  unequivocally against even the slightest hint of singling Jews out that  way.Third, we must continually assess the status of Jews on campus in a  calm and rational way, distinguishing between the real challenges Jewish  students face without sending alarm signals which could undermine the normal  life on campus that exists for most of them.Jews in America have made  too much progress over the last half-century to cause us to overreact. Still, we  cannot afford to be complacent. We have to address these campus issues now  before they expand further and spin out of control, truly creating a widespread  worrisome atmosphere.

<title>As I See It: Britain’s nightmare post-election scenario</title>
<date>30/4/2015</date>
<content>
In the run-up to next week’s UK general election Gulzabeen Afsar, a Conservative  Party candidate in the simultaneous local council election in Derby, wrote on  her Facebook page about the Labor Party leader Ed Miliband: “Never ever will I  drop that low and support the Al Yahud!” Al Yahud is Arabic for “the  Jew.”Ms. Afsar was promptly suspended by the Conservative Party. The  affair caused a few ripples. A number of people expressed shock at such a  comment. People in Britain regularly express their shock and amazement at the  increasingly common displays of outright Jew-hatred.




One wonders just how  many more such outbursts must occur to stop them being so amazed.It  never occurs to them that the tsunami of anti-Israel bigotry which has swamped  Britain these past 15 years and more has legitimized ever-more brazen  expressions of Jew-hatred. On the contrary, people in Britain tend to think that  anti-Jew stuff has nothing to do with anti-Israel stuff. Since so many Jews are  hostile to Israel or Zionism, they chorus, this can’t possibly be anti-Jew, can  it? I suspect that Ed Miliband himself makes precisely this distinction. For the  Labor leader, who is himself a Jew, is in effect deeply anti-Israel.
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}Not  that he would characterize his position in this way. Indeed, in this week’s  Jewish Chronicle he claims once again to be “a strong friend of  Israel.”This even though he damned Israel’s Gaza war last summer as  “wrong and unjustifiable.” Since that war was driven entirely by the need to  halt the thousands of attacks intended to murder as many Israelis as possible,  Miliband was effectively damning Israel for defending itself.If this is  a “strong friend,” you can’t help wonder what an enemy would do. Miliband says  he is committed to providing security for Israel. But how can this possibly  square with vilifying it for defending itself? Miliband’s position draws upon  the systematic lies and distortions deployed in the campaign of delegitimization  intended to bring about the end of Israel. In the Gaza war, for example,  Israel’s military strikes achieved a far lower ratio of civilian casualties than  any other armed force has ever achieved. Yet in the demonology of the Left,  Israelis have been vilified as willful child-killers. It is this monstrous libel  to which Miliband effectively subscribes.Others in political life  similarly claim to be Israel’s friends but in fact hang it out to dry. So what  is the explanation for this two-faced approach? The starting point is that such  people cannot admit to having some kind of problem with the very existence of  Israel, because they are aware this is indefensible. So they pretend there is a  solution to the Middle East impasse which Israel is unreasonably frustrating. In  this way, they can line up Israel as the fall-guy while pretending their own  hands are clean.But they can only do this if they deny all the evidence  of history and law. So they eagerly subscribe to the revision of history in  which the Arab war of extermination has been rewritten as Israel’s oppression of  the Palestinians.For some Jews who have a troubled or shriveled  connection to their Jewish ancestry, this twisted narrative fulfills another  function.It enables them to hang on to the bits that drape them in the  mantle of unchallengeable moral virtue – i.e., identifying with the victims of  the Holocaust – while repudiating Jewish religion or peoplehood, the dimensions  which risk jeopardizing their embrace by non-Jewish society.This is  surely where Miliband is coming from. He and his brother David were brought up  by Marxist Jews who, by all accounts, taught them precious little about Judaism  and who were reflexively anti-Zionist.Having apparently realized only a  few years ago the extent to which their family had suffered in the Holocaust,  the brothers appear to have identified with this tragic element of their  identity while dumping the rest of it.However troubling the prospect may  be of such a conflicted prime minister, this is as nothing compared to a  possible nightmare scenario that now looms. No one can predict the outcome of  this most volatile general election, in which the UK Independence Party and the  Scottish Nationalist Party may eat into both the Conservative and Labor vote,  thus depriving either David Cameron or Ed Miliband of an overall  majority.Even if Miliband gains the largest number of seats, in order to  form a government he may have to enter an alliance with the Scottish  nationalists who look set to storm to victory in the vast majority of Scottish  constituencies. And the SNP’s hatred of Israel knows no bounds.The  former SNP leader Alex Salmond presents Israel as committing a never-ending  series of crimes; after the Mavi Marmara incident, when Israeli forces killed  Arab terrorists who tried to lynch them when the Israelis intercepted the boat  which was breaching a maritime exclusion zone, Salmond condemned Israel for “an  atrocity on the high seas.”During last summer’s Gaza war, the SNP’s  Minister for External Affairs and International Development Humza Yousaf called  for an immediate suspension of arms sales to Israel. For two years, Yousaf was  the director of the Scottish Islamic Foundation which supported and hosted  Islamic extremists.The foundation was created by former SNP  parliamentary candidate Osama Saeed, who wrote of the need to reestablish the  Islamic caliphate and supported Islamists such as Anwar al-Awlaki, the extremist  preacher who inspired numerous Muslim terrorists, and Youssef al-Qaradawi, the  spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood who supports human bomb attacks  against Israelis and Americans.Stewart McDonald, an SNP election  candidate for Glasgow South, has described Israel as an “apartheid” state,  backed a boycott and called for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be tried  for war crimes.You get the general idea.Of course it is also  possible that David Cameron may stitch together another coalition. In recent  weeks, he has expressed his shock and concern that some British Jews are now  wondering aloud whether their families have a future in Britain. Doubtless  Cameron’s shock is genuine. He’s a decent enough guy.But it is the  demonization of Israel, unchallenged by British politicians and now running at  epidemic levels throughout the British political and educated classes – and fed  by the Foreign Office, with its false claims that Israel’s occupation and  settlements are “illegal” – that is behind this anti-Jew atmosphere.In  short, the UK’s election alternatives on Israel would seem to be between decent  but ignorant and thus incoherent on the one hand, and poisonous, existentially  agonized and lethal on the other. A no-brainer, you might think – but in a  country where reason itself seems to have taken an extended  vacation.

<title>A yellow star for the Jewish state?</title>
<date>27/6/2015</date>
<content>
PARIS – The world has recently seen a rapid succession of efforts to delegitimize Israel. Earlier this month, the CEO of French telecommunications company Orange declared at a press conference in Cairo his desire to part ways with an American partner that is too closely tied to Israel. In May, Palestinians tried to have the Israeli soccer federation expelled from FIFA. And Britain’s National Union of Students recently approved a resolution supporting boycotts and sanctions against Israel.Meanwhile, a campaign to ban Israeli products has been gaining strength in the United States and Europe.




And then there are the many performers who – following the lead of Brian Eno, Elvis Costello, Vanessa Paradis, Roger Waters and others – wonder out loud whether or not to appear in “occupied Palestine.”None of these developments is, in itself, of great moment. But, taken together, they create a climate – and perhaps form a watershed.

 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}And this is no accident. All of the recent episodes can be traced, more or less directly, to the global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, established in 2005 by 171 Palestinian nongovernmental organizations.So they provide a good occasion to remind those who support this campaign of its true nature.BDS is supposedly a worldwide civil-society movement embodying respect for law, democracy and human rights.If that is true, why target the only country in the region that was founded on those values, and that has continued, for better or worse – and despite a nearly 70-year state of war with its neighbors – to be broadly faithful to them? How is it that these scrupulous humanists have had nothing whatsoever to say about the 200,000 victims of Syrian President Bashar Assad, the crimes of Islamic State, or the massive deportation of Christians from the Plain of Nineveh, to name just a few contemporaneous issues? BDS is an “anti-apartheid” movement, comes the reply, adopting the methods and spirit of Nelson Mandela in South Africa. That sounds splendid. But then, once again, why the focus on Israel? With its multiethnic polity and society – a mix of Western and Eastern Europeans, Americans and Russians, Ethiopians and Turks, Kurds, Iranians and Arabs (17 of whom sit in the Knesset) – Israel is precisely the opposite of an apartheid state.By contrast, in Qatar, whose foundations (together with Saudi think tanks) provide most of the financing for the BDS movement, 95 percent of the labor force consists of Asian non-citizens working in slave-like conditions under the kafala system, which is a close cousin to apartheid.Perhaps the goal is to pressure Israel to conclude a peace deal with the Palestinians, which surely is worth a little accommodation with Qatar. In that case, it is a peculiar peacemaking strategy that puts pressure on only one of the belligerents, and that, instead of strengthening the hand of the many Israelis who favor negotiation, imposes collective punishment in the form of exclusion from the community of nations.Only one real formula for peace exists, and everyone knows it. That formula, enshrined in the Oslo Accords, is the two-state solution. One has only to read the declarations of Omar Barghouti, Ali Abunimah and other promoters of the BDS movement to see that this solution is precisely what they do not want. They prefer a “onestate solution” (Abunimah’s term) – under a Palestinian flag, of course.Is this just a detail that can be safely ignored on the grounds that BDS targets “only” the territories, the Jewish settlements being built there, and the goods that the settlers produce? This is another sucker trap.Here, too, it is enough to read the movement’s founding declaration of July 9, 2005, which specifies that one of its “three objectives” is to “protect” the “rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194.” In fact and in law, that would amount to establishing on those lands a new Arab country that could be counted on, in short order, to undergo an ethnic cleansing that would make it judenfrei.And, finally, how can I refrain from reminding those whose memory is as full of holes as their thinking that the idea of boycotting Israel is not as new as it appears? In fact, it is older than the Jewish state, having emerged on December 2, 1945, from a decision by the Arab League, which then wasted no time in relying on that decision to reject the United Nations’ dual resolution to establish two states. Among the promoters of this brilliant idea were Nazi war criminals who had settled in Syria and Egypt, where they gave their new masters lessons in marking Jewish shops and businesses.A comparison is not an argument. And the meaning of a slogan does not reside entirely in its genealogy. But words do have a history. As do debates. And it is better to know that history, if we wish to avoid repeating its ugliest scenes.The truth is that the BDS movement is nothing more than a sinister caricature of the anti-totalitarian and anti-apartheid struggles. It is a campaign whose instigators have no aim other than to discriminate against, delegitimize and vilify an Israel that in their mind never stopped wearing its yellow star.To activists of good faith who may have been taken in by duplicitous representations of the movement, I would say only that there are too many noble causes in need of assistance to allow oneself to be enlisted in a dubious one.
Those worthy causes include fighting the jihadist decapitators, saving the women and girls enslaved by Boko Haram, defending the Middle East’s imperiled Christians and Arab democrats, and, of course, striving for a just peace between Israelis and Palestinians.

<title>Better Energy: Divesting from oil, Jewishly</title>
<date>12/2/2015</date>
<content>
The  Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Funds – the largest in the world – took part in two  momentous events last week that I hope will ripple worldwide, including among  the Jewish community’s estimated $50 billion in endowments, pensions and other  investments.The first is a decision to divest from companies involved in  coal and tar sands, because they want their investments to be consistent with  their values and these fossil fuels are some of the worst offenders when it  comes to climate change.




Second, they helped cut the ribbon on East  Africa’s first commercial-scale solar field, where they invested equity and will  receive a solid return for the next 25 years. (Disclosure: I am associated with  the solar field.) Global Divestment Day from Fossil Fuels is today, Friday, with  Israel and the Jewish community conspicuously absent. (See gofossilfree.org)  Christian pension and other funds are used to investing their billions according  to their values, often filtering out companies that are involved in tobacco,  firearms or abortions. And now the World Council of Churches, representing half  a billion Christians, is pulling its money out of fossil-fuel companies. And  there is a campaign by Catholics to have the Vatican divest from oil.The  Jewish community funds barely blinked during the divestment against apartheid  South Africa, and only sometimes screen for those few companies that comply with  the Arab boycott of Israel.Astoundingly, “drill-baby-drill” companies  are found in nearly every investment portfolio of the Jewish community without  any moral qualms. This is also true for Jewish foundations that  philanthropically give to environmental groups.The environmental groups  in Israel that successfully fought back against oil shale in Emek Ha’ela  received grants from foundations whose portfolios include fossil fuels. I am not  railing against possible hypocrisy, since it was not known, either by the donors  or the recipients. But it is time for members of the Jewish Funders Network,  that are holding their international convention in Israel next month, to  voluntarily undergo fossil fuel audits of their investments and consider moving  their capital to be aligned with their noble missions.The planet can  tolerate a warming of up to 2 degrees Centigrade and all energy policy and  investment should be viewed through that prism. Yet the known oil, gas and coal  reserves of the planet are five times past the 2-degree mark; meaning, we have  to leave 80 percent of our carbon fuels in the ground and make the switch to  renewables as fast as possible.Low oil prices help deter further  expensive exploration. Effective divestment can further discourage opening up  carbon- based wells and mines if it makes capital harder to come by or more  expensive.Maintaining investment in traditional energy companies is  could lower the value of endowment portfolios, since the hyped valuation of many  of these companies is based on in-the-ground resources that may, with  international action, have to stay underground.And while the Jewish  community is very philanthropic when it comes to Israel, Jewish communal funds  as a rule do not invest in Israel, except for the nearly obligatory and  low-performing Israel Bonds. Yet the Greater Miami Jewish Federation, along with  nearly a dozen others, has invested modest amounts in the Blue Star Index, which  is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. I hope that every federation will  follow suit. But overall, there is only symbolic investment in Israeli companies  by the Jewish community and foundation endowment funds.We not only  ignore our values when it comes to investments by Jewish community endowments,  we even go against them.Most members of the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries are autocratic states and hostile to Israel and in bed with  Exxon/Mobil, Chevron and all the rest. We send solidarity missions to Sderot  during rocket attacks, but never think about the ultimate source of the Hamas  funding. We worry about the spread of Islamic fundamentalism, ignoring the fact  that Saudi Arabia’s Wahhabis finance Islamic centers around the world that  spread hate and intolerance.We hear the Israeli prime minister pledge a  world without oil, yet the Israeli-Iranian joint venture, the Eilat-Ashkelon  Pipeline, spilled 5 million liters of crude in the pristine Arava in December  and continues to operate unregulated.Do we even know who is buying oil  from Islamic State and are we sure that Jewish communal dollars aren’t invested  directly or indirectly in those largely Asian companies that finance its  brutality? Rabbis last week gave beautiful sermons on Tu Bishvat and  sustainability, but don’t know and don’t seem to care if their pension funds and  the endowments of their seminaries are invested in greedy companies destroying  God’s creation.Imagine: This shmita year, every board of every Jewish  communal fund should meet to divest from fossil fuels, and move those available  funds to invest at least 18% of their portfolio in Israeli for-profit social and  environmental ventures, and in for-profit endeavors that promote economic  development and renewable energy in emerging markets to help the world’s poorest  people. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund – whose source was originally Standard Oil  – have figured out how to do that, as have 50 other leading US foundations. The  Jewish community has no more excuses. Julie Hammerman, of the JLens Investor  Network, is launching the first Jewish values-based mutual fund.Truth be  told, the Jewish community has let our fear of divestment going mainstream  against Israel prevent us from promoting our values and being part of the  multi-faith solution to climate change and global economic and social  development.This is morally lazy; we have the intelligence and resources  to fight unjust BDS while promoting justice in our portfolios.Just prior  to the Jewish Funders Network conference, Israel will host its first Impact  Investment conference, which will create a network of investors who seek not  only to do well but also to do good, based on Jewish values. The moral fiction  of donors doing good but investing amorally or immorally can finally be  rectified in favor of our community’s highest ethical values while also creating  financial value.If the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Funds have figured out  how to provide healthy and ethical returns, so should we.

<title>Borderline Views: Boycott hysteria</title>
<date>8/6/2015</date>
<content>
When the Ben-Gurion Institute at the Sde Boker campus of Ben-Gurion University  asked me to deliver a lecture relating to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions  (BDS) movement and boycotts in general some six months ago, the organizers could  not have foreseen that today’s presentation would take place at the back end of  what has probably been the busiest week in years for boycott-related matters and  headlines.In the space of the past 10 days we have witnessed the attempt  by the Palestinian football federation to ban Israel from world soccer, a motion  passed by the national student executive in the UK in favor of boycotting any  joint activities with their Israeli counterparts, and the statements by the CEO  of the Orange International cellular phone company in support of withdrawing its  activities from Israel.




From sport to academia to commerce, the BDS  attempts have covered the spectrum of society. The government, the heads of the  universities, along with the self-appointed defenders of Israel in the Diaspora,  have woken up about five years too late, but the amount of noise they have made  in the space of a few short days has certainly compensated for their lack of  action.The small group of faculty who, year after year, proposed boycott  motions to the UCU in the UK, achieving almost no success whatsoever beyond the  headlines afforded them by those who oppose them, must be rubbing their hands in  glee at the victory they have achieved this past week – thanks to the hysterical  and totally disproportional responses on the part of the Israeli government and  Jewish leaders. BDS and boycotts have become the main topics conversation at the  weekly cabinet meeting, at the Herzliya Conference and at the Jerusalem Post  Conference in New York.Some of these have been nothing short of  hysterical.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has likened it to a new  strategic threat facing Israel and has called for the establishment of a unity  government. Chairman of the Labor Party Isaac Herzog has described it as a new  intifada facing Israel. A noted right-wing journalist Ben-Dror Yemini, in an  article entitled “Churchill was right,” has gone as far as comparing the  situation to that which took place in Germany in the 1930s.The  government is prepared to sink NIS 100 million into combating BDS, to be  coordinated by Minister of Strategic Affairs Gilad Erdan. Two of the world’s  wealthiest supporters of Israel – Sheldon Adelson and Haim Saban – have put  together their own private enterprise version, bringing together like-minded  Jewish organizational leaders for a weekend of planning and fund raising in Las  Vegas, aimed at bolstering the counter-boycott activities on American campuses  where, it would appear, the threat is far greater than anywhere in  Europe.But the fact remains that Israel was not ousted from FIFA, even  though the establishment of a committee to monitor Israel’s activities within  this sphere was far removed from the victory which the Netanyahu government has  blindly declared. The motion passed by the UK student union has almost no impact  or significance other than the headlines accorded it by our responsive Israeli  media. This was made clear in the statement of Universities UK, the umbrella  authority of all of Britain’s universities, that they are totally opposed to any  form of academic or scientific boycott and actively seek to strengthen and  promote Israeli- UK scientific cooperation. And the CEO of Orange, Stephane  Richard, appears to have no actual opinion of his own, quickly backtracking on  his pro-BDS statements, made at a press conference in Cairo, and now preparing  to visit Israel to make a public apology.And despite the many cries of  academics, there is no strong empirical evidence that their papers are not being  accepted for publication or that they are not being invited to participate in  conferences or sit on editorial boards because they are Israeli. Beyond the few  incidents that do occur (and we should deal with these with all the severity  that they deserve) it has now become a new mantra for academics whose promotions  or tenure are delayed because their research and publications records are not  yet deemed good enough to start blaming it on the boycott.Israel  continues to compete in the major soccer tournaments, Israel’s universities  continue to enjoy strong, and even growing, academic and scientific links with  their UK and European partners, while Israel’s commercial links in the field of  technology and satellite communications remain among the most developed in the  world and would not have suffered any major setback even if Orange had  unilaterally abrogated its contracts.While forced withdrawal from the  corrupt FIFA organization would have prevented a great deal of continued  heartache for the country’s sports fans, we can be proud of the country’s high  scientific and start-up credentials, second to none on the face of the globe.  The Youtube video which has been circulating for some years, advising all pro  boycotters to stop using any goods or medical devices invented by Israeli  R&D, is as true as it is humorous – the world has a great deal to thank this  small country for in its disproportional contribution to technological and  scientific development.Even those few individuals or small companies  that actually withdraw their support from the country or don’t attend a  scientific conference in Israel are quickly replaced with the many other  potential partners in Europe, North America and the growing Asian arena who are  only too happy to do business with one of the world’s leading scientific and  high tech societies.There is no comparison whatsoever to be drawn  between South Africa in the 1960s and 1970s with what is happening in Israel  today. In the case of South Africa there was global support, not just by trade  unions, sports teams and student unions, but by most governments, for a blanket  boycott of the country because of its racist and apartheid  policies.Ironically, the attempt to boycott Israel has resulted in a  host of government leaders, heads of universities and other public figures  coming out with strong anti-boycott declarations, when otherwise they would have  remained silent. It has also spurred on a host of new collaborative scientific  projects between Israeli scientists and universities throughout the world which  may not have materialized under normal circumstances.Western governments  have been unanimous in condemning all new manifestation of anti-Semitism. It  demonstrates clearly the different environment in which Israel operates today as  contrasted with the false and hysterical comparisons with Germany of the 1930s  or South Africa of the 1960s and 1970s.Instead of the current hysteria,  what we need is a measured and realistic response which takes account of a  multitude of factors, and not just those which are convenient for the political  discourse of the present government.While recognizing that BDS is  fertile ground for the anti-Semites and the Israel delegitimizers of the world,  we cannot use the argument of anti-Semitism as an excuse for avoiding other  relevant issues. We cannot dismiss the Palestinian issue as though it has become  totally irrelevant.To simply repeat the mantra that it is all about  anti-Semitism is as simplistic and detached from reality as it is to say that  anti-Semitism does not play any role in BDS and that anti-Semites are not  manipulating the critique of Israel’s policies to introduce their own sick minds  into the process.To create a hysteria that Israel faces an existential  security threat from BDS, when for every one who wishes to boycott us there are  20 top scholars and high tech companies waiting to take their place, is equally  detached from reality and only causes demoralization among those Israelis who  rely entirely on the Israeli press and media for their version of world  events.To compare the current situation to that faced by the Jews and  Europe in the 1930s is akin to denying the very existence of a strong and  sovereign Israel which is capable of looking after itself and its diverse  interests throughout the world. Such an attitude reeks of a Diaspora mentality  which still hasn’t come to terms with the existence of Israel and plays into the  very hands of the boycotters and the sort of headlines they wish to create. It  is the “nebbich” mentality which has no place in contemporary Israel, as much as  some Diaspora leaders would like us to think otherwise.If and when we do  ever resolve the conflict and the painful issue of the occupation, only then  will we ever really assess the extent to which the attempt to boycott and  isolate Israel is about delegitimization and crude anti-Semitism. Only when we  remove the single major problem facing Israel vis a vis the international  community will we ever be able to gauge the structural change in world opinion  and the depths to which the “new” anti-Semitism has taken hold of feelings  toward Israel.

<title>Borderline Views: Get out and vote!</title>
<date>9/3/2015</date>
<content>
The result of next week’s elections will be determined by the  level of voter participation. There has been a significant decrease in voter  turnout during the past decade, sinking to a low of 69 percent three years ago.  This in a country where everyone used to be interested in politics, where every  taxi driver could deliver a lecture on what and who should be running the  country, and where Friday night dinners were the scene of long and heated  political discussions and arguments.Until 15 years ago, Israel had some  of the highest participation rates in the world, close to 90%. The only other  democratic countries that surpassed that figure were those where voting was  required by law, under penalty of fine. Compared with the United States or the  United Kingdom, where participation barely reaches 50% and sometimes falls below  this figure, 69% turnout is still relatively high. But compared to the situation  in Israel until 20 years ago, we are witnessing a continuous decline in the  number of people exercising their democratic right to vote.




Despite all  the noise, the media adverts and the mass rallies taking place at this very  moment, there are no indications that this figure will increase next week,  although surveys do indicate that they will not decrease any further.Ask  people in the street whether they listen to the political debates on radio and  TV, the election adverts or even the Netanyahu speeches at AIPAC and in the  Congress, and most will tell you that they have better things to do.
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}How  do we account for these falling participation rates in a country where the  Israel-Palestine conflict and the growing regional threat have heightened,  rather than decreased, in intensity? Either you believe that the creation of a  Palestinian state and a withdrawal from the occupied territories will be  suicidal and bring about an end of the Jewish state (a la Benjamin Netanyahu,  Naftali Bennett and Avigdor Liberman), or you believe that the continuation of  occupation will eventually bring about demographic parity between Jews and Arabs  resulting in either an apartheid or single binational state, the end of the  Jewish democratic state (a la Isaac Herzog, Tzipi Livni and Zehava  Gal-On).The existential nature of these two diametrically opposed  positions, both of which seek to ensure the long-term survival of the State of  Israel have, in the past, resulted in high electoral turnout on election  day.Not only has this basic dilemma not changed, it has become even more  entrenched in recent years. So how do we account for this significant fall in  participation, and why are there no indications that this will change in any big  way in next week’s elections? Talking with many of my students and neighbors,  people with a high degree of political awareness, I hear the following messages  about what concerns them in contemporary Israel.First of all, there is a  growing and general apathy toward politics and politicians.The increase  in the number of senior politicians who have been indicted for various offenses,  including a former president (Moshe Katzav) in prison for rape, a former prime  minister (Ehud Omert) on his way to prison for financial fraud and a former  chief rabbi (Yona Metzger) who will soon be on trial for financial  improprieties, has only served to lower the already negative image of  politicians in the eyes of the public. Political leaders currently standing for  reelection to the most senior of positions, Prime Minister Netanyahu and Foreign  Minister Liberman (along with other Knesset members from Liberman’s Yisrael  Beytenu party) are also under police investigation.Simply put, the  people do not trust their elected leaders, and do not see them as representing  their values and norms – and certainly not as having the right to tell them how  to behave and lead their lives.Many potential voters do not believe  that, regardless of who is elected, there will be any solution to the political  or the economic problems facing the country at present. They do not see  charismatic leadership, nor do they really believe that things will change  significantly, whoever becomes the country’s next prime minister. They are tired  of Netanyahu, but do not necessarily see an alternative charismatic leader who  could command the respect of the people and put clear and fresh ideas on the  table.Many of those who voted for the “third way” of Yesh Atid just  three years ago no longer see a failed finance minister, Yair Lapid, as a  potential alternative.Three years ago they voted for the new party  which, they believed, offered some hope of social and economic change, but Lapid  has proved to be a major disappointment. This time round, there is no new  magical third party, and given the fact that the Zionist Union is as much  centrist as it is left-wing, there is no vacant space on the political continuum  for such a party to develop.Comparative data from many other countries  shows that having a public holiday on election day does not guarantee higher  participation rates.Most countries no longer have a public holiday  because of the impact on the economy, although they do guarantee the rights of  every worker to take time out during the day to go and vote. Many respondents,  especially those who have limited vacation time from their jobs during the year,  take the day out to holiday with their families, rather than spend the time in a  long line waiting for their turn to vote.Most surveys show that the  lower the participation rate, the greater the impact on the left-wing parties.  In many countries this is because the blue-collar workers prefer to spend the  time with their families, but this does not necessarily explain the Israeli  situation where, ever since the days of Menachem Begin, the poorer groups in  society have voted for the Likud or, more recently, for sectoral parties,  notably Shas.In Israel, the decline in voter participation has impacted  parties on the Left for different reasons. Much of the middle class has become  disaffected with the Labor Party and, more recently, has also turned away from  Meretz, which is increasingly seen as being out of touch with the issues facing  a country in which public opinion has moved from the Left to the center, and  from the center to the Right, during the past decade.Within the Arab  sector there has also been a significant decrease in voter participation among a  younger, educated generation of voters who have become disillusioned with a  country where they see themselves as second- class citizens, and with a  leadership which continues to control the destiny of the Palestinians without  offering any real solutions aimed at ending the occupation.Based on  recent polls and the atmosphere at Saturday night’s demonstration in Tel Aviv,  there is a feel in the air that real change could take place next week. Growing  dissatisfaction with Netanyahu even among his own ranks, and the attempt to  reclaim the Zionist mantle by Herzog and his reincarnated Labor Party following  a decade in which the term “Zionism” has been hijacked by parties of the Right,  has made the results of this election more open and uncertain than any recent  campaign.But for change to happen, people must get out and vote. The  more people that vote, the more chance there is for some real change to begin to  take place. This is not a time for vacationing, nor is it a time for  intellectual questioning. No post-election excuse or complaint can be justified  by anyone who did not go out to vote – even if they are not convinced that the  current parties or their leaders offer solutions to the complex problems facing  the state.This is the name of the game and anyone who wants to see  change take place must exercise their democratic right to vote.

<title>Borderline Views: Winds of change felt by UK Jewry</title>
<date>16/2/2015</date>
<content>
Two very contrasting events will be taking place in the UK this coming week.  Taken together they are indicative of the internal dilemmas and soul searching  which is being faced by the Anglo-Jewish community as it experiences a period of  questioning concerning its present and future status.Starting next  Sunday, Jewish Book Week will host a myriad of cultural and literary events and  panel discussions, focusing on books which have been published during the past  year on topics related to Jews, Judaism and Israel and other topics by prominent  Jewish authors. Following less than two months after the impressive Limmud  conference, Jewish Book Week has, during the past decade, become transformed  into a major cultural and intellectual experience. Different in nature to  Limmud, one complements the other as evidence of the internal dynamism of the  Anglo Jewish community and the thirst for knowledge, discussion and debate in  the very best of Jewish traditions. Almost all of its events are sold out in  advance, as a diverse and heterogeneous audience come to hear authors and  speakers, some of whom have come from as far afield as North America or Israel  to present their latest literary or research achievements.




At precisely  the same time, universities and other institutions throughout the country will  host Israel Apartheid Week which, according to its website, is an international  series of events that seeks to raise awareness about Israel’s apartheid policies  toward the Palestinians and to build support for the growing Boycott, Divestment  and Sanctions (BDS) campaign. The so called charity “War on Want” supports this  struggle for “justice, freedom and equality” by offering students for Israel  “apartheid” week an “Apartheid Wall” display which includes four  cardboard/paper-mache guns measuring 1.5 meters each.This follows on  other events which have been taking place around the country, such as a  three-day international law conference at the University of Southampton to  examine the “legality, validity and legitimacy” of the State of Israel, a  much-publicized appearance of Norman Finkelstein at a seminar convened by the  International Relations Society and Friends of Palestine at the University of  Warwick, and a hostile reception received by Israel’s excellent ambassador to  the UK, Daniel Taub, at the prestigious London School of Economics, all within a  very short space of time. On Sunday it was announced that 700 British artists  had pledged to boycott Israel.This is of concern to a Jewish community  which prides itself on its Zionist affiliations and its support of Israel. The  present UK chief rabbi, Efraim Mirvis, essentially a religious leader, has  stressed the importance of Israel to Jewish identity and has already, in the  short space of 18 months in office, led a number of missions of both rabbis and  lay leaders to Israel, to gain knowledge and to strengthen the links between the  two communities.The idea that Jewish identity is detached from attitudes  toward, and support of, Israel – as has been argued by some fringe elements – is  nonsensical.One does not have to support specific policies or actions of  the Israeli government to make one’s concern for, and support of, the State of  Israel any less legitimate. Just this past weekend I was witness to an amazing  show of support for young Israelis who had experienced trauma during their army  service and, as part of the programs organized by the Herzog Center for Trauma  in Jerusalem, were hosted by one of the leading Orthodox synagogues in London,  St. Johns Wood, for a week of events and therapy in the UK.For members  of the synagogue, holding a wide range of views concerning Israel and its  policies, arranging and organizing this week-long event, at no small expense,  was an integral part of their Jewish identity. One could feel the pride that  members of the community felt for these young men who, ostensibly with little in  common in terms of their daily life practices or religious behavior, were  present in their synagogue and taking part in their Shabbat morning service.  Each came out strengthened by the mutual support shown and demonstrated by the  other. Being Jewish and supportive of Israel were intricately bound up with each  other.The annual report of the Community Security Trust which monitors  anti-Semitism and provides security for community institutions and events points  to a significant rise in the incidence of anti-Semitic events throughout the UK.  While the community is self-assured and self-confident and enjoys the support of  the government and the police authorities, the sorts of questions which are  being raised by some leading community figures are evidence of a an uncertainty  which has probably not been experienced since the pre-World War II days and the  fascism of Oswald Mosley.None of this was helped by the fact that last  week a major political debate broke out between the head of the Labour Party and  contender for prime minister at the forthcoming national elections, Ed Miliband,  and a senior figure in the Conservative Party, former party treasurer and now  member of the House of Lords, Lord Stanley Fink, concerning the morality and  ethics of avoiding tax payments, even when it is done within the framework of  the law.While it was not openly stated as such in the mass media  coverage of this bitter political exchange between two leading public figures,  the fact that both are Jews made most people around the Shabbat table  uncomfortable. It was felt that there was an anti-Semitic undertone to the  public debate about two Jews who had achieved positions of prominence in the  world of politics (Miliband) and finance (Fink), disproportionate to their  overall representation within the British population.A survey published  last week showed that most Britons believed there to be some five million Jews  in the UK, although the real number, which has declined significantly during the  past 30 years largely due to assimilation, along with migration elsewhere  including Israel, is no more than an estimated 260,000-280,000 people. It is a  community which, during the past century, has indeed excelled in almost all  fields of British life, from politics, to education, from media to law, and from  public service to the philanthropic, arts and culture. There is almost no walk  of life in which members of the Jewish community, most of them second- or  third-generation immigrants from persecution and poverty, have striven upwards,  worked hard and made their mark on British society, despite their relatively  small numbers. Their contribution to British life is something which has been  rightly praised by national leaders of all political persuasions, from Margaret  Thatcher on the far Right to Tony Blair as leader of the Labour  Party.But it is ironic that while there are those who will not vote for  Miliband because he is Jewish, there are also many Jews who will not do so,  despite a tradition of voting for socialist parties who care for the poor and  the underprivileged, because they prefer not to see a Jew as the scapegoat of  failed policies and/or because of the fact that Miliband is, in their eyes,  over-critical of Israel.There are those, including this writer, who are  not always prepared to attribute all incidents of anti-Semitism to criticism of  Israel and its policies vis a vis the Palestinians. But there can be no doubt  that the borders between the two are becoming increasingly blurred as many  anti-Israel activities and demonstrations are becoming overtly anti-Semitic in  nature, and are resulting in attacks on Jewish institutions and individuals. It  has not reached the level which we are witnessing in France – and ironically it  is because of this that many French Jews have been moving to the UK in recent  years, such that there are now French-speaking Sephardi synagogues and a demand  for French-language education in some of the Jewish day schools – but there are  those who are looking through the Eurostar tunnel at what is happening in France  and raising questions concerning what may happen in the UK a few years down the  road.Equally there are many community leaders and prominent  personalities who are not prepared to become engulfed in what they see as an  atmosphere of paranoia. While they accept the fact that there is more  anti-Israel and anti-Jewish sentiment than in the past, they do not see this as  any way threatening the longer-term stability and dynamism of the  community.They accuse some of the community institutions as whipping up  a threat over and beyond that which really exists, and they are particularly  scathing with regard to some Israeli leaders and media whom, they believe, do  not serve the best interests of Diaspora communities by taking it upon  themselves to speak out on behalf of Jews everywhere and are using the situation  on the ground as a justification for trying to influence them, largely  unsuccessfully, to pack up their belongings and come home to a “safe and secure”  Israel.The debate within the community was reflected in two columns  which appeared in last week’s Jewish Chronicle, the major media outlet of the UK  Jewish community. Two well known Jewish personalities, both of whom are known  for the rightof- center and neo-con views concerning Israel, the Palestinians  and the perceived “Muslim threat” to Western society, columnist Melanie Phillips  and academic Geoffrey Alderman, posited alternative views on whether Jews should  start selling up and moving to Israel. Philips was adamant that there is no  future for Jews in the UK, while Alderman argued that there was no need to  panic, although he did suggest that if certain legislation, such as the  potential banning of kosher slaughter, were to go ahead in the future, he would  have to reconsider his position.When we grew up in the UK of the 1960s,  there was no need for security personnel at the gates of every synagogue or  Jewish school. Beyond the very occasional and rare anti-Semitic slur by a member  of the public, there was never any problem in walking the streets, riding the  public transport or attending a Jewish or Israel society event at university  with a kippa on one’s head and advertising one’s own ethnic and religious  affiliation. For many this is still the case and I cannot say that I, or my many  other Israeli colleagues, who undertake joint research and teaching, and guest  lectures, at UK universities have experienced the sort of mob rule experienced  by the ambassador last week, when we appear as bona fide Israeli academics with  the title of our Israeli universities on the websites and posters advertising  our lectures.UK universities are, mostly, places which are welcoming to  top scientists and academics as they jointly seek to pursue joint research and  teaching agendas, despite the attempts by some faculty and some students groups  to prevent this from happening.But neither can one be blind or naïve  about the events taking place, and due to which many are fearful. Increasingly  Jewish students on campus are made to feel uncomfortable at holding Jewish- or  Israel-related events and, in some cases, have been subject to verbal attacks  aimed at preventing their activities from taking place.The community is  strong in its institutions (of which there are far too many) and feels confident  in its ability to stand up for itself. It is aware that while anti-Israel  activities and anti-Semitism are not always one and the same thing and should  not always be seen as such, there is a blurring of the borders between the two  and they have increasingly been taking on the same mantle. They are not over  pleased about Israeli leaders who speak in their name and, on some occasions, do  them more harm than good – while at the same time holding opening the doors to  what they present as the “safe bolt hole,” as though that is all what Israel is  about.Nor are they prepared, under any circumstance, to accept the more  radical critique of their position that they are as blind to what is happening  in the UK as the proud and self-assured Jewish community in Germany was when  Hitler came to power in the early 1930s. They reject any such comparison out of  hand, if only because in the case of Britain today, the government and the  police authorities stand firmly behind them and are partners in their fight  against racism, hate crimes and anti-Semitism, unlike Germany where it was the  government and the police authorities who were the instigators of the  anti-Jewish discrimination.I do not believe that the long-term future of  this small but dynamic and vibrant community is in danger. I would like to see  more of my British compatriots join me in Israel, not because they’re escaping  anti-Semitism but because they believe that Israel is a place where a Jewish  life can be fulfilled in a way which is impossible in the Diaspora – and that is  equally true for those who are critical of particular Israeli government  policies as those that support them blindly. It should be even more true for  religious communities, for whom settling in Israel is often the one part of  religious practice which is all too conveniently set aside.
But the winds  of change in Albion are here for all to see, and while members of the community  should not be over paranoid about the situation, seeking anti-Semites under  every stone and behind every bush, neither can they sit in self-complacency (as  indeed many of Germany’s Jews did in the early stages of the third Reich) as  though business is normal.

<title>Canada's embassy belongs in Jerusalem</title>
<date>24/1/2015</date>
<content>
On Sunday, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird received a stately welcome in Jerusalem, where he held a press conference with his Israeli counterpart before scheduled meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Reuven Rivlin.Later in Ramallah, the contrast could not have been starker, when some one hundred protesters attacked Baird’s convoy with eggs and shoes. All the while, heavily armed Palestinian forces, whose salaries are partially financed by Canadian taxpayer dollars, made no effort to protect Ottawa’s top diplomat.




This is what some $650 million in aid to the Palestinians over two decades has bought the people of Canada.The ostensible reason for the violent demonstration is the Canadian administration’s support for Israel. Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s government has unquestionably become the Jewish state’s most steadfast and outspoken ally, having most recently forcefully denounced both the Palestinians’ statehood initiative at the UN Security Council and any subsequent accession to the International Criminal Court. In 2012, Canada was among the few countries that voted against the Palestinian bid to become a non-member state at the United Nations General Assembly.As such, top PLO official Saeb Erekat fanned the flames prior to Baird’s visit, demanding an apology for the foreign minister’s decision to, of all things, hold meetings with Israeli officials in east Jerusalem last year.“We regret the Canadian government’s decision to stand on the wrong side of history by blindly supporting the Israeli occupation and its apartheid policies,” Erekat said in a statement, oblivious to the irony that the “affront” in question saw Baird visit the Israeli Justice Ministry, headed by none other than lead peace negotiator Tzipi Livni, a known proponent of dividing Jerusalem.Whether Erekat’s words provoked the ensuing rioting cannot be determined; it is, however, undeniable that Baird should not have been in Ramallah in the first place.He had no chance of persuading the Palestinians to stop waging their diplomatic war against Israel, surely the main point of the visit, as evidenced by the previous, humiliating failure of the US to do so.Baird should have conveyed his displeasure by forgoing the trip altogether but, given the course of events, the time has come for more than silent protest.Prior to meeting with Baird, Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman announced that Israel would begin lobbying ICC member-states, including Canada, to cut funding for the tribunal. Ottawa should accede to the request, which would parallel Washington’s decision to temporarily suspend contributions to UNESCO after it accepted “Palestine” as a member in 2011.Netanyahu aptly described the ICC’s launch of a preliminary war crimes investigation as “absurd.” He debunked the lead prosecutor’s definitive declaration of “Palestine” as a state and pointed out the sheer insanity of charges being levied against the Middle East’s lone democracy by the Hamas terror organization and its unity partner, Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah party.It would likewise not be unreasonable for Canada to halt direct aid to the Palestinians. I previously described in these pages the gross waste such funding constitutes, further arguing that Ramallah has never upheld its end of the Oslo bargain and therefore should not be privy to any financial largesse. But perhaps it is time to change tack.Instead of penalizing the Palestinians, Ottawa should instead move to reward Israel for its commitment to peace, as evidenced by the many concessions it continues to make despite receiving only unrelenting terrorism in return.Simply put, Canada should move its embassy to Jerusalem.While controversial, the embassy could be relocated comfortably within the 1947 lines, so as to limit the expected fallout and not be perceived as “prejudging” the anyways non-existent peace negotiations. In reality, such a move would simply be a statement of the obvious; namely that Jerusalem, whatever its future borders, will always remain the capital of Israel.It would nevertheless be a powerful demonstration of support for democracy over terrorism, a monumental gesture by a resolute ally and a clear message to the Palestinians they will be held accountable for their actions.There is also precedent for the move.In The Domestic Battleground: Canada and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, David Taras and David H. Goldberg describe thenprime ministerial candidate Joe Clark’s election promise to move the Canadian embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.As leader of Canada’s Progressive Conservative party, on April 25, 1979, he proclaimed, “Next year in Jerusalem is a Jewish prayer which we intend to make a Canadian reality.”After being voted into office, Clark reaffirmed the intention in his first official press conference, only to backtrack three weeks later by deferring the move by one year. Ultimately, on October 29, 1979, he announced no action would be taken “until the status of Jerusalem is clarified within a comprehensive agreement between Israel and her Arab neighbors.”Electoral concerns aside, Clark pushed the initiative as a way of reinforcing peace between Egypt and Israel, a position echoed by none other than former US president Jimmy Carter, a signatory to the accord, during his campaign in 1976.According to Taras and Goldberg, “Clark and his senior advisers [also] considered the transfer of the embassy to be a foreign policy initiative justifiable on historic, moral and especially legal grounds; they were convinced of the justice of the case for moving the embassy.”But it was not to be.First, the terrorist group known as the Palestine Liberation Organization denounced the prospect as “an act of aggression,” whereas the Canada-Arab Federation called it “a declaration of war on 900 million Muslims.” Many Arab nations threatened to boycott Canadian goods and the dollar dipped sharply when the Arab Monetary Fund said it would no longer make deposits in Canadian banks.Clark’s government was simultaneously scoured in the press.While the Harper administration could expect the same from a decisively anti-Israel media, times have changed.No longer fresh in people’s minds is the 1973 Arab oil embargo that crippled the North American economy. In fact, the Arab world today is in utter turmoil, divided along sectarian lines, a far cry from the once demonstrated unity.Moreover, Canada has anyways since transformed itself into a net-energy exporter; its economy, which was largely insulated from the recent global financial crisis, has become more diverse with the ascent of China and other developing nations. It is thus less dependent on Arab markets and could withstand the resultant shocks, assuming sanctions were implemented at all.While some backlash should be expected, overall, the tangible negative consequences would likely be minimal, whereas the positive effects would be significant.As the Palestinians turn justice on its head by pursuing Israel for war crimes at the ICC, moving the Canadian embassy to Jerusalem would reaffirm the West’s immutable moral code, setting an example that would undoubtedly be followed by other countries.It would mark a major shift in a diplomatic paradigm that for two decades has given the Palestinians carte blanche to do as they please without fear of consequences; it would be a first step in countering the delegitimization campaign targeting Israel, which is part and parcel of the renewed tide of anti-Semitism sweeping the globe.In the wake of recent terrorist attacks worldwide, including two in Canada last October, it would send a clear message that the ideology shared by the likes of Hamas and Hezbollah, which seeks the “liberation” of Jerusalem and the rest of Israel, will not be countenanced; it would create the beginnings of a united front against a common, and increasingly emboldened, enemy.Moving the embassy to Jerusalem would cement the legacy of a Canadian government that understands all of this profoundly and which fully appreciates the nature of the growing threats against the Western world and Israel’s unique role as a primary line of defense in an intensifying battle. Mr. Harper, the time has therefore come to right a historical wrong, thereby bringing the physical into synch with the conceptual realities of both contemporary and future geopolitics.

<title>Candidly Speaking: British Jews under pressure</title>
<date>8/12/2015</date>
<content>
Reviewing the status of Anglo Jewry can lead to diametrically opposing  conclusions. Residing in a northwest London Jewish suburb, one can easily be  deluded into thinking that life for Jews in the UK is rosy. Jewish cultural and  religious life is thriving, as exemplified by the mushrooming of synagogues and  kosher facilities, not to mention the highly successful educational initiatives  like Limmud. Indeed, insulated from the outside world and living and socializing  primarily in a Jewish “ghetto,” it is not difficult to convince oneself that  life in this Anglo Jewish Diaspora is almost idyllic.But this picture is  a far cry from the reality. The demographic projections reflect snowballing  intermarriage offset by the high birthrate of the ultra-Orthodox – which will  make them the dominant element in the UK Jewish community within the  not-too-distant future.




More importantly, even though British Jews have  not yet suffered from the bloody jihadi violence as their French counterparts  have, as European Jews they will ultimately face the same threat, and if they  believe they are in a different category, they are in denial.Although  Muslim jihadi elements are currently less dominant in the UK than in France, the  two countries face very similar threats from Islamic State (IS) followers and  homegrown terrorists. Moreover, indigenous anti-Semitism in the form of feral  anti-Israelism is as blatant in the UK as in France.One need only peruse  the vicious anti-Jewish talkbacks to appreciate the extent of the problem. The  media, especially the BBC, effectively incites hatred against Israel by its  biased and distorted reporting, which at best portrays Jewish victims of  terrorism and the perpetrators with moral equivalence and frequently condemns  Israelis for defending themselves.The regular mass support for  anti-Israel demonstrations headed by leftist and human rights groups – for whom  Israel-baiting is considered axiomatic – confirm that hatred of Jews has become  a central feature of the British political system. Some of the banners and  placards at these demonstrations, such as “Jews to the gas,” resemble Nazi  anti-Semitic campaigns.The situation at universities is appalling, with  boycotts being promoted at all levels and pro-Israeli speakers denied the  opportunity of expressing their views and frequently facing violence. This has  led to the intimidation of Jewish students and the exclusion of lectures or  activities relating to Israel.This has led to the atrocious situation in  which cowardly Jewish student leaders even justify their refusal to engage in  pro-Israel advocacy so as to cater to “non-Zionist” members and avoid  confrontation with anti-Israeli student unions.The most shocking  developments are at the parliamentary level, despite the presence of the  pro-Israel Prime Minister David Cameron, who consistently displays friendship  toward Israel. For over 20 years, until Ed Miliband headed the Labour Party, a  tepid but overall bipartisan positive approach toward Israel prevailed. Labour  leaders including Tony Blair proved to be among Israel’s staunchest  supporters.However, the tide has turned as Labour has now elected as its  leader Jeremy Corbyn, who after a visit to the Middle East in 2015 characterized  Israeli policies as “immoral” and “illegal” and related to the genocidal  terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah as his “friends,” insisting they be  recognized as key negotiating partners.Corbyn was accused by the London  Jewish Chronicle and others of links with – and even in one case funding of –  Holocaust deniers, terrorists and outright anti-Semites. In July 2015, Corbyn  described as “a very good friend” the fundamentalist Islamic preacher Ibrahim  Hewitt, who believes apostates and adulterers should be killed and is considered  by the US government as a promoter of Hamas funding.The change in  attitude by the Labour Party toward Jews was recently reflected by an outburst  from the hostile Jewish Sir Gerald Kaufman, a veteran Labour MP who accused the  Conservatives of being influenced by “Jewish money” and claimed that the  stabbing attacks on Israeli civilians were fabricated by the Israelis in order  to “execute Palestinians.” It took a week for Corbyn’s party to respond to  protests and then it merely expressed concern over Kaufman’s obscene remarks but  failed to condemn or censure him.Although opinion polls show that under  Corbyn’s leadership, Labour would be overwhelmingly defeated in an election, the  fact that the alternative party to government could elect such a person should  have sent chills throughout the Jewish community. That is particularly so  because, in these volatile times, unexpected upheavals could bring about the  downfall of the government and the opposition could assume control by  default.The Board of Deputies of British Jews, the representative body  of Anglo Jewry founded over 250 years ago, today finds itself in a difficult  position. It is vastly underfunded and understaffed to cope adequately with the  complex challenges facing the community.In recent years, its leaders  have been subject to major criticism and dubbed “trembling Israelites” for  insisting that silent diplomacy or shtadlanut is more effective than public  activity. It has been accused of pursuing a policy of not “rocking the boat,”  opposing public demonstrations and generally seeking to retain a low  profile.The former president, Vivian Wineman, was head of the far-left  New Israel Fund and linked the Board with a number of dubious projects. He was  strongly supported by Yachad, a group with similar objectives to the US J Street  and which demonizes the Israeli government and urges British tourists to Israel  to join its Ramallah tours designed to promote the Palestinian cause. It  recently commissioned an opinion poll based on biased sampling methods, which  falsely stated that over 70 percent of British Jews believe Israel’s approach to  peace is damaging. Needless to say, this group is embraced and hailed as  courageous by the anti-Israel media and pro-Palestinian activists.This  year, the Board of Deputies elected Jonathan Arkush as its 47th president.  Arkush is a lawyer, a traditional Jew and a passionate Zionist, two of whose  children have made aliya. He cannot be expected to revolutionize the Board  overnight, but there is little doubt that he represents a new leadership style.  Hopefully, he will generate support among grass-roots activists previously  alienated by Jewish leaders who failed to speak out forcefully against the  prevailing anti-Israel stream.Arkush has already vigorously condemned  Yachad for calling on the British government to exert pressure on Israel over  settlements.The greatest obstacle facing the Board of Deputies is the  so-called Jewish Leadership Council, which primarily comprises a group of  wealthy Jews, many of whom bankroll and control charities.The power of  some of these tycoons provides them with ready access to politicians, but  instead of using this to support the official umbrella body or engage directly  with them, they have created an organization with absolutely no accountability  to anyone.The Council frequently bypasses and undermines the Board of  Deputies and takes initiatives that are not in synch with the official  body.To make matters worse, this body is headed by Mick Davis, the South  African-born mining tycoon who has a long record of using public platforms to  castigate Israeli governments. In 2010, he accused Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu of “lacking the courage to take steps” to advance the peace process,  blaming Israel for being the obstacle to peace and predicting “an apartheid  state.” His arrogance was reflected in the statement that “the government of  Israel has to recognize that their actions directly impact on me as a Jew living  in London. ...The impact on me is as significant as it is on Jews living in  Israel. I trust them to recognize this.”Last week, in his capacity as  chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, Davis called for the cessation of  settlement activity, demanded “voluntary resettlement” of those resident over  the Green Line and stated that “Israel has simply not done enough” for peace and  that “the consequences of that failure are enormous and  growing.”Needless to say, the role of the Board of Deputies of British  Jews and the standing of Israel are deeply compromised when wealthy Jewish  “supporters” of Israel exploit communal platforms in order to promote such  negative views.Anglo Jewry faces enormous challenges and is only  marginally less vulnerable than most European communities.Official  leaders must wrest control from the unaccountable tycoons seeking to displace  them.But if they view themselves dispassionately, Anglo Jews who place a  premium on a meaningful Jewish life should recognize that their status is  unfortunately only likely to deteriorate. They should at least encourage their  children to make aliya.The writer’s website can be viewed at  www.wordfromjerusalem.

<title>Candidly Speaking: Rivlin must eschew politics</title>
<date>16/12/2015</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was widely criticized last year for his  efforts in trying to prevent Reuven Rivlin from being elected president.  However, in light of Rivlin’s recent engagement in politics, which is  constitutionally beyond the jurisdiction of the primarily ceremonial role of the  president, there may have been significant substance to Netanyahu’s concerns  about Rivlin.At the outset let me say that, like most citizens, I have a  fondness for Rivlin as a friendly character, a man of the people. He is a stark  contrast to his predecessor, Shimon Peres, the ultimate diplomat, always coiffed  and sartorially elegant to the point of perfection. He was admired from a  distance, sought to present himself as a cosmopolitan intellectual, and  succeeded.




The more avuncular Rivlin, who worshiped at my local synagogue  during the High Holidays, endeared himself to all, ignoring protocol and  mingling with the congregants after the service. The intimacy he projects by  rubbing shoulders rather than acting as a formal diplomat has made him highly  popular at the grassroots level. Besides, he is in every sense a warm and genial  personality who instinctively recoils from pomp and ceremony.But alas,  in recent months, he has become increasingly involved in politics, which should  be beyond his domain. Admittedly, some of his predecessors, such as Peres and  the late Ezer Weizmann, also breached the boundaries of their ceremonial  constitutional roles and dabbled in politics.But what makes Rivlin more  controversial is that he has seemingly adopted public policies quite  inconsistent with his former role as a Likud hard-liner. He has increasingly  been publicly critical of government policies and initiated policy innovations  that are totally beyond his jurisdiction, such as his recent call for the  creation of a confederation of Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians.He  has now gone further and during his recent visit to the United States made  totally inappropriate statements and innuendos about his country, indirectly  criticizing his government’s failure to take diplomatic initiatives, which  obviously endeared him to US President Barack Obama and the liberal  media.But it was his contentious decision to participate in the  Haaretz-New Israel Fund conference in New York and some of the extraordinary  statements he made at that venue that suggest that he may be losing the  plot.NGO Monitor refers to the politically far-left New Israel Fund as  an organization “active in repeating unsupported allegations of deliberate,  systematic, and widespread targeting of Palestinian civilians; war crimes and  crimes against humanity, and grave violations of international humanitarian  law.” The NIF also provides funds for Jewish and Arab groups that oppose Zionism  and a two-state solution.The conference was essentially a hate-fest and  an effort by left-wing American Jews to exert pressure on the democratically  elected Israeli government and its security policies, which enjoy the support of  the vast majority of its citizens. It attracted a host of anti-Israeli elements  including even prominent promoters of the boycott, divestment and sanctions  movement such as former Pink Floyd front man Roger Waters.The conference  was addressed by chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, who fully endorses  and partakes in the evil incitement that has led to the current killing spree  against Israelis emanating from his boss, Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas. To compound matters, Erekat demanded that the Israeli flag be  withdrawn from the platform and, disgustingly, his hosts complied with this  request.In his address, Erekat “congratulated” Netanyahu for “destroying  a culture of negotiations, a culture of dialogue and a culture of peace.”  Speaking with a forked tongue and claiming that he supports a two-state  solution, Erekat accused Israel of “promoting apartheid.” Erekat also told the  gathering that Israeli security forces had killed his nephew last month – but  failed to point out that he was killed after having shot and wounded two  Israelis in Jerusalem. His address received a standing ovation from the audience  of “progressive” Jews.US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power condemned  the delegitimization of Israel but then proceeded to apportion equal blame on  both sides for insufficient commitment to the peace process, adding that  “continued settlement growth raises questions about Israel’s long-term  objectives.”Joint Arab List leader MK Ayman Odeh, who a few days earlier  had refused to attend a meeting with the Conference of Presidents of Major  American Jewish Organizations because it shared office space with the Jewish  Agency, which, he claimed, aims to “disinherit and exclude the Arab population,”  received resounding support – Haaretz described him as being “greeted like a  rock star.”The conference was also addressed by Breaking the Silence, a  group that concentrates on demonizing the Israel Defense Forces, disseminating  lies and accusing it of war crimes. Israeli reservists demonstrated outside  Rivlin’s residence, urging him not to participate in a conference that provided  a platform for a group whose primary objective is to slander Israel and their  role in defense of the nation.Rivlin rejected all calls not to  participate and dignify this anti-Israeli-government forum with his presence. In  his address, he did make a spirited defense of the moral code of the IDF but  failed to condemn Breaking the Silence and then resumed his subtle criticism of  government policy by stating that security is not merely “a military mission.”  He conveyed to the fanatically hostile anti-Israeli-government audience the  ambiguous message that “we have to find new diplomatic ways, because finding new  diplomatic ways is just as important for our safety and security. And for that  we need to think out of the box.” Rivlin has never conveyed solutions for the  impasse to the government and it is difficult to interpret such remarks other  than as criticism – inappropriate for any politician while abroad and infinitely  more so for the president of Israel.What was even more astonishing was  Rivlin’s fulsome praise for Haaretz, whose views he disagrees with but which, in  his words, nevertheless represents “a beacon of freedom of expression in  Israel.” He added, “I believe that the free market of ideas is a holy  principle.”Most Israelis agree about the need for freedom of expression.  But if Rivlin insisted on providing legitimacy and addressing such a conference,  he should surely at least have employed his freedom of expression to lambaste  the newspaper, which has promoted post-Zionist editorials, distorted truth in  its efforts to demonize Israel, and published front-page headlines about  purported IDF crimes (subsequently proven to be false) that paved the way for  the Goldstone Report and undoubtedly provided more ammunition for the global  anti-Israeli media than any other channel.As president, Rivlin should  avoid contributing further to the already dysfunctional Israeli political arena.  He must resist the temptation to seek public support by engaging in  anti-government or populist rhetoric. He must restrict himself to his  constitutional role, remain above politics, and never engage in direct or  indirect criticism of the government. He certainly should not identify in any  way with Jewish or other groups whose principal objective is to besmirch and  undermine his government. This applies especially when he is abroad.

<title>Can you be against BDS and for BDS?</title>
<date>2/12/2015</date>
<content>
Can an organization or  individual claim they are opposed to the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions)  movement against Israel, but still support boycotting Israeli goods, academics  and people over the Green Line? There seems to be a strange phenomenon among  American Jewish progressives, saying they oppose the BDS movement, except that  it’s OK or a good thing to boycott Israel over the Green Line. They seem not to  realize that the worldwide BDS movement is not a humanitarian movement trying to  foster a two-state solution. The goal of its founders and supporters is the  destruction of Israel, a non-indigenous people who they claim forced out the  rightful indigenous Arabs.Zionism is to them a racist movement based on  colonialism and apartheid, which should be given no sanctuary at all in the  Middle East. American progressives play into the hands of Israel’s enemies, to  divide and conquer Israel by backing BDS for part of Israel.




Boycotting  Israeli goods on either side of the Green Line is overwhelmingly opposed by  mainstream Israelis of the Left and Right, who see clearly that any boycott is  part of a strategy of delegitimization of Zionism itself.Israelis across  the political spectrum know this is true because their governments have  painfully offered almost all of the West Bank with Jerusalem as a capital for a  Palestinian nation three times within the past 15 years to no avail, with the  Palestinian response being rejection and escalation of violence, the Israeli  willingness to consider compromise being seen only as a sign of  weakness.The mainstream political Israeli Left and Center have made it  clear that any boycott of Israel over the Green Line is part of the BDS  movement. Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog said in regard to the newly  announced EU boycott of Israeli products over the Green Line, “This decision is  based on hatred, falsehood and ignorance, devoid of any moral value.” Yesh Atid  chairman Yair Lapid tweeted: “Jews are being stabbed in the streets and the EU  has given in to BDS. This decision discriminates against Israel and encourages  terrorism.”Hilik Bar, secretary general of the Labor Party and Deputy  speaker of the Knesset told me, “We are against BDS over the Green Line, and BDS  in Israel, and any kind of BDS.” Speaking last week before the European  Parliament, he said, “When you label products, you are labeling yourselves as  less relevant to solving the conflict, as an unfair broker... Be against  boycotts and for promoting cooperation.”Tzipi Livni of the Zionist Union  said, “True, [the European boycott] starts with settlement [goods], but their  problem is with Israel, which is seen as a colonialist country. Therefore, it  won’t stop at the settlements, but [will spread] to all of Israel.”Many  on the American Jewish Left are more aligned on this issue with the Israeli far  Left and Israel’s Arab parties than with Labor and the Zionist Union. American  progressive organizations believe there is a real distinction between boycotts  of Israel and boycotts over the Green Line. They find no contradiction between  rhetorically standing strong against the BDS movement that delegitimizes the  Zionist state, yet defending boycotting of Israeli goods from over the Green  Line as legitimate.They believe Israel needs to be pressured for its own  good to remove all Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria, which are to them  the cause of most of the problems of the Middle East. They do not distinguish  between communities in Judea and Samaria that are necessary for Israeli  security, Jewish majority areas of Jerusalem over the armistice line or areas  that were part of the Clinton or Olmert land swap plans from other “occupied”  territory. Until the Obama administration, areas such as French Hill, Gilo, or  Gush Etzion were not considered controversial, and were always assumed to be  part of a future Israeli state.American Jewish progressives don’t seem  to respect the judgment – born of decades of experience – and will of the  Israeli electorate who have to live with the consequences of the boycotts,  endure the nightmare of Palestinian terrorism, and who put their own children in  harm’s way. They also ignore the true meaning of UNSC Resolution 242, whose  language and authors clearly called for an adjustment of the 1949 lines, giving  legitimacy to Israeli land claims over the Green Line. They subscribe to a  politicized, biased view of international law which says that Israel is a  semi-illegal stepchild state with fewer rights than every other nation on the  planet.This has also been the Obama administration narrative since  taking office in 2009. Ambassador and former Obama Iran and Middle East expert  Dennis Ross wrote in his new book, Doomed to Succeed, that the administration’s  preoccupation “and collective view that the Israeli occupation and settlement  activity – not Palestinian behavior – were responsible for the conflict argued  for pressure [on] Israel.” It is a short leap from there to rationalizing  boycotts of Israel, which the EU has already done.The news from Europe  is not all bad. David Harris of AJC opined that we should recognize and  appreciate the 12 EU countries that did not sign the BDS boycott of Israel:  Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Latvia,  Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary.Which gets us back to  the conundrum: Can you and your organization be against BDS if you subscribe to  boycotting Israel over the Green Line? Can you feel comfortable contributing to  the isolation of Israel in the world and singling out Israel for condemnation of  the occupation of disputed territory, knowing that treating Israel differently  from any other country is defined as anti-Semitism according to the US State  Department’s definition? Can you just ignore the unprovoked, egregious  occupations by Russia, Turkey, China, Pakistan and Morocco, while joining forces  with those who want BDS to destroy all of Israel? Controversy has arisen in  regard to organizations that have given a platform to those who want to boycott  Israel or create a single binational state. J Street says it is against BDS, but  has had a keynote speaker who endorsed BDS against Israeli goods over the Green  Line and has had speak at its national meeting a group that is against the  Jewish state itself. All is done in the name of freedom of speech, respecting  all opinions, but its more than that: Giving someone’s odious views a platform  on your stage gives them a seeming legitimacy, that goes beyond freedom of  speech.The New Israel Fund also claims to oppose BDS, but supports  organizations that are full-time demonizers of Israel. Can they honestly say  they are against BDS and still support anti-Israel organizations like Adalah,  Shovrim Shtika (Breaking the Silence), Yesh Din and Machsom Watch, who directly  or indirectly support BDS and whose agendas are more aligned with Palestinian  propaganda than with Israeli interests? In this highly contentious debate, ad  hominem attacks have taken place in the States. That should not happen; it is  wrong, and counterproductive. However, defenders of boycotters of goods from  Judea and Samaria should be called to task for the damage they do, whether from  the pulpit or in the pages of Haaretz.Going forward, everyone needs to  reflect on the reality of the world Israel lives in; who its neighbors really  are, and how difficult surviving in the Levant is when the world  disproportionately criticizes you and refuses to acknowledge that you have been  under an Arab siege to destroy your legitimacy for over 67 years.

<title>Center Field: ‘Alleged’ Palestinian lies encouraging their ‘alleged stabbings’</title>
<date>13/10/2015</date>
<content>
Predictably, this wave of terrorism, with Palestinian teenagers and  twenty-somethings attacking Israelis commuting, shopping, walking to synagogue,  has unleashed a wave of idiocy blaming Israelis for being targeted. The  Independent in England framed Israel’s violent reaction as an overreaction to “a  spate of alleged stabbings.”Four centuries after Shakespeare had Shylock  the Jew ask “if you prick us, do we not bleed,” when Palestinians slash innocent  Jews Jeremy Corbyn’s England believes we only bleed “allegedly.”




And The  New York Times echoed Palestinian lies questioning the conclusive archaeological  and historical evidence that two Jewish Temples stood on Mount  Moriah.Forced to run a correction, the Times admitted that the only  “question is where precisely on the 37-acre Temple Mount site the temples had  once stood,” but the headline remained “Historical Certainty Proves Elusive at  Jerusalem’s Holiest Place.” (Note, the Muslim conquerors’ tendency to build holy  places like the Dome of the Rock on others’ sacred sites makes the Aksa Mosque,  built in 691 C.E., 30 years after Muhammad’s death, proof that originally  Muslims considered the Temple Mount the site of the Holy Temple, built by  Solomon 1,600 years earlier).These outrages reflect “The Obama  Intifada,” a term I use regretfully, and that has been received angrily.  Clearly, most guilty are the terrorists, their co-conspirators who aid them,  their teachers who encourage them and their leaders who stir them up. Clearly,  President Barack Obama doesn’t want this “on his watch,” as he said about Iran  going nuclear. But Obama – Israel’s Best Friend Ever – shaped the broader  inflammatory context.His perpetual blame game puts the burden  disproportionately on Israel, as does his “dog whistling”: all the unquotable  gesturing and messaging that demonizes Israel and condescendingly enables  Palestinians to use American and European dollars to subsidize dehumanizing  incitement, anti-Semitism (not “just” anti-Zionism) and evil violence against a  14-year-old girl here, a young teacher there – innocents just trying to live  their lives.Yet again, I note that Obama is not anti-Israel or  anti-Semitic. Such language demonizes him unnecessarily and aligns him with  Israel’s outright enemies. We must move beyond the simplistic antior pro-Israel  dichotomy. Obama respects Israel’s right to exist. However, having swallowed the  Big Lie that no Jews belong in the West Bank he allows his anger over Israel’s  presence there to sour his perceptions of Israel and blame Israel for causing  the conflict.As with the Times Temple lie, two decades after most  Israelis acknowledged that two peoples love the same land because history is  messy enough to generate conflicting land claims, the Palestinians’ exclusive  (and ultimately exterminationist) claims to Jerusalem, the West Bank, and  basically all of Israel, are gaining traction with intelligent  people.What’s absurd is that the West Bank, which even many Jews now  perceive as Palestinian property wrongly occupied by Jews, is an artificial  improvisation hastily defined by the 1949 armistice’s “Green Line,” then  illegally occupied – er, controlled – by Jordan for 19 years. Making that piece  of land an organic entity that must be Jewfree with sacrosanct borders simply  rewards Palestinian intransigence.Today, the healthiest, safest Israeli-Palestinian future lies in rejecting this rigidity and transcending contiguity.  Negotiators and the “PPPPs” – perpetual, professional peace processors – should  respect the demographic status quo, and prepare both populations for two  independent non-contiguous states, with interlocking borders.Think about  it. In the modern world, city-states can thrive. Conflicting Arab-Jewish claims  and communities have already divided the area. And the Palestinian population  retains strong tribal and local identities. The first steps should be toward  declaring true independence in the areas that are already Palestinian, and which  Israeli law bars Israelis from entering.We need new national and  geographic paradigms. Calling these independent, interlocking regions  “Bantustans” would be sheer demagoguery, negating Jews’ internationally  recognized claims to this territory. Jews have deeper historic ties to Bet El  and Hebron than to Tel Aviv – consider The Patriarch’s Tomb’s architecture and  history.And remember, the West Bank is no more organic than artificial  sweetener – and more toxic.This historical analysis recognizes that  national self-conceptions evolve, borders shift, people move.The  Palestinians have their narrative and claims, while we Jews have ours. As a  Zionist and an American, I respect Palestinian nationalism.I resent when  someone else tries rewriting my historical narrative, I won’t rewrite theirs. As  a liberal democrat, I acknowledge the problems with the Israeli military  controlling Palestinians in some places.But I also note that they have  much freedom from Israeli rule in Ramallah and elsewhere, while they endure more  oppression from their own people in Gaza and elsewhere.Moreover, their  violence perpetuates Israeli rule. My new book The Age of Clinton: America in  the 1990s argues that the Soviet Union collapsed peacefully, South African  apartheid vanished peacefully, the Northern Ireland troubles ended peacefully,  but the Israeli-Palestinian problem persists violently because only in this  conflict does one group seek to destroy the other people. You cannot compromise  with those who wish to kill you.As we watch young Palestinians stabbing  and rock-throwing, flip the Western assumption that people that violent must be  that desperate.Instead, ask: who is teaching them to hate? Why aren’t  they raised to be peaceful (Mahatma) Gandhians or high-tech (Bill) Gatesians?  Palestinians could get more than they expect with non-violence or a productive,  middle-class high-tech society. Instead, they terrorize their neighbors and  create totalitarian exterminationist regimes like Hamasistan in  Gaza.Finally, note the irony: Bill Clinton and Barack Obama share the  same vision of two states for two peoples, but Israelis still cherish Clinton’s  friendship and resent Obama’s hostility. Instead of falsely crowning him  Israeli’s Best Friend Ever, pro-Israel Democrats should protest the messaging,  the dog whistling, the telegraphed hostility. Israel needs true Clintonesque  friends, not Blame Israel First Obamians, especially with totalitarian terrorism  metastasizing yet again.

<title>Center Field: Fair and balanced</title>
<date>15/12/2015</date>
<content>
A pro-Israel activist was invited recently to teach teens  about Israel at a “liberal” – non-Orthodox – synagogue. Good educators know the  importance of building a tent big enough politically to welcome a range of  perspectives without reducing Israel to a political problem or politicizing the  basic facts so many students don’t know. The challenge grew when the rabbi  intervened, saying: “I expect you to present BDS fairly.”“What,” this  activist asked me, “should I do?” We knew what the rabbi meant. In this age of  delegitimization, this Jewish leader wanted to make the case for boycotting  Israel to the synagogue’s teens, presenting Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions as  a fair, legitimate option.




It’s astonishing. If gays, feminists and  African-Americans don’t invite homophobes, sexists and racists to present their  enemies “fairly,” why should we? This was not even a request to present the  Palestinian side – which has educational value – but to justify the boycotters,  rooted in anti-Semitism, championing anti-Zionism, often demanding Israel’s  destruction.We need to understand how we stumbled into this pathetic  state, wherein Jewish leaders urge us to disrespect ourselves and our  story.It starts with the loony Left’s identity politics and  anti-“racism” obsession. Identity politics’ essentialist approach reduces people  to their skin colors and ethnicities while labeling them “privileged” or  “oppressed.” The privileged are automatically racist, even when biological  differences are irrelevant. The oppressed are always right, even when they are  violent or wrong.Worshipers in that church rally around opposing Israeli  “racism” as their grandparents rallied around Marxism. And, in Iran and  elsewhere, anti-Americanism and anti-Zionism overlap: attacking “Little Satan,”  Israel, slams “Big Satan,” America. But Israel’s an easier  target.Radical Jews, eager to be loved, have embraced this approach,  which reduces the complicated Arab-Israeli conflict to a simple, black-andwhite  tale casting the Palestinians as helpless “blacks” oppressed by Israeli  “whites.” While most of the Jewish world mocks this idiocy, it has seduced a  loud, self-righteous minority of Jewish intellectuals and radical  rabbis.As the rabbinate becomes more of an academic track, with some  students entering seminaries as a reasonable career option that teaches Judaism  and Jewish history in a theoretical, scholarly manner, rather than a passionate  outgrowth of their commitment to a denominational movement, many young rabbis  swallow this nonsense.Knowing this, I suggested two options. Teach BDS  through the boycotters’ own words. Read the “Palestinian Civil Society Call for  BDS” of July 9, 2005, which jumps from the post-1967 question, What borders  should Israelis and Palestinians have? – a question allowing for compromise – to  the pre-1948 question, Does Israel deserve to exist? which rejects compromise,  because their answer is “no.”The text manipulatively escalates from  fighting “the occupation” to demonizing Israel to rejecting Israel’s existence.  The document alleges Israel was “built mainly on land ethnically cleansed of its  Palestinian owners,” has an “entrenched system of racial discrimination” and  ignores “UN resolutions [which] have condemned Israel’s colonial and  discriminatory policies as illegal... since 1948” – note, not “just”  1967.Many BDS leaders, who compare democratic Israel to racist apartheid  South Africa, are anti-Israel and often anti-Semitic. BDS leader Omar Barghouti  – who should boycott himself as a Tel Aviv University student – admits that “if  the refugees were to return, you would not have a two-state solution, you would  have a Palestine next to a Palestine.”He justifies Palestinians’ right  to “resistance by any means, including armed resistance,” by denying not just  Jewish rights “to self-determination” but insisting: the Jews “are not a  people.”As’ad Abu Khalil, a Californian political scientist, admits:  “The real aim of BDS is to bring down the State of Israel.” Zaid Shuaibi, a  boycott activist, explains: “Freedom, justice, return of refugees and  self-determination in general require a rejection of normalization and greater  resistance against Israel’s multitiered system of oppression which includes  occupation, colonization and apartheid.”Rejecting “normalization” means  rejecting any interaction, no matter how benign, with any Israelis, no matter  how liberal. And if Israel were a colonizing apartheid state, conquering distant  territories without historic claims or imposing racist, biologically based  bigotry, it would be reprehensible – but that’s not Israel.I would  finish by showing BDS images and videos, especially from rallies spewing  anti-Semitic hate, intimidating opponents, celebrating violence – then let the  students judge for themselves. Defining movements by their founding documents  and leaders is fair – although not flattering considering BDS’s venom.If  the rabbi rejected this factual, let-‘em-damn-themselves approach, I offered  Plan B, invoking the Joe Hochberg Rule.Years ago, Hochberg was the  business manager of Young Judaea’s national camp, Tel Yehudah. Two parents  contacted him, furious that their son was sent home for misbehavior. As the  argument escalated, one parent screamed, “You guys are like the  Nazis.”“That’s it,” Joe said. “This conversation is over” – and he  kicked them out of his office.Sometimes, people become so unreasonable  they make dialogue futile. If a rabbi doesn’t believe presenting the boycotters  in their own words is “fair,” the next step is to address the rabbi’s  congregants – and appeal to them.“This conversation is over” is an  important general lesson in Israel activism. We need a big tent from left to  right supporting Israel, fighting delegitimization. The further “left” you are,  the more territory you want Israel to concede, the more ardently you should  oppose anti-normalization which insulates and demonizes, and the more  aggressively you should oppose boycotts and delegitimization, which alienate  Israelis.Still, we need some bottom lines. I don’t debate Israel’s right  to exist. I don’t engage with Israel-haters and anti-Semites. And when  someone cannot distinguish friends from enemies and tries suppressing the truth,  it’s time to end the conversation and publicize that behavior, even if it  embarrasses this leader as a lamb, sheepishly following the latest radical  trends, while betraying our people.

<title>Center Field: Fight BDS with national unity not a biased, divisive strategy</title>
<date>16/6/2015</date>
<content>
Two attempted hijackings occurred at last week’s Herzliya Conference. Rightist  politicians invoked the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement to  justify Israel’s continued West Bank presence. This makes as much sense as  enjoying the warmth of a fire you mistakenly ignited as it threatens to engulf  your house. Simultaneously, leftists invoked the anti-Israel boycott to justify  leaving “the settlements,” which is as sensible as dieting by eating poison.  Partisans from both extremes failed to use the boycott threat to unite Israelis  and the entire pro-Israel community in a big-tent, left-to-right coalition,  defending Israel’s existence against enemies who believe that every boycott  resolution from every no-name company or university brings them one step closer  to their true goal of exterminating Israel. Thus, while the conference brought  together Israel’s leading politicians and thinkers, Israel’s leaders once again  foolishly wrenched Jewish unity apart to score partisan  points.Shockingly, a leading left-wing academic, whose name I won’t even  mention out of respect, naively parroted the BDS movement’s Trojan Horse  strategy.




He justified the boycott as a legitimate move targeting “the  settlements.” He bristled when I suggested that a phrase like “the settlements”  oversimplifies.The Jewish Quarter, Gilo, Gush Etzion, the Golan and an  illegal outpost are equally illegitimate to our enemies but not to most  Israelis, or to thoughtful compromisers like those who designed the Clinton  Plan. Even worse, this activist academic’s hatred for the Right and “the  settlements” blinded him to the delegitimizers’ repudiation of the entire  Zionist project.
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}Lurking behind the BDS movement’s human rights mask and  supposed “settlement” focus is a desire to destroy Israel. The July 2005  Palestinian Civil Society Call for BDS quickly shifts from fighting “the  occupation” to demonizing Israel to rejecting Israel’s existence. Anyone – and I  mean everyone – who supports a boycott against Israel, even this allegedly  “limited” boycott of products from the territories, legitimizes the BDS call  describing Israel as being “built mainly on land ethnically cleansed of its  Palestinian owners,” having an “entrenched system of racial discrimination” and  ignoring “UN resolutions [which] have condemned Israel’s colonial and  discriminatory policies as illegal... since 1948” – note, not “just”  1967.BDS leaders, who repeatedly compare democratic Israel to racist  apartheid South Africa, are even more belligerent. The leading BDS activist Omar  Barghouti – whose calls for boycott overlook his own studies at Tel Aviv  University – has accused Israel of using “common Nazi practices” against the  Palestinians.He believes a “Jewish state in Palestine in any shape or  form cannot but contravene the basic rights of the indigenous Palestinians.”  Barghouti justifies Palestinians’ right to “resistance by any means, including  armed resistance,” by denying not just Jewish rights “to self-determination” but  by insisting that the Jews “are not a people.”Other allies are equally  anti-Zionist.“Israel is the oppressor, not the settlements,” says Hind  Awwad, a national coordinator of the BDS Committee.“BDS represents three  words that will help bring about the defeat of Zionist Israel and victory for  Palestine,” says a deluded but demonizing Ronnie Kasrils.As’ad Abu  Khalil, a California political scientist and anti-Zionist blogger, admits: “The  real aim of BDS is to bring down the state of Israel.... That should be stated  as an unambiguous goal.”At least he’s honest.These anti-Zionists  built BDS on a foundation going back four decades to the UN’s infamous “Zionism  is racism” resolution passed in November 1975, which we should mark with mass  pro-Zionist teach-ins this fall. That false linkage of Zionism with racism,  imperialism and colonialism sits on a larger foundation of centuries of  anti-Semitism.The pile-on against Israel, the disproportionate obsession  with Israeli missteps, the exaggeration of Palestinian suffering – all echo  old-fashioned Jew hatred. This analysis does not justify every Israeli action;  it simply explains the current overreaction.Actually, the further Left  you are, the more concessions you want Israel to make, the more vehemently you  should fight BDS and Israel’s delegitimization.Every assault on Israel,  every boycott call, makes compromising harder, escalating the conflict from a  solvable border dispute to an existential war.In this debate, partisans  from both extremes sound ridiculous. The Right’s woe-is-me chorus sounds like  scared Galut Jews quaking that the whole world opposes us. Left-wingers sound  like pathetic Galut Jews, trying to placate the world, assuming we will become  popular if we behave nicely. Both the Right’s useless bullies and the Left’s  useful idiots should stop using the BDS movement when debating the West Bank.  True Zionists will chart our destiny without relying on outside forces to decide  for us. True Zionists will offer an affirmative vision of what we want rather  than a defensive reaction to our enemies.Alas, this Israeli partisan  myopia is an epidemic.Last week’s embarrassing revelations about Oren  Hazan as casino-pimp-and-partier-turned-Knesset- member evoked partisan sneers  from the Left and partisan silence from the Right. Two class acts emerged,  however. Opposition leader Isaac Herzog refused to exploit the Likud’s  embarrassment to score partisan points. Meanwhile, Likud Knesset speaker Yuli  Edelstein sidelined Hazan as deputy speaker. Having resisted the KGB and the  Soviet empire itself in the 1980s, Edelstein then shrugged off Hazan’s petty  threats. Alas, colleagues foolishly mocked Herzog’s patriotism as “gentlemanly”  weakness, while Edelstein’s Likud boss, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, once  again vanished when Israelis needed moral leadership.More than a  national unity government, Israel needs a government promoting national  unity.Perhaps Israel’s leaders could learn from Las Vegas, of all  places. There, the Republican Sheldon Adelson and the Democrat Haim Saban,  agreeing to disagree about other issues, united to endorse a bipartisan,  broad-based, anti-BDS strategy focused on campuses.“It’s a challenge to  get Jewish groups to work together,” Adelson said, in a rare  understatement.“When it comes to Israel we’re absolutely on the same  page,” said Saban.Shouldn’t we all be?

<title>Center Field: Genteel anti-Semitism is still Jew hatred!</title>
<date>12/5/2015</date>
<content>
This week, the Foreign Ministry’s Global Forum against Anti-Semitism convenes in  Jerusalem. In an age of massacres and rank hatred, it is easy to concentrate on  traditional anti-Semitism, the crude Jew-hatred surging on the Web, from  Islamists, in European streets.But a subtler, equally repulsive  anti-Semitism is spreading, masquerading as “only” anti-Zionism, garbed in human  rights rhetoric, championed by the totalitarian Left, validated by  intellectuals. Traditionally, aristocrats’ genteel anti-Semitism legitimized the  peasants’ cruder, more violent hatred. Today, radical leftists’ genteel  anti-Semitism validates and perpetuates Islamists’ cruder, more violent hatred.  Don’t be lulled by the idealistic words, intimidated by the professional titles,  and made defensive by the criticisms of Israel, some of which are valid. To  combat the violent form of hatred you must fight its partner.




That this  new fancy-pants anti-Semitism flourishes in some – not all – universities is  particularly shameful. The campus should be a wild, rollicking, mind-expanding,  soul-stretching, assumption-challenging free marketplace of ideas. The new  anti-Semitism violates core academic values of encouraging openness toward  others, in all their diversity; of seeking truth, in all its complexity; and of  fighting for freedom, with all its messiness.In the latest academic  witch-hunt, anti-Zionists have hounded Andrew Pessin, of Connecticut College,  into a medical leave of absence. His crime: an awkward Facebook posting  comparing Hamas during the Gaza conflict to a “rabid pit bull.” A Palestinian  activist trolling for trouble uncovered the posting months later. Pessin  apologized, emphasizing he was attacking Hamas terrorists, not  Palestinians.Nevertheless the campus thought police branded him  “racist.” Some dishonestly claimed: “Professor Pessin directly condoned the  extermination of a people.” The university, cowering, addressed the supposedly  broader issue of “dehumanizing language,” while sponsoring one-sided  “dialogues.” One panel, demonstrating “diversity,” university-style, pitted a  boycott supporter against a fellow anti-Zionist who compares Israelis to  Nazis.Pessin reported that “the faculty immediately became an  intellectual mob, with nearly every department releasing statements condemning  me signed by nearly every faculty member – when not a single person vilifying me  ever asked me what the post meant.” Pessin exclaims: “It is an anti-Zionist,  anti-Semitic campaign masquerading as a campaign against  racism.”Pessin’s case parallels Fordham University history professor  Doron Ben-Atar’s experience of being investigated for acting “in an  inappropriate way” for angrily insisting that Fordham’s American Studies program  condemn the American Studies Association’s Israel boycott. The program’s  director accused him behind his back of religious discrimination. Ben-Atar is  not smart enough to understand “how opposing anti-Semitism amounts to religious  discrimination.” Neither am I.Ben-Atar’s lawyer helped get him  exonerated. Others should offer these victims of harassment financial  help.Few academics can afford lawyers fees; there’s no discount for  telling the truth or doing the right thing.There’s a chilling effect.  What sane professor would ever want to defend Israel? Two disturbing trends are  smothering freedom. Since the 1960s, the Campus Left has championed free speech  “for me and not thee.” Genuine concerns about creating a safe and respectful  learning environment, free of sexism and racism, fed a fascist mentality  narrowly approving only certain ideas, words and causes. Now hypersensitive,  politically correct students complain about “micro-aggressions” they perceive in  body language or nuanced words, seeking protection from what one junior recently  called “viewpoints that really go against my dearly and closely-held  beliefs.”We used to call that education. If students never question  cherished beliefs, they are wasting their time and their parents’ money. The  Canadian prime minister Lester Pearson called ideas “explosive.” Neutralizing  them for modern campus brats is educational malpractice.Many of these  seemingly precious students, vigilant about “micro-aggressions” challenging  their assumptions, commit macro-aggressions willy-nilly against Israel and the  Jewish People. You can have a whole week falsely comparing Israeli democracy to  South Africa’s apartheid regime, yet when Jews take being called racist or being  targeted by terrorists personally, we are guilty.As the acceptable  bandwidth of campus thought narrowed, the Palestinians became a protected class  and Israel- bashing became a varsity sport. While many groups enjoy  particularist prerogatives, Zionism is politically incorrect. At a time when  individual sensibilities repeatedly trump sensible discussion, Jews’  sensitivities don’t count if they support Israel. And despite racism, sexism and  homophobia being supposedly reviled on campus, Arab, Islamist and Palestinian  racism, sexism and homophobia are excused while Israeli democracy,  inclusiveness, gender equity and sexual freedom are overlooked – or mocked as  veneers.The shift from Enlightenment Politics to Identity Politics  created a polarized culture with protected classes and acceptable targets  impervious to the once-prized tools of fact and reason. That anti-Zionism,  weaponized by an underlying anti-Semitism, feeds this is not  coincidental.The Palestinians pretend to be the archetypal Third World  Victims, treating Israel as the prototypical racists, colonialists and  imperialists, continuing the systematic propaganda campaign hatched in the  1970s. There’s no racism; the fight is national, not biological. There’s no  colonialism; Israelis and Palestinians have disputed land claims. There’s no  imperialism; Israel is small and independent. But why let facts stop a good  post-modern academic rant? How dare Professors Pessin and Ben-Atar break the  mold.Their independence not only threatens the anti-Zionist groupthink,  it imperils a whole system of academic thought suppression that too many have  invested in for too long. Just as little Anatoly (Natan) Sharansky was too big a  threat to the massive Soviet Union because his commitment to truth exposed all  the Big Red Lies, these intellectual dissidents pose a disproportionately  massive threat to all the Ivy-covered lies that so many academics have built  their careers on.True, not all criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic. But  when mobs repeatedly single out one group of people for one kind of idea,  subjecting them to special standard, treating them in ways that violate one’s  fundamental values and core mission, that kind of scapegoating is bigotry. And  the bigoted scapegoating of Jews is indeed anti-Semitism.The author is  professor of history at McGill University and is teaching this semester at  Hebrew University’s Rothberg School.

<title>Center Field: Yom Hashoah blues</title>
<date>14/4/2015</date>
<content>
It is easy to despair this Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Remembrance  Day. For too many, “Never Again” has become “Hopefully Soon,” even “Inshallah  Tomorrow” – profaning religion to serve evil. Of course, not all Muslims are  genocidal anti-Semites, but too many Islamists are proudly, unabashedly so,  along with too many Palestinian activists, too many “Death to America” and  “Death to Israel” Iranian leaders, too many European enablers. The Holocaust  warns us to take hateful words seriously; bloodthirsty dreams can spawn bloody  realities.This Yom Hashoah, freshly dug graves in Europe and Israel  testify to today’s epidemic of murderous anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. Jews  this year were slaughtered visiting a museum in Brussels, shopping for Shabbat  in Paris, praying and commuting in Jerusalem. In a familiar inversion, many  supposedly enlightened and religious voices not only refused to mourn, they  blamed Jews for those deaths. Alas, some Jews swallow this poisonous idiocy and  feel guilty.




True, Israel must take its share of responsibility for the  Palestinian problem. Still, most crocodile tears shed for Palestinian suffering  are more motivated by the desire for a modern, seemingly legitimate mask for  Jew-hatred than any love for the Palestinians. For decades, the proof has been  in the disproportionate, obsessive attacks on democratic Israel, with overheated  comparisons to Nazism and apartheid while ignoring Palestinian terrorism and  exterminationism. Now, note the silence surrounding the slaughter of  Palestinians in Syria, particularly Islamic State’s mass starvation and  beheadings in Yarmouk. Al-Jazeera’s Mehdi Hassan calls this “the shameful  silence when Israel is not to blame.”This Yom Hashoah, it is also too  easy to compare European appeasement circa 1938 to American appeasement circa  2015, matching Neville Chamberlain’s Munich-inspired “peace for our time” to  Barack Obama’s Lausanne-triggered “I’ve been very clear that Iran will not get a  nuclear weapon on my watch.” Obama’s own words now prove he was too eager for a  deal. Moreover he is wrong to claim that the choice was this flawed deal or war.  The peaceful alternative to a nuclear Iran was more regime-crippling sanctions  and a tougher deal. In Haaretz, sane analysts like Ari Shavit said Obama’s sales  campaign “doesn’t set off one alarm bell, it sets off a thousand.” Yet even  hearing the ayatollahs reiterate their “Death to America” chant won’t stop the  Obama Appeasement Express.
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}Amid such hatred and weakness, it feels  foolish to sit around a darkened room, listening to yet another Holocaust  survivor’s story. Standing still during the siren is the opposite of what we  should be doing. We need action not contemplation, anger not mourning. We must  avert a future Holocaust, not regret the first one.Precisely at this  danger point, accept two other obligations. First, honor the millions  murdered and those who survived by listening to them. Elie Wiesel teaches: “To  forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time.” That,  frankly, is easy. Jews, Zionists, Israelis, democratic patriots, are good  memorializers. We know how to bathe in memory, cherish our heroes, echo our  past.The second obligation is harder. Even in a world rife with  injustice, teetering toward madness, learn to resist false analogies. It’s not  1938, because we have a flourishing Jewish state and a powerful Jewish army.  It’s not 1938, because we have an engaged America not an isolationist  America. It’s not 1938, because we live in a more civilized  world.Commemorating Yom Hashoah honestly also involves isolating the  variables that made the Holocaust unique, not just generalizing the ones that  make it seem imminent. Yes, beware violent words. But also beware sloppy  comparisons. In his challenging and uplifting 2011 book, The Better  Angels of our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, the cognitive scientist Steven  Pinker provides nearly 800 hundred pages of good news, showing that our era, for  all its faults, is the least violent, the least tumultuous, the most civilized,  the most humanitarian epoch humans have ever enjoyed. The post-Nazi “Long Peace”  has now been followed by the post-Soviet “New Peace.”Especially in the  West, our media-fueled outrage sometimes reflects a bratty perfectionism. Once,  life genuinely was nasty, brutish and short; today, it’s mostly cushy, safe and  long. As a result, we get particularly annoyed when things go wrong, when that  pleasant baseline feels threatened.Anger is legitimate when confronting  injustice; just judge today’s chaos in context. In Jewish terms, the  change from 1938 and 2015 is transformational. In spring, 1944, Nazi  killers in Auschwitz gassed 6,000 Hungarian Jews a day. That means that the  Nazis slaughtered more Jews in five days than the 25,000 Jews Arabs have  murdered in a century of war and terrorism.Today, most Jews live in  free, safe, prosperous countries, with most living in Israel and the United  States, two of the happiest experiments in productive, constructive, peaceful  Jewish living in our 3,500-year history.We need that context not to  approve a contemptible surrender to Iran or to restrain our fury at even the  slightest stirring of anti-Semitism. But that perspective highlights the true  horrors our ancestors and elders endured. We also should appreciate all we have,  cataloging all the good we got from our parents’ and grandparents’ sacrifices.  And we should fight hard to guarantee that just like they made a better world  for us, we leave our children an even better, safer, sounder world.When  you stand at attention this Yom Hashoah, don’t just remember the past also but  think of an effective action plan, asking, “What am I doing to fight  anti-Semitism today and to build a positive modern Zionism for the future?” When  listening to survivors, find inspiration in their grit and ingenuity. And with  zero tolerance for any intolerance that remains, let’s celebrate all the good in  our lives, even at this sobering moment.

<title>Column One: Israel’s next 22 months</title>
<date>12/3/2015</date>
<content>
The next 22 months until President Barack Obama leaves office promise to be the most challenging period in the history of US-Israel relations.
Now unfettered by electoral concerns, over the past week Obama exposed his ill-intentions toward Israel in two different ways.First, the Justice Department leaked its intention to indict Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez on corruption charges. Menendez is the ranking Democratic member, and the former chairman, of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He is also the most outspoken Democratic critic of Obama’s policy of appeasing the Iranian regime.




As former US federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy wrote this week at PJMedia, “It is perfectly reasonable to believe that Menendez may be guilty of corruption offenses and that his political opposition on Iran is factoring into the administration’s decision to charge him. Put it another way, if Menendez were running interference for Obama on the Iran deal, rather than trying to scupper it, I believe he would not be charged.”The Menendez prosecution tells us that Obama wishes to leave office after having vastly diminished support for Israel among Democrats. And he will not hesitate to use strong-arm tactics against his fellow Democrats to achieve his goal.
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}We already experienced Obama’s efforts in this sphere in the lead-up to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech before the joint houses of Congress on March 3 with his campaign to pressure Democratic lawmakers to boycott Netanyahu’s address.Now, with his move against Menendez, Obama made clear that support for Israel – even in the form of opposition to the nuclear armament of Iran – will be personally and politically costly for Democrats.The long-term implications of Obama’s moves to transform US support for Israel into a partisan issue cannot by wished away. It is possible that his successor as the head of the Democratic Party will hold a more sympathetic view of Israel. But it is also possible that the architecture of Democratic fund-raising and grassroots support that Obama has been building for the past six years will survive his presidency and that as a consequence, Democrats will have incentives to oppose Israel.The reason Obama is so keen to transform Israel into a partisan issue was made clear by the second move he made last week.Last Thursday, US National Security Adviser Susan Rice announced that the NSC’s Middle East Coordinator Phil Gordon was stepping down and being replaced by serial Israel-basher Robert Malley.Malley, who served as an NSC junior staffer during the Clinton administration, rose to prominence in late 2000 when, following the failed Camp David peace summit in July 2000 and the outbreak of the Palestinian terror war, Malley co-authored an op-ed in The New York Times blaming Israel and then-prime minister Ehud Barak for the failure of the negotiations.What was most remarkable at the time about Malley’s positions was that they completely contradicted Bill Clinton’s expressed views. Clinton placed the blame for the failure of the talks squarely on then-Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat’s shoulders.Not only did Arafat reject Barak’s unprecedented offer of Palestinian statehood and sovereignty over all of Gaza, most of Judea and Samaria and parts of Jerusalem including the Temple Mount, he refused to make a counter-offer. And then two months later, he opened the Palestinian terror war.As Jonathan Tobin explained in Commentary this week, through his writings and public statements, Malley has legitimized Palestinian rejection of Israel’s right to exist. Malley thinks it is perfectly reasonable that the Palestinians refuse to concede their demand for free immigration of millions of foreign Arabs to the Jewish state in the framework of their concocted “right of return,” even though the clear goal of that demand is to destroy Israel. As Tobin noted, Malley believes that Palestinian terrorism against Israel is “understandable if not necessarily commendable.”During Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, then-senator Obama listed Malley as a member of his foreign policy team. When pro-Israel groups criticized his appointment, Obama fired Malley.But after his 2012 reelection, no longer fearing the ramifications of embracing an openly anti-Israel adviser, one who had documented contacts with Hamas terrorists and has expressed support for recognizing the terror group, Obama appointed Malley to serve as his senior adviser for Iraq-Iran-Syria and the Gulf states. Still facing the 2014 congressional elections, Obama pledged that Malley would have no involvement in issues related to Israel and the Palestinians. But then last week, he appointed him to direct the NSC’s policy in relation to the entire Middle East, including Israel.The deeper significance of Malley’s appointment is that it demonstrates that Obama’s goal in his remaining time in office is to realign US Middle East policy away from Israel. With his Middle East policy led by a man who thinks the Palestinian goal of destroying Israel is legitimate, Obama can be expected to expand his practice of placing all the blame for the absence of peace between Israel and the Palestinians solely on Israel’s shoulders.Malley’s appointment indicates that there is nothing Israel can do to stem the tsunami of American pressure it is about to suffer. Electing a left-wing government to replace Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu will make no difference.Just as Malley was willing to blame Barak – a leader who went to Camp David as the head of a minority coalition, whose positions on territorial withdrawals were rejected by a wide majority of Israelis – for the absence of peace, so we can assume that he, and his boss, will blame Israel for the absence of peace over the next 22 months, regardless of who stands at the head of the next government.In this vein we can expect the administration to expand the anti-Israel positions it has already taken.The US position paper regarding Israeli-Palestinian negotiation that was leaked this past week to Yediot Aharonot made clear the direction Obama wishes to go. That document called for Israel to withdraw to the indefensible 1949 armistice lines, with minor revisions.In the coming 22 months we can expect the US to use more and more coercive measures to force Israel to capitulate to its position.The day the administration-sponsored talks began in July 2013, the EU announced it was barring its member nations from having ties with Israeli entities that operate beyond the 1949 armistice lines unless those operations involve assisting the Palestinians in their anti-Israel activities. The notion that the EU initiated an economic war against Israel the day the talks began without coordinating the move with the Obama administration is, of course, absurd.We can expect the US to make expanded use of European economic warfare against Israel in the coming years, and to continue to give a backwind to the anti-Semitic BDS movement by escalating its libelous rhetoric conflating Israel with the apartheid regime in South Africa.US-Israel intelligence and defense ties will also be on the chopping block.While Obama and his advisers consistently boast that defense and intelligence ties between Israel and the US have grown during his presidency, over the past several years, those ties have suffered blow after blow. During the war with Hamas last summer, acting on direct orders from the White House, the Pentagon instituted a partial – unofficial – embargo on weapons to Israel.As for intelligence ties, over the past month, the administration announced repeatedly that it is ending its intelligence sharing with Israel on Iran.We also learned that the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is being fingered as the source of the leak regarding the Stuxnet computer virus that Israel and the US reportedly developed jointly to cripple Iran’s nuclear centrifuges.In other words, since taking office, Obama has used the US’s intelligence ties with Israel to harm Israel’s national security.*He has also used diplomacy to harm Israel. Last summer, Obama sought a diplomatic settlement of Hamas’s war with Israel that would have granted Hamas all of its war goals, including its demand for open borders and access to the international financial system.Now of course, he is running roughshod over his bipartisan opposition, and the opposition of Israel and the Sunni Arab states, in the hopes of concluding a nuclear deal with Iran that will pave the way for the ayatollahs to develop nuclear weapons and expand their hegemonic control over the Middle East.Amid of this, and facing 22 months of ever more hostility as Obama pursues his goal of ending the US-Israel alliance, Israelis are called on to elect a new government.This week the consortium of former security brass that has banded together to elect a leftist government led by Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni accused Netanyahu of destroying Israel’s relations with the US. The implication was that a government led by Herzog and Livni will restore Israel’s ties to America.Yet as Obama has made clear both throughout his tenure in office, and, over the past week through Malley’s appointment and Menendez’s indictment, Obama holds sole responsibility for the deterioration of our ties with our primary ally. And as his actions have also made clear, Herzog and Livni at the helm will receive no respite in US pressure. Their willingness to make concessions to the Palestinians that Netanyahu refuses to make will merely cause Obama to move the goalposts further down the field. Given his goal of abandoning the US alliance with Israel, no concession that Israel will deliver will suffice.And so we need to ask ourselves, which leader will do a better job of limiting the danger and waiting Obama out while maintaining sufficient overall US support for Israel to rebuild the alliance after Obama has left the White House.The answer, it seems, is self-evident.The Left’s campaign to blame Netanyahu for Obama’s hostility will make it all but impossible for a Herzog-Livni government to withstand US pressure that they say will disappear the moment Netanyahu leaves office.In contrast, as the US position paper leaked to Yediot indicated, Netanyahu has demonstrated great skill in parrying US pressure. He agreed to hold negotiations based on a US position that he rejected and went along with the talks for nine months until the Palestinians ended them. In so doing, he achieved a nine-month respite in open US pressure while exposing Palestinian radicalism and opposition to peaceful coexistence.On the Iranian front, Netanyahu’s courageous speech before Congress last week energized Obama’s opponents to take action and forced Obama onto the defensive for the first time while expanding popular support for Israel.
It is clear that things will only get more difficult in the months ahead. But given the stakes, the choice of Israeli voters next Tuesday is an easy one.

<title>Column one: Netanyahu’s true electoral rival</title>
<date>19/2/2015</date>
<content>
Officially, the election on March 17 is among Israelis. Depending on how we  vote, either Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu will remain in office and form  the next government led by his Likud party, or Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni will  form a government.But unofficially, a far greater electoral drama is  unfolding. The choice is not between Netanyahu and Herzog/Livni. It is between  Netanyahu and US President Barack Obama.




As the White House sees it, if  Herzog/Livni form the next government, then Jerusalem will dance to Obama’s  tune. If Netanyahu is reelected, then the entire edifice of Obama’s Middle East  policy may topple and fall.Keep up to date on the latest opinion pieces on our new Opinion & Blogs Facebook page Secretary of State John Kerry made clear the  administration’s desire to topple Netanyahu last spring during his remarks  before the Trilateral Commission. It was during that memorable speech that Kerry  libeled Israel, claiming that we would automatically and naturally become an  apartheid state if we didn’t give Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria to the PLO,  Jew free, as quickly as possible.Despite Israel’s venality, Kerry held  out hope. In his words, “if there is a change of government [in Israel], or a  change of heart, something will happen.”Shortly after Kerry gave his  Israel apartheid speech, his Middle East mediator Martin Indyk attacked Israel  and the character of the Israeli people in an astounding interview to Yediot  Aharonot.Among other things, Indyk hinted that to force Israel to make  concessions demanded by the PLO, the Palestinians may need to launch another  terror war.Indyk also threatened that the Palestinians will get their  state whether Israel agrees to their terms of not. In his words, “They will get  their state in the end – whether through violence or by turning to international  organizations.”Indyk made his statements as an unnamed US official. When  his identity was exposed, he was forced to resign his position. 
Following his departure from government service he returned to his previous position as vice president of the Brookings Institution and the director of its foreign policy program. Last September, The New York Times reported that the  Brookings Institute received a $14.8 million, four-year donation from Qatar, the  chief financier of Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood.This week, Indyk was  back in Israel to speak at the annual conference of the Institute for National  Security Studies. There he provided us with a picture of what we can expect from  the Obama administration in its remaining two years in office if Netanyahu forms  the next government.On the Palestinian front, Indyk warned that Israel  shouldn’t be worried about the Palestinians getting an anti-Israel resolution  passed in the UN Security Council. Rather, it can expect that the US will join  with the other permanent members of the UN Security Council to pass a resolution  “against Israel’s will” that will “lay out the principle of a two-state  solution.”As Indyk intimated, Israel can avoid this fate if it elects a  Herzog/Livni government. Such a government, he indicated, will preemptively give  in to all of the Palestinians demands and so avoid a confrontation with the US  and its colleagues at the Security Council.Indyk explained, “If there is  a government in Israel after these elections that decides to pursue a two-state  solution, then there is a way forward. It begins with coordinating an initiative  with the United States. And then, together with the US, looking to Egypt and  Jordan and the resurrection of the Arab Peace Initiative.”As for Iran,  Indyk shrugged at Israel’s concerns over the agreement that Obama is now seeking  to conclude with the Iranian regime regarding its nuclear weapons program. That  agreement will leave Iran as a threshold nuclear state. Indyk suggested that the  US could assuage Israel’s concerns by signing a bilateral treaty with Israel  that would commit the US to do something if Iran passes some nuclear  threshold.There are only three problems with such a deal.First,  as former ambassador to the US Itamar Rabinovich noted, such a treaty would  likely render Israel unable to take independent action against Iranian nuclear  sites.Second, the US has a perfect track record of missing every major  nuclear advance by every country. US intelligence agencies were taken by  surprise when India, Pakistan and North Korea joined the nuclear club. They have  always underestimated Iranian nuclear activities and were taken by surprise,  repeatedly, by Syria’s nuclear proliferation activities. In other words, it  would be insane for Israel to trust that the US would act in a timely manner to  prevent Iran from crossing the nuclear threshold.Third of course is the  demonstrated lack of US will – particularly under the Obama administration – to  take any action that could prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. So  Israel has no reason whatsoever to believe that the US would honor its  commitment.But then, since the Obama administration believes that Herzog  and Livni will be compliant with its policies, the White House may expect the  two will agree to forgo Israel’s right to self-defense and place Israel’s  national security in relation to Iran in Obama’s hands.And this brings  us to the real contest unfolding in the lead-up to March 17.When Speaker  of the House of Representatives John Boehner announced last month that he had  invited Netanyahu to address the joint houses of Congress on the threat  emanating from Iran’s nuclear program and from radical Islam, he unintentionally  transformed the Israeli elections from a local affair to a contest between Obama  and Netanyahu.Obama’s response to Netanyahu’s speech has been  astounding. His ad hominem attacks against Netanyahu, his open moves to coerce  Democratic lawmakers to boycott Netanyahu’s speech, and the administration’s  aggressive attempts to damage Israel’s reputation in the US have been without  precedent. More than anything, they expose a deep-seated fear that Netanyahu  will be successful in exposing the grave danger that Obama’s policies toward  Iran and toward the Islamic world in general pose to the global  security.Those fears are reasonable for two reasons.First due to  a significant degree to the administration’s unhinged response to the news of  Netanyahu’s speech, Boehner’s invitation to Netanyahu sparked a long-belated  public debate in the US regarding Obama’s strategy of appeasing the Iranian  regime. Generally consistent Obama supporters like The Washington Post editorial  board have published stinging indictments of this policy in recent  weeks.These analyses have noted for the first time that in pursuing Iran, Obama is alienating and weakening America’s allies, enabling Iran to expand its nuclear program, and empowering Iran regionally as the US does nothing to prevent Iran’s takeover of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.Second,  it is possible that in his remarks about Iran and radical Islam, Netanyahu will  manage to discredit Obama’s approach to both issues. This is possible because  Obama’s approach is difficult to understand.Last week, following the  decapitation of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians by Islamic State, the Obama  administration stood alone in its refusal to note that the victims were murdered  because they were Christians. When Egypt retaliated for the massacre with air  strikes against Islamic State training camps and other facilities in Libya, the  Obama administration refused to support it ally. Instead it criticized Egypt for  acting on its own and called for a political solution in Libya, which is now  governed by two rival governments and has become a breeding ground for Islamic  State terrorists who transit Libya to Sinai.Following Islamic State’s  massacre of the Christians, the group’s leaders threatened to invade neighboring  Italy. Italy’s Prime Minister Matteo Renzi promised a strong response, and then  called on the UN Security Council to do something. The Obama administration  responded with coolness to a similar Egyptian call last week.Hamas  (which is supposedly much more moderate than Islamic State despite its intense  cooperation with Libya-trained Islamic State forces in Sinai) warned Italy not  to attack Islamic State in Libya, lest it be viewed in the words of Salah  Bardawil as beginning “a new crusade against Arab and Muslim  countries.”While all of this has been going on, Obama presided over his  much-touted international conference on Confronting Violent Extremism.  Reportedly attended by representatives from 60 countries, and featuring many  leaders of Muslim Brotherhood- linked groups like the Council on American-  Islamic Relations, Obama’s conference’s apparent goal was to deemphasize and  deny the link between terrorism and radical Islam.In his remarks on  Wednesday, Obama gave a lengthy defense of his refusal to acknowledge the link  between Islam and Islamic State, al-Qaida and other Islamic terrorist groups. He  insisted that these groups “have perverted Islam.”Obama indirectly  argued that the West is to blame for their behavior because of its supposed  historical mistreatment of Muslims. In his words, the “reality... is that  there’s a strain of thought that doesn’t embrace ISIL’s tactics, doesn’t embrace  violence, but does buy into the notion that the Muslim world has suffered  historic grievances, sometimes that’s accurate.”Obama’s insistence that  Islamic State and its ilk attack because of perceived Western misbehavior is  completely at odds with observed reality. As The Atlantic’s Graeme Wood  demonstrated this week in his in-depth report on Islamic State’s ideology and  goals, Islam is central to the group. Islamic State is an apocalyptic movement  rooted entirely in Islam.Most of the coverage of Netanyahu’s scheduled  speech before Congress has centered on his opposition to the deal Obama seeks to  conclude with Iran. But it may be that the second half of his speech – which  will be devoted to the threat posed by radical Islam – will be no less  devastating to Obama. Obama’s stubborn refusal to acknowledge the fact that the  greatest looming threats to global security today, including US national  security, stem from radical Islam indicates that he is unable to contend with  any evidence that jihadist Islam constitutes a unique threat unlike the threat  posed by Western chauvinism and racism.It is hard to understand either  Israel’s election or Obama’s hysterical response to Netanyahu’s scheduled speech  without recognizing that Obama clearly feels threatened by the message he will  deliver. Surrounded by sycophantic aides and advisers, and until recently  insulated from criticism by a supportive media, while free to ignore Congress  due to his veto power, Obama has never had to seriously explain his policies  regarding Iran and Islamic terrorists more generally. He has never endured a  direct challenge to those policies.
Today Obama believes that he is in a  to-the-death struggle with Netanyahu. If Netanyahu’s speech is a success, Obama’s  foreign policy will be indefensible. If Obama is able to delegitimize Netanyahu  ahead of his arrival, and bring about his electoral defeat, then with a  compliant Israeli government, he will face no obstacles to his plan to appease  Iran and blame Islamic terrorism on the West for the remainder of his tenure in  office.

<title>Column one: The power of Jewish indignation</title>
<date>20/8/2015</date>
<content>
Perhaps we should thank Spain’s Rotodom Sunsplash reggae festival organizers.  They just provided us with a textbook case both of the nature of today’s  anti-Semitism and of how to defeat it.Last weekend, the festival  organizers canceled their invitation to Matisyahu, the American-Jewish reggae  artist, because he refused to bow to the organizers’ demand that he publicly  support “Palestine.”




Matisyahu was the only known Jew in the festival  line-up and the only performer asked to produce such a statement.Rather  than take this lying down, on Monday Matisyahu recounted the episode on his  Facebook page, writing, “It was appalling and offensive that as the one publicly  Jewish-American artist scheduled for the festival they were trying to coerce me  into political statements.”Matisyahu’s disinvitation prompted a  worldwide Jewish outcry. The Foreign Ministry registered a complaint with the  Spanish government.

(BDS to Jpost : Matisyahu justified Israeli crimes)Every major American Jewish organization and several  European Jewish organizations condemned the blatant discrimination against  Matisyahu.On Tuesday, Spain’s main newspaper, El Pais, condemned the  festival’s anti-Semitism. The Spanish government followed hours later.On  Wednesday, the festival organizers issued a groveling apology to Matisyahu and  officially reinstated his invitation to perform.The organizers claim  they were intimidated into discriminating against Matisyahu by a local  anti-Israel BDS group. BDS País Valencià resorted to “pressures, threats and  coercion” and warned the organizers that its members would “seriously disrupt  the normal functioning of the festival.”There are two main lessons  here.First, the BDS movement does not seek to end the so-called  occupation of Judea, Samaria and Jerusalem. It does not seek peace.By  demanding that an American Jew denounce Israel as a condition for performing,  the BDS movement made clear that the only Jews it is willing to countenance are  anti-Semitic Jews. The only Jews BDS activists will accept in the public square  are those who join them in denouncing Israel and denouncing Jews who support  Israel.In other words, the goal of BDS is deny Jews civil rights. All  participants in the movement – whether non-Jews or Jews – are anti-Semites,  because they all seek to boot from public life Jews who disagree with  them.The second lesson of the Matisyahu affair is that it is possible to  defeat these haters. The festival organizers discriminated against Matisyahu  because they feared the Jew-hating mob more than they valued his artistry. They  are now groveling at his feet because the pushback they received from world  Jewry for their behavior knocked them to their knees.When Jews stand up  to anti-Semites, the anti-Semites back down.In the West today, the  hardest part about standing up to anti-Semites is that most anti-Semites and the  most powerful anti-Semitic movements are on the Left, where most Western Jews  have traditionally situated themselves.Although the US is far less  anti-Semitic than Europe, ironically, it is in the US where Jews have the  hardest time defending themselves. The relative mildness of anti-Semitism in the  US makes anti-Semitic Jews feel comfortable joining anti-Semitic non-Jews in  weakening Israel and the Jewish community.Their involvement in  anti-Semitic organizations, in turn, together with the relative weakness of the  threat in comparison to Europe, inhibits mainstream Jewish groups from  discrediting hostile Jews and hostile groups.J Street has played a major  role in recent years in subverting attempts to achieve Jewish unity on issues  related both to Israel and to fighting anti-Semitism on college  campuses.Case in point is the communal division over President Barack  Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran.This week, 340 rabbis signed a  letter to Congress calling on lawmakers to support Obama’s nuclear deal with the  world’s greatest state sponsor of terrorism. The letter received significant  publicity in the US and contributed to a sense that the Jewish community stands  with Obama against Israel in relation to the nuclear pact.But whereas  the organizers claimed that the signatories represented all streams of American  Judaism, according to an analysis undertaken by the Zionist Organization of  America, 187 of the signatories are members of J Street’s “Rabbinic  Cabinet.”The ZOA revealed as well that Ameinu, the Jewish group that  organized the letter, is a J Street front group. Its National President Kenneth  Bob also serves as J Street’s treasurer. Its Vice President and Executive  Committee Chairwoman Judith Gelman is also a J Street official.J Street  is so radical that its student group J Street U just elected a Muslim to serve  as its national president.President Amna Farooqi announced that J Street  U is not a pro-Israel group. In her words, “We are not here to talk about the  pro-Israel conversation on campus. We are here to talk about the occupation.”  She declared that J Street U will dedicated itself to “yearlong anti-occupation  work.”Part of the reason the community has avoided taking J Street on is  because of its deep ties to the Obama White House. For six years the White House  has used J Street as a strategic weapon of influence. J Street’s assigned role  is to prevent the Jewish community from opposing the administration’s rank  hostility toward Israel and block Jewish criticism of the administration’s  willingness to countenance and legitimize anti-Semitic allegations. These  include Secretary of State John Kerry’s libelous accusations that Israel is  about to become an apartheid state and that Israelis are uninterested in peace  as well as Obama’s recent insinuations that there is something basically  treacherous about American Jewish support for Israel.It is a sign of J  Street’s power that although the 340 activists who signed the J Street-inspired,  pro-Iran rabbis’ letter to Congress make up just 6 percent of the rabbis in  America, and although American Jews oppose the deal 2 to 1, neither the Reform  and Conservative movements nor the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish  Organizations has agreed to openly oppose the deal.Then again, for a  group with a direct line to the White House and apparently unlimited amounts of  money, convincing a community that voted for Obama 3 to 1 twice to side with the  White House against Israel should have been a piece of cake. And yet, the fact  is that despite all of its advantages, while the Conservative and Reform  movements haven’t come out in opposition to the deal, they also haven’t come out  in support of it.On Wednesday, the Reform movement issued a statement  announcing it would refuse to take a stand on the issue. Although purportedly  neutral, the statement criticized the administration’s employment of  anti-Semitism in its attacks against opponents of the deal, stating, “We are  concerned... with the possibility that some will use the debate as fuel for  anti-Semitic views.”With even the Reform movement denying its support,  it is hard to imagine the administration will be able to secure the support of  any major Jewish groups outside of J Street and the NJDC – the official Jewish  wing of the Democratic Party.In part, J Street’s failure is a testament  to the overwhelming support for Israel among American Jews. In part, it owes to  communal anger at Obama’s anti-Semitic bating of his Jewish  opponents.But a large share of the credit for blocking Obama’s attempts  to split the community goes to Israel’s skillful diplomacy, which has challenged  and empowered normally diffident Jewish leaders to stand up to the White House  and withstand its pressure.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s  willingness to confront Obama directly and explain over and over why Obama’s  deal endangers Israel makes it difficult for American Jewish leaders to support  it. They cannot take Obama’s word for it when Netanyahu shows them how the deal  guarantees Iran will acquire nuclear weapons, be well placed to achieve its goal  of regional hegemony and develop the means to attack the US with nuclear  warheads.There is a lesson here about the role of Israeli diplomats in  fighting anti-Semitism in the West and cultivating Jewish unity in defense of  Jewish rights, even as leftist Jews seek to undermine that unity.The  lesson is that there is no point in trying to reach compromises with  anti-Semites, or with those pushing agendas that endanger Israel and threaten  the civil rights of Jewish communities in the West. Israel gains the most by  demanding the most and patiently, clearly and convincingly justifying its  demands.Israel empowers Western Jews – including leftist American Jews –  to stand with it, and to stand for their rights by unapologetically defending it  and its rights.This basic truth demonstrates why Israelis should be  heartened rather than concerned about Netanyahu’s ambassadorial  appointments.His designated ambassador to Italy, Fiamma Nirenstein, has  devoted her life to defending Israel and Jewish rights and fighting  anti-Semitism in Europe. Netanyahu’s decision to appoint her to Rome is a clear  sign that he is putting an end to the pathetic mollycoddling of anti-Israel  forces in the hopes of appeasing them that has characterized Israel’s diplomacy  for decades.The concerns of some Italian Jews that Nirenstein’s  appointment will raise allegations of dual loyalties against the community are  proof not that Netanyahu made a mistake in appointing the famous Italian-Jewish  journalist and former member of the Italian parliament to represent Israel, but  that he was right to appoint her.Only a fighter like Nirenstein who  knows Italian culture inside and out can ensure that such allegations are  discredited and that anti-Semites feel the same heat that the organizers of the  reggae festival in Spain felt this week.Netanyahu’s decision to appoint  Danny Danon as ambassador to the UN springs from the same willingness to  confront rather than appease anti-Semites. Danon’s unapologetic defense of  Israel’s rights to Judea and Samaria has been attacked by the Left as proof that  he will be unable to get along at the UN.But Israel of course cannot get  along at the UN. The only way for it to successfully defend itself in a body  dedicated to delegitimizing it is by fighting for its rights every single day.  That is why someone who makes no apologies and doesn’t worry about being loved  is exactly the person Israel needs at the UN.
Matisyahu’s ejection and  reinstatement at a reggae festival is a small story in the vast scope of events  today. But it tells us that we can fight effectively for our rights against the  anti-Semites on the Left. We can defend our rights and defeat our enemies on the  Left if we stick to our guns and empower our fellow Jews – including leftist  Jews – to do the same.

<title>Confronting European anti-Semitism</title>
<date>1/2/2015</date>
<content>
I just completed a  three-day visit to Prague and the former Terezin concentration camp. I was there  to speak at a conference commemorating the 70th anniversary of the liberation of  the Nazi death camps. Many European speakers talked about the efforts they are  making to confront the rising tide of anti-Semitism throughout Europe. But  before one can decide how to confront a sickness like anti-Semitism, one must  first describe and diagnose the pathology.There are several distinct,  but sometimes overlapping, types of anti-Semitism. The first is traditional,  right-wing, fascist Jew hatred that has historically included theological,  racial, economic, social, personal and cultural aspects. We are seeing a  resurgence of this today in Greece, Hungary and other European countries with  rising right-wing parties that are anti-Muslim as well as  anti-Jewish.




The second is Muslim anti-Semitism. Just as not all Greeks  and Hungarians are anti-Semitic, so too not all Muslims suffer from this malady.  But far too many do.It is wrong to assume that only Muslims who manifest  Jew hatred through violence harbor anti-Semitic views. Recent polls show an  extraordinarily high incidence of anti-Semitism – hatred of Jews as individuals,  as a group and as a religion – throughout North Africa, the Middle East and  Muslim areas in Europe. This hatred manifests itself not only in words, but in  deeds, such as taunting Jews who wear kippot, vandalizing Jewish institutions,  and occasional violence directed at individual Jews. Among a small number of  extremists it also results in the kind of deadly violence we have seen in  Toulouse, Paris, Brussels and other parts of Europe. Several decades ago it  manifested itself in attacks on synagogues by Palestinian terrorists, including  some operating on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization.Third,  there is hard Left anti-Zionism that sometimes melds into subtle and  occasionally overt anti-Semitism. This pathology is seen in the double standard  imposed on everything Jewish, including the nation-state of the Jewish people.  It is also reflected in blaming “Jewish power,” and the “pushiness” of Jews in  demanding support for Israel. I’m not referring to criticism of Israeli policies  or actions.I’m referring to the singling out of Israel for extreme  demonization. The ultimate form of this pathology is the absurd comparison made  by some extreme leftist between the extermination of policies of the Nazis and  of Israel’s efforts to defend itself against terrorist rockets, tunnels, suicide  bombers and other threats to its civilians.Comparing Israel’s actions to  those of the Nazis is a not-so-subtle version of Holocaust denial. Because if  all the Nazis really did was what Israel is now doing, there could not have been  a Holocaust or an attempt at genocide against the Jewish people. A variation on  this perverse theme is apartheid denial: by accusing Israel – which accords  equal rights to all its citizens – of apartheid, these haters deny the horrors  of actual apartheid, which was so much more horrible than anything Israel has  ever done.Fourth, and most dangerous, is eliminationist anti-Zionism and  anti-Semitism of the kind advocated by the leaders of Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas,  and Islamic State. Listen to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah: “If [the Jews]  all gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of going after them  worldwide,” or, “If we search the entire world for a person more cowardly,  despicable, weak and feeble in psyche, mind, ideology and religion, we would not  find anyone like the Jew. Notice I didn’t say the Israeli.”These  variations on the theme of anti-Semitism have several elements in common. First,  they tend to engage in some form of Holocaust denial, minimization,  glorification or comparative victimization.Second, they exaggerate  Jewish power, money and influence. Third, they seek the delegitimation and  demonization of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people. Fourth, they  impose a double standard on all things Jewish.Finally, they nearly all  deny that they are anti-Semites who hate all Jews. They claim that their hatred  is directed against Israel and Jews who support the nation-state of the Jewish  people.This common form of the new anti-Semitism – we love the Jews,  it’s only their nation-state that we hate – is pervasive among many European  political, media, cultural and academic leaders. It was evident even among some  who came to commemorate the liberation of the death camps. A recent poll among  Germans showed a significant number of the children, grandchildren and  great-grandchildren of Nazi supporters didn’t want to hear about Nazi  atrocities, but believed what Israel was doing to the Palestinians was  comparable to what the Nazis had done to the Jews.This then is the  European problem of anti-Semitism that many European leaders are unwilling to  confront, because they have a built in excuse! It’s Israel’s fault – if only  Israel would do the right thing with regard to the Palestinians, the problem  would be solved.Tragically, it won’t be solved, because the reality is  that hatred of Israel is not the cause of anti-Semitism.
Rather, it is  the reverse: anti-Semitism is a primary cause of hatred for the nation-state of  the Jewish people.

<title>Containing the link between BDS and anti-Semitism</title>
<date>3/6/2015</date>
<content>
From the FIFA saga to the recommendation of the UN Secretary-General’s envoy to  include the IDF on a blacklist of countries accused of regularly causing harm to  children, Israelis are becoming more aware of Israel’s (problematic) standing in  the international arena. A serious issue often brushed off as  anti-Semitism.The BDS (Boycott, divestment, sanctions) movement, working  to ostracize Israel from the international community, is indeed partly motivated  by sheer anti-Semitism. This is most apparent from the rhetoric relayed by BDS  activists who target the Jewish state and too often draw blatant comparisons  between Jews and Nazis. In this respect, elements of the BDS campaign are not  only rooted in anti-Semitism, but play a significant role in generating  anti-Semitism.




Nevertheless, over-emphasizing the role that anti-Semitism  plays in global BDS – be it blatant anti-Semitism or more “sophisticated”  anti-Semitic anti-Zionism – is counterproductive. This is because such an  approach substantially limits Israel’s ability to combat the phenomenon:  anti-Semitism has existed for as long as the Jews have and the ultimate answer  to anti-Semitism is the existence of the Jewish state – a place of refuge for  Jews worldwide. A set of tools developed to deal with global anti-Semitism,  however, is illequipped to combat BDS and rehabilitate Israel’s image in the  international arena.
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}In searching for additional elements which fuel BDS  activity, two relatively simple factors should be singled out from many others  that make up the larger, complex puzzle.The first is the mere ability of  a trans-national, well-funded, organized civil society movement, such as BDS, to  taint Israel’s image in the international arena. Seen through this lens, the  obsessive attention with Israel’s follies thrives on the motivation to pressure  Israel into granting Palestinians self-determination. This course of action is  modeled after the struggle of black South Africans to eliminate apartheid in the  mid-1980s.Similarly to what we see with Israel now, South Africa was not  the only country during the 1980s to violate human rights.The UN  rationale for investing immense resources in the South African struggle –  including the establishment of a Special Committee against Apartheid (comprised  of 19 states) and the UN Center against Apartheid which serviced it – was that  sensitizing the international community would pressure the government of South  Africa to amend its racist policies. While Israel is by no means an apartheid  state, BDS leaders are undoubtedly aware of her vulnerability to external,  international pressure. They well realize that internationalizing the conflict  can effectively transform limited Palestinian power into meaningful social  power.The second element which is downplayed when analyzing BDS through  an anti-Semitic-tainted lens is the moral grounding that this campaign bases  itself upon. Human rights discourse is currently the normative lingua franca,  and it is locked in a zero-sum game with a security- based discourse. While the  BDS narrative relates to human rights – Israel’s counter-narrative relates to  security.Also relevant to the moral grounding element is the BDS appeal  to anti-colonialism, which has become an increasingly important value of the  liberal Left. Israel’s obvious inability to live up to this value as long as it  is entrenched in a conflict with the Palestinians has tarnished Israel’s moral  grounding not only among fervent pro-Palestinians but also among those who  perceive themselves as supporting the liberal Left at-large, including minority  groups and LGBT supporters.Thus, supporters of the BDS campaign – and  its attractive moral grounding – are often unaware of the convoluted reality at  the base of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.In developing a toolbox to  deal with the BDS movement, then, it would be wise to step back from the  anti-Semitic paradigm and allocate it only relative weight in light of many  other factors which nurture the phenomenon and which warrant a different set of  tools. Also of note is that the dismissal of a certain part of Israel’s  criticism as mere anti-Semitism contributes to a growing global frustration with  Israel’s lack of ability to deal with relevant criticism – from which no country  is immune.

<title>Debating against BDS - and winning</title>
<date>3/11/2015</date>
<content>
When I was invited to debate in favor of the motion “Is BDS Wrong?” at the  Oxford Union, I fully expected to lose the vote of the 250 or so students and  faculty who are members of the oldest debating society in the world. “Israel  always loses at Oxford,” I was warned by colleagues who had debated other  Israel-related issues. Nonetheless I decided to participate, hoping to change  some minds.I proposed as my opponent Omar Barghouti, the Qatari-born,  Israeli-educated, co-founder and spokesperson of the BDS movement, but he  refused to debate me. The Union then selected Noura Erekat, a  Palestinian-American human rights attorney, who has been a vocal supporter of  BDS.




When she backed out at the last minute, I began to get suspicious:  was the BDS movement boycotting me? After all, BDS advocates have called for  “common sense” academic boycotts against individuals who they feel are too vocal  in their support for Israel, in addition to a blanket boycott of all Israeli  academic institutions. After speaking with the organizers of the debate at  Oxford, I continue to believe that I was in fact being boycotted.The  Union then selected Peter Tatchell, a distinguished and popular British human  rights activist who has participated in 30 Union debates, most of which he has  won. I knew I was in for a difficult time, especially when the audience  applauded his points more loudly than mine and when many of the questions seemed  hostile toward Israel, though polite.Mr. Tatchell’s main argument was  that BDS was a nonviolent form of protest against Israel’s occupation and  settlement policies that mirrored the boycott movement against apartheid South  Africa, and followed the principles of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. He  was articulate in arguing that boycott tactics generally were a nonviolent  alternative to war and terrorism.The force of his argument was somewhat  weakened by the recent spate of terrorist knife attacks by Palestinians against  Israelis, which leaders of the BDS movement such as Barghouti have justified as  resistance to the “decades-old regime of occupation.”I argued that BDS  was not an alternative to war but rather an alternative to peaceful negotiations  by the Palestinian leadership. This is because the BDS movement is firmly  opposed to the twostate solution. Barghouti confirmed as much when he said  “definitely, most definitely, we oppose a Jewish state in any part of  Palestine.” Thus, the BDS movement makes it more difficult for the Palestinian  leadership to accept the kind of painful compromises that both sides must agree  to if there is to be a negotiated resolution.Together with other efforts  to delegitimize and isolate Israel, BDS also sends a false message to the  Palestinian street: namely, that international economic and political pressure  can force Israel to capitulate to all Palestinian demands, without any  compromise on territorial issues. In turn, this disincentivizes the Palestinian  leadership from accepting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s offer to begin  immediate negotiations with no preconditions.Such discussions are  particularly important now, to halt the gruesome cycle of violence that has  intensified in recent weeks. Both sides must return to the negotiations table,  and both must be willing to make concessions. For the Israelis this means  rolling back settlements, and granting greater autonomy to the West Bank; for  the Palestinian Authority, it means renouncing violence against Israeli  civilians, disavowing Hamas and other terrorist organizations, and accepting the  need for territorial compromise with land swaps.BDS opposes any effort  at negotiation that isn’t premised on the recognition that Israel is an  apartheid state.Indeed, many of its leaders refuse to recognize the  right of Israel to exist as a nation-state for the Jewish people. In so doing,  they are empowering radicals on both sides of the issue who have no desire to  see a peaceful resolution to the conflict.Many liberal activists such as  Mr.Tatchell – whose advocacy on behalf of LGBT rights I greatly admire –  have made common cause with BDS, hoping to pressure Israel to end the  occupation, and afford greater self-determination to Palestinians in the West  Bank.They seem to believe that a movement advocating nonviolent tactics  is necessarily the best way to achieve a lasting peace. But BDS is radically  opposed to any negotiated settlement, and has increasingly begun to regroup  bigots of all stripes who feel comfortable with the language used by its  leaders, such Mr. Barghouti.Mr. Tatchell and many pro-BDS academics also  feel that Israel has committed human rights violations both in the occupation of  the West Bank, and in its prosecution of the armed conflicts in Gaza. During the  course of the debate I issued the following challenge to the audience and to my  opponent: name a single country in the history of the world, faced with threats  comparable to those faced by Israel, that has a better record of human rights,  compliance with the rule of law and seeking to minimize civilian  casualties.I invited audience members to shout out the name of a  country. Complete silence. Finally someone shouted “Iceland,” and everyone  laughed. When the best is treated as the worst, in the way the BDS movement  singles out Israel for accusation, the finger of blame must be pointed at the  accusers rather than the accused. In the end, the case against BDS won not  because of the comparative skill of the debaters but because I was able to  expose the moral weakness of the BDS movement itself.

<title>December 29: False Optimism</title>
<date>28/12/2015</date>
<content>
False optimism I do admire Gershon Baskin’s optimism in “Yes it is difficult to  make peace” (Encountering Peace, December 24). But it seems to me that his  reasoning is based on false premises.




He says “Life would be much easier  if we had nicer enemies.”And implies that one makes peace with one’s  enemies.History teaches us that this is not true. Peace is established  when people decide not to be enemies (England and France for example) or when  one enemy has be totally destroyed (the end of World War II).Baskin  starts by taking to task the Palestinian leadership for having refused every  offer Israel has made, but he doesn’t remind us that Oslo was an (ill-fated)  Israeli initiative. Was Israel irresponsible? He states that many Palestinian  leaders are filled with hate but does not single out President Mahmoud Abbas’s  long list of incitements, not to mention his doctorate linking Zionism with the  Holocaust. Isn’t that irresponsible? But then he states that both sides have  just claims, that both sides are responsible. By his words, Baskin is fueling  the perpetuation of the conflict: responsibility will be heaped upon Israel, and  Israel will be pushed, once again, to make “painful concessions.”When he  brings forth the example of the Christmas party where people from all sides  mingled peacefully, they have to be kept in an anonymity. It is not difficult to  understand why.His optimism would be served best if he used his  influence on the Palestinian people and leadership to arrive at the decision to  stop being enemies (a first step could be to publicly disavow the spate of  stabbings we witness every day).Once that is achieved, the path to the  negotiating table is short. The great majority of Israelis are  ready.DANIEL BRAUNSCHVIG 
Jerusalem Spoiled night Bethlehem Christians  are fully aware that their Christmas celebrations were spoiled by Palestinian  incitement and terrorism and not by a “wall,” (“Abbas’s Christmas message bashes  Israel’s ‘apartheid regime,’ December 24).The hundreds who attended  religious prayers traveled to and from Bethlehem unhindered by “settlers.” Those  who came from abroad were not put off by “checkpoints.” They had to come through  checkpoints at their domestic airports – checkpoint security required by the  threat of terrorism.The ones that stayed away did not do so because of  “settlements” but out of fear of knife-wielding Palestinian killers.Most  Christians are fully aware of the facts on the ground here and are not deceived  by a fraudulent Palestinian narrative.Not even the one that says Jesus  is a Palestinian messenger.

BARRY SHAW 
Netanya Back check It is difficult  to understand why it has taken several years for Israel to recognize and give  voice to the harm the organization Breaking the Silence is doing and,  shamefully, its growing popularity with (some) Jewish organizations as  spokespeople to Diaspora Jewry, not only in the US, but in Britain  too.It’s that foothold that has engineered the donations that Israel now  seeks to halt. The question is why weren’t their activities nipped in the bud  from the beginning? Every battle is an act of self-preservation and no army in  the midst of battle will act like angels, not the British army nor the American  army, but I cannot imagine either the government of the United Kingdom nor the  United States administration allowing their retired military personnel to travel  round the world, addressing gatherings specifically to damn their own country  and its defenders such as Israel has permitted and is permitting.

LEILA  CUMBER 
London Act of kindness The comparison of an injured terrorist to a  “driver who caused the accident” is absurd, (“No Kindness,” Editorial, December  27). The key word at the end of the sentence is “accident.” A terrorist sets out  to intentionally kill and wound his or her victims.A terrorist is an  enemy.The injuries are no accident.No, we should not give  priority to injured terrorist ahead of a victim of terror. ZAKA performs a  hessed, and an act of kindness begins at home.

MOSHE BODNER 
Jerusalem Watch the watchers I’ve been a fan of Caroline Glick’s writings for years. Now  I’m trying to re-read her latest article, “Israel’s home-grown enemies” (Column  One, December 25), and discover how she got from point A to point B.In  the first part, Glick reminds us of the shenanigans of Avishai Raviv. He was an  agent provocateur employed by the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) in the  1990s. He even made and filmed a false swearing-in ceremony of a bogus  “terrorist group” that he himself ran, and invited reporters to witness the  event. One does wonder, out of all the thousands of weddings these days, how did  Channel 10 get to know about this one? Who invited them? Even the discussions on  the radio these days are eerily similar to the 1990s: “Who are the rabbis of  these kids?” Why should we believe the Shin Bet this time? Does Glick have  information that the rest of us don’t have? These kids (who were thrown out of  their yeshivot, and some even shunned by their own parents) remind me of the  hapless juvenile delinquents in the brilliant song, “Officer Krupke” from West  Side Story. Everyone is using them for their own purposes.Glick pointed  out that it’s hard to believe the Shin Bet now, remembering how they demonized  the whole religious community in the 1990s. So why does she believe them this  time? Why even equate them with our Arab enemies? How did she get to that? I  would ask, who will police the police? Or as British spy novel writer John le  Carré says in one of his recurrent themes, “who will watch the watchers? THELMA  JACOBSON Petah Tikva Apt conclusion In December 25’s editorial, “100 days of  terrorism,” the author states that perhaps by now “the Palestinians will reach  the conclusion that they have made their point and the violence will subside.”  Frankly, one would have hoped that they would by now have long concluded that  their best guarantor of peace, freedom and tolerance in the anarchic Middle  East, is a strong Israel.Sadly, your conclusion here too, is apt:  “Judging by experience, however, this possibility is unlikely.”IRVING  WIESEN 
Jerusalem Basic point In response to Benny A. Benjamin’s letter, (“No  excuses,” December 25), which relates to the article of Rabbi Shlomo Riskin’s  article on the Chief Rabbinate, the essence of the scholarly approach that Rabbi  Riskin promotes, is, yes, believe it or not, not all those that are chief rabbis  have the knowledge of the Conservative Movement in America.
And this  attitude that Rabbi Riskin so admirably portrays is an attitude that allows the  dialogue to live on, that ensures that while he clearly makes his point, Rabbi  Riskin does not for a moment forget that the fundamental nature of keiruv  halevavot (Jewish outreach), is in understanding from where the other is  standing. Isn’t that the basic point from where the remark of the “serious  error” came to birth?

<title>Demographic intifada</title>
<date>3/1/2015</date>
<content>
“There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and  statistics.” This quote, usually ascribed to Mark Twain, aptly describes the  latest propaganda assault by the statisticians of the Palestinian  Authority.Last week’s report by the Palestinian Central Bureau of  Statistics on the Palestinian population residing in the geographical area  bordered by the Jordan River on the east, the Mediterranean on the west, and  from the Gaza Strip to Lebanon, gleefully predicts that the number of  Palestinians will overtake the number of Israel’s Jews by  2016.




Predictably, the report set off a scurry of conflicting  interpretations by Israeli statisticians of the Left and Right, each claiming  the accuracy of its conclusions – which not coincidentally fit their opposing  agendas. But both groups of social scientists insisted there were political  motivations behind the Palestinian numbers.One school cast doubt on the  accuracy of the statistics, arguing that they were meant to frighten Israel into  making concessions in the run-up to a Palestinian state. The other upheld the  notion that they accurately predicted Israel’s Jews being overwhelmed by a  growing Arab population that would inevitably turn Israel into an apartheid  state.While perhaps the data don’t lie in the sense of “damned lies,”  the conflicting interpretations of the statistics reflect political agendas at  work. For one thing, the world media’s gullibility in its blind acceptance of  the Palestinian figures is mainly due to not unquestioning the statistics  assembled by the PA bureau, as if it were a true national authority and as such  beyond reproach. For another, the cancerous growth of the mindless BDS movement,  especially in academia, has made even social scientists eager to accept bad news  about Israel.At first glance, the Palestinian Central Bureau of  Statistics report on data it collected during 2014 seems  straightforward.It calculated the number of Palestinians in the world at  approximately 12.1 million, of whom 4.62 million live in the West Bank and Gaza,  1.46 million live in Israel, 5.34 million in Arab countries, and some 675,000 in  other countries.Ominously, the report predicts that the number of  Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza will equal the number of Jews in Israel  at about 6.42 million in 2016, if current growth rates remain constant. Worse,  it predicted that, by 2021, the number of Palestinians will outnumber Jews by  7.14 million to 6.87 million Jews. If the numbers are true, Israel’s legitimacy  is being challenged on a new front – sort of a demographic intifada.As  in previous intifadas, views of the conflict differ among Israelis. There are  basically two competing narratives.One side considers the Palestinian  demographic predictions a threat to Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic  state, thus urgently requiring the achievement of the two-state  solution.The other side favors alternative statistics and plays down the  need for a settlement, which it anyways argues the Palestinians aren’t really  interested in. It cites data that indicate more moderate changes among the  Palestinians and a substantial growth of Israel’s Jewish  population.Whatever the prevalent Israeli interpretation will be, the  government has enough fact to act upon: The Palestinians have the strategic goal  of imposing a solution on Israel via the United Nations, ironically demanding a  second chance to get the state they could have had in 1947 but violently  rejected.Their new tactic in their ongoing campaign to delegitimize  Israel is to utilize demography as a political tool.Prof. Sergio  DellaPergola, a Hebrew University expert on demography, told The Jerusalem Post  that “the Palestinian data must be scrutinized carefully, as they do not  constitute the only possible source to assess the demography.”Former  ambassador Yoram Ettinger, a member of the American- Israel Demographic Research  Group, told the Post that there are many flaws in the Palestinian  numbers.Essentially, he said, the Palestinian bureau had overestimated  the numbers in the West Bank by 1.1 million. As such, the report’s West Bank  number of 2.83 million residents is really 1.7 million, and the claimed 1.79  million in Gaza is really 1.4 million.
There are other flaws, but one  objective statistic is comforting. Ettinger notes that the Jewish fertility and  immigration rates continue to grow, while the Arab fertility rate is slowing.  Accordingly, birth patterns are now weighted toward the Jewish population: the  Palestinian fertility rate has dropped from 5 babies per mother in 2000 to 2.9  today, while the Jewish birth rate is slightly over 3 babies per mother – and  increasing.

<title>Demonizing Israel with false moral equivalence</title>
<date>24/2/2015</date>
<content>
Rhetoric plays a major role in the demonization of Israel. Besides  the use of lies, the dissemination of false arguments is among the major  demonization techniques. It is thus important that those who publicly defend  Israel be trained to see through such tactics. One prominent technique used  against Israel is false moral equivalence. It is based on the deceitful claim  that there is no difference between two greatly dissimilar  actions. Comparisons by nature easily lend themselves to abuse. Examples  abound and only some of the most frequent ones can be mentioned here. Several go  beyond the realm of common sense. A prominent one is the perverse claim that  Israel’s behavior is equivalent to that of Nazi Germany or the Nazis. This  example of false moral equivalence is widespread throughout Europe. Five studies  covering nine European countries show that about 40 percent of Europeans think  that Israel is a “Nazi state.” 




Another version of this falsehood is that Israel  is exterminating the Palestinians. This belief is also widespread as  found in European polls. Yet another variant of this false comparison is  “Zionism is fascism.” When speaking at the Fifth Alliance of Civilizations Forum  in Vienna in February 2013, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayipp Erdogan stated,  “Just like Zionism, anti-Semitism and fascism, it becomes unavoidable that  Islamophobia must be regarded as a crime against humanity.” This statement was  immediately criticized by US Secretary of State John Kerry, UN Secretary General  Ban Ki-moon, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Keep up to date on the latest opinion pieces on our new Opinion & Blogs Facebook pageSince false  comparisons are so easily made, a great variety of them are used against Israel.  The false moral equivalence of Zionism and racism was a tactic created by the  Soviet Union to justify its refusal to condemn anti-Semitism. This political  strategy was initially used in an attempt to expel Israel from the United  Nations in the 1960s. Although it failed, the Soviet Union, its satellite states  and its Arab allies eventually succeeded in 1975 in passing UN resolution 3379.  It determined that “Zionism is a form of racism and racial  discrimination.”Yet another example of false moral equivalence  frequently used to demonize Israel is labeling Israel an apartheid state. Former  US president Jimmy Carter is among those who made this false comparison, in the  title of his 2006 book, Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid.Israeli left-wing  journalist Benjamin Pogrund’s book Drawing Fire has as its subtitle  “Investigating the Accusations of Apartheid in Israel.” The author says in a  personal note in the book: “I was treated for stomach cancer at one of Israel’s  leading hospitals, Hadassah Mt. Scopus in Jerusalem. The surgeon (he was the  head surgeon) was Jewish, the anesthetist was Arab. The doctors and  nurses who cared for me were Jews and Arabs. During four and a half weeks as a  patient, I watched Arab and Jewish patients get the same devoted treatment. A  year or so later, the head surgeon retired; he was replaced by a doctor who is  an Arab. Since then, I’ve been in hospital clinics and emergency  rooms. Everything is the same for everyone. Israel is like apartheid  South Africa? Ridiculous.”Another popular false moral equivalence used  is the idea that Israel represents a colonial power in the Middle East.  Historian Richard Landes exposed the hypocrisy of this moral equivalence. He  wrote about the benign nature of Zionist settlements in Ottoman and British  Palestine, sharply contrasting from the imperial aspirations of European powers  at the time. “Rather than arrive as zero-sum military victors, the Zionists  arrived as positive-sum neighbors,” writes Landes.Yet another use of  false moral equivalence is comparing the Holocaust to the Nakba, the  “catastrophe” or creation of the State of Israel. Many have adopted this false  moral equivalence. The Holocaust and Nakba are far from similar, however. The  Holocaust was a planned, industrial genocide. The Palestinian Nakba was a direct  result of the refusal of Palestinians to accept the existence of Israel, which  led to their major military defeat.Another category of moral equivalence  implies that the intentional murder of innocent civilians is equivalent to the  accidental deaths of civilians in military actions. In March 2012, European  Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton compared the deaths of innocent  people, such as the Jewish children killed in Toulouse, France, by serial  killers, and brutal dictators like Syria’s Bashar Assad, to the accidental  deaths of civilians due to Israeli retaliatory actions in Gaza. Justice Minister  Tzipi Livni reacted by saying, “There is no similarity between an act of hatred  or a leader killing members of his nation and a country fighting terror, even if  civilians are harmed.”Many so-called humanitarian NGOs are frequent  abusers of false moral equivalence. Even when writing brief statements about the  human rights violations imposed upon Israeli soldier Gilad Schalit when he was  kidnapped and imprisoned by Hamas terrorists for over five years, the reports by  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch chose to bring attention to the  false moral equivalence of a kidnapped Schalit and the Palestinian terrorists  sentenced by the courts to serve time in Israeli jails.Says American  lawyer Alan Dershowitz, “Every single prisoner held by Israel has judicial  review available to him or her and some have won release. Every one of them has  access to Red Cross visitation, can communicate with family, and has a known  whereabout.Kidnapped Israeli soldiers on the other hand are kept  incommunicado by criminal elements, are routinely tortured, often murdered (as  occurred recently), and have no access to the Red Cross or judicial  review.Moreover, the prisoners being held by Israel are terrorists –  that is, unlawful combatants. Many are murderers who have been convicted and  sentenced in accordance with due process. The ‘women’ and ‘children’ are guilty  of having murdered or attempted to murder innocent babies and other  non-combatants. The soldiers who were kidnapped are lawful combatants subject to  prisoner of war status.”Dershowitz mentioned that Hamas or Hezbollah  would not treat the Israeli soldiers in the same manner that Israel treats its  prisoners, because “they are terrorist organizations who do not operation within  the rule of the law.”Many more false moral equivalences can be  mentioned. Israel’s public defenders and diplomats have, for the most  part, not been trained to recognize and systematically fight against abusive  moral equivalence. The damage caused by these demonization tactics should be  addressed and dealt with by those who are in the public eye. The same is true  for other false arguments that are frequently used, such as sentimental appeals,  double standards and scapegoating. Failing to combat false moral equivalence is  one of the many Israeli shortcomings in the war of words to which its government  authorities should give far more serious attention.

<title>Encountering peace: Abbas is still the leader who can make peace</title>
<date>7/10/2015</date>
<content>
Let’s start with the basics – Mahmoud Abbas is not popular among his own people.  He is way down in the polls and if elections were held now, he would not win. In  the eyes of his own people he has lost his legitimacy – and not only because he  was elected in 2005 for what was supposed to be a four-year term and there have  not been elections since (let’s recall that Oslo was a five-year interim deal,  and that was in 1993). Abbas has little legitimacy because he has failed to  deliver on the promise that he made to his people following the second intifada  – an end to the Israeli occupation and the creation of a Palestinian state  without using violence.Abbas and the Palestinian Authority have not been  the cause of the recent round of violence. It is easy for the Israeli government  and prime minister to point a finger at him and accuse him of everything wrong  that happens in the country. Yes it is true that some of his remarks in his UN  speech and other statements that he made recently were horrible and were  perceived as lies and as incitement by Israel. No Palestinian would see them as  lies. If you were a Palestinian living in the West Bank how would you describe  the legal situation there – two peoples living under two separate legal regimes  – one for Israelis and one for Palestinians? The Israelis enjoy complete  freedom; massive building funded by the government; infrastructure of a 21st  century modern state; a criminal legal system that protects Israelis even when  they are the attackers of Palestinians – Jewish terrorists who killed who are  not arrested even two months after their crime; Israeli control of land, roads,  electricity, water, etc. The Palestinians are living in small islands of  semi-control by their own government. Their territory is violated constantly by  the Israeli military. They have control over almost nothing. They have no  defined borders, no control over external borders, they need permits issued by  Israel to their holiest places and even their population registry is controlled  by Israel. From their perspective if that is not a new form of apartheid then  what is? For months the experts on Arab affairs in Israel (including me) have  been warning that the territories are boiling.




In particular we have  spoken about the frustration of the masses from zero political movement, no hope  of changing the reality on the ground, economic stagnation, high youth  unemployment and increased settlement building.In addition to this have  been crimes committed by Israelis against Palestinians, particularly by violent  settlers, that have gone without prosecution and convictions.The defense  minister even admitted that Israel knows who killed the Dawabshe family, but  cannot arrest them. Add to this the perception of Palestinians that Israel is  gradually changing its policies on the Temple Mount that Palestinians see as the  eventual step of transferring the place to Jews (even though this has no truth  behind it). Perceptions create consciousness which change realities. Abbas  called to defend al Aksa against the “defaming feet of the Jews,” referring to  the boots of the soldiers and police who entered the holy mosque without taking  off their shoes, as required by Islam.The majority of Palestinians do  not want a new intifada.This is quite clear. They have too much to lose  and they are aware of the dangers. I spent many hours pleading with influential  people from both sides to return the calm. It needs both sides to agree and to  work together. I knew that Netanyahu would not call Abbas and say, “Let’s work  together to calm the situation and then let’s talk about how we return to  negotiations.” I pleaded with people to convince Abbas to pick up the phone and  call Netanyahu – I doubt if he did. During crises like this, we need leaders who  are big enough to overcome their anger and frustration and look beyond the  present. We don’t have that kind of leader – on either side. On the Palestinian  side they say, “Netanyahu doesn’t want peace, he is only interested in expanding  settlements.” In Israel they say the Abbas doesn’t want peace, he won’t  recognize us and the Palestinians cheer the death of every Jew.” Both sides are  right in what they are saying, but they are also both wrong. Netanyahu does not  want to see more dead bodies – not Israeli nor Palestinian. I also don’t believe  that Abbas wants to see more dead bodies. But more dead bodies is what we will  have if they don’t – together – work to calm the situation.To the  Palestinians I say there is no truth to what you believe the Israelis are  planning to do regarding al-Aksa. There is no Israeli plan to destroy the  mosques or to allow Jewish prayer there. To the Israelis I say the Palestinians  do not want another intifada, they don’t want to destroy all that has been  achieved.To both sides I say it can all collapse and degenerate into  another round of horrendous violence. The violence can end now, but it can also  get out of control. It is not too late. It must end now and then the parties  have to figure out how to get back to serious genuine negotiations for peace and  security – for ending the occupation and creating a partnership for life of our  two peoples.Will this turn into another intifada? It could. It could  easily slide down the slippery slope of violence until it becomes a force too  powerful to stop. Right now it doesn’t look that way (yet). It seems that  Palestinian security forces have not joined in the direct confrontations with  the Israeli army. On Monday night Abbas convened all of his security chiefs and  instructed them to prevent clashes and return the calm. The clash points remain  the arena for relatively few Palestinians – the masses have not joined in. The  primary weapons remain the stones, fire-bombs and knives, and not guns and  bombs. The number of deaths is still relatively small (although every single one  is a tragedy).I don’t think that Palestinian society has the energy for  another destructive intifada. There is too much to lose – too much was built  over the past years to risk losing. One just needs to see all of the building  all around the West Bank in Palestinian cities and villages to understand how  much has been invested over the past years.Now the Jewish holidays are  finally over (way too many holidays) and people are going back to  work.That includes some 100,000 Palestinians who work in Israel. Some  50,000-60,000 work-permit holders, another 25,000 who work in settlements and  another 20,000 day workers without permits. I imagine that Israel will not  cancel those permits (even though they are suspended during the holidays). It is  citrus picking season, construction needs in Israel are climbing and the IDF  understands that the best way to fuel the fire is to deny Palestinians the  ability to feed their families.
Ending this round of violence is not  enough to prevent the next. The parties must return to the table, but the table  has to have content on it. Negotiations cannot simply begin from the beginning  again. There must be terms of reference and there must be a time period. If  Abbas did deliver a genuine peace agreement to his people, he would overnight  regain his legitimacy and his credibility. If Netanyahu delivered a peace  agreement his government would probably collapse, but he would have the support  of a majority in the Knesset and among the people of Israel. That is what they  should do. That is probably not what they will do.

<title>Encountering Peace: FIFA, soccer and the Palestinians</title>
<date>13/5/2015</date>
<content>
In two weeks, 200 national football leagues  composing the membership of FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football  Association) will vote on a motion put forward by the Palestinian football  association to suspend Israel’s membership in FIFA or to impose sanctions on  Israel.The Palestinian motion began two years ago when complaints were  first submitted to FIFA by Palestine’s football commissioner-general, Jabril  Rajoub. The Palestinian complaints against Israel included violations committed  by Israel against the free movement of Palestinian soccer players between Gaza  and the West Bank, the limitations placed by Israel on allowing Palestinian  players to participate in games abroad, difficulties and prohibitions that  Israel places on some foreign teams with regard to playing matches in Palestine  (particularly Arab and Muslim teams from countries with which Israel has no  diplomatic relations), Israel’s less than satisfactory treatment of anti-Arab  racism within the Israeli league (of particular mention are the games of Betar  Jerusalem, where some fans’ “death to Arabs” calls are the norm and where news  reports have indicated there is a policy not to allow any Arab players to join  the team), and the existence of Israeli League members in settlements (which are  illegal by international law) that are playing in the territory the Palestinians  define as within the Palestinian state in violation of FIFA’s  statutes.




For the past two years FIFA has encouraged the Palestinians to  work out their differences with Israel directly. In a statement issued this week  by the Palestinian football commissioner the following was said: “If the Israeli  Association is concerned about being suspended, they should respect the FIFA  Statute and stop being an integral part of the Israeli occupation and its  Apartheid policies.”Head of the Palestine Football Association (PFA)  Gen. Jibril Rajoub met with FIFA president Joseph “Sepp” Blatter in Switzerland  to discuss the latest meeting between FIFA and the Israeli Football Association  (IFA) regarding Israeli violations of the FIFA statutes and the ongoing  oppression of Palestinian athletes, which has been continuously denounced by the  PFA. Rajoub accepted a request from Blatter to meet the head of the IFA after  their meeting.
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}Rajoub declared the following after his meeting with the  IFA: “We accepted to meet with the Israeli Association in appreciation to the  efforts made by FIFA chairman Sepp Blatter for the development of football in  Palestine.Unfortunately, the meeting simply reaffirmed that the Israeli  Football Association does not want to stop being a tool of the Israeli  occupation or to respect the FIFA statutes. It is clear that the Israeli  Football Association is not willing to recognize PFA as a federation with equal  rights and obligations, just as they continue to violate their commitments made  before FIFA.“We are therefore determined to continue our path to suspend  the Israeli Football Association during the next FIFA Congress, this May 29. If  the IFA is concerned about being suspended, they should respect the FIFA  statutes and stop being an integral part of the Israeli occupation of the state  of Palestine and its apartheid policies.”Israel has denied all of the  claims issued by the Palestinians, and has issued an “all hands on deck” call to  all of Israel’s diplomatic representatives around the world to contest the  Palestinian demands for suspension and/ or sanctions. The FIFA vote will be  taken by a secret ballot which is a great cause of concern for Israel, but in  order to remove Israel the vote must be won by 75 percent, which is unlikely to  happen. Sanctions could be imposed by a small majority.Whether or not  the Palestinians win the vote is only secondary to the realization that this is  just the beginning of the Palestinians’ diplomatic efforts to impose sanctions  on Israel. The issue is not football or the freedom of movement of soccer  players. The issue is much larger and will continue to emerge on the  international stage on which Israel is now being targeted. The issue is of  course the continuation of the occupation and Israel’s refusal to recognize the  Palestinians’ right to self-determination in an independent state of their own  next to Israel.Almost every nation in the world has come to the  conclusion that the state of Palestine must exist and that Israel’s control over  the Palestinian people must come to an end. Being that almost no one in the  world sees the chance of a negotiated solution today, the international  community will adopt the Palestinian position that pressure must be applied to  Israel so that both the government of Israel and the people of Israel come to  the conclusion that the continuation of the occupation is no longer sustainable  or in Israel’s interest.This is a conclusion that the people and  government of Israel should have come to on their own out of the desire to  preserve the democratic and Jewish character of the State of Israel. This is the  Zionist conclusion that we, the people of Israel should understand without any  international pressure. It is in our own interest to cease our rule and control  over the Palestinians and to work with them to find a peaceful solution to the  conflict that will provide Israel the security it needs and allow the  Palestinians the independence and freedom that they deserve.But we in  Israel seem to be slow to understand this and therefore we will have to confront  the growing international pressure against us. FIFA is just the beginning. More  steps will be on the way including the economic boycotts that we have already  seen with some European pension funds withdrawing investments in Israel,  companies withdrawing from infrastructure projects in Israel, and academic and  cultural boycotts. Many of those boycotts, divestments and sanctions will do  little damage to Israel and their impact on the Israeli pocket will be very  small. But there will be a cumulative effect. More painful for the Israeli  mindset will be the actions of organizations like FIFA. Likewise, more  anti-Israeli sentiment will become prevalent amongst public opinion around the  world, and because Israelis love to travel so much, they will face more and more  uncomfortable expressions of anger against Israel’s policies regarding  Palestine.Moreover, discussions on possible sanctions are already taking  place in countries which are not only very important to Israel but are also  clearly in the pro-Israel camp, such as the 28 member states of the European  Union. All of the countries of the EU are deeply committed to Israel’s right to  exist, its legitimacy and its right to defend itself and fight against  terrorism.But these 28 countries are all deeply committed to the right  of the Palestinians to have a state of their own next to Israel, the end  Israel’s occupation over the Palestinians and most clearly against Israel’s  settlement policies. It is the last, the continuation of Israeli building for  Israelis beyond the “green line” that will push Europe in the direction of  adopting sanctions against Israel.The most hurting step could be the  possibility of changing the current visa free entry policy to Europe for Israeli  citizens. Unlike in the United States, Israelis are not required to get a visa  prior to traveling to the 28 EU member countries. That could easily change and  the Europeans could simply adopt the US policy which denies Israeli citizens the  right to enter the US without a visa. The main US reason for allowing Israelis  visa-free entry is Israel’s policies of discrimination against certain US  passport holders. Arab and Palestinian Americans are treated differently at  Israel’s entry borders than other American passport holders. They are separated  from the line, held back, questioned, searched, sometimes their computers are  scanned, their contact lists and emails copied and sometimes even denied entry.  The same is true for European passport holders and if the EU continues to decide  to ratchet up the pressure on Israel, that kind of step will also  appear.

<title>Encountering Peace: The vision of real peace</title>
<date>11/2/2015</date>
<content>
There is no  solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict other than two states for two  peoples, if solution means end of the conflict. Jews and Arabs have been killing  each other and have been willing to die for more than 100 years over their  determination to have a territorial expression of their identity – a place they  can call their own. Neither people agrees to be ruled over by the other. Neither  side is interested in living in a state with a homogenized identity – say, the  United States of Israel-Palestine. Binational states don’t really exist or work.  The only solution remains partition.The reality created by the failure  of the Oslo agreements that were aimed at reaching understandings and building  trust in order to resolve the most contentious issues is untenable, undesirable  and will inevitably lead to more violence. There is currently a one-state  reality in which one side is in control and the other side is denied the most  basic human and national rights. Israel attempts to claim that it does not rule  over the Palestinians because 98 percent of the Palestinians in the West Bank  and Gaza are under the direct rule of the Palestinian Authority. The fact that  the PA takes care of waste removal, social services, education and health does  not hide the truth that in reality the real government in the West Bank is the  Israeli Civil Administration.




The PA has little ability to do anything  that indicates true sovereignty and almost everything requires Israel’s  approval. And when Israel does not approve, it withholds its agreement, freezes  tax revenues, limits movement, closes roads, enters the “PA-controlled areas” at  will. Even Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas requires the approval of the  Israeli army to move around in the West Bank. Gaza remains shut off from the  world with Israel and Egypt, in cooperation, controlling Gaza’s external borders  and the flow of people and goods in and out of Gaza. The Palestinian people are  not free and no status of peace will ever emerge from this reality.The  “two states for two peoples” vision as has been conceptualized over the years  has failed to emerge because the parties have not yet been able to reach an  agreed formula which resolves all of the outstanding issues. It is not only the  hard-core, central issues such as borders, Jerusalem and refugees which remain  difficult to resolve, but lack of a compelling vision that in turn significantly  lessens the political will and ability to imagine a better future, on both sides  of the conflict, removing the public pressure because of the general lack of  hope. The vision of two states living behind walls, barbed wire and checkpoints  can hardly inspire people to take to the streets. Two states living behind walls  and fences will also not create or sustain peace.While the status quo of  no solution is lacking, the lack is mainly felt on the Palestinian side, and  many Israelis are able to carry on their daily lives without really giving  thought to the conflict. This is all but impossible for Palestinians.The  current election campaign has not provided one iota of vision regarding peace.  It is as if Israel were in the middle of Europe, or in Ohio, where only social  and economic issues are relevant to the candidates. The issue which more than  anything else will determine the future of the State of Israel – the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict – is barely mentioned.So many years of  failed negotiations have led to most leaders and citizens adopting the point of  view that we need to “manage” the conflict because we cannot resolve it. I don’t  believe that this conflict can be managed, and I do believe that it can be  resolved. But that requires leaders with vision – something which appears to be  in short supply. I have written in this column repeatedly over the past years  what the formula is for bringing about agreement and resolution. But it is clear  to me that while it is possible to reach an agreement with the Palestinian  leadership, it is not possible to reach an agreement with Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu.It is he who has blocked every serious attempt over  the past years to reach agreements with the Palestinians.This is mainly  because he is not interested in or willing to reach an agreement that will allow  a two-state solution to materialize. Labor leader Isaac Herzog might be able to  reach an agreement with the Palestinians, but it is difficult to know because he  has not told us what he really believes regarding the issue of peace with the  Palestinians.If Netanyahu wins the March 17 elections, there will be no  chance at all for a negotiated agreement with the Palestinians. The possible  scenarios that may emerge are quite clear: a right-wing, Netanyahu-led  government will continue to expand settlements all around the West Bank and  within Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.This will go against the  entire world. This goes directly against the possibility of maintaining a state  which is both the nation state of the Jewish people and a democracy. One state  for two unequal peoples means a new form of apartheid. It means the end of  Israel’s ability to claim it is a democracy.There is already a  binational reality on the ground with Israel in control. Anyone who travels  through the Palestinian areas is immediately struck by the total lack of  equality and the total Israeli control and domination over Palestinians’ lives.  With 62% of the West Bank under full Israeli control and new settlements  sprouting on every hilltop, it is quite clear that if the two-state solution  does not emerge rather quickly, it never will.No person with the ability  to distinguish between right and wrong can justify the conditions under which  Palestinians live in the West Bank (and even more so in Gaza). It is quite clear  that most of the world is coming to that very conclusion.A right-wing  victory in March, as far as I can see, will lead Israel to the point of no  return. Increasing international pressure, boycotts and sanctions together with  the extremely distasteful reality for both Jewish and Arabs citizens of Israel  who actually care about democratic values will push Israel to be the pariah of  the Western world. Jews around the world will suffer increased anti-Semitism,  spurred by intensive anti-Israeli sentiments.The current elections are  the most critical ones that Israel has ever faced and yet the candidates and  political parties are acting as if they were about the price of cottage cheese  once again.I expect to hear from the candidates and the parties clear,  direct visions and policies regarding the future of the relations between the  Palestinian people and the State of Israel. This is the issue that will  determine our future. It is time, one month before the elections, for the  candidates to be bold and tell us what they really think – because until now  they have been hiding behind empty words and stupid video clips.

<title>Encountering Peace: What does he really want?</title>
<date>16/12/2015</date>
<content>
What does he really want? No one knows for sure, maybe not even he, himself.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he does not want Israel to become a  binational state and that it will not become one. He says he still supports the  twostate solution, but he has done nothing to advance it.In fact, he has  done much to prevent it from emerging at any time in the future.




We are  reminded of his campaign promise that “no Palestinian state will be established  on my watch!” His right-wing coalition partners want to annex Area C of the West  Bank, comprising 62 percent of the territory.Netanyahu hasn’t done  anything to advance their program either, but they keep reminding him and the  people of Israel that someone who supports a Palestinian state next to Israel  cannot be considered to be part of the so-called “national camp.”The  prime minister is certainly not a stupid man, nor is he out of touch with  reality – as far as we can tell.According to reliable demographers (not  the rightwing players with statistics) there is already a balance between Jews  and Palestinians between the River and the Sea – with perhaps slightly more  Palestinians than Jews even today.The continued settlement building, the  lack of any political horizon, the stagnant and even declining economy of the  Palestinians are all part of the causes behind the current round of violence, at  least that is what the Shin Bet and the IDF say. And while Israelis are under  attack, Palestinians, the non-participating overwhelming majority of them, feel  they are under attack. As a result of no political progress, years of failed  negotiations and continued violence, today between the River and the Sea there  is a very large majority of Jews and Palestinians who believe the twostate  solution is not possible anymore. So what then? What do they support? It has to  be clear to everyone, including to the prime minister that both peoples are here  to stay. The Israelis are not going anywhere and neither are the  Palestinians.If the prime minister rejects the idea of a binational  state, as do most Israelis, it is clear that there is no intention to grant  millions of Palestinians citizenship and equal rights, including the right to  vote and to be elected. I have heard right-wing people explain that since the  Palestinians have their own authority and they elected it, and they have their  own government ministries – education, health, welfare, planning and even a  foreign ministry – the problem of no democracy and no rights is solved. The  Palestinians can continue living with their Palestinian Authority and Israel can  continue to control all of the land between the River and the Sea.We  don’t have to count the 1.8 million Palestinians in Gaza because they live under  Hamas anyway, which rejects Israel’s right to exist – so everything is in fact  okay, they say. The criticism of the international community against the  so-called “occupation,” they claim, can be ignored because for one we all know  that regardless of what Israel and the Jewish people do, they say, the whole  world is against us because at their core they are  anti-Semitic.Education Minister Naftali Bennett tells us and the world  that no one can occupy their own land and God gave us this land so how can we be  an occupier in our own land, and anyway the whole world hates us because we are  Jews. Everything is explained away by the knee-jerk anti-Semitism  claim.The problem begins with the fact that the whole world is not  anti-Semitic – even the 28 states of the European Union, which voted to label  settlement products, all strongly support Israel’s legitimate right to exist as  a Jewish democratic state, Israel’s right to defend itself and strongly condemn  Palestinian terrorism against Israel. But the 28 states of the European Union  all oppose Israel’s control of the Palestinian territories, the construction of  settlements in those territories and the prevention by Israel of the Palestinian  people’s right to self-determination. This can hardly be defined as  anti-Semitism. All anti-Semitism is illegitimate.Criticism of Israel and  its policies is completely legitimate. Taking actions against those policies is  also completely legitimate.While the prime minister fails to present any  plan to prevent Israel from becoming a binational state, the binational reality  is becoming permanent. The Palestinian struggle against the impossible reality  that they are living will be rapidly transformed from their demand for a state  of their own next to Israel into a demand for equal rights and real democracy.  As the binational reality of Israel continues to exist with continued decreasing  support for partition on both sides of the conflict line, the international  community will abandon its own support for the two-stats solution and will  define the reality in which millions of Palestinians are living under Israeli  control without equal rights as the 21st-century version of a new form of  apartheid.No, it is not apartheid South Africa with its racial  separation, but it is a country with separate, different and unequal forms of  government – one for Jews and Arabs who are citizens of Israel and enjoy  relative democracy and equal rights and one for Palestinians who are not  citizens of Israel and are devoid of basic human rights and freedoms. This will  not be tolerated.But what the world thinks of this situation is way back  on my list of concerns and what I believe should concern every Israeli citizen  and every Jew around the world – the continuation and entrenchment of the  binational reality is causing Israel to lose its Jewish soul. The moral code  brought to the world by the Prophets of Israel - as our Declaration of  Independence states written by our founding mothers and fathers: “Israel will be  based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it  will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its  inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex…” So prime minister, please  tell us how Israel remains faithful to itself and its founding principles and  continues to maintain this binational reality.

<title>ENCOUNTERING PEACE: Yes, it is difficult to make peace</title>
<date>23/12/2015</date>
<content>
Many talkbackers to my articles and opponents of my opinions berate me for my  longstanding insistence that peace with the Palestinians is possible. They  insist that the Palestinians continue to incite against Israel and don’t  recognize the Jewish People’s right to a state of their own. They point to the  hate-filled statements of Palestinian leaders and to the Palestinians’ own  refusal to make a deal that would end the conflict. I have no problem admitting  many of these claims are true. There is incitement against Israel. The  Palestinian leadership has refused to accept every offer that Israel has made  thus far for lasting peace. Many of their leaders are filled with hate and many  Palestinians would definitely prefer for Israel not to exist. It is not  impossible for Israel to play the victim card and demonstrate to the world and  to ourselves that we have a very difficult enemy.Life would be so much  easier if we had nicer enemies.




But like it or not, this is the reality  and the conflict between Israel and Palestine is not simply over hatred,  incitement or refusal to recognize each other’s rights.This conflict is  over real issues and like it or not, both sides have just claims. And like it or  not, the conflict will not be resolved without sitting at the table and  negotiating. Both sides are responsible for the failure to reach a negotiated  agreement so far. Both sides are responsible for the situation that we are in.  Both sides suffer from the conflict and from the continued violence.Both  sides play the victim card and at this time neither is taking responsibility to  change the situation for the better. Both sides lack responsible leaders who can  see beyond tomorrow. Both sides are irresponsible to their own people. Even if  there is no symmetry in the conflict – there is a strong side and a weak side,  an occupier and an occupied. Nonetheless, it takes two sides to fight and two  sides to make peace.No territorial-identity conflict is easy to resolve.  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is especially difficult and complex because of  the added ingredients of religion and history. The weight of history and claims  of ownership to the will of God not only foster intransigence they also blind  each side to the other’s basic legitimacy.Many Palestinians refuse to  recognize the Jews as a nation that is connected to this land. Many Israelis  refuse to recognize that the Palestinian people exist and have a right to  self-determination even on part of Palestine. We don’t recognize each other’s  narrative and many don’t even recognize the legitimacy of an alternative  narrative to their own.The one absolute truth that I know is that  neither the Jews nor the Palestinians are going to surrender and disappear. The  reality of two peoples on the land between the River and the Sea will either be  played out in two states for two peoples or in one state for two peoples. There  is no third way.The other night I attended a remarkable Christmas party  in Herzliya convened by a very senior foreign diplomat. His home was filled with  about 60 people.There were about 10 Gazans that had been given permits  by the IDF to attend. There were about 10 Palestinians from the West Bank. There  were about 20 Israelis there including some eight senior IDF officers in  uniform, including a general and a brigadier general.The rest were other  foreign diplomats. The most amazing thing about the evening was how normal it  felt. I stood off on the side for a moment watching this astounding gathering,  gazing at the interaction between the people there. There were no walls. There  was no hatred, there was no animosity and people were genuinely enjoying each  other’s company.I made mention of this observation to several people  there who also noted their surprise about how normal it felt. I commented that  is my own experience almost on a daily basis. I interact with Israelis from all  over Israel and with Palestinians from all over Palestine on a daily basis. And  I often bring them together as I have done with thousands of Israelis and  Palestinians over the past 30-plus years. I do not personally feel a conflict,  and I never hide my identity or my political positions.I do not chose  the option of one states for two peoples.I am a proud Jew and Israeli  and want to live in the nation state of the Jewish people. But I do not and will  not support the nation state of the Jewish people which ceases to search for a  solution that will enable the Palestinian people to live in their own nation  state.I will never accept one state for two peoples, which would mean an  apartheid state ruling over millions of Palestinians and denying them their  basic human and political rights. If the option of two states for two peoples is  removed from the realm of feasibility, I will fight for one state for two equal  peoples – one person, one vote – which will not be the nation state of the  Jewish people nor the nation state of the Palestinian people.The way to  resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not through the “divorce” proposed  by Yair Lapid or the vision of peace with walls and fences as proposed by Isaac  Herzog and Tzipi Livni from the Zionist Union. Peace will never exist between  the two peoples living on this land based on physical and permanent separation  imposed with walls and fences and people living in cages. Peace will never  develop without normal interaction between people – the kind of interaction that  I witnessed at the Christmas party in Herzliya. This will obviously need a lot  of time and a lot of effort to create. The prerequisite is a fair, negotiated,  intelligent peace agreement that resolves all of the core issues. It is not so  difficult to reach that agreement and the formula for it is very well known. The  process of peacemaking and reconciliation is a much more difficult process and  will take much longer – perhaps even more than a generation. But the first step  of moving beyond the hatred, animosity and fear that exists on both sides is to  reach that negotiated agreement.
For that to happen, both sides are going  to have to sit down at the table and stay there until they reach the agreement.  There is no other way.

<title>End the terror now!</title>
<date>11/10/2015</date>
<content>
It took a major wave of terrorism to spread to the country’s center for Israelis  to awaken from their slumber.The deaths of “only” four fellow citizens  in sporadic violence earlier this month left too many outwardly unperturbed; a  dynamic that plays out regularly when a handful of Gaza rockets terrorize  southern communities, rather than rain down in large numbers on heavily  populated areas.




In fact, unless Israel finds herself on the brink of  disaster, emotional paralysis pervades society, an attitude of ostensible apathy  that unwittingly assimilates quickly the murder of a Jew or two as part of  normality.Undoubtedly a defense mechanism adopted to cope with years of  rampant Palestinian terror, it is nonetheless a defect of the mind and soul  which needs to be eradicated.It is time to call upon an Israeli  intellectual and spiritual revival; for, if real change is ever going to come,  it will come directly from the people. If the violence is ever going to end, it  will be because Israelis coalesce around the moral imperative to uphold the  sanctity of Jewish life.Every single one.Indeed, it has become  abundantly clear that our political class has no plan of reaction in this regard  – and thus no ability – to guide the country toward a more internally secure  future.Neither the Right nor the Left has any answers.Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s course of action is to recycle failed policies,  including expediting the demolition of terrorists’ homes (which will be rebuilt  using salaries paid by the Palestinian Authority to those jailed), expanding  administrative detentions of rioters (who will then become more radicalized  while incarcerated without trial) and banning those engaged in incitement from  the Old City and the Temple Mount (essentially, closing down vast swaths of  Jerusalem as well as the entire al-Aksa compound).Disconcertingly,  Netanyahu is concurrently re-exploring the tried and tested track of  negotiations, calling on the illegitimate leader of the PA to pretty please talk  with him, the grand effect of which over the past two-plus decades has been the  extraction of Israeli concessions in exchange for more terrorism.In  other words, Netanyahu’s proposed solution to the ongoing wave of violence in  Jerusalem and the West Bank will lead deeper into the current morass.How  Orwellian.While the Right attempts to apply a Band-Aid to a gaping  wound, the Left would pour acid on it. Incredibly, the latter’s grand ideas have  not changed one iota since the Oslo Accords were signed.We must be  serious about making peace, the Left implores. But with whom exactly? The same  Mahmoud Abbas that rejected leftist premier Ehud Olmert’s fully comprehensive  peace deal in 2008? The same Abbas who would pursue war crimes claims against  Israel at the ICC rather than sit down at a table across from Netanyahu? The  same Abbas who fans the flames of violence by stating the Temple Mount should be  devoid of “dirty” Jews? The same Abbas who encouraged the latest wave of  terrorism by spewing lies, hatred and bile at the UN General Assembly while  denying any Jewish connection to the land of Israel? Or perhaps the Abbas who  heads the Fatah party, whose military wing took responsibility for the recent  murder of Na’ama and Eitam Henkin in front of their four children? Yes, that  Abbas, we are told over and over again; a man of “peace” who oppresses his own  people and then redirects reprisals against innocent Israelis.The Left  can rail all it wants against the “occupation” (perhaps the “apartheid” wall  should be dismantled to allow suicide bombers again to freely roam the streets  of Tel Aviv?) or the “settlements” (an enterprise introduced by Labor  governments); but reality – the Left’s implacable adversary – dictates that the  IDF remain in the territories over the long-term and that half a million Jews  will never be uprooted from their homes in the West Bank.Reality check:  There is no Palestinian peace partner, so it might be time to come up with a new  approach.For one, how about implementing punitive measures with actual  teeth, such as incarcerating Palestinian terrorists in solitary confinement for  the rest of their lives instead of releasing them after 10 years as a  precondition for negotiating about negotiations? Or how about arresting the  imams on the Temple Mount and across the Palestinian territories – including  those regularly appearing on state television – who reduce Jews to “apes and  pigs,” effectively justifying their slaughter? Or what about coming down like a  pile of bricks on Palestinian officials who support the terror campaign, such as  Fatah Central Committee member Mahmoud Aloul, who was quoted as saying that a  faction of the Al-Aksa Martyrs’ Brigades “accepted responsibility” for murdering  the Henkins? At the very least Aloul would seem to have intimate connections to  a designated terrorist group.Likewise the leaders of Hamas (a cell of  which is now believed to have actually carried out the Henkin killings) and  Islamic Jihad, who might be granted their ultimate aspiration – a face-to-face  meeting with Allah – every time their organizations praise the “heroic martyrs”  who attack unarmed children.Perversely, Israel continues to transfer tax  revenues and provide electricity to those who preach our  annihilation.But none of these things will happen because we have an  inert leadership that banks on a public that remains detached in the absence of  total chaos, at which point the government’s “solution” can be likened to  dumping a pail of water on a raging fire.The road to change is paved by  a new, collective mobilization around a common cause. Harm to even one of us  needs to enrage us all and spur us to action, as indifference to any act of  terrorism allows such evil to metastasize. In its final expression, that evil  would have us all evacuated from this land tomorrow, preferably in body  bags.One day perhaps Palestinian society might evolve, rendering  coexistence possible. In the interim, it is high time that the people demand an  end to violence – using any and all means necessary.
No more  “proportionality.” No more moral relativism. No more Palestinian terrorism.  Period! Only then can a divided Israel – public and officialdom, alike – justify  resuming the ludicrous debate about which phantom might be partnered with in an  imaginary “peace.”

<title>Fundamentally freund: Anti-Zionism is the real apartheid</title>
<date>23/3/2015</date>
<content>
Although barely a week has passed since Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s reelection, Israel’s enemies are already gearing  up to besmirch the Jewish state.A new governing coalition hasn’t been  formed yet, but that hasn’t stopped the critics from invoking the “A” word –  apartheid – to demonize the country’s democratically-elected administration even  before it takes office.




Take, for example, a column in a major South  African newspaper, under the headline “Isolate the Israelis and their  apartheid,” which warned that, “The Israeli people have spoken, and their choice  is occupation and apartheid. The world must respond with isolation.”
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}And  then there was a blogger on The Hill, an American political website which covers  Congress, who declared ominously that, “Netanyahu’s reelection is a call for war  on Palestinians everywhere...It is a mandate for the Israeli government to  murder Palestinians. It gives Netanyahu license to continue Israel’s  seven-decade policy of racism and apartheid towards the people from whom they  stole the land.”Obviously, this kind of preposterous poppycock bears  little connection with reality. After all, the chairman of Israel’s Elections  Commission, who oversaw the balloting, was a Christian Arab judge, Salim  Joubran.And the Joint Arab List is now the third largest party in the  Knesset, beating out Naftali Bennett’s Bayit Yehudi on the Right and Meretz on  the Left.Moreover, there were plenty of Israeli Arabs who backed the  Likud and its right-wing allies, such as the Galilee village of Arab al-Naim,  north of Haifa, where 76 percent of the vote went for Netanyahu and his  party.I’m sure the village’s residents would be quite surprised to learn  that observers abroad view them as having chosen “racism” or  “occupation.”Nonetheless, it is clear that a major push is coming to  isolate Israel and hit it hard with various sanctions and boycotts, making it  imperative that the Jewish state and its supporters abroad gear up to wage an  intensive hasbara, or public diplomacy, campaign.It is of course  essential to respond to each slur, to counter the lies and slander that have  become de rigueur in the international media. We have the truth on our side, so  we might as well deploy it as much as possible.But beyond the usual  defensive tactics, it is no less important that we go on the offensive in  countering our hate-filled opponents. We must bring the battle to their  territory and highlight the hypocrisy of their stance.A good place to  start would be to emphasize that the real practitioners of apartheid are those  who oppose Zionism and seek to segregate Israel from the international community  and treat it differently than other nations.Apartheid, an Afrikaans word  which literally means “apart-hood” or being apart, was a system that  discriminated against a group of people because of their identity.That  is precisely the kind of policy that anti-Zionists who support boycotts,  divestment and sanctions (BDS) are seeking to impose against the Jewish state.  They want Israel to be confined to pariah status, tossed out of respectable  society and barred from an equal opportunity to engage in culture, commerce and  trade.But Zionism, by definition, is the national liberation movement of  the Jewish people. It represents the collective yearning of Jews for two  millennia to exercise sovereignty in their ancient homeland, the Land of  Israel.To deny Jews such a right, or to seek to punish them for  upholding it, is therefore inherently discriminatory and entirely  unjustifiable.And the proof that they are motivated by hatred for who we  are, rather than what we do, is evident from the fact that they do not apply a  single standard of behavior to all states. Instead, they focus only on  democratic Israel while ignoring the conduct of our less-than-democratic  neighbors.Just take a look around the Middle East and this becomes  readily apparent. At the same time that Israel’s critics are lambasting its  duly-elected leadership, there are at least five Arab governments whose armies  are currently bombing their own territory.In Yemen, government planes  have been used by the president and the rebels to bomb each other in Aden and  elsewhere.In Syria, military helicopters have been dropping barrel bombs  in Damascus, Aleppo and Homs, indiscriminately killing civilians.In  Iraq, the air force has been carrying out raids against targets in Tikrit in an  effort to take the city back from rebels belonging to Islamic  State.Libya and Sudan have also seen air power deployed against their  own people in recent weeks.Yet despite this surge of violence in the  region, and the daily trampling of human rights it entails, it is Israel that is  being singled out for special treatment by supporters of the  Palestinians.This cannot and must not go unchallenged. Anyone who  opposes Zionism, or who seeks to treat the Jewish state in a discriminatory  fashion, needs to be condemned for what he is: a bigot, a racist and an  anti-Semite.People have every right to criticize Israeli policy,  disagree with it and protest against it. But disenfranchising Israel or  subjecting it to trade embargoes or sanctions is nothing more than a form of  diplomatic apartheid and it cannot be allowed to stand.
So instead of  sitting back and watching as others smear our national integrity, let’s turn the  tables on those who do so and preserve our good name.

<title>George Washington campus response to false claims against Israel</title>
<date>5/4/2015</date>
<content>
George Washington University’s campus  overflows with politically active and opinionated students. Our community takes  pride in educational programming conducted by student organizations that  benefits all points of view. We believe in engagement and respectful dialogue.  Once that dialogue crosses into offensive and ignorant language, it should be  condemned as hate. George Washington for Israel, GWI, urges all politically  active organizations on neighboring campuses to follow our lead, especially  considering recent events at Columbia University.We understand the  frustration of the Black Students Organization at Columbia University. The  Black, Jewish, Muslim and both Israeli and Palestinian communities have been  subject to a variety of recent events leaving emotions and tensions high.  However, the deplorable language about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should  not be seen as acceptable by any party.





 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}Calling Israel an apartheid state  is ignorant and disappointing, labeling her actions “acts of genocide” is  offensive and false. To compare the struggle of people of color in South Africa  to the only democratic nation in the Middle East simply hurts those who lived  under true apartheid rule. Misusing powerful terms can be a method of  reinventing their meaning. To call Israel an apartheid state is to delegitimize  the suffering of millions.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is  notoriously one of the most complicated issues in today’s world. No one wants  peace more than Israel. Israel’s “hawkish” right-wing prime minister Menachem  Begin said about making peace with Egypt, “War is avoidable. It is peace that is  inevitable.” To paint the conflict in black and white and label Israel as  genocidal undermines any efforts for peace in the region.To achieve  peace we have to work together. We have to respect everyone’s views and be as  inclusive as possible.Learning about the violent rhetoric on Columbia  University’s campus saddened us. The anti-Semitic slurs that were splattered  across campus escalated the discourse to a level that was neither acceptable,  appropriate, or helpful in any way. It is understandable to feel passionate  about the subject, yet the moment that passion is expressed through hatred the  hope for peaceful discussion and progress becomes extremely bleak.We  will continue to strive for peaceful and productive dialogue on all college  campuses across the country engaged in this very important debate.As  student leaders of George Washington University, we send our message of  solidarity to Columbia University’s community. We stand alongside them in their  struggle against those that slander Israel with hateful discourse.We  stand alongside them in their struggle against those that have done more damage  than good to this dialogue.Finally, we stand alongside them in our  shared hope that we may all learn from this experience and work together to help  spread peace rather than hate across college campuses.
The authors are  leaders at George Washington for Israel, GWI, believes in shedding a positive  light on the political advocacy of the relationship between Israel and the  United States. As a student organization that represents a set of political  beliefs, we fully understand that not everyone will choose to agree with our  stance but we hope to continue to foster a respectful dialogue among all  parties.

<title>Gloom and doom for the Jewish American college experience</title>
<date>16/12/2015</date>
<content>
Keven McDougal, Jimmy LaStella, Richie Hernandez and I munched popcorn and  watched the World Series together. Football season followed and every Saturday  we met at my house to watch college games. I remember that Mrs. Fitzgerald came  into our 7th grade classroom crying in November and announced that JFK had been  assassinated. We were all sent home from school, but most of us went to the  playground for pick-up games. My Catholic and Protestant friends came to my bar  mitzva at the local country club.I played high school football and  baseball with the Italian and Irish guys, and we watched and talked about the  Beatles, the moon landing, Woodstock and prayed to our respective gods for a low  selective service number so we wouldn’t end up like my brother, drafted into the  army and serving in Vietnam. My parents let me know that if I could qualify, I  could go to any college or university in the country.




My children have  been raised with similar expectations. Suburban Americans who are socially  integrated, they have the same economic, political and service opportunities  that are available to their gentile neighbors. But something has changed. My  kids are adults now, with their own children. When their children are ready to  go to college, will they have the same choices? You’ve seen the videos.  Pro-Israel speakers shouted down by pro-Palestinian student  groups.Jewish voices silenced in student government or in the  classroom.Academic boycotts of educational, cultural or economic  programs with Israeli participation.Jewish students routinely bullied on  campus. And the Jewish reaction from our community and on-campus institutions is  the same one we’ve been raised to believe is always most fitting: civility and  deference. We play by the rules in a game in which the other side observes no  rules. Our students don’t want this fight and neither do their parents. They are  still living in the last generation, under the impression that the land of the  free and the home of the brave still endows them with the same unalienable  rights as their Protestant, Arab, black, Asian or Hispanic neighbors and  classmates.That ship has sailed. But, the American-Jewish parents of  college- aged kids don’t seem to know it yet.College counselors at  Jewish high schools still work hard to get their students into the schools of  their choice, with no attention paid to the campus environment into which that  unsuspecting student will walk. Parents, students and their advisers proceed  with blinders on. And when trouble strikes, the support and reaction are  passive, not disruptive.We can’t stop the protests. We can’t change the  minds of those who hate us and what we represent.The best we can do is  to try to educate our own youth and give them an appreciation of their  Jewishness. In doing so, we accept the fact that they will hide from us as well  as from the rest of the student body in order to avoid  confrontation.More often than not, they will simply opt out of anything  Jewish in order to try and capture the complete college  experience.Jewish religious and political ignorance remains  pervasive.Even those students arriving on campus from Jewish day schools  are woefully unprepared for what they are about to experience at campuses with  proud Jewish histories and prominent Jewish donors.In a conversation  with a member of the community who is intimately involved in the effort to  educate Jewish campus youth, a very stark reality was addressed.Can the  problems that our college students now confront ever change? Can Jewish students  “disrupt” the effort to demonize them along with the Jewish state? “A Jewish  student is going to have to be beaten or killed for the response to change,” he  told me. And even then, parents are unlikely to alter their hopes and dreams for  their children’s educational ideal. And what moral suasion can force university  administrators to apply the same rules to Palestinian sympathizers that are  applied elsewhere? They are bound by the tenure system and the plague of  political correctness. Every day another campus falls to the influence of  leftist ideology that demonizes Israel, endangers every Jew and ultimately  undermines the very American principles on which the American system of higher  education stands.Is this a wakeup call for American Jews – particularly  for American- Jewish high school students, their parents and their schools?  Academia isn’t the land of the free and the home of the brave anymore (if it  ever was). It’s the land of the radical Left and the home of the cowering middle  class.As Americans we live in fear of terrorism. As American Jews, we  think of that terrorism as far away.No longer. It is taking place on  that campus where you’ve sent your son or daughter with the hope that he can  hide his Jewishness and survive four years unscathed. But the very effort to  survive implies that he will absorb the ambient culture and philosophy. “Israel  is an apartheid state, an illegitimate state, which has dispossessed the real  owners of the land. And as a Jew, your son or daughter is  complicit.”Four years of survival effort will result in a permanently  altered relationship with reality, his or her Jewish reality.In 12  years, my granddaughter will want to matriculate at a major American university.  And she may well have little difficulty blending in to campus life. Two decades  or so thereafter, her children may be looking at a fine university education.  Will their choices be limited to Yeshiva University and Touro College, assuming  that both are still in business? Or will it be understood by then that what was  once the model American-Jewish educational experience is nothing more than a  memory.Either we are going to have to send all of our students to a  small group of campuses on which we can assure their safety, or we are going to  have to prepare students and their parents to face a new reality – the reality  that the golden age of the American-Jewish college experience is over and that  direct campus confrontation and aliya are the only remaining choices.

<title>Good Palestinians, evil Israelis</title>
<date>22/1/2015</date>
<content>
My father recently asked me if I would meet an old friend of his who was  visiting Israel. “But before you agree,” he warned, “you must read some of his  anti-Israel articles.”“Don’t worry,” I answered. “I’d much rather  counter criticism and help shape someone’s perspective than speak to those who  support us unconditionally.”




Prof. William A. Cook was my father’s  teacher at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, in the 1960s. He is now professor  of English at the University of La Verne in California, and has spent many years  researching and writing about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The  titles of his books, such as The Rape of Palestine: Hope Destroyed, Justice  Denied, and The Plight of the Palestinians: A Long History of Destruction,  indicate where he stands.His biography, on the official webpage of the  department of English, refers to Israel as the 51st state of the US, and calls  it “an apartheid state determined to destroy the Palestinian  people.”After reading some of his articles, I changed my mind, and  declined the offer to meet. His views were so radical that I assumed there was  nothing I could say to influence them.But he surprised me by writing a  long email in which he expressed disappointment at my decision, and conveyed a  sincere wish to be enlightened “beyond the scholarship of research” by my long  service in the IDF.We met in Tel Aviv and spoke for three hours. It was  an intriguing discussion, for Bill is extremely intelligent, knowledgeable and  eloquent. He was also very friendly and willing to hear what I had to  say.But the things he said made my blood run cold and my stomach  turn.It was not a debate over nuances of policy, but a portrayal of  Israel as an evil entity, conceived in sin in 1947 and engaged in atrocities  ever since. It was not only his criticism of Israel’s actions that shocked me,  but the attribution of malicious intent, and even mental madness, to the people  of Israel.What surprised me was that most of the foundations on which  his views were constructed are factually baseless or warped.What I heard  was a multitude of false allegations, misunderstandings and things taken out of  context or blown way out of proportion.According to Cook, the massacre  carried out by the Christian Phalange in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps in  1982 was “orchestrated by Israel.”Another tragic incident taken by Cook  as proof of Israeli brutality is the 1996 mistaken shelling of a UNIFIL compound  near Qana, Lebanon. Many civilians were killed when Israel retaliated toward the  positions of Hezbollah, which had deliberately fired from a nearby location. He  thinks we did it on purpose.The allegation of a massacre having taken  place during the Battle of Jenin in 2002 has long since been refuted by  international organizations. But Bill Cook still talks of “the Jenin massacre”  as if it were a fact.The 2010 raid on the Turkish MV Mavi Marmara is  described by him as a “brutal attack” by Israeli commandos. He himself  subsequently traveled to Lebanon in order to board another flotilla, which never  did set sail due to diplomatic intervention. Cook then wrote this about Israel:  “a people willing to forgo all morals and principles to achieve ultimate power,  the soulless human without conscience or remorse, the walking  dead.”Fighting Hamas in Gaza is described by him as “pointless  aggression, unleashed against an innocent, defenseless people.”There is  no relevant context, no real cause and effect – only Israeli  brutality.The widely criticized book Torat Hamelech (“The King’s  Torah”), which summarizes theoretical Jewish law in times of war, to him is  proof that the IDF teaches its soldiers that they may kill any non-Jew on sight.  I know, it sounds insane, but he heard about the book, saw an article about a  certain IDF unit that had the book thrown out of its synagogue, and pieced it  all together.I find it deeply troubling that something as foolish and  insignificant as this can be taken as a reflection of Israel.He has  every crazy, libelous story backed up by “facts” and “data,” and he really  believes it all. I looked at him as he passionately fired away his allegations,  and in a way pitied him for being so immersed in his fictional world.At  the same time I was deeply saddened at the realization of how warped and  dangerous anti-Israeli bias can be.He was perplexed when I told him that  I have Arab friends, and when I referred to Israeli Arabs as my fellow citizens.  When I said that most Israelis want to live in peace, side by side with our  Palestinian neighbors, he furrowed his eyebrows in disbelief.Perhaps I  did not fit his image of “those who have no conscience, no remorse, and no  soul,” as he once wrote. In his eyes, all Israelis hate the Arabs, and Israel is  a tyrannical regime committed to a “systematic genocide.”To him, Jews  are a foreign colonial power, which has stolen the land from its “rightful  owners” – the “indigenous people of Palestine.”He even believes that the  kingdoms of David and Solomon “were and are but myths.”He refers to the  British Mandate-era Jewish militant organizations (Izl/the Irgun and Lehi/the  Stern Group) as “terrorist organizations,” but relates to Hamas as oppressed  freedom fighters merely expressing their grievances. I could not extract from  him any condemnation of suicide bombers blowing up buses and malls.The  IDF, to him, is a brutal army, and every tragic incident involving harm to  civilians in combat zones is evidence of a deliberate attack according to  Israel’s “ethnic cleansing” plan. He didn’t believe me that, from my experience,  no other army in the world goes to such lengths to safeguard the lives of  civilians.His world is black and white. Good Palestinians, evil  Israelis.Cook explains that the Jewish murderers of the Arab teenager  Muhammad Abu Khdeir last summer are not considered extremists in Israel, since  “racism has been so thoroughly mainstreamed” here.  Sickening.Anti-Semitism? Not a trace. Bill has Jewish friends and  colleagues, and even the fact that he spent a day touring Israel with my  kippa-wearing father, says a lot about how he feels toward and around Jews. It  is only the Zionist “terrorist state” which he detests, and he skillfully  vilifies, demonizes and delegitimizes it whenever he can.It was an  incredible lesson for me to see how someone can make something his life’s work,  and end up with a completely distorted understanding of it. Bill came here  searching for historic archives to prove Israel’s immorality, yet refused to  accept my own living-history testimony as to our ethics and  values.Genocide? Apartheid? Certainly anybody who has spent time in  Israel knows that there is no systematic process to destroy the Palestinians,  and people can say “apartheid” till they are blue in the face, but there exists  no form of racial segregation to support such a claim.I did not write  this article in order to criticize Professor Cook. But after getting to know his  mindset, I felt a need to share my awakening to the fact that not much has  changed since the blood libels blaming Jews for killing Christian children for  their blood. Ankara’s mayor has just claimed that Israel masterminded the terror  attacks in Paris.Based on my realization of the depths anti-Israel bias  can reach, I am naturally concerned about the “preliminary examination” launched  by the International Criminal Court, following preposterous Palestinian  allegations of Israeli war crimes.From attributing to Israel vicious  intentions and barbaric acts, to denying the Holocaust, the Holy Temple, and  even historic Jewish existence in the Land of Israel – the rewriting of history  and inventing false narratives have become dangerous weapons in the campaign to  delegitimize Israel.But facts matter. History matters.I believe  that there is no basis for negotiating with the Palestinians unless there is a  modicum of truth in their perception of history, and of the facts on the ground.  The international community must understand that emboldening the campaign of  deception and fabrication neither promotes the Palestinian cause, nor furthers  reconciliation and peace.

<title>Here and there: The fear factor</title>
<date>19/11/2015</date>
<content>
Just one week ago Paris experienced a major terrorist attack – one that evoked  immediate attention worldwide. Our TV screens projected the president of France,  the president of the United States, Britain’s prime minister and our own prime  minister, amongst others, expressing horror at the murder of innocent civilians  who were out enjoying a concert, eating at a restaurant or simply walking along  the streets of Paris.The effect has been trauma, shock and even  surprise. How will the individual in France deal with this phenomenon? Sadly, we  in Israel have been experiencing terrorism for many years.




During these  past weeks of horrific stabbings, shootings and vehicles ramming into  pedestrians, the media – both international and national – have posed the  question as to whether the third intifada has arrived. How are we in Israel  coping with this situation? In fact how does anyone cope when living in an  environment of personal danger? Having made aliya in 1998 I have vivid memories  of the second intifada, which followed the breakdown of the Camp David talks  convened in July 2000 by US president Bill Clinton with prime minister Ehud  Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat. Memories from that  period are hard to shake off, such as the massacre carried out by a suicide  bomber at the Park Hotel in Netanya, where the lives of 30 guests celebrating  Seder night in March 2001 were barbarically cut short, with many more severely  wounded.On June 3 of that same year, a suicide bomber blew himself up in  the midst of teenagers as they queued to enter a disco at Tel Aviv’s  Dolphinarium; 21 were murdered. This intifada claimed the lives of more than  1,000 civilians.In August 2001 I was in South Africa on a speaking tour  for WIZO. At my first stop, Johannesburg, my WIZO colleagues issued me with  clear instructions.I was told not to walk outside on my own even during  the day; it was not safe. Of course I was aware of the stringent security  arrangements that each household had to make. Many white people’s homes stood  behind high walls protected by armed guards.One evening, seated around  the table with colleagues, the conversation focused on what was happening to  members of the community in Johannesburg.My colleagues began to talk  about their friends and relatives who had been injured and murdered while  returning to their gated communities.On arriving home, as they opened  the electric gates, their car would be followed and then they were  attacked.Suddenly – as if my presence was just noticed – a colleague  turned to me and said, “You must be very afraid living in Israel?” My  spontaneous response was that I would have no problem or fears going for a walk  on my own anywhere in Israel, even at midnight.It was only when I  returned home, after three weeks of shlihut in South Africa, that I began to  think of that evening when the conversation focused on the reality of living in  Johannesburg and how I had reacted to the question suggesting that I must be  afraid to live in Israel. How could they have possibly believed me when I  implied that what was happening all around me did not affect my fear level? Yes  it was horrifying to see, time and again, the TV screen showing pictures of  buses that had been blown up. On one occasion we saw what had happened an hour  earlier in Jerusalem: a young child with blood pouring down her face, near a  blown-up bus, clearly in a state of panic and desperately seeking her parents.  How was I able to blank out this painful reality when responding to my South  African colleagues? History is repeating itself (as it does so often here). We  are in the autumn of 2015, once again facing terrorist attacks – different from  previous ones, but nevertheless just as shocking. Who cannot fail to be sickened  at the thought of Israeli Arab youths of 12, 13 and 14 knifing Israeli Jewish  boys or Jewish adults? How could we not be moved to learn of the Palestinian  Arab gunmen who murdered Eitam and Naama Henkin last month as their four  horrified children looked on? A week ago I received an email from a friend  living in London. She expressed anxiety and deep sympathy for what was happening  here. “We hope you are safe and feeling okay with everything that is going on in  Israel – we worry about you and your family.” I responded immediately, saying  that we were fine and life goes on as normal in spite of all the terrible things  they see in the media. I also wrote that we here were worried about her and her  family, knowing of the unprecedented increase in anti-Semitism in the UK – both  verbal and physical.After I responded, I asked myself why it had been  necessary for me to say “life goes on as normal here” and, at the same time,  express my anxiety for my friend and her family living in a country where  anti-Semitism has indeed created the need for an more stringent security  measures to protect its Jewish community.It was almost as if history was  repeating itself. I was reacting just as I did back in 2001 in South Africa.  Then, my South African WIZO colleagues seemed to accept living behind high walls  as well as being unable to walk around in Johannesburg for fear of being  attacked or even murdered. Life goes on just as it does here in Israel.A  few days ago, friends originally from South Africa told me that their  Johannesburg- based children are worried about them and have instructed their  parents to avoid journeying on buses. I could not help but wonder how the South  African Jewish community must be feeling with the recent visit of Hamas chief  Khaled Mashaal. At a government-endorsed rally, Mashaal compared the Palestinian  cause to the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. Referring to the current  terrorist attacks in Israel he stated that “the uprisings will continue until  freedom is achieved and the land is for Palestine and its people.” African  National Congress secretary-general Gwede Mantashe declared that his party had  signed a “letter of intent” with Hamas. He went on to say, “We have an intention  of building a long-lasting relationship.” Surely this must have a negative  impact on the Jewish community.How do we cope in a situation where we  know that our fellow citizens are being attacked almost on a daily basis – and  it might be us tomorrow? It would seem that wherever we live we endeavor to  protect ourselves by burying our heads in the sand. On one level we are aware of  what is happening, the stabbings and shootings, but on another level we need to  protect ourselves by blocking out the painful reality and endeavor to continue  with our daily lives.A few days ago we sat around our dining table with  a group of friends, talking about how our government was fairing, the  diminishing number of tourists, and the new and shocking phenomenon of child  murderers. We simultaneously enjoyed our food and drank our wine. This may seem  strange, yet this is how we cope. We continue life as normal even when it is at  its most abnormal. We look around the world and, for the most part, would not  wish to live elsewhere.Israel is our country – a place where we feel at  home because it is home.

<title>Here and There: Today is tomorrow</title>
<date>30/7/2015</date>
<content>
There have been two major topics heading our media of late, the Iranian nuclear  deal and BDS, both posing threats to this one Jewish state.There are  those who would argue that the two are not to be compared.




Iran, with its  continual threat to annihilate us, is an existential threat, while the Boycott,  Divestment and Sanctions campaign cannot be placed in the same category. Or can  it? Let us begin by recognizing that the United States is of enormous  significance to the State of Israel. Its importance is twofold: first, because  of the US’s steadfast support of Israel, in terms of military aid and, often,  unique support at the United Nations; second, because of its Jewish  community.Yes, this is the reality today – but what of tomorrow?  Tomorrow begins with what is happening on campuses today, because the graduate  of today will become the leader (both national and Jewish) of  tomorrow.An Anti-Defamation League review of the past year clearly shows  that anti-Israel activity on American college campuses is largely dominated by  BDS. Jewish students throughout the country are facing hatred, accused of  supporting an “apartheid state” and often have to cope with blatant  anti-Semitism. This is a situation the likes of which their parents and  grandparents never had to confront.The truth is that the majority of  today’s Jewish students are totally unprepared for the barrage of abuse and  hatred toward Israel that has now become the norm. There are numerous reasons  for this, including a lack of knowledge relating to Israel and its history.  This, in turn, has increased the number of students being attracted to  relatively new Jewish groups that firmly believe Israel should be at the  receiving end of BDS, a trend that in itself should create a sense of  foreboding.WHEN AND how did BDS begin? Wikipedia states that it began in  July 2005. However, as the leader of the WIZO delegation to the infamous and  so-called UN Conference against Racism, held in Durban in 2001, I believe this  is where BDS was born. There, numerous NGOs came together for the prime purpose  of delegitimizing Israel.Israel was portrayed as an “apartheid” state.  One Uri Davis, an academic born in Jerusalem, brought up in Kfar Shmaryahu, was  busy giving away his book Israel: An Apartheid State.As an Israeli Jew,  he was the flavor of the month, invited on to TV and radio talk shows. He and  other academics, such as Ilan Pappé, are well known on the campus circuit as  Israeli Jews who propagate BDS and are promoting the now annual “Israel  Apartheid Week” on campuses worldwide.Back to the Durban conference.  Before leaving with our WIZO team to participate in this “Anti-Racist”  conference, I contacted the Israeli Foreign Ministry to request materials to  help us prepare for what we imagined would be a challenging  situation.However, in our wildest dreams we could not have foreseen that  it would turn out as bad as it did.The answer to my request was that  nothing was available at this time, but “not to worry,” for when the  governmental delegation came out for the second conference (the first was NGOs  only, followed by the governmental conference), it would bring with it suitable  material.We arrived at the conference and were overwhelmed with the most  sophisticated and multiple anti-Israel materials – from T-shirts to posters and  leaflets.WIZO – the one organization that had a “Z” in its name – had  nothing. So we spent hours at the Durban Jewish Community Center producing – as  best we could – our own material, which paled compared to the professional  material we had to combat.When the governmental delegation arrived, its  idea of appropriate hasbara (public diplomacy) material came in the form of  thick books – which were, of course, totally useless.On to the  governmental conference where the Foreign Ministry decided – in its “wisdom” –  to send a low-level delegation to represent the State of Israel.What  transpired was little short of a disgrace. Rabbi Michael Melchior, who was the foreign minister at the time, did not come  to Durban but he wrote the speech to be read by someone in the delegation. Those  of us sitting there squirmed in our seats as the person who read what was an  excellent speech on paper clearly could not read English very well. Enough  said.A FEW years later at an International WIZO conference with a  gathering of 1,000 participants from all over the world, as the World WIZO  chairwoman of public affairs, I again contacted the Foreign Ministry requesting  material, to be told once more that none was available.Fortunately, I  have a good friend who, together with her sister, produced an excellent small  brochure which answered the hasbara questions of the day.She donated  1,000 of these effective booklets, which were distributed at our conference  during the hasbara session addressed by a member of the Foreign Ministry. The  following day I received a phone call from the secretary of the Foreign Ministry  representative requesting some 5,000 copies of the brochure.When I asked  if this was something that would be purchased, I was told: “Oh no, the Foreign  Ministry has no money available for materials.”Perhaps you are now  wondering what tales of yesteryear have to do with today? It is quite simple:  Israel has neglected the entire area of hasbara or the battle of the word for  far too long. It is only now – when BDS has taken a firm hold – that our  leadership is beginning to recognize it is time to do something.The  question is what to do? A Jewish People Policy Institute report presented to the  Israeli government at the beginning of July on the state of the Jewish people  suggests that Jerusalem take the initiative.Yes, there is Sheldon  Adelson who has pledged a vast sum of money to combat BDS. Yes, there is Rabbi  Shmuley Boteach whose involvement has been sought as one experienced with campus  challenges. Yet Boteach maintains that there is no clear direction or  organization to deal with the ever-growing hostility toward  Israel.Tomorrow remains the priority, but it can be ensured only by what  we do today. There can be no doubt that today’s greatest friend – the  United States – will not automatically be there for Israel  tomorrow. Israel’s anti-BDS effort should be clearly focused on campuses  worldwide but especially in the United States. We should be in touch with  leaders of America’s Jewish community to help seek out incoming freshmen with  leadership potential.If Sheldon Adelson has money available, then it  should be utilized to bring over these youngsters for as long as possible –  three months, six months or, better still, one year. We must ensure that they  are in touch with the real Israel – yes, with all its faults – but an Israel  that is far removed from the “apartheid” state being propagated  internationally. Birthright – a 10-day free visit to Israel – has proven  to be great in contributing toward a strengthening of Jewish  identity.Today we are facing a tsunami in terms of our image abroad. If  we do not begin to address the campus issue with the urgency, funding and  outreach it deserves, there will be no guarantee that Israel’s most important  supporter will be there for us in the future.
While BDS may not be an  existential threat in terms of our personal survival, it is a potent and  dangerous threat to the tomorrow we would wish for our children and  grandchildren.

<title>If they scream, I’ll shout</title>
<date>3/3/2015</date>

I admit that I grew up in a fairly sheltered, well, very sheltered environment  within the American Jewish world: I attended Chicago’s Solomon Schechter Day  School before my family moved to Boca Raton, Florida, where I attended a modern  Orthodox middle school and high school.This year, I am spending my gap  year studying at Midreshet Lindenbaum in Jerusalem, and I plan on attending  University of Pennsylvania next fall.




Aside from what I’ve seen in the  news and learned about in school, I have never been exposed to the anti-Semitism  that exists in the world. Even when making the decision about which college I  would attend, a major factor in my decision was whether I would be surrounded  with an active Jewish community. Maybe my sheltered upbringing has made me naïve  but I never imagined that UPenn (where the student body is almost a third  Jewish) would also be a home to such cruel anti-Israel campaigns that cross the  line into blatant anti-Semitism. This past October, I was appalled to see  pictures like this posted by one of my Facebook friends.This photo,  taken on the UPenn campus, reads: “Each flag represents a Palestinian in Gaza  who was murdered by the Israeli Defense Forces between July 8th and August 25th.  This latest assault is part of Israel’s siege on Gaza since 2007. The siege of  Gaza is part of Israel’s 60 year occupation of Palestine. Join us tonight for a  candlelight vigil.”
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}At that moment, I felt a great deal of concern about  what will await me when I get to college next year. I will enter a world that  demonizes Israel with no regard for the actions of Israel’s enemies like Hamas  and Hezbollah – it’s a world consumed by hatred for Israel, crossing the line  into hatred of all Jews; a world that is dedicated to bringing about the demise  of the Jewish state and our connection to it. At that very moment, it struck me  that my secure bubble which has sheltered me for over 18 years is about to  burst.Anti-Israel activity has taken root in many college  campuses.Ranging from Israel Apartheid Week, Students for Justice in  Palestine and American Muslims for Palestine (the leading organization providing  anti-Zionist training and education), to BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and  Sanctions) clubs, each is not only extremely disturbing, but also very  frightening.I am not saying that I think we should not be talking and  debating about Israel, but what I see isn’t an effort to engage or find  solutions within common ground, rather, it’s pure intimidation that crosses the  line into anti-Semitism, by completely silencing and isolating the pro-Israel  voice.On February 26, Israel Apartheid Week returns to US college  campuses. This is a multi-week effort whose sole purpose is to distribute  distorted and false information about Israel’s alleged “apartheid” policies  toward Palestinians and to build support for future BDS campaigns. It is a time  when Jewish students are targeted in various ways, and their voices are drowned  out. They call this education, but it is pure intimidation, which offers no  solutions or possibility of dialogue.I know next year I will encounter  situations where people will want to silence me for my support for Israel; where  some will attempt to stifle my efforts to raise awareness of the pro-Israel  narrative; where there will be student groups whose hateful accusations against  Israel cross the line into anti-Semitism, by claiming Israel is guilty of  apartheid or genocide and with revolting comparisons to Nazi Germany. I know I  must not be afraid – fear only fuels these haters. Silence only encourages more  heinous acts.While I’m of course unsure of what is to come, I am  motivated to learn and to involve myself more, so that when I do step on the  University of Pennsylvania campus, I will not feel overpowered by the hate,  distrust and disgust launched my way, and I will not be intimidated by their  tactics, but rather, I will be proud of my Jewish identity and proud to raise my  voice for Israel.
I recently viewed the new documentary Crossing the Line  2: The new face of Anti-Semitism on Campus – a very powerful warning about what  is happening on North American campuses. But it is more than that. It is a call  to our parents to prepare us, starting long before we reach college. It is  critical that they provide us with opportunities to engage in discussions about  Israel in a safe environment. And it is essential that they give us the tools to  know what to do when we witness or are the targets of campaigns against Israel  which cross the line into anti-Semitism.

<title>Is Barkat forsaking Jerusalem?</title>
<date>24/12/2015</date>
<content>
Nir Barkat probably wouldn’t admit to this, but he’s a mayor in transition. On  Tuesday, he announced that he’s joining the Likud and setting his sights on a  position in national politics. Granted, in the same breath he declared that he  would continue serving as mayor until 2018, but what if the national election is  moved up to 2017, for example? From now on, Barkat has one foot out the door. He  might not admit this, but his priorities have completely changed. And this is a  darn shame, because Jerusalem desperately needs an engaged, full-time mayor now  more than ever.Let’s go over a few facts, not rely on impressions and  feelings: Jerusalem is deteriorating.




This is happening first and  foremost because of the demographics, the social composition of the city and the  urban structure. Jerusalem now lags behind 15 other Israeli  municipalities.You need to take a look at and memorize these statistics.  According to data that were published this week, poverty rates in 2014 rose to  46.1 percent in the region and 48.6% in Jerusalem.In east Jerusalem, the  situation is even worse. We should be very proud of ourselves (not). We love  investing in the eastern part of the city, unless it happens to be in education,  infrastructure, housing or garbage collection. The gap is greatest with respect  to poverty: Over the last year, the poverty rate in east Jerusalem increased by  5 percentage points. As of today, 79.5% of east Jerusalem residents live below  the poverty line.And among children, the number is even higher: 83.9% of  children living in east Jerusalem are poor.You might retort that in  reality they are enjoying a high standard of living since they benefit from  National Insurance Institute payments and from Employment Bureau  services.Well, I’m sorry to rain on your party, but according to Israel  Social TV, it turns out that Arabs living in east Jerusalem have a hard time  navigating the Israeli government’s bureaucratic labyrinth and as a result many  of them do not receive NII payments or other benefits they  deserve.Despite the fact that 13% of the country’s poor people live in  east Jerusalem, only 2.7% of NII income support payments reach families in east  Jerusalem.Sixty-nine percent of income support claims made by residents  of east Jerusalem are denied, the vast majority on the grounds of failure to  submit the correct documents or failure to show up as required to the government  employment office.Jerusalem is at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict.If you’re curious what a binational Israel might look like,  just come to Jerusalem and see for yourself. There will be two peoples: Jewish  and Arab.At first, the Jewish one will be slightly larger in number than  the Arab one. This small numerical advantage will keep the Jewish public happy  for a number of years, but then the demographics will begin changing. At some  point, we will turn into a Jewish minority ruling an Arab majority.And  then we will face the real dilemma: Do we offer true civil and political rights  to the Arabs with whom we share this space between the Mediterranean Sea and the  Jordan River? Voting rights, as we all know, were denied to residents of east  Jerusalem.Can we deny voting rights to Arabs living in Judea, Samaria  and Gaza as well? The third intifada is knocking loudly on our door. The  terrorism we are experiencing is more violent than the first intifada, but less  violent than the second one. Even so, 23 Jews have been killed in terrorist  attacks in the last few months, many more have been injured and treated for  shock, and countless Israelis have been too scared to leave their homes. This is  the goal of terrorism. It is no surprise, of course, that most of the attacks  have taken place in and around Jerusalem. Jerusalem is the gateway to Israel.  Some 350,000 Palestinian live here and thousands make their way across the city  daily.It should be of no surprise then that terrorists are carrying out  so many attacks in Jerusalem.Jerusalem is at the heart of the conflict,  the city that is holy to three religions, with the Temple Mount the focus of  religious extremists on both sides who irresponsibly fan the flames of  fire.This is how it will be in a binational Israel – constant friction  between the two communities everywhere they come into contact, and slowly  spilling over into each other’s neighborhoods.There is no way we can  completely isolate the Palestinians, build hermetically sealed neighborhoods,  make sure they don’t drive on streets used by Jews, or have any connection with  our schools. This is called apartheid, and under no circumstances do we want to  live in an apartheid state. We want our home to be Jewish, democratic, Zionist,  peace loving, with a Jewish majority and an Arab minority that enjoys full civil  rights as citizens in any democracy would want.I am against dividing  Jerusalem.Jerusalem is my city and the city of my parents. My father,  Eliezer z”l, was honored as a Distinguished Citizen of Jerusalem (Yakir  Yerushalayim).I believe that there is so much we still need to build in  Jerusalem, to strengthen the city economically and socially.But the  current city leadership does not understand the severity of the crisis we’re  experiencing.Nor does the mayor realize that what happens in Jerusalem  affects the outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Therefore, we  must grit our teeth and suffer the pain that’s involved in making difficult  decisions, such as deciding whether or not we should disengage from  neighborhoods in east Jerusalem and turn control over these areas to the  Palestinian Authority. No, this does not constitute a division of the city.  Rather, it is a wise move that will save us from the demographic imbalance in  Jerusalem. Such a move would still allow Israel control over and full access to  religious sites that are holy to Judaism, Islam and Christianity.The  government must make Jerusalem one of its top priorities, ahead of the North or  the South. We’re always searching for the periphery, but it is here right under  our noses. There is a geographic periphery, and then there is the obvious and  painful social periphery.Mayor Nir Barkat has worked very hard to make  improvements, and he has accomplished many great things during his tenure. But  will others be able to cope better with the fear and radicalization that are  taking place in the city? Barkat’s campaign posters against Finance Minister  Moshe Kahlon that were pasted around the city called on the latter not to  forsake Jerusalem.Now it’s time for Kahlon to turn the tables and ask  the very same thing of Barkat.

<title>Is China Israel’s last, best hope?</title>
<date>29/6/2015</date>
<content>
This past semester  about 150 students at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government participated in a  student-organized trip called the “Palestine Trek.” The trip, led by Palestinian  students at the school, was planned as a tour of the land’s “1948  borders.”The organizers’ apparent goal was to expose participants to the  Palestinian perspective on the conflict, if not persuade them of its moral  righteousness. Of course, many of those who participated needed no convincing  and were already hostile to Israel, while many others who may have begun the  journey ambivalent, returned skeptical, if not distrusting, of the Jewish  state.




Participants heard from a multitude of Palestinian speakers  offering a range of views sympathetic to their side of the conflict. The usual  anti-Israel arguments were on display. One participant said that they heard  almost every day and from every speaker that Israel is an apartheid state. But  there were also some less common arguments voiced: a Boycott, Divestment and  Sanctions (BDS) movement speaker charged Israelis with “milking the  Holocaust.”The sole Israeli the students heard from was on the far Right  – convenient for painting all Israelis as damnably hostile to  Palestinians.
It is not hard to imagine why so many students would return  from such a trip with anti-Israel views. The views of students at the school –  even before the trip – appeared to parallel the larger trend of millennial views  toward Israel: increasing hostility. During last summer’s war in Gaza, a Pew  Research Center poll showed a widening generational chasm in views on Israel: 29  percent of 18- to 29-yearolds blamed Israel more than Hamas versus 21% who  believed the opposite. In comparison, Democrats blamed Hamas more 29% to 26% and  liberal Democrats were split at 30%-30%. This was before Israel’s recent  election, which hurt its world standing. In short, the young are turning against  Israel and its narrative.As my generation grows older, America’s  historical support for Israel may flag. Most of the future electorate, far  removed from the Holocaust, Israel’s founding, or the wars that nearly  extinguished the nascent state, are likely to remain steady in their distrust of  – or disgust with – the country as they grow older, especially if peace is not  obtained. And as they assume the reins of leadership across society, in business  and in government, official support for Israel is likely to  wane.Amplifying this trend and likely outcome is the fact that  Hispanics, the fastest growing demographic in the US, lay even greater  culpability – 35% – with Israel for last summer’s conflict.Certainly,  Israel will be able to count on the continued support of some  Americans.Evangelical Christians and devout Catholics have long  supported the Jewish state. However, they will be vastly outnumbered and their  electoral influence will diminish as young Americans increasingly turn away from  religion.So if America abandons Israel, will the Middle East’s sole  democracy stand alone? Ironically, thanks to Christian proselytization Israel’s  last best hope may become China.China is on track to become home to the  largest Christian population in the world.There are already 100 million  Christians in China – more than the number of Communist Party members – and the  community is growing rapidly. Professor Fenggang Yang, a sociologist at Purdue  University, estimates there will be 160 million Christians in China by 2025 and  247 million by 2030. Evangelical Christianity is spreading exponentially in  China.If their American brethren are any guide, Christian Chinese will  look favorably upon Israel. It is well-documented that the Chinese already  admire Jews. Books with titles like Talmud: The Greatest Jewish Bible for Making  Money and Learn to Make Money with the Jews abound in Chinese  bookstores.Many of the Chinese Christians will become or already are  members of the Chinese Communist Party. They will serve in Chinese government  posts and view the world through a Christian lens. It is a lens that, among  other things, may be sympathetic to Israel. Meanwhile, the Christian millions  who are not in government may also indirectly influence the Chinese state to  support the Jewish one.Certainly, this would require a departure from  China’s foreign policy since the rise of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. China has  long pursued a pragmatic and national interest- or realpolitik-based foreign  policy.In contrast, the US has oscillated between pragmatism and  idealism. Yet, a Chinese state with over 250 million evangelicals may be of much  different character than what we have witnessed to date. It may no longer  single-mindedly pursue all of its foreign policy objectives based on realpolitik  alone. Instead, it too may be infused with a modicum of Christian impulse and  Christian ethics. It is there where Israel may cultivate a new ally.For  now, however, Israel must do better making its case to the next generation of  Americans.

<title>January 21: Look to the east</title>
<date>20/1/2015</date>
<content>
Look to the east Sir, – It is wonderful to note that Japanese Prime Minister  Shinzo Abe has come to Israel with an entourage calling for meaningful trade  relations (“Netanyahu: We must open Asian markets because of anti-Semitism in  Europe,” January 19).




Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments on  anti-Semitism in Europe might be true, but it is also important to develop trade  with Asia for its own sake. Asia is booming. Israel is strategically located. It  remains what it always was in history – a land bridge between the Far East, the  Middle East and Europe.Asian minds are eager to learn, not fixated on  the past. Asian people are delightful to meet and have a wonderful culture. This  is the time for Israel to develop great knowledge of the Asian peoples and move  ahead accordingly.Trade is most important. I hope that from this day  forward trade will blossom into real friendship.BATYA KOENIGSBERG  
Jerusalem Here already Sir, – With regard to “Danger: Dishonest politicians  could be up ahead” (Analysis, January 19), could be? What the article describes  is almost a given. One gets the feeling of “same old, same old” when reading  it.Much more disturbing than what’s up ahead is the number of  politicians across the political spectrum who have been convicted of crimes of  one sort or another and are running again in the current elections. It is  frightening to know that they are contributing toward decisions that affect our  personal and national lives. It is upsetting to see the rotten example being set  for younger generations.I never understood why such people have to wait  seven years before being eligible again for a position of national  influence.The punishment should include a permanent ban, even assuming  that they’ve totally reformed.Such a ban would hopefully serve as a  deterrent for others while sending a message to our youth.I’m tired of  the national tsk, tsk and oh no over the scandal-of-the- day, followed by the  ho-hum until the next.NACHAMA KANNER 
Rehovot Sir, – If the people of  Israel and the State of Israel are not viewed, internationally, as being strong  militarily, diplomatically and politically, we won’t be in any position to lower  the price of cottage cheese or housing, let alone absorb all those immigrants we  hope are coming.I hope all the election rhetoric flying around will  reflect these truths.ANITA ELLIS 
Jerusalem Not so official Sir, – With  regard to “Orthodox woman appointed to serve as communal spiritual leader in  Efrat” (January 19), we wish to make a clarification.Although we applaud  the private initiative of Rabbi Shlomo Riskin’s decision to appoint Dr. Jennie  Rosenfeld to assist him in dealing with halachic and religious issues in Efrat,  she is not employed by the Religious Council of Efrat and has no official  position as “communal spiritual leader in Efrat.”If at some later date  it is decided to officially establish such a position, it will be dealt with in  the proper legal manner, including an official tender.BOB LANG CHAIM  SCHMELL 
Efrat The writers are head and member, respectively, of the Religious  Council of Efrat.Mussed-up makeover Sir, – I searched in vain for the  word “communicated” above the half page of pro-Herzog bloviation by Jeff Barak –  which issued forth under the rubric Reality Check no less (“The Herzog  makeover,” January 19).Dropping the nickname Buji will hardly do it for  this lackluster wannabe leader. And his conjugal liaison with Tzipi Livni makes  most of us gag, not only because she is guilty of serial political infidelity,  but because her single accomplishment to date has been getting us into the Gaza  quagmire that has cost us so much in life and treasure.But what does it  say about a man who already comes across as an adolescent-voiced wimp and then  gives away half his kingdom to Livni when he could have purchased her for a  whole lot less? Is this the sort of prime minister we want at the helm during  serious negotiations with our sworn enemies – someone who overplays his  opponent’s hand? Yes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s expiration date may  have come and gone. But the Bible warns us against the yoking together of a  donkey and a cow.With team Herzog we are all in deep trouble, Mr.  Barak’s windy fulminations notwithstanding.J.J. GROSS 
Jerusalem Sir, –  Jeff Barak’s declaration that “Herzog has dazzlingly disrupted the entire  political ecosystem with the masterstroke of this election campaign” is nothing  short of astounding, if not whimsical fantasy.Would any see-it-as-it-is  Israeli realist vote for a Herzog-Livni disaster ticket, thereby putting first  and foremost Israel’s most critical security interests in their enemy-appeasing  hands? I believe and sincerely trust not.The economy and high cost of  living are certainly problems, but they are dwarfed by the ever-escalating  genocidal Islamic threat, let alone the potentially suicidal Labor/left-wing  goal of the creation of a genocidal, judenfrei, apartheid terrorist state in the  heart of our country and within missile range of Ben-Gurion Airport.The  time is long overdue for liberals and left-wingers to abandon their ostrich  technique and squarely face the critical priority, urgency and reality of  Israel’s security and survival.ALAN CROOCK 
Kfar Saba Sir, – Jeff Barak  once again lauds Labor Party leader Isaac Herzog, this time for having  “dazzlingly disrupted the entire political ecosystem” by aligning himself with  Tzipi Livni. Wasn’t she, by most accounts, an abject failure as foreign minister  and a total failure when it came to forming a new government in 2009? What’s so  “dazzling” about that? JACOB HIMMELFARB Jerusalem Sir, – Has everyone completely  forgotten Tzipi Livni’s “great achievement” – the infamous UN Security Council  Resolution 1701? At the time, Livni expressed much pride in her “successful”  negotiations to prevent Hezbollah from rearming after our last war in Lebanon.  But unlike her firm conviction, we are now faced with a much greater threat from  our northern border.It reminds me of US President Barack Obama using the  person who acted as negotiator with North Korea for his hopeless talks with  Iran, trying to stop the latter from galloping toward the atom bomb. It is  obvious that here, too, any agreement will be a farce.I was amazed that  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put Livni in charge of negotiations with the  Palestinian Authority.How could he ignore her ineptness facing  Hezbollah? If Labor wins the coming elections, party leader Isaac Herzog will  undoubtedly allow his “partner” to wreak even more damage on Israel’s  security.Now that another round of missiles from Hezbollah-land might be  imminent, Livni’s great part in enabling it to formidably rearm is even more  relevant. I won’t hold my breath waiting to hear from her the slightest doubt  that Resolution 1701 was a huge mistake.TAMAR GINAT 
Yehud Expect no less  Sir, – When reader Angela Formby states that “Israeli forces have been helping  Syrian rebels from the Nusra Front for quite some time” and that the rebels are  “being encouraged by the Israeli government” (“No Surprise,” Letters, January  19), she is seriously ill-informed or deliberately misleading.It is well  documented that Israel is supplying urgently required humanitarian aid to Syrian  civilians near its borders and accedes to requests for medical assistance when  necessary. Whether the casualties are civilians or combatants is irrelevant. I  would expect no less from my own government.STANLEY GROSSMAN

<title>January 28, 2015: Enough problems</title>
<date>27/1/2015</date>
<content>
Enough problems Sir, – Regarding “Yisrael Beytenu to distribute ‘Charlie Hebdo’  magazine after Steimatzky pulls it from stores” (January 26), shame! What has  happened to our Jewish teachings and values? Hillel taught: What is hateful to  you, do not do to your neighbors.




To this day we are angered and upset to  see the old Nazi cartoons degrading Jews. We have enough problems without  importing more hatred from France or elsewhere.NEAL ROTHNER
Hashmonaim  Sir, – In the past I have admired Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman for his  ability, and sometimes courage, to speak out strongly on controversial  subjects.Unfortunately, his intention to have activists from his Yisrael  Beytenu party acquire Charlie Hebdo magazines and hand them out free of charge  is completely beyond my comprehension.There comes a time when freedom of  speech has to be superseded by good sense and also good manners. It is simply  stupid and extremely bad manners to hand out a publication that might be  offensive to a large part of our population, namely Israeli Arabs.Kol  hakavod to Steimatzky.What it did was not capitulation to extremist  intimidation – it was a sign of sensitivity to the feelings of fellow  citizens.MIRIAM VAN BERS
Tzofit 
Far from realitySir, – While I have the  greatest regard for the opinions of Prof. Alan M. Dershowitz and  admiration for his untiring efforts on behalf of Israel and world Jewry, I have  to say that “The case against the ICC investigating Israel” (Comment &  Opinion, January 26) presents a picture that is too far from reality. He is so  infused with love of Israel and assurance of the rightness of its position that  he makes statements that border on the ridiculous.Dershowitz says that  the foundations of the Palestinian case will lie on the statement that the 1949  armistice lines would have to be accepted by the court as the de jure borders of  a pseudo- state called Palestine. Unfortunately, this is indeed the view of the  Palestinians, their Arab brothers and most of the rest of the world. Just  because we say it isn’t so doesn’t mean it isn’t so to them.He says that  “Israel offered generous proposals in 2000/01, 2008 and most recently in 2014,  none of which was accepted.”Try to find a single Palestinian or Arab  leader who will subscribe to that view. He also says that Israel “is a vibrant  democracy governed by the rule of law.” In the eyes of our opponents (and who is  to say not also in the eyes of the court) we are a neo-Nazi, apartheid, racist  regime of child-killers.We need to remember that the best form of  defense is attack. Look into the history of every judge, prosecutor and  witness. Find the stuff that either disqualifies them or deters them from  speaking for fear of revelation.Drag the whole International Criminal  Court process through the mud – which is where it belongs if they go ahead with  this farce.HENRY KAYE
Ashkelon Sir – Prof. Alan M. Dershowitz makes a  statement that fully stretches the imagination. He refers to Gilo and other  suburbs of Jerusalem, as well as to Ma’aleh Adumim, as areas that “Palestinian  leaders have long acknowledged would remain part of Israel in any negotiated  resolution, despite being beyond the Green Line.”No “Palestinian leader”  has ever acknowledged this. If any has, I should like to know who.LARRY  REEFE
Netanya
 What’s in a name Sir, – Sarah Honig’s “Zionism and etrogism”  (Another Tack, January 23) touches a very interesting and, at the same time,  sensitive question of the true meaning of Labor’s and Hatnua’s electoral slogan,  claiming they represent the “Zionist camp.”Does it mean that Israeli  citizens who are not active members of these parties or those who will not vote  for their “camp” are not Zionists, and that they are against Zionism as a  historic movement? As a retired linguist, I have my personal objections for the  wrong interpretation and usage (abuse) of the words “Zionist” and “Zionism,”  especially among our politicians.In my view, Zionism’s aim has been to  convince and encourage Jews in the Diaspora to return to Zion (Jerusalem).  Following that logic, a Zionist is a Diaspora Jew who prepares to immigrate to  this region. Before, but especially after, the modern State of Israel was  created, all Jews who made aliya fulfilled their Zionist  dream.Therefore, all Jews who live in Israel should be considered merely  Israeli citizens, having their Jewish nationality (and religion) as well, no  matter to which political or ideological orientation they belong.AVRAHAM  ATIJAS
Jerusalem Sir, – With regard to “Labor activist files petition for Bayit  Yehudi to change its ‘misleading’ name” (January 26), years ago I overheard a  discussion. The subject was a well-known Jewish gangster. My mother: He  has no right to call himself a Jew! My father: A Jew is a Jew. Even if he makes  a picnic on Yom Kippur, he is a Jew. God doesn’t let go of us so  easily.Bayit Yehudi is full of Jews. Some say good Jews, some say  bad. But a Jew is a Jew.

MARCELLA WACHTEL
Jerusalem 
A bit extravagantSir, – H.A. Goodman’s assertions on behalf of a nuclearized Iran (“Why bombing  Iran would be a strategic mistake for Israel and America,” Comment &  Features, January 21) seem a bit extravagant.It is most unlikely that  nuclear weapons would transform Iran into a force that would stabilize our  region. Far more likely is that they would redirect Iran’s destabilizing  impulses away from the Arab-Israeli conflict and into the Persian Gulf.A  nuclearized Iran would feel emboldened to assert Shi’ite supremacy in a manner  that conventional Iran shies away from.Most specifically, it would have  no problem challenging the House of Ibn Saud for control over the holy cities of  Mecca and Medina.While such a turn of events would be an unmitigated  bounty for Israel, I remain unconvinced that America, even Obama’s America,  would accept such a development with equanimity, notwithstanding the compelling  logic of the late nuclear weapons expert Kenneth Waltz.AVI BERKOWITZ
Efrat
 Imperfect Rav KavSir, – The other day I purchased a round-trip ticket on  Israel Railways from Beit Shemesh to Beer Sheba with a Rav Kav smart  card.When I placed my card on the turnstile to make my return trip, I  was denied entry to the train platform.I turned to a clerk. She read the  card on her computer and told me that I had already taken my return trip! I  protested and was courteously instructed to speak to the station manager, who  read the card, asked me a few questions and allowed me to board. (He, too, was  most courteous.) If I hadn’t by chance arrived long before my train was to  depart, the delay meant I would have missed it.In the course of our  conversation, the station manager mentioned that there were many cases like  mine. Conclusion: The Rav Kav is not reliable. It leaves us helpless in the face  of technical glitches, human error and dishonest brokers. Who loses? The  consumer.Even if the Rav Kav were reliable, there is something wrong  with the consumer having to rely on the seller for confirming that it has in  fact been loaded, and for knowing how much credit remains. There will always be  glitches.TZVI ABRAHAM

<title>January 5: Well interpreted</title>
<date>4/1/2015</date>
<content>
Well interpreted Sir, – With regard to “New study of UN Resolution 242 could  alter views of Israeli-Arab conflict” (January 2), the Supreme Court, when it  gives its opinion on agreements or contracts, argues that it tries to understand  what the original drafters had in mind. The studies and interpretations of  Resolution 242 do not need our imagination, as we have the drafters’ reasoning  in their own words.




Lord Caradon, one of the architects of the  resolution, said: “It would have been wrong to demand that Israel return to its  positions of June 4, 1967, because these positions were undesirable and  artificial.After all, they were just the places where the soldiers on  each side happened to be on the day the fighting stopped in 1948. They were just  armistice lines. That is why we do not demand that the Israelis return to them  and I think we were right not to.”And Steven Schwebel, head of the  International Court of Justice, said in 1970 on those armistice lines: “Where  the prior holder of territory [Jordan] had seized that territory unlawfully, the  state which subsequently takes that territory in the lawful exercise of  self-defense has against the prior holder better title.”It does not seem  to me, therefore, that any other understanding of 242 and the armistice lines  need be further interpreted.ISIDORE SOLOMONS 
Beit Shemesh Closer to home Sir, – With regard to your January 2 editorial “Film censorship,” you do not  have to go as far as Etihad Airways. Turkish Airlines, which is very well liked  here in Israel (I flew it), does not mention Tel Aviv as a destination in its  in-flight magazine.RUTH SCHUELER 
Jerusalem Don’t sanitize Sir, – Once  again, Liat Collins has written brilliantly what so many are thinking (“The  statehood bid and gamble,” My Word, January 2). My only question is why the  selection of such a benign photo – a formal, dignified image of Palestinian  Authority President Mahmoud Abbas at the grave of Yasser Arafat? For its 50th  anniversary, Abbas’s Fatah movement posted on its Facebook page vile photos, one  of them a pile of skulls with Stars of David on them. Members burned US and  Israeli flags to celebrate the occasion.Yes, such images might have  shocked your readers. But using a sanitized image is not doing the public any  favor.

Jerusalem Distasteful depths Sir, – Martin  Sherman’s venomous “Delusional, destructive Left vs incompetent, impotent Right”  (Into the Fray, January 2) crosses the line of decent journalism.How  dare he use the inciting terms “disloyal” and “borderline treasonous” when  referring to the Left, and how does The Jerusalem Post allow this? Mr. Sherman  ingeniously offers balance by calling the Right “impotent” and “incompetent,”  yet it should be noted that he is not referring to its management of the  country, rather to his claim that “it has been manifestly incapable of  vanquishing its left-wing rivals.” Does he not know that we have had rightwing  governments for the past decade and more? He claims that the Oslo process is the  “seminal event” that separates Left from Right in Israeli politics, and mocks  the late Yitzhak Rabin for trying to implement those accords, lumping him  together with Amos Oz and Yossi Beilin as proponents of political appeasement,  citing insidiously Sudetenland and the Nazis in 1938! A more appropriate  association with the Nazi past would be Sherman’s own Goebbels-like distortions  of the truth.It is well to remember that both the Left and the Right  have been responsible for this country’s great achievements and unfortunate  errors over the years. Sharply critical debate is acceptable, but neither side  can, nor should, be labeled disloyal or treasonous.The Post should  ensure that debates in its pages do not descend to such distasteful  depths.

Netanya Good on her Sir, – How refreshing it is to  have in our midst such a person as Anett Haskia, author of “I am not a traitor”  (Observations, January 2). I hope she succeeds in her bid to win a place on  Bayit Yehudi’s Knesset list. She deserves it. And bless her sons for their  service to this country.In the meantime, my advice to her is keep going,  don’t give up.And “watch your back” as much from the Israeli Left as  from elements of the Arab population.

Nahariya Not surprising  Sir, – Gil Troy writes of his disgust about the proposal by the American  Historical Association to single out Israel for boycott (“Dear fellow  historians, vote no to boycotting Israel and preventing dialogue,” Center Field,  December 31).The group’s vote is not surprising.There is a  Jewish belief that we live in a world of falsehood, as opposed to a world of  truth in the afterlife. Three shocking examples: • Arundathi Roy, who has been  called the “conscience of India,” wrote a powerful article on the country’s  horrific caste system in the December issue of the British magazine Prospect. It  is revolting to read that in “the world’s largest democracy,” so-called  untouchables collect human excrement, including those who pick it up by hand,  without gloves, from railway tracks.South Africa has become “a light  unto the nations” because it has cast off the repulsive apartheid system. Yet  the country is a nightmare – a world leader in rapes, particularly the rape of  children; in the number of women with AIDS because they were infected by their  husbands; and in murders.• April 2015 marks the centenary of the  beginning of the Turkish massacre of over a million Armenians, the first  genocide of the 20th century. I Googled “Armenian genocide” and received 643,000  results. Yet when I Googled the terms nakba and al-nakba, I received a combined  771,000 results. It was caused by the Arabs themselves and was minor compared to  the Armenian horror.JACOB MENDLOVIC

Well done, Bibi Sir, –  Whether sincere or not, Hamas’s claim (“Hamas: We are committed to cease-fire  with Israel,” December 26) shows our prime minister in a most heroic  fashion.The previous week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he  would not stand by quietly if there was shooting from the Gaza Strip (“PM after  Hamas attack: I won’t tolerate even 1 rocket,” December 21). He acted upon it.  That retaliation brought about the December 26 headline.Congratulations,  Bibi!

Luck of the Irish Sir, – Each day, as I read my  Jerusalem Post, I get more and more confused as to which party I should vote for  on March 17.Each day brings more disturbing highlights of MKs and their  misdemeanors.I was born in Dublin and hope that some of our Irish  traditions might help this country to once and for all get itself on the right  track so that we have a strong Knesset on which we can rely. So here  goes.
I thought “laundering” meant washing; I found out it has a  different meaning here. St. Patrick drove out the snakes in Ireland; perhaps we  should find a saint (or perhaps a trustworthy rabbi) who would drive out all the  snakes in the Knesset! Why not be like Ireland’s Fianna Fáil, whose slogan was  “vote early and often”? You never know what the luck of the Irish could bring  you!

<title>Jerusalem Post Editorial: Paper, rock, scissors</title>
<date>28/11/2015</date>
<content>
Life in the Holy Land is becoming more and more like a  grim version of that child’s game where each of three components has power over  another.Paper covers rock but is cut by scissors, which can be smashed  by rock, and so on. In the current Middle Eastern version of the game, paper is  represented by Palestinian propaganda; rock is the often lethal but impersonal  level of Palestinian violence; while scissors – like those employed last Monday  by teenagers at Jerusalem’s Mahaneh Yehuda market – represent the ubiquitous and  more personal violence perpetrated by the knife-wielding terrorist.




The  stabbings that characterize the current tidal wave of terrorism is violence on  the personal level. It is an attempt to kill someone directly, not on a bus or  in a cafe as in a second intifada bombing. Today’s terrorist slashes a few  people at most before being shot and killed.The second intifada was  accompanied by signs posted everywhere reminding the public to be on the lookout  for suspicious objects. There are no similar signs at bus stops – yet – warning  you to be on the lookout for suspicious people. But Israelis have grown cautious  in the awareness that what passes for normal life in this country may be  disrupted at any time by terrorism.Any serious attempt to win the  terrorist version of this most dangerous game must deal with all three  interrelated components. First, the Palestinian success at winning what appears  to be the entire galaxy to its cause in defiance of all logic and truth has  never been countered adequately by any of our governments. In lieu of appointing  yet another commission to analyze this ongoing failure, the government should  outsource its so-called “public diplomacy” to a professional advertising  agency.Government bureaucrats have proven themselves incapable of  countering the Palestinian propaganda machine.It’s time to let  professionals do the job. There is ample precedent – for example, PR pros have  often been hired from the US to help with certain election campaigns.But  there is a grimmer dimension of Palestinian propaganda that must be dealt with:  its internal side. The world at large is used to hearing Mahmoud Abbas rant  about the horrors of life under “occupation” and the rigors of “apartheid” and  so forth, while he oversees an entire generation of Palestinian children being  raised on TV shows and school textbooks that teach hatred of Jews.The  result is that a Palestinian schoolboy as young as 11 recently committed a knife  attack on a Jerusalem light rail guard, declaring he did so for the purpose of  dying as a martyr. Whatever education his parents gave him could not compete  with the certainty that he would eventually have a West Bank stadium, or at  least a street, named in his honor. Unless a strategy is conceived that will  effectively counter such vile and lethal incitement, we’ll probably have to rely  on that advertising energy to sell our case.The rock phase of the deadly  game will never end until Palestinian parents teach their children not to throw  rocks. This is unlikely for the foreseeable future, barring a complete reversal  of the Palestinian culture of incitement.They might start by renaming  streets and stadiums that were crowned with the names of terrorist murderers and  call them after real Palestinian heroes, those who would work to achieve  independence for their people via a just settlement with Israel. Just a thought.  But given the ubiquity of rocks and the present poisonous atmosphere, it is  likely that the rock phase of the game will drag on.Unfortunately, the  final component of this grim game is also likely to linger on. While the weapon  of choice of this cold-steel intifada is a large kitchen knife, variants have  also been favored, such as a meat cleaver. Another, less personal, terrorist  technique has appeared in car-ramming attacks. But these are not new to  Jerusalemites, at least, who have suffered numerous ramming attacks over the  years featuring both cars and bulldozers.
The choice of weapon used by  two brainwashed, teenaged Palestinian girls in a Jerusalem attack last week is a  chilling illustration of how desperate the youngest generation of terrorists has  become – and how ultimately self-defeating is their violence. The two used  scissors to attack an elderly man they took for a Jew, but in fact stabbed an  innocent Palestinian passerby.

<title>Jpost Letters to Editor: Police negligence?</title>
<date>1/8/2015</date>
<content>
Police negligence?
Incompetence, shortsightedness, or plain criminal negligence?  I’m trying to comprehend the police mindset, after reading in your report of  Thursday’s atrocity that “Judea and Samaria police were not required to track  [Yishai] Schlissel...
because he committed his crime in Jerusalem” (“Man  stabs 6 at Jerusalem Gay Pride Parade,’ July 31). If so, why didn’t they alert  the Jerusalem police to look out for him? An avowed hater of the LGBT community,  Schlissel was released a mere three weeks ago.Did it not occur to anyone  in the police that there was some possibility that he would repeat his crime? My  heart goes out to the injured, and to the gentle, happy people who wanted  nothing more than to enjoy their parade.




SHULA BERMAN EfratBad image 
First the stabbing at the gay parade, and then the burning and murder of a  child. We must stop the actions in the name of religious-nationalism now,  hitting them hard and for good. In addition to being tragic, painful atrocities,  what is happening in Israel is making Jews all over the world look  bad.STEVEN ROSS New York 

Pollard’s release 
Regarding the announcement  that Jonathan Pollard is slated to be set free (“Pollard to be released Nov.  20,” July 29), while it was truly wonderful to learn that Pollard will finally  be released from prison after serving 30 years of his life sentence, there was a  catch. Pollard will not be allowed to move to Israel for the next five years.  Unfortunately that means that places like Tel Aviv or Eilat are no-go areas for  Pollard until 2020. However, given that the US State Department does not  recognize Jerusalem as part of Israel, surely the US government should have no  objections to Pollard moving to our unrecognized capital city the day after he  is freed from prison.KENNY FISHER JerusalemThe granting of parole to  Jonathan Pollard does not meet the conditions of The Jerusalem Post’s excellent  editorial in the Friday paper (“Don’t parole Pollard,” July 31) calling for  Pollard “to be set free.” It is up to Pollard’s talented pro-bono attorneys,  Elliot Lauer and Jacques Semmelman, to change that condition.The same  edition of the paper has the informative article of former MK Dov Lipman (“The  lesson of Jonathan Pollard,” July 31). Yes, Rabbi Lipman , I agree with you that  “Thank God,Jonathan will now be free.” But sorry rabbi, I cannot agree with your  assertion that five presidents kept “Pollard in jail because of his love of  America” and “to protect the United States of America.”Loyalty to  America is fine, but America’s judicial system does not have to close its eyes  to compassion and mercy.LEONARD KAHN Zichron Yaakov 

Stubborn ministers
 Let me understand: The coalition- sponsored “Norwegian law” was passed by a  large margin, and yet Likud ministers now refuse to honor their own bill (“Likud  ministers don’t want to quit for potential MKs,’ July 31).And things get  even more confusing with Bayit Yehudi’s creative compromise of a new and very  Israeli version of ‘musical chairs,’ where ultimately the same ministers will  return and remain as MKs after six months.What happened to all the lofty  ideals and principles espoused by the prime minister on down regarding the law’s  importance, and even necessity, for enhancing democracy, separation- of-powers  and more effective governing? It seems clear to me – any potential legislative  stability and real interest in serving the people are more than eclipsed by the  personal interests of power, perks and control.GERSHON HARRIS Hatzor  Haglilit 

Chunnel chaff 
In “Man dies in Chunnel as migrant crisis deepens,” (July  16), the Reuters report states that Britain is “pressing ahead with erecting a  three-meter fence” to protect against the entry of thousands of illegal  migrants. Does this mean that the land that was my home for 60 years is now  joining Israel as “an apartheid state”? After all, their would-be entrants are  merely seeking better economic conditions, while some of those who would like to  enter Israel have far worse goals in mind.LESLIE PORTNOY Netanya  Palestinian state 
Not content with the Obama/ Kerry-led deal that imperils  Israel by making avowed genocidal Iran a threshold nuclear power, Tal Harris  calls on Barack Obama to support UN recognition of a Palestinian state  (“President Obama: It is now time for Palestinian statehood,” July 29). This  demand is being made while PA leaders endlessly deny Jewish history and lionize  “martyrs” who murder innocent Israelis and Americans.Harris says that  symbolic recognition of a Palestinian state would “do no harm.” Yet we witness  with growing alarm developments since the UN granted the PA non-member observer  status – repeated attempts to haul Israel before the ICC; a burgeoning BDS  movement; the EU’s decision to require labeling of Israeli products from the  “occupied Palestinian territories.” Why would the PA enter into meaningful  negotiations when it can achieve virtually everything it wants through  international pressure on only one party to the dispute? Harris notes Obama’s  reference to shared values. If Harris is truly interested in shared values, he  should support conditioning future assistance to the PA on a free and fair  election, an end to violence and incitement, and recognition of Israel as the  nation state of the Jewish people.Once those conditions are met, Israel  will happily resume negotiations with the PA.EFRAIM A. COHEN Zichron  YaacovIsi and Abe 
Once again, kudos to Isi Leibler for being such a mensch  regarding Abe Foxman (“Abe Foxman’s retirement: End of an era,” July 29). Rather  than let ego get in the way, he tells it like it is. If only there were more  people as clear, honest, and straight forward as he is.RIVKA ZAHAVY  Jerusalem Amnesty’s flaws 
Regarding the story “Israel calls Amnesty report on  Gaza war ‘flawed’” (July 30), the real question that should be asked is if  Amnesty International itself has committed a crime against humanity.By  failing to report the “indiscriminate attacks” of rocket fire on civilians in  Israel, Amnesty has once again shown it is working hand in hand with a terrorist  group – Hamas.We also see that Amnesty only reports about governments  but never about the cause of the problem which is indiscriminate “crimes against  humanity” by terrorist groups. When has a report by Amnesty reported on crimes  committed by ISIS, Hamas, Boko Haram, al-Qaida, Hezbollah? All terrorist groups  violate human rights but Amnesty seems blind to this simple fact. Is this a case  of attacking the target that won’t hit back or just inconsistency an Amnesty’s  part? MICHAEL H. DAVIS Jerusalem Free speech? 
Sheikh Khaled al-Maghrab tells  children that “a martyr is absolved with the first drop of his blood” and  emphasizes that Muslims who protect the mosque and sleep in for 30 days “are  awarded 70 virgins” (“Sheikh promotes martyrdom to kids,” July 29). These  statements and more to children under the age of 10 in front of Border Police  officers went unhindered. If that is not incitement, what is? Which country in  the world, democratic or not, would tolerate such behavior without taking legal  action? Free speech does not include incitement. When are we going to respond  and act as a responsible state? We can no longer tolerate anti-Semitism too in  the name of “freedom of speech.”

<title>June 22: Not funny</title>
<date>21/6/2015</date>
<content>
Oren’s claims With regard to “Jerusalem: Why fuss over Oren’s critique of  Obama?” (June 19), the more US Ambassador Dan Shapiro complains about Kulanu MK  Michael Oren’s account of his four years as Israel’s ambassador in Washington,  the more we know it must be nearer the truth than is comfortable for the Obama  administration.




But why, oh why, does Finance Minister and Kulanu party  leader Moshe Kahlon feel he needs to add his halfpenny’s worth and disassociate  himself from Oren (“Kahlon apologizes to Shapiro after Oren criticizes Obama’s  policy on Israel in op-ed,” June 18)? What Oren says has absolutely nothing to  do with him or any knowledge he could have on the subject.It is high  time for this country’s politicians to grow up when it comes to dealings with US  President Barack Obama.I suspect that Oren’s book will be a revelation  to the public in both Israel and the US. In due time, Shapiro will be able to  write his own to correct the record as he sees it.PETER SCHWEITZER 
Tel  Aviv As is the case with the Left, whether in the US or Israel, the guarantee of  freedom speech goes out the window when one of its own is criticized. And with  US President Barack Obama, it only seems to be a crisis when an Israeli is the  critic.In one year and seven months, former president Obama will depart  the eastern side of the US Capitol with his wife, depart Washington on Marine  One and fade into history. It is my guess that he will become a worse critic of  Israel than during his term in office, and even worse than former president  Jimmy Carter.AVRAHAM FRIEDMAN 
Modi’in Illit Better spent elsewhere  Concerning Amotz Asa-El’s “The politics of Israeli culture” (Middle Israel, June  19), if the people of Israel want to enjoy all aspects of the arts performed by  the various institutions here, they should pay for them. It should be a  self-supporting sector. If people want to see what is on offer and like it, they  will pay. If they don’t, they won’t.Failure should be dealt with like  anywhere else. If you don’t perform (no pun intended) and you are not giving the  public what it wants, you find a proper job that is not subsidized by the  taxpayer.I could not but help contrast this column with another in the  same section, on the far needier and tragic situation of Rachel, the 85-year-old  Holocaust survivor who is alone, in poor health and can barely afford to live  (“Caring for Holocaust survivors,” Yael’s Corner).There is no doubt in  the minds of sensible and caring people that a vast portion of the culture  budget would be far better spent in helping such people.I. KEMP 
Nahariya 

He’s lost the plot Regarding “Israel-Hamas ceasefire would be surrendering to  terrorism, Liberman says” (June 18), for heaven’s sake! We surrendered to  terrorism each time Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brokered a peace deal with  Hamas during last summer’s Operation Protective Edge! We surrender to terrorism  with each concession made to our enemies, whether they be called “Palestinians”  or otherwise. We surrender to terrorism each time terrorists are released from  prison.Netanyahu continues with this madness in which a sovereign state  negotiates with terrorists who aim to eventually destroy us, and even rewards  them with benefits if they agree to a deal. What does he think Hamas will be  doing during any period of “peace” – during which, of course, there will be the  odd rocket ignored by Israel? The prime minister has completely lost the plot  and reduced us to a pathetic country with no pride or dignity.EDITH  OGNALL 
Netanya 

Security first With regard to “Netanyahu, Steinitz: Natural gas  market must remain attractive to investors” (June 18), the public, sadly, is not  party to the details of the negotiations.But one requirement has to be  that we do not defer the laying of a second pipeline. With the Middle East in  absolute turmoil, that would be absolute madness! There are allegations that the  government is about to agree to such a deferment. It is hoped that Netanyahu  will not abandon his long-term promise about security in order to achieve an  agreement.Sabotage of the existing pipeline would certainly leave all  the gas under the sea for a very long time, and drive away all prospective  investors.DAVID GOSHEN 
Kiryat Ono Gets it right I am glad to see that  David Serero has performed a version of Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice,  with Shylock as a Sephardi Jew (“The Merchant of New York,” Arts &  Entertainment, June 18).A Jew in medieval Venice would have been  Sephardi. He would have spoken fluent Spanish, as well as Italian. He would  certainly not have been a cringing, hooknosed, eastern-European, Yiddish-  speaking, stereotypical Jew, as is usually the way Shylock is portrayed on the  generally anti-Semitic British stage.JACK S. COHEN 
Netanya Lies and  nonsense Despite the presence of Arabs in the Knesset and on the Supreme Court,  Kwara Kekana, a spokeswoman for the international Boycott, Divestment and  Sanctions campaign, says Israel meets the definition of an apartheid state (“Our  mandate is to isolate Israel, BDS leader tells ‘Post,’” June 17).She  further states that the South African Jewish Board of Deputies supported the  country’s Apartheid regime, much as it currently supports an Israel “that is  killing innocent Palestinians.”Enough is enough! That such outrageous  lies and nonsense can be leveled against Israel and the Jewish community of  South Africa is beyond belief! None of the restrictions imposed on the black  population during the Apartheid years in South Africa ever took place in Israel.  The analogy of Israel as “apartheid state” was initiated by South African  archbishop Desmond Tutu, along with former US president Jimmy Carter and others  in their “Elders’ Group.”Archbishop Tutu knows very well that what  transpired in South Africa has no parallel in Israel.Calling it such is  deceitful and scandalous.ISSY RIEBACK 
Kfar Yona Not funny At first  glance, “Likud: The anti- ISIS party” (Analysis, June 16) seems to make a  statement about the Likud’s stance against Islamic State. But as we start  reading, we begin to realize that this could be an attempt to compare the Likud  to ISIS in some sort of comical way.Does reporter Gil Hoffman really  think it’s funny to compare the beheadings by ISIS to the Likud keeping its head  “attached,” having had only four leaders in its history? Does anyone at The  Jerusalem Post review these articles, or are journalists given free rein to  write whatever nonsense they choose? I realize your paper is shifting more and  more to the left of center, but allowing your reporters to use such comparisons  against left-wing parties or even the Joint List would not be  tolerated.JONATHAN SURASKY 
Ra’anana Not alone I couldn’t agree more with  Gabriel A. Sivan (“Retirement in Israel,” Comment & Features, June 16)  regarding the practice of denying jobs to highly-qualified people due to their  age. I’m sure his humiliating experience has been shared by many  others.RACHEL P. COHEN 
Jerusalem 
CORRECTION In “Health Ministry will pay  half of the cost of new MRIs in hospitals lacking scanners” (June 19), Deputy  Health Minister Yaakov Litzman’s nominee for director- general of the Hadassah  Medical Organization is Prof. Zeev Rotstein, current head of the Sheba Medical  Center, and not as stated.

<title>Kerry’s role</title>
<date>25/2/2015</date>
<content>
US Secretary of State John Kerry’s attitude toward Israel has always been  Cassandra-like. He invariably dispenses prophesies of doom and disaster, but  only to Israel.The latest in Kerry’s long litany of dire predictions is  his warning that the Palestinian Authority might not survive if Israel keeps  withholding the tax revenues it collects for Ramallah.




Speaking at a  press conference in London, he expressed concern, also on behalf of his British  counterpart, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, “about the continued viability of  the Palestinian Authority if they do not receive funds soon.”Kerry  cogitated on a chain of hypotheticals: “If the Palestinian Authority ceases, or  were to cease, security cooperation – or even decide to disband as a result of  their economic predicament, and that could happen in the near future if they  don’t receive additional revenues – then we would be faced with yet another  crisis that could also greatly impact the security of both Palestinians and  Israelis and that would have the potential of serious ripple effects elsewhere  in the region.”Kerry failed to mention why Jerusalem had chosen to  freeze the funds in question. This omission implies that Israel acted with  out-of-the-blue arbitrariness.Consequently, Israel would bear the full  onus for all the adverse ramifications that its seemingly unjustified actions  would spawn.Ignoring causality signals the PA that it can do no wrong in  Washington’s eyes, while Israel willfully refuses to do right (by Obama  administration definitions).This emboldens Mahmoud Abbas to escalate his  provocations such as his decision to join the International Criminal Court and  thereby instigate proceedings against Israel for alleged war crimes. Israel  froze the revenue transfer only after it failed to dissuade its supposed peace  partner to desist from this inimical ploy.Ramallah had not been using  the revenue to defray its massive debts for the water and electricity it  receives from Israel. The Israel Electric Corporation cannot secure restitution  of the PA’s NIS 1.9 billion debt. Kerry presumably expects Israeli citizens to  foot the PA’s bills.Kerry has failed to take Abbas to task for a host of  moves that scuttled negotiations – from seeking state-status in UN forums to  inspiring boycotts and defaming Israel in order to banish it beyond the  pale.Now Abbas plans to convene the PLO’s central council, where, he  implies, he may disband the PA or discontinue security cooperation with  Israel.Kerry has let Abbas off the hook, and the ominous warnings he  sends Jerusalem disconcertingly correspond to everything with which Ramallah  threatens Israel.In the past, Kerry admonished Israel that failure to  achieve progress with the Palestinians would bring upon it BDS (boycott,  divestment, sanctions) ostracism, more spates of terrorism and apartheid-state  stigma.At the most recent White House ceremony for the Muslim feast of  Id al-Adha, Kerry expressed worry that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (i.e.  the Jewish state’s struggle for survival) bolsters the mass appeal of Islamic  State radicalism.“As I went around and met with people in the course of  our discussions about the ISIL coalition,” he asserted, “there wasn’t a leader I  met with in the region who didn’t raise with me spontaneously the need to try to  get peace between Israel and the Palestinians, because it was a cause of  recruitment and of street anger and agitation.”Kerry repeated the  hypothesis in London in warning “of serious ripple effects elsewhere in the  region.”His statements are certainly issued in the spirit of a friend  warning another friend that his current behavior will have ramifications, but  his non-too-concealed subtext is that somehow Israel is to blame for all that  ails the entire Middle East.That’s the tone that’s continued to chime  this week.
Kerry should have stood up to Abbas and unambiguously  challenged the PA’s penchant for pinning culpability on Israel. He should have  pointed out to Abbas that his provocations contradict any professed aspirations  for peace and that relentless vilification negates the very notion of acceptance  and coexistence. Until Kerry does that, he will remain as unheeded as Cassandra.

<title>Know Comment: How not to respond to Palestinian violence</title>
<date>8/10/2015</date>
<content>
The Netanyahu government stands at a strategic crossroads in shaping this  country’s security future. The wrong response to the current round of  Palestinian violence and terrorism will not only inflame the situation, but will  weaken Israel for the long term.Israel should avoid making the following  conceptual and tactical mistakes: Don’t buy into the nonsense that the violence  in Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria, Kiryat Gat, Petah Tikva, Tel Aviv and elsewhere  is “uncoordinated” and “spontaneous,” or conducted by “lone wolves” and  “volunteer martyrs” without direction.




The youth conducting most of the  attacks know very well how to read signals from above. They have excellent ears.  Which leads to my next point.Don’t ignore the incitement to violence  coming from Palestinian political and religious leadership.From Mahmoud  Abbas’s repeated lies about Israeli threats to destroy the Jerusalem mosques, to  his ugly talk about “filthy Israeli feet” invading the Temple Mount, to his  exaltation of terrorists and his salary payments to families of terrorists, to  the bloody glorification of knifing and bombing attacks that is running around  the clock on Palestinian Authority television stations and Internet sites (as  graphically documented this week by a shocking Channel 10 documentary) – it is  clear that the Palestinian leadership is stoking, not stifling, the  violence.It may be true that Abbas is controlling and calibrating the  violence rather than fomenting total chaos with mass casualties of the type that  marked Arafat’s second intifada. (And for that, the IDF says it is “thankful.”)  But Abbas has unleashed a wave of religious hatred that is not so easily reined  in, either by Israeli security forces or his para-military militias. Thus the  blood of each Israeli victim – Eitam and Naama Henkin, Nehemia Lavi, Aharon  Banita and more – is on his head.Don’t whitewash the responsibility of  Abbas for the escalating international diplomatic assault on Israel, out of  hollow hope of maintaining the fiction of a “peace partner.” We did that for far  too long with Yasser Arafat, and paid enormous prices for doing so.It’s  nice that Abbas tells Haaretz (of course, gullible Haaretz!) that he “opposes  all use of weapons and is prepared to reopen negotiations.”But then he  proceeds to demand that, first, all “heroic” Palestinian terrorists be released  from Israeli jails; to deny the Jewish people’s historical and religious bond  with the Land of Israel and Jews’ right to worship on the Temple Mount; to  demonize Israel as an “apartheid state that is terrorizing Palestinians;” and to  promise more legal assaults on Israel at the UN and ICC.And knowing that  Israeli counter-terrorism measures get Israel into additional global hot water,  he cynically exhorts Palestinians to “defend Jerusalem with their blood” thereby  ensuring additional violence and deepening Israel’s isolation.Don’t talk  only about Israel’s security needs in explaining Israel’s actions. Talk about  Israel’s legal, historic and religious rights in this land. Don’t abandon the  discourse of human, national and civil rights to the Palestinians. Change the  way our diplomats present Israel’s case, immediately.Don’t parrot the  fallacious line that “the status quo is unsustainable.” Don’t push for a hasty  and dangerous Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.Despite the current  violence, the status quo is very sustainable for the medium- to long-term. And  given the regional meltdown, it is probably the least-worst alternative for  Palestinians and Israelis alike.Don’t abandon Jerusalem. Israelis must  demonstrate presence in, and guardianship of, Jerusalem; and push the Netanyahu  government to protect all people in Jerusalem.Don’t cancel school class  visits to Jerusalem – encourage them. Don’t ban Israeli VIP visits to the Temple  Mount – increase them. Don’t close off the access route to the Western Wall  through the Arab market in the Old City – ensure its safety.Post 2,000  guards around the clock to secure every holy and historical site, if that is  what’s necessary! Don’t forget that terrorism feeds off weakness and retreat;  that the enemy smells Israeli lack of resolve; and that the Israeli government  is affected by public opinion.This, then, is the time for the Israeli  public to show determination by voting with its feet and ascending to Jerusalem  en masse.Jews from abroad, and Jewish youth from abroad studying in  Israel, should flock to Jerusalem, davka and defiantly now.Don’t allow  the terrorists to roll-back Israel.Don’t excuse or accept terrorist  attacks on Israelis driving to Tekoa in Judea or Itamar in Samaria, or on Jewish  worshipers walking on a Muslim-dominated street in the Old City toward the  Kotel. Don’t say that Palestinian violence in these places is  “understandable.”Don’t fool yourself: In Arab eyes, the beach-goers of  Tel Aviv are targets just as legitimate as the settlers of Samaria, and they  will be next in line for murder the minute Israel concedes Jerusalem or lets its  guard down.Don’t say, as Ariel Sharon lamentably did, that “restraint is  power.” Restraint is sometimes smart and necessary. But make no mistake: In the  Middle East it does not enhance your clout or perception of your  power.In the current circumstances, restraint will not bring about an  end to Palestinian terrorism, nor even to the current flare-up.Instead,  Israel must act decisively to change the dynamic on the ground, and make clear  that it won’t tolerate even the smallest security infractions.Sale,  possession or manufacture of firecrackers and kerosene bombs should be felonies.  Stone throwers, including juveniles, are potential murderers and therefore  should go to jail for lengthy periods of time.Leaders of violent  demonstrations should be swiftly expelled from the country.Don’t say  that the punishment of Palestinian families is illegal or ineffective. It is  appropriate and has been shown to be very effective.The families of  Jerusalem Palestinian rioters should lose all government benefits, and the  families of West Bank Palestinian rioters should be denied access to work, study  and medical treatment permits in Israel. Families of terrorists should lose  their homes through immediate demolitions.Don’t wait too long before  launching a full scale re-invasion of the West Bank to rigorously rout-out the  terrorist cells of Hamas, Tanzim, Abdel Qader al-Husseini Brigade, and al-Aqsa  Martyrs’ Brigade. (The latter three are affiliated with Abbas’s Fatah  movement).Israel made that mistake in 2000-2002, suffering Arafat’s  terrorism for an interminably long period before launching Operation Defensive  Shield. Then prime minister Ariel Sharon justified this wait with the miserable  contention that he was building international support. What a horrible error in  judgment! Don’t attempt to buy diplomatic cover at the expense of Israeli lives.  If and when a more substantial military incursion becomes necessary, Prime  Minister Netanyahu shouldn’t delay out of concern for global opinion.
And  the Guardian of Israel will deliver wisdom to Israel’s leaders,  amen.

<title>Lauryn Hill and the boycott’s other victims: An issue of freedom of expression</title>
<date>6/5/2015</date>
<content>
Proponents of the cultural Boycott, Sanctions and Divestments  (BDS) campaign against Israel claim that their cause is human rights and their  goal is Palestinian self-determination.Both assertions are belied by the  facts, but resonate strongly with the generally progressive and liberal thinking  of most artists. Artists like Lauryn Hill, who recently canceled her May 7  performance in Israel, however, are the unspoken victims of a campaign that  disparages them, threatens them, interferes with their right to earn a living  and regularly throws them under the bus.




Because artists and pop icons  have the power to influence public opinion, they are increasingly becoming the  weapon of choice in the war against Israel. When artists announce a trip or tour  in Israel, boycott proponents place extreme pressure on them to cancel,  eviscerating their role as peace ambassadors and impinging on a human right they  so deeply cherish, their right to self-expression.
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}Nobody pressures  artists to perform in Israel. Over 300 international artists perform in Israel  each year because they want to. It is not an endorsement of the policies of the  Israeli government any more than performing in the US or France is an  endorsement of their policies. Artists want to connect with their fans and  realize their unique ability to challenge us, make us think, bring us together,  create a universality and provide a bedrock for peace.The cultural  boycott campaign seeks to create an intellectual dictatorship, using every means  possible to compel artists to think in a certain way. Their way. Ingredients in  their toxic brew include petitions, demonstrations, emails, phone calls, tweets  and open letters, to name a few.The first line of attack is on the  artist’s reputation and character. They claim that anyone who wants to perform  for their Israeli fans is giving a “stamp of approval” to false claims of  colonialism, apartheid, oppression and ethnic cleansing. They single out  minority artists inferring that if they don’t support the boycott, they are  betraying their community. Their vitriolic comments on Facebook and Twitter  incite responses by Israel defenders, perverting the artists’ peaceful social  media pages into political battlefields.They harass artists in their  scheduled stops en route to Israel, shouting and picketing in front of their  hotel rooms and concert halls. They drove a wedge between Scarlett Johansson and  the charitable work she did with Oxfam International and sought to do the same  with Alicia Keys, Neil Young and, most recently, British musician Robbie  Williams. Their barrage of intimidation crossed the line into physical threats  against artists Paul McCartney and Eric Burdon, and caused Afro pop musician  Salif Keita to regretfully cancel his tour, not in support of the campaign, but  out of concern for the physical safety of himself and his family.They  regularly threaten to impact artists’ music sales and concert events, and hound  their representatives.These attacks are not limited to those cloaked in  fame and fortune. In fact, BDS turns up the heat on niche musicians who often  struggle to make a living. The stars get most of the attention, but it’s the  regular working artist who often pays the biggest price.BDS just doesn’t  abuse artists, it uses them. The most recent casualty in this war against  independent thought is songstress Lauryn Hill who has almost two million  Facebook friends and over 140,000 Twitter followers.Just days after her  Tel Aviv concert was announced, her social media pages were flooded with  anti-Israel posts urging her to cancel. Fallacious charges ranged from the  political to the ridiculous (that Israel abducted 25,000 Ukrainian children to  harvest their organs) to the blatantly anti-Semitic (a bloody graphic of  Netanyahu cannibalizing a child). Their strategy was intended not only to  persuade Hill to cancel but to use her social media platforms as a billboard for  their own political agenda, much akin to graffiti for someone else’s favorite  cause written across your front door.Who the BDS activists are helping  is not evident; who and what they are hurting is unquestionable. While Israelis  are being unfairly maligned and artists are being used and abused, the condition  of Palestinians fails to improve.To date, the response from Israel’s  supporters has been primarily defensive.While correcting the  misinformation and lies inherent in the BDS narrative is important, it does not  change the conversation or detract from the appeal their propaganda has in  numerous circles.It’s time for us to re-frame the debate on behalf of  the creative community and everyone who treasures the gifts artists give the  world. It’s time to pin the badge of shame where it properly belongs – on those  who callously place artists and freedom of expression in their cross-hairs, a  tactic as repugnant as the use of human shields.Abuse is a continuum.  What begins as harassment on social media continues on a course of  destruction.When artists are gagged and freedom of expression is  crushed, it’s not just artists who are impacted – the whole world  suffers.
Let’s

Unraveling chapter 
It is sad to see the unraveling of one of the glorious  chapters of Zionism – the rescue of Ethiopian Jews from oblivion to live as  equal citizens in Israel (“Ethiopian- Israeli activists vow to continue  protests,” May 11).Julius Rosenwald, a part-owner of the American  department store chain Sears, Roebuck, was a great funder of schools for blacks  in the American South.




Today, so many wealthy Jews, including American  billionaires who want to donate most of their wealth to philanthropy, could aid  their Ethiopian-Israeli brethren.The destruction of the family unit  among American blacks is the cause of so much of their crime and misery. It is  vital that the family structure of Ethiopian Israelis not be eroded. It is also  in the interest of all Israelis that Ethiopian Jews not become a permanent  underclass, something that would enable the haters of Israel to gloat at the  country for having truly become an apartheid state.JACOB MENDLOVIC 
Toronto Rabbis’ monopoly 
Writing from my experience as a representative of a  globally recognized kashrut authority, your editorial “End rabbis’ monopoly”  (May 11) only reveals the tip of the kosher iceberg.The reason a  mashgiah (kashrut supervisor) is appointed is to ensure that the kashrut of an  establishment is in accord with the codified Jewish law. Any appointment of a  religious supervisor has obviously been agreed upon and accepted by the  proprietor, who wishes to serve kosher cuisine.If the proprietor wishes  to display, for example, a Christmas tree for clients of other faiths, how can  it possibly change the status of the food? It is being supervised by the  rabbinate, not the proprietor.Do I need to be certified or am I reading  it wrong? LEONARD E. BOOK 
Ashkelon
The writer is a rabbi.The  juxtaposition of two headlines seen in your May 11 issue – the editorial “End  rabbis’ monopoly” and the news item “Israel Medical Association condemns  Litzman’s plan to appoint non-physician as director-general” cannot be more  illustrative.It is too ludicrous to even imagine an editorial calling to  break the “monopoly” of doctors in the administration and delivery of health  services, yet you call for “[d]ismantling the Chief Rabbinate’s monopoly,” in  this case regarding kosher supervision.The editorial clearly  acknowledges that, according to the 1983 Law for the Prohibition of Kashrut  Fraud, “it is illegal to advertise a restaurant or a food product as ‘kosher’  before receiving the imprimatur of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.” This law has  not yet been revoked or changed, which means that Attorney-General Yehuda  Weinstein acted in violation of the law with his ruling – and he has not been  taken to task.I agree with your statement terming it “an absurd  situation...in which the State of Israel’s secular institutions – such  as the Supreme Court and the Knesset – can tell rabbis what is kosher and what  is not.” But there is no greater absurdity than advocating for the abolition of  the rabbinic role in a purely religious matter, and its replacement by those,  including some members of the judiciary or legislature, who do not personally  see kashrut as a primary Jewish value.MARVIN PACHINO
Jerusalem Verbiage  of hate 
With regard to “Clear and present danger: Netanyahu’s new gov’t”  (Observations, May 8), God gave the Jewish people the Land of Israel.  Unfortunately for Rabbi Dov Lipman, God did not have the mercy to include in his  promised inheritance non-Jewish Russians, or to allow for questionable divorcées  who might create an explosive situation just because Lipman and Yesh Atid  believe that Judaism is based on emotion and not principle.As opposed to  Rabbi Lipman, I was raised according to “It’s not what you say, but how you say  it.” If there is a conflict, then analyze the foundation of the  argument.What the “ultra-Orthodox” (I despise these labels) want to undo  is based on principle. Halacha is what a Torah Jew aspires to live by. Modern  Jewry (or the coined term “modern Orthodox”) denotes an ancient  Jewry.Change for the sake of destroying the Torah’s fundamental dictates  does not legitimize change in our Torah tradition, no matter how sensitive and  emotional Rabbi Lipman wishes it to be.Ahdut (unity) is wonderful. It  does not have to exist only in times of war. When both sides learn how to speak,  the meat of their contention can be digested much more tastefully.ZELIG  SCHUR
Jerusalem Lack of character 
It is ironic that former UK prime minister  Tony Blair has been a character witness for former prime minister Ehud Olmert  (“Olmert pleads to avoid jail: I respect the decision, do not take conviction  lightly,” May 6).The judges should dismiss the letter provided by Blair  since he is both an external interloper with personal interests, as well as the  official envoy of the Quartet, representing the interests of the US, Russia, EU  and UN in interfering in Israel’s affairs.Blair’s terrible economic  legacy took almost eight years for subsequent Conservative governments to  correct – he authorized his chancellor of the Exchequer to sell the country’s  gold when the price was at its lowest. In 2005, he promised to serve his full  term but resigned in June 2007, before the end of his term; immediately, he was  appointed as the official representative of the Quartet – and we know how he has  failed.Currently, the official UK government inquiry into the invasion  of Iraq in 2003, which was authorized in 2009, still has not published its  long-awaited report, the delay being due to certain key individuals being given  an opportunity to respond to provisional criticism in the draft. UK media  reports attribute this delay to Blair.All of this morally disqualifies  him as a character witness.BARNEY KAYE 
Edgware, UK No credible evidence  
In “Is there a connection between Swedish aid and Hamas institutions?” (Comment  & Features, April 28), Tobias Petersson questions the integrity of Islamic  Relief Worldwide. But the Islamic Relief Worldwide I know and love has no links  to proscribed organizations and works extremely hard to ensure that aid does not  fall into the wrong hands.We are a member of the United Nations Economic  and Social Council and a signatory to the International Red Cross and Red  Crescent Code of Conduct, reflecting the fact that we subscribe to the highest  standards of neutrality, impartiality and independence in the delivery of  humanitarian aid. Right now, our teams are delivering life-saving aid to  communities devastated by the severe earthquake in Nepal and torn apart by the  protracted conflicts in Syria and Yemen.Some are risking their lives  daily to assist people in need – people of all races and religions.Mr.  Petersson displays very limited knowledge of the circumstances of Ayaz Ali’s  unlawful detention in Israel. Mr. Ali was held in a military prison for three  weeks without access to a lawyer, and was finally released by order of an  Israeli military court judge after the Israeli authorities failed to produce any  evidence to bring about a charge.We have seen no credible evidence to  substantiate Israel’s claim of Hamas links, either from the Israeli authorities  or through rigorous investigations. And contrary to Mr. Petersson’s slur of  anti-Semitic and Islamist links, we unreservedly condemn all forms of religious  hatred, including anti-Semitism, and are not influenced, let alone controlled,  by any political agenda or external group.MOHAMED ASHMAWEY

The wrong thing Gershon Baskin’s naivety in urging us to do the “right thing” by allowing Palestinian refugees under attack in Syria’s Yarmouk camp to enter the West Bank (“We have the chance to do the right thing in Yarmouk,” Encountering Peace, April 9) is as bad as US President Barack Obama’s naivety in believing that Iran has peaceful nuclear objectives. Both tend toward Israel’s destruction.




Israel has no responsibility toward resolving humanitarian problems arising from a tribal Arab/Muslim conflict. Acceptance of Baskin’s proposal, like his intervention in the prisoner exchange for captive IDF soldier Gilad Schalit, would only increase the security risks emanating from the West Bank.GERALD M. ADLER 
Haifa/Hove UK Gershon Baskin advocates allowing, unconditionally, the entrance of 18,000 Palestinians from the Yarmouk refugee camp to the West Bank.He proposes that the Israeli government make an immediate public announcement to this effect in expectation that the UN and other international actors would enable the move. He also opines: “This gesture on Israel’s part would be so valued and appreciated regionally and internationally. There is so much to gain from it in trying to build a new relationship with the Palestinian people.”In my opinion, Mr. Baskin is showing a misunderstanding of the way our enemies think.Assuming that such a rescue operation could be successfully achieved, it would be studiously ignored or labeled political opportunism by our neighbors and their foreign supporters who oppose Jewish nationalism.I am in agreement with Baskin that these people should be allowed sanctuary in the West Bank simply because they are human beings caught in an impossible situation. But I do not have any expectations of neighborliness or less hostility arising from this act.EFRAIM PERLMUTTER 
Sde Nitzan Slavish allegiance With regard to “Bibi on the outside looking in” (Washington Watch, April 9), Douglas Bloomfield’s slavish allegiance to the Democratic Party, above all common sense, and his homage to America’s first black president despite his abject failures in foreign policy, know no bounds.Having failed to persuade Israel that Benjamin Netanyahu was not the best choice for prime minister, he now wants to excoriate him for his failure to influence US President Barack Obama’s drive to make Iran a threshold nuclear power.In his effort to do so, Bloomfield quotes former State Department official Dennis Ross, New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman, Israeli defense analyst Amir Oren and others – none of whom have had a positive effect on the radical Muslim world despite their constant meddling.He fails to note that former US secretaries of state George Shultz and Henry Kissinger, as well as almost every knowledgeable military expert and sensible political pundit, have criticized the senselessness of the Obama approach.The column is so rife with foolishness that it is difficult to focus on just one of its failures of logic.But I would like to try.Bloomfield quotes John Kerry, the current, feckless secretary of state: “Simply demanding that Iran capitulate is not a policy.”Really? I seem to remember that the world had a problem with Germany and Japan some time back, and demanded unconditional surrender. Both were evil regimes that desired to dominate the rest of the world.Thank God Obama and Kerry were not around then to make nice.CHAIM ABRAMOWITZ 
Jerusalem Worrying others With regard to “Worried reader” (Letters, April 7), James Adler asserts that the Likud’s victory resulted from “right-voting settlers” who have “risen to a perhaps unbeatable 750,000.” The numbers, though, tell a very different story.Only 160,000 voters turned out in the “West Bank.” More importantly, the Likud captured eight of Israel’s 10 largest cities.Despite the Zionist Union’s emphasis on a social agenda, the Likud won overwhelmingly in many middle- and lower-middle- class towns. The Zionist Union was strongest in the country’s smaller number of wealthy towns, including 53 percent in tony Kfar Shmaryahu.Adler castigates Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his comment about Arabs “voting in droves.” While the warning was poorly expressed, it was nothing more than a call to his supporters to offset a voting bloc that was certain to go to the opposing side en masse. For example, more than 92% of Nazareth voters opted for a single party, the Joint List. Apparently, your reader does not object to bloc voting so long as the bloc votes his preference.Despite Adler’s worries about an “unbeatable” settler bloc, the Likud took just 23% of the total vote, just 5% more than the Zionist Union. It was as much a failure by the latter to state its message convincingly as it was a victory for the former.Adler also rails against Israel’s “occupation over a non-voting population,” conveniently forgetting that the Palestinian population is “non-voting” because the Palestinian Authority has refused to call elections for over half a decade. He also ignores one factor that might have caused those on the fence to vote for the Likud: They were offended by the many people – e.g., human rights “experts,” a US president and even a certain Massachusetts letter writer – who accuse Israel of racism and offer facile solutions to critical security challenges.EFRAIM A. COHEN 
Zichron Ya’acov Is there some sort of love affair going on between the letters editor and a certain left-wing American whose letters are frequently published? I refer to reader James Adler, who, while sitting comfortably in his cozy front room in the settlement of Cambridge, Massachusetts, invariably complains about the “sins” of Israeli right-wingers such as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, other Likud politicians and those who vote for them.Adler constantly bashes Israel for building “settlements” and sending more and more “settlers” to “occupy” what he calls “another people’s land.” But he’s both hypocritical and mendacious – hypocritical because he himself is a settler sitting comfortably in another people’s land, and mendacious because he denies the right of Israelis to live in any part of their God-given homeland.It bewilders me that he doesn’t know, or pretends not to know, of the history whereby European settlers conquered America while massacring millions of its native tribes and then imprisoned survivors in sordid camps called reservations, where many still remain as second-class citizens. If that isn’t “apartheid,” what is? For some reason, Adler cannot admit that if anyone is a “settler” in Israel or Judea and Samaria, it is the Arabs.TRUDY GEFEN 
Kiryat Ono Can anyone tell me why I, a loyal reader of The Jerusalem Post and one who has had a subscription for many years, must be subjected to regular letters from one James Adler? He had the gall to end his most recent letter by saying “I care deeply for Israel” but then went on with one, long “however.”Any chance of giving others a chance to appear instead? We’ve certainly heard enough from him.DEBBIE POZNANSKY 
Herzliya The Letters Editor responds: I strive for balance in the letters section wherever possible. If the discourse is civil, within the realm of the logical and possible, and somewhere between “Kill the Jews” and “Kill the Arabs,” I will publish the letter.
CORRECTION The suggested donation for attending a screening of Prisoner of Paradise at Mizmor L’David in Jerusalem’s Talpiot neighborhood at 8 p.m. on Monday, April 13, is NIS 20, and not as stated in “Profiles in Courage” in the Capital Calendar section of the April 9 In Jerusalem supplement.

Not blue-and-white 
Judy Siegel-Itzkovich’s “Care improves from one war to the  next” (Health & Science, April 12) was a very interesting article on medical  treatment in combat.However, I have to correct her on her facts  regarding the use of freeze-dried plasma by the IDF.




The article states  that it is an Israeli innovation developed by Core Dynamics in Ness Ziona. I  wrote an article on this subject for Jane’s International Defence Review, and  the product in question, LyoPlas N, is a freeze-dried plasma made by the German  Red Cross. It is made from blood and plasma donations. It contains human  fibrinogen, as well as the factors of the coagulation cascade.Perhaps it  was modified by Core Dynamics for Israeli conditions.IDF medics used  freeze-dried plasma operationally for the first time in March 2013 to save the  life of a Palestinian man who had been in a traffic accident.JOE  CHARLAFF 
Mevaseret Zion
 The writer is a freelance journalist.Legs to  stand on 
With regard to “Freedom message” (Editorial, April 12), I never heard  the saying “The price of freedom is eternal vigilance” until November 1975, when  I was driving back roads between potential customers in Australia and came  across a small British Legion meeting house with those words writ bold and large  above the entrance. It was a further 20 years before I read the same words on  the plinth of Thomas Jefferson’s statue in Washington, DC, by which time I had  discovered what they really meant.Democracy can be likened to a  three-legged stool that can be made stable on almost any terrain.An  important part of democracy is the right to free speech and opinions that many  people will not like. One might suggest that this right is one of the legs upon  which democracy stands. But where it is obvious that freedom of speech can be  likened to someone sitting on the stool and sawing a leg off, we have the right  to say stop, you are going too far.The classic example, of course, is  anti-Semitism, especially Holocaust denial, which, when left unchecked, destroys  the democracy that allows it to flourish. Take the UN, which hears Iran call  daily for the destruction of Israel and Jews, without a single world leader  saying boo. That organization no longer has any legs to stand on.It is  fascinating to record that one of Hitler’s favorite scientists, Werner  Heisenberg, was a rabid anti-Semite. He showed that when attempting to measure  atomic dimensions, the light that was used to measure a nucleus made accurate  measurement impossible. Truth was thus lost in the observation.To  preserve democracy, we have to be vigilant and careful that the light of  unbridled free speech does not distort truth and destroy the nucleus of  freedom.KALMAN BOOKMAN
Jerusalem Western Armenia 
Raffi K. Hovannisian,  in “Remembering the Armenian genocide” (Comment & Features, April 12), must  be taking advantage of the lack of historical knowledge of the average reader.  What he calls “western Armenia” has been in the hands of the Seljuks or Turks  since 1071. They took the area from the Byzantines after the battle of  Manzikert.Demanding the area back from Turkey is as hopeless as the  American Indians asking for the wild, wild West back from the  Americans.For hundreds of years, the majority of western Armenia’s  inhabitants have been Turks and other Muslims.Dreaming of taking it back  is nothing more than contemplating an apartheid state.ERKIN BAKER 
Alton,  Illinois How typical 
In “Obama finds out that honesty on Iran deal doesn’t pay”  (Analysis, April 9), Yossi Melman says that “only a few truthful statements have  been heard. They have come from Atomic Energy Organization of Iran chief Ali  Akhbar Salehi.”How typical of Melman to believe that “Iran did not  produce a bomb for religious and ideological reasons,” and not to trust Israeli  experts.Anyone with even a slight knowledge of Islam knows that jihad is  a primary tenet of the faith. Therefore, nuclear weapons are a valuable asset to  extend a caliphate throughout the Middle East and beyond. I challenge Melman to  prove his statement that Salehi’s statement is “held by most senior experts in  the world.He correctly claims that Sheldon Adelson is a patron of the  Republicans and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. US President Barack Obama and  the Democrats have their own, equally wealthy patrons.So what? STEVE  KRAMER 
Alfei Menashe In his own words 
With regard to Gershon Baskin’s “We have  the chance to do the right thing in Yarmouk” (Encountering Peace, April 9),  Israel should never offer a home to a “few” Palestinians in Damascus’s Yarmouk  refugee camp. (Some 18,000 – that’s a few?). The reason lies in Baskin’s own  words – that the Syrian capital “became the home for Hamas, Palestinian Islamic  Jihad, the Popular Front General Command of Ahmed Jabril, and other radical  Palestinian opposition groups.”Would Baskin care to guarantee that they  have since become less radicalized and would never again strike an Israeli or  Jew? MICHA’EL S. BLOCH 
Kochav Yair Each morning, looking out the window on a  rainy cold day, I imagine the people of the Yarmouk camp going through their  hell, especially the children. At the same time, I see those Palestinians who  steal the millions of dollars they receive from the West without doing anything  to save these people.In their schools, Palestinians teach youngsters to  hate the Jews, that the Jews are monkeys and thieves, and that the Jews stole  their land. Death to the Jews.Mr. Baskin, why do you think that  accepting a few thousand suffering Yarmoukites here will be a step forward in  making peace, and not a step backward toward increasing the danger to Jews who  are being threatened continuously? MICHAEL TAL 
JerusalemBeing there 
US  President Barack Obama was quoted as saying in his interview with New York Times  columnist Thomas L. Friedman that “if anybody messes with Israel, America will  be there.”Was America “there” when Russian President Vladimir Putin  annexed Crimea? Has America been there when Russia-sponsored gangs are occupying  additional sovereign territories in eastern Ukraine, killing Ukrainian soldiers  and civilians, and destroying that beautiful, peaceful country that naively  believed Western promises? Did the liberal, pacifist West achieve diplomatic  solutions with the Taliban, Saddam Hussein or North Korea? How can Israel rely  on American guaranties? Obama’s America is “there” – with Iran, the Muslim  Brotherhood and the Palestinians. Not with us.PETER ROTBERG 
Ramle Learn  from history 
At about the time of the first Passover in 1230 BCE (see Timelines  of Jewish History, 1993, by Judah Gribetz), the ancient Egyptians under Ramses  were recycling building waste (see Egyptian temple exhibit at The Metropolitan  Museum of Art).Pharoah’s architects realized that dilapidated buildings  were a useful source of stone.The stone blocks were carefully dismantled  and cleaned (possibly by our own ancestors), and then shipped from Amana to the  western bank of the Nile to serve as the foundations of the temple at Hermolis  Magna.Perhaps it is time for modern, hi-tech Israelites (who mostly dump  their building waste by roadsides, as well as in nature reserves and landfill  sites) to learn from history and manage building waste in a more responsible and  useful manner.JACK SHEBSON

Bearing the burdenWith regard to “Rivlin: They tried to wipe us out, but we  survived” (April 22), our president is an admirable man, but in his address to  the nation for Remembrance Day, in a laudable effort to encourage unity, he  indulged in some wishful thinking when he said that sacrifices in defense of the  state had been made equally by all sectors.




I cannot accept that those  who stubbornly refuse to fulfill their duty of national service should be  included in that judgment.Although I am aware that some haredim have  suffered in Israel’s wars and from terrorist attacks, it did not happen as a  result of community-wide national service.When speaking of the defense  burden, I refuse to have my children and grandchildren mentioned in the same  breath with these and other draft dodgers.R. PORATH 
Haifa

On Remembrance  Day morning, I was attending an important staff meeting with over 40 colleagues  (half of them national- religious, the other half haredi) at the Chiba Community  Mental Health Clinic. The clinic is part of the Ma’yenei Hayeshua Medical Center  in Bnei Brak, which is under haredi auspices.Many of us were debating  what to do when the siren went off.Dr. Moshe Rothschild, a haredi  physician and founding president of the hospital, was speaking when the siren  sounded. He asked everybody to stand to honor the soldiers who had died  protecting our country, and proceeded to read aloud a chapter from Psalms. This  made a great impression on all those present.SEYMOUR HOFFMAN

The  writer is supervising psychologist at the Chiba Community Mental Health  Clinic.

An inspiration 
“Sad and mad on Remembrance Day” (Comment &  Features, April 21) by Susie Weiss – which bore the touching photo of Ari, her  fallen, but not vanquished, son – reminded me, as Dylan Thomas put it, that  “death shall have no dominion.”I fully identify with Weiss’s vehement  support of the policy to call on Jews everywhere to come to the homeland, as  well as with her lucid survey (the word “contempt” comes to mind) of those who  condemn us, such as the UN Security Council. The pride she shows in the  strengths for which we are jealously maligned is matched only by her proud  stance that, despite our nation’s short-comings, we have the stamina and valiant  young people to fearlessly defend our beloved Land of Israel.I vote that  she be made an ambassador and travel to Jewish communities worldwide with her  message. I wish her and her husband continued strength in the knowledge that Ari  was an inspiration, and that his all-tooshort life was not in vain.

Jerusalem 
The writer is a psychotherapist.They’re obsessed 
Ban  Ki-moon, secretary-general of the United Nations, once again takes Israel to  task for the lack of a peace agreement with the Palestinians (“Ban: Israel must  take steps for peace, freeze settlement activity,” April 22).The  Europeans, among others, are obsessed (and obsession is really the only word for  it) when it comes to Israel and the Palestinians.Do they realize that  what they are proposing is another failed state in the Middle East? The Arabs of  the Palestinian Authority are living peaceful lives while all around, hundreds  if not thousands of their co-religionists are killed every day.Suicide  bombings are endemic all over the Middle East, as are attacks on civilians and  soldiers.Atrocities, including publicly filmed beheadings, are being  carried out in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen and Egypt, yet the countries of the EU,  instead of dealing with their own problems, are obsessed with imposing a phony  peace agreement.Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas would  welcome this. It would enable him and his henchman to pocket millions in aid.  Anyone who questions that should ask where Yasser Arafat’s widow, Suha, obtained  her own millions.CYRIL ATKINS

Worried by overflights 
It is  gratifying to know that the head of the Home Front Command monitors civilian  flights (“Home Front Command has new approach to dealing with mass rocket  strikes,” April 22).Unknown to the public is the fact that we permit  Arab civilian aircraft to overfly the country, including the airlines of  countries with which we have no diplomatic relations and which vote against us  at the UN and in international forums.Using commonly available web  software, some of these aircraft can be monitored at all altitudes, including  down to 600 meters, in the latter case obviously using spy technology.It  is high time this practice ceased.

Jerusalem Torah giant  
The Jerusalem Post is to be congratulated for its editorial tribute to the  achievements of the late Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein (“Lichtenstein’s legacy,”  April 22). It went way beyond the ordinary and obligatory obituaries published  upon the passing of a prominent individual.Rabbi Lichtenstein was a  Torah giant, a thinker and a teacher who influenced thousands of students who  are active in all walks of life in Israel and the Diaspora. He was certainly  worthy of everything written about him, and even more.Rabbi Lichtenstein  was a living link between our authentic tradition and our continuing loyalty to  the values that have kept our nation alive.The Post showed that it is  more than a newspaper. It is an authentic voice of renewed Jewish  sovereignty.RIVKA ROSENBERG 
Jerusalem Setting things straight 
Regarding  “Independence Day: We have reason to rejoice” (Candidly Speaking, April 22), I  think it’s about time to set the record straight: Nowhere in Israelite sources  (Torah, Talmud, Halacha) are the children of Israel considered a religion. The  Israelites are a nation, a people living according to the Torah, its  constitution, given at Mount Sinai.There are many who deny this truth. A  religion can be denied and cast aside, but a citizen follows a people’s  constitution. Can one be a Reform citizen, a Conservative citizen, an Orthodox  citizen? There is a need for someone to help demonstrate the importance of Torah  as a symbol of Israelite citizenship even today, in modern, “progressive”  times.ALLEN MANDEL 
Jerusalem Tell them, not us 
In “The Israel apartheid  lie” (No Holds Barred, April 21), Rabbi Shmuley Boteach makes some excellent  points. He seems to be preaching, though, to those who know it is a lie. He  should aim for international audiences, where it is believed to be  truth.When I attended a conference in Australia last summer, I met  several people who, upon discovering that I came from Israel, proceeded to treat  me to a rant on how horrible we are. “The Palestinians can’t vote, they can’t  get medical care, they are discriminated against.”I fielded these  comments with the assertion that all Israeli citizens have the right to vote,  that medical care is available to all, and that those Arabs who live across the  Green Line and are not citizens are often treated in Israeli  hospitals.One woman in particular was so struck by my answers that she  commented, “Oh, I didn’t know that!” I hope I changed her mind, or at least  opened it to a better understanding of what is really going on here.We  need to do more to show that the assumptions of our being an apartheid state are  untrue, because Israel is losing the propaganda war.ELAINE GOLDSTEIN

<title>March 31: Dealing with Iran</title>
<date>30/3/2015</date>
<content>
Dealing with IranWith regard to “Nearing deadline, senior EU official says P5+1  ‘closer than ever’ to Iran nuke deal” (March 29), the Iranians are enemies and  should be treated as such. You can’t defeat them by lifting the sanctions that  you have successfully put in place.




You don’t deal with Iran the  rule-breaker by making an agreement it is sure to break. The only ones who will  be bound up by an agreement are the rest of the world. Iran is sure to “break  out” and go nuclear when it sees fit to do so, especially after it acquires more  cash.Is US President Barack Obama going to irretrievably dismantle the  sanctions regime against Iran and destroy the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty  that protects the world in order to make an executive agreement that only he,  and not Congress, gets to approve, and therefore does not have the force of a  treaty? Since when is the president the unrestrained monarch of the US, and of  the rest of the world as well? We are not going to stop Iran’s malicious  ambitions in the world by reducing our power over it. The negotiations are  analogous to making a similar deal with Nazi Germany just before World War  II.It’s insane.

 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu has said that if the P5+1 makes an agreement with Iran, it  will start a massive arms race in the Middle East. Isn’t this just what the US  armaments sector wants? Never forget, the arms lobby is the most powerful  Washington lobby of them all. Companies can see billions and even trillions of  dollars in orders coming their way.The US also has a national debt  approaching $20 trillion. A massive arms race could seriously reduce this  burden, regardless of the severe dangers it might pose to Israel.

Religious apartheid With regard to “Prosor to UNSC:  End silence on persecution of Mideast minorities” (March 29), the statement by  our ambassador to the UN could have a major effect on the peace process. It  finally explains why east Jerusalem, with its numerous religious minorities,  cannot be handed over to the Palestinian Authority and its policies on ethnic  cleansing.The threat of a global religious war that PA President Mahmoud  Abbas made last November over the issue of Jews being allowed to pray on the  Temple Mount – because this would “contaminate Muslim holy places” – is the type  of religious apartheid that the world cannot accept.PA rule over east  Jerusalem would result in the disappearance of all minorities within a  generation, and leave the area almost purely Muslim, as happened in Gaza and is  the case in most Muslim- dominated states in the Middle East.DAVID  GOSHEN 
Kiryat Ono Jews as blacksRegarding “US magazine claims PM ‘burned his  bridges’ with black Democrats” (March 29), sadly, members of the Congressional  Black Caucus equated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Election Day remarks  about Arab voters with discrimination against American blacks. The fact is, we  Jews are the “blacks” of the Middle East.We are the natives who have  inhabited the land for 3,800 years.Christians such as Al Sharpton, Jesse  Jackson and Jeremiah Wright worship a Jewish West Bank “settler” who lived in  the land 600 years before the invasion of Arabs from the east.Jesus  never met a Palestinian or heard a single word of Arabic. Arab law forbids Jews  from residing in Jordan and Saudi Arabia, and Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas has assured the world that any Palestine will be judenrein. What  would the Black Caucus say if Abbas declared no blacks allowed? Israel is the  only country in the Mideast that extends full democracy to Arabs, and the only  country that upholds the banner of Nelson Mandela: One man, one  vote.STEVE BERGER 
Ramat Gan Cure the disease The piece “Viable solutions  for affordable housing” (Comment & Features, March 29) resonated with me in  a way that was very painful. After 30 years in Israel, I cannot keep my  grandchildren and great-grandchildren here because if they choose housing where  they can afford it, in places like Amona (a settlement outpost slated for  demolition – ed.), they will lose everything.The proposal Ron Diller  suggests ignores the fact that high prices are a symptom, while the shortage of  housing in areas where people want to work and live is the disease.What  he suggests will not result in a single additional house or apartment being  built; subsidizing costs will only lead to more demand, making prices skyrocket  even higher.Proper treatment is to slash the bureaucracy that delays  construction for years, and light a fire under the Israel Lands Authority,  forcing it to release more land. We also need to ignore pressure from the US to  restrict building in Jerusalem and the major settlement blocks that under no  circumstances will be abandoned.RITA STAR 
Ma’aleh Adumim 

Cheeky Amnesty Regarding “Amnesty Int’l charges Palestinians with war crimes during Gaza  conflict” (March 26), the rights group still infers that Israel’s response to  Hamas rockets was unjustified. It is time Amnesty International realized we are  a Jewish state and do not turn the other cheek.

HERBERT KOPPEL 
Jerusalem Brigadier’s backstoryYour readers might be interested in one or two additional  biographical nuggets concerning Brig.-Gen. Frederick Hermann Kisch of the  British army, who was mentioned in “New MKs giving up citizenship from UK, US,  Russia, Argentina” (March 26).When Baron Herbert Charles Onslow Plumer,  a field marshal, was appointed high commissioner for Palestine, he and Kisch,  then a colonel, got on well. Plumer attributed this to the fact that they dealt  with each other on a soldier- to-soldier basis and therefore understood each  other.Later, Kisch had to discuss the question of arming Palestine’s  Jews for self-protection with the officer in command of the Warwickshire  Regiment, which was stationed here at the time. The regiment was commanded by a  certain Col. Montgomery, who arguably, despite their similar rank, had  seniority. During World War II, Kisch was promoted to brigadier, but Montgomery  outranked him as a lieutenant-general.As a brigadier, Kisch was  responsible for the defenses protecting El Alamein. Presumably, he pleased his  boss, for that was where the Wehrmacht suffered its first defeat. The second,  about four months later, was in Stalingrad.Kisch was eventually killed  while defusing a land mine. He died protecting others.

ALBERT JACOB
Beersheba Archaic systemI agree entirely with reader Andrew Braude (“Streamline  the system,” Letters, March 18) regarding the huge waste of money for voting  slips and envelopes.His suggestion to follow the UK system of only one  ballot slip, with all the names and parties on it, and no envelopes deserves  serious consideration by Israeli election officials.In elections for  mayor of London and municipal representatives, there is also a relatively low  threshold. However, unlike in Israel, where votes cast for parties that don’t  pass the threshold are disenfranchised, London voters are entitled to note a  second and third choice on their ballots. This is a system that should be  followed in Israel. It would have meant that the more than 120,000 votes cast  for parties that were in the end marginalized would be democratically  used.There can be no excuse for the current archaic Israeli system!

<title>May 12: Raising eyebrows</title>
<date>11/5/2015</date>
<content>
Raising eyebrows While I can live with most of what MK Ayman Odeh said (“Odeh:  Netanyahu’s extreme right-wing coalition is a danger to Israeli Arabs,” May 10),  one quote should raise eyebrows and be cited as grounds for possible treason. In  the second paragraph, the head of the Knesset’s Joint List faction is quoted as  saying: “If dialogue with the government doesn’t succeed, then the Joint List  will endeavor to join the global struggle [against Israel].”




Criticizing  the emerging government is okay, as that’s a feature of the opposition’s  role.However, stating publicly that he and others will fight against  Israel is definitely crossing a line.Odeh swore to uphold the country’s  laws and serve it to the best of his ability. This is how he does it? An appeal  to the attorney-general would probably do no good. Look what happened with  Odeh’s fellow Joint List MK Haneen Zoabi, who was allowed to run for Knesset  even though she actually did join the enemy during the Mavi Marmara  flotilla.She also disrespected Arab policemen.These two people  are the best counter-arguments to charges of “Israeli apartheid” that there can  be! BATYA BERLINGER 
Jerusalem Get over it Chutzpah strikes again! As you report  in “Yesh Atid vs. Litzman” (News in Brief, May 7), Yesh Atid and former health  minister MK Yael German have the audacity to petition the courts against the  appointment of United Torah Judaism MK Ya’acov Litzman as deputy health  minister. This, from a person who barred the fluoridation of drinking water in  the face of massive medical and scientific evidence to the  contrary.Litzman served earlier as a deputy health minister and was  highly regarded as a very effective public servant.Ms. German, you’re  out (to the plaudits of the Israeli public), so get over it and stop trying to  interfere with the conduct of good government.MARCHAL KAPLAN 
Jerusalem  Inconvenient facts Regarding your May 7 editorial “Anti-Semitism in Argentina,”  of course there’s anti-Semitism in Argentina, and has been at least since the  Simon Radowitzky case in 1909. But you skip over a lot of inconvenient facts in  trying to tar the Argentine government with the brush of anti-Semitism over the  Alberto Nisman case.These facts include: • The repeated rejection of  Nisman’s brief by several judges, at least one of whom is Jewish, on the ground  that he simply had no substantive case. (The insinuation that the last  prosecutor to handle the brief might have been bribed or blackmailed to drop it  is not only unjustified by any evidence of any kind, but constitutes  rumor-mongering that should be beneath The Jerusalem Post.) • The investigator  directing the inquiry into Nisman’s death, Viviana Fein, is Jewish. The  periodical Pagina/12, which published the denunciation of the AMIA leadership,  is so heavily staffed by Jews that real anti-Semites derisively refer to it as  the “Jew paper.” Are all these Jews, including Foreign Minister Hector Timerman,  anti-Semites? An American idiom of Civil War vintage, to “wave the bloody  shirt,” is to exploit knee-jerk reactions to an emotionally charged allusion.  That’s what this editorial does – to the Post’s discredit.ARTHUR SHAPIRO  
Davis, California 
The writer is a biologist who has conducted research in  Argentina for the past 37 years.Editorial Page Editor Mati Wagner  responds: The letter writer repeats several times that because this judge or  that journalist is Jewish, he or she cannot possibly spout anti-Semitic  conspiracy theories. Yet some of the worst anti-Semitic accusations have been  made by members of the tribe. In the modern era, this has been true at least  since Karl Marx’s essay On the Jewish Question, and continues today on Philip  Weiss’s Mondoweiss blog.I never said the Nisman case, the AMIA case or  cases unrelated to Jews – such as the 2012 Once Train Crash – have gone unsolved  because of anti-Semitism.I said President Christina de Fernandez  Kirchner and members of her government are trying to distract attention from  their failures (corruption?) using anti-Semitic conspiracy theories as a smoke  screen.Are American Jews who made their money charging “usurious”  interest rates really manipulating powerful American politicians to interfere in  internal Argentinean politics? Is the organized Argentinean Jewish community  really working surreptitiously for international Jewish banking interests or for  the Mossad? Perhaps the letter writer thinks so. It sounds like anti-Semitism to  me.Aliya? Yes, indeed! I wish to thank David Margolese for “Why you  should move to Israel” (Comment & Features, May 7). He reminded me of all  the emotions and self-doubts I went through 33 years ago this July.My  husband shared none of these qualms. For him, once his dormant Zionism had been  awakened after a 10-day trip to Israel, there were no questions. I, on the other  hand, reacted just like Mr. Margolese, with my list of pros and cons being  totally lopsided.How would I cope without the support system I had grown  up with? Who would I be when the name of my family, school or address would be  of no consequence to anyone I met? What would be the long-term effects of  bringing up my children without their grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins  all around them? Would leaving leafy, green Cheshire, England, for a parched,  barren landscape affect me and depress me? I even wondered if I would ever hear  birds again! We also came at a “bad” time, in the summer of 1982, in the middle  of the first Lebanon war.We sat in our Hebrew classes and heard what was  going on and the number of fatalities, but nothing really got through to us  because no name or place was familiar.Thirty-three years, three  paratroopers, one Golanchik and 11 grandchildren later, we unquestionably made  the right decision.The homesick tears I shed at first were just for me.  Now I cry for others because I belong to a world that is not centered only  around myself. We belong to a people and a land, and we are unabashedly proud of  all our achievements, even with all their faults.Aliya? Yeah! SURI  ORDMAN

Chinese distraction With regard to “Beijing: Manila  violating sea code” (May 6), the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs  believes that China should not distract the region and the international  community from the core issue in the disputes in the South China Sea, which is  China’s illegal and invalid “nine-dash line” claim. Its massive reclamation  activities in the sea are intended to advance this claim.These  activities are plainly intended to change the character, status and maritime  entitlements of the features; prejudice the arbitration; and undermine the work  of the Arbitral Tribunal constituted under UNCLOS to hear and objectively decide  the case filed by the Philippines.They also threaten freedom of  navigation, cause irreparable damage to the marine environment and infringe on  the rights of other states.China should adhere to Paragraph 5 of the  2002 ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea  (DOC), which states that all parties should exercise self-restraint in the  conduct of activities that would complicate and escalate disputes and affect  peace and stability.

<title>May 1: Good reasons</title>
<date>30/4/2015</date>
<content>
Good reasonsI cannot agree more with Ben Levitas when he discusses the good  reasons the South African minister for higher education and training was denied  entry to Israel so he could travel to Ramallah and implement an academic  cooperation agreement (“Why Israel refused Blade Nzimande,” Comment &  Features, April 28).




It is good that Israeli authorities have stopped  bending the knee to South Africa and realized that this so-called moral country  is very much lacking in correct values and does not seem to have the ability to  be introspective.Instead of being an example to other countries in  Africa, it has demonstrated only the values that one who is moral would oppose  and laugh at.It is rather unfortunate that the present leaders of the  “rainbow nation” know not that they know not, and thus illustrate a complete  inability to hide their deep anti-Semitic roots. What a sad state of affairs it  was that Nzimande did not realize he was dealing with an Israel that doesn’t  need the support of a country that partakes in acts of xenophobia and practices  reverse apartheid.South Africa should put its own house in order before  trying to educate Israel.

COLIN WINKLER 
Ra’anana 
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}On his soapbox I see  that Yossi Sarid is back on his soap box (“Sarid disgusted by thought of Bennett  as education minister,” April 27).The former Meretz leader says:  “Secular schools must be protected from missionary activity that Bennett is  prone to support.”Well, Ra’anana and, I’m sure, other parts of Israel  are having problems with Christian missionaries, from whom secular children and  those who had only a secular education are at greatest risk.I remember  when the ministry was under Sarid and another Meretz leader, Shulamit Aloni.  They pushed Arab culture at the expense of Jewish and Israeli  culture.Meretz pushes only pure, secular views. It was lucky to get into  the Knesset in the last election.That must tell us  something.WILLIE MALKINSON 
Ra’anana Sensing fearIn “New carpet in Dome  of the Rock stokes tensions” (April 26), you quote Ze’ev Orenstein of the Ir  David Foundation as saying: “In recent years on the Temple Mount we have been  witness to the wanton destruction of archeological antiquities...at the  hands of the Wakf, along with its outright denial of the Jewish historic  connection to the site.”Unfortunately, there is no one in our government  prepared to take back responsibility for the Temple Mount. Although the state  comptroller documented the Wakf’s ongoing illegal excavations in a 2010 report,  it was ordered classified by government officials due to concerns over political  fallout with Jordan. Exactly what fallout could there be that makes our prime  minister so afraid to stand up for our historic rights? Before we started  begging our enemies to make peace with us and offered them our land, they never  made the demands that now are accepted as normal.When an enemy senses  fear, it always gains the upper hand.

<title>May 4: Ethiopian protests</title>
<date>3/5/2015</date>
<content>
Ethiopian protests With regard to “Ethiopian anti-racism protest in Jerusalem  turns violent” (May 1), alongside the beautiful Israel that sends search and  rescue teams and a hospital to Nepal, saves Syrian child casualties, helps and  protects perfect strangers on its streets and shops in Sderot under fire, there  is an ugly, xenophobic undercurrent that has abused non-European immigrants,  their color and culture since Mandate days.




Some of the comments made in  the heat of the last election show that there are still those who cannot accept  them as equals. When this prejudice rests with those we invest with the right to  use force to protect the general good, it is particularly offensive.Such  behavior should be easily identifiable and subject to correction.The  police force is a hierarchical organization, and the inspector-general can crack  down on racist behavior among officers, as he is doing with regard to sexual  abuse in the ranks.But don’t kid yourself! Focusing on the police and  outlawing their abusive behavior is not a cure, and could actually provide the  rest of us with a comfortable fig leaf. For a cure, we need to look to our true  commitment to the in-gathering of the exiles, our segregated neighborhoods, our  schools, our work environments and our informal social ties. Most of all, we  need to look deep into our own hearts.HAYIM GRANOT 
Petah Tikva It is  absolutely true that absolute power corrupts absolutely.Hence, the  unprovoked attack on an Ethiopian soldier earlier in the week by two policemen  in Holon.One gets used to these events in the United States. But in  Israel? What’s next? SALLY ROSS 
Netanya Acted wisely In “South African  ties”(Editorial, May 1), you claim that Israel erred in denying a South African  cabinet minister permission to enter Israel or areas controlled by the  Palestinian Authority. You state that by so doing, the minister, Blade Nzimande,  received far more publicity than he would have if he had been allowed in, and  that Israel’s actions gave the impression of being spiteful or  petty.Your reading of the situation is poor, because any black South  African who openly accuses Israel of practicing a worse type of apartheid than  pre-democracy South Africa is guilty of blatantly lying, and not just expressing  a politically biased opinion. Imagine the lies Nzimande would have preached had  he been allowed to meet with Palestinian leaders in their own domain – while  being subjected to all the falsehoods they frequently mention.The world  media would have been filled with articles decrying Israel. Thus, without doubt,  the Israeli authorities acted wisely.

Direct  correlation Melanie Phillips (“Britain’s nightmare post-election scenario,” As I  See It, May 1) is right to point out the direct correlation between the UK  Foreign Office’s policy toward Israel (based on the false claim that settlements  are “illegal,” something even the Obama administration has never claimed) and  the anti-Jewish atmosphere now prevalent in the UK.Prime Minister David  Cameron may well be a decent enough guy, as Phillips states, but surely one  should be able to expect that the prime minister has sufficient influence in his  cabinet to prevail over the false claims of “illegality,” and will not repeat  them in the Tory manifesto for this week’s election.Unfortunately, the  nightmare scenario Phillips posits is already a pre-election reality, as neither  party that will produce the next prime minister has a record that shows it is a  genuine friend of Israel.What puzzles me far more, however, is why it is  left to the US Congress to seek to exert influence over the UK Foreign Office/  Conservative Party and the rest of the EU governments by conditioning any trade  deal with the US on the elimination of the discriminatory trade practices  against Israeli commerce.PETER SIMPSON

Selective success I  read Martin Sherman’s “Parading past predictions” (Into the Fray, May 1) with  great interest.I admire his writing. But I note that the only  predictions he parades are those in which he was proved correct, or nearly so.

Funding sources The article “Nakba-themed film  festival sparks controversy at TAU” (April 30) discusses the activities of  Zochrot, a radical, anti-Zionist Israeli NGO.The extensive funding  Zochrot receives from foreign governments is an essential dimension in this  story. According to the Israeli Registrar of Non-Profits, Zochrot received NIS  853,863 from foreign government entities in 2014; NIS 827,111 in 2013, and NIS  1,211,691 in 2012. Over 90 percent of this money is channeled through European  church groups (which are themselves primarily funded by governments) under the  heading of “humanitarian aid.”These enablers include Broederlijk Delen  (Belgium), the Rosa Luxemberg Foundation (Germany), Finn Church Aid (Finland),  Christian Aid (UK), Trocaire (Ireland), ICCO (Netherlands), Misereor (Germany),  HEKS (Switzerland), the Mennonite Central Committee and the American Friends  Service Committee (US). Their funding enables Zochrot’s promotion of a  “one-state” formula and a “de-Zionized Palestine.”Furthermore, as  detailed research by NGO Monitor demonstrates, most of these groups promote BDS  (boycott, divestment and sanctions) against Israel.GERALD STEINBERG  
Jerusalem The writer is president of NGO Monitor.Never so moved The  speech given at Bergen- Belsen by Ronald S.

Kfar Yona Serious responsibility I read your editorial “Surrogacy  challenge” (April 28). It seems you are committing a very serious crime against  Jewish (Torah) law.You argue that gay relationships be made legal. This  goes directly against the Torah, which considers gay relationships a very  serious crime. What is your message? Ignore the Torah? God forbid! Maybe this is  what you personally believe. I, myself, was not very religious for the first 18  years of my life. But now I realize that I was very wrong.We believe  that the Torah is from Hashem (God), that Hashem is infinite and so is the  Torah. We cannot understand everything Hashem does or understand all of His  Torah. Our intellect is small.The Torah forbids us to waste our seed. A  man can use his seed to give life to a new baby. If instead he has gay  relationships, his seed goes to waste. He is killing children that could have  been born.Please take into account that your beliefs could be  mistaken.Keep them to yourself. Many people read your newspaper. If  anyone decides to ignore the Torah because of what you write, you will be held  responsible.BEN ZION COHEN

CORRECTION Former US president  Jimmy Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his “decades of untiring  effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance  democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development,” and  not in 1979 for his role in Israeli-Egyptian peace talks, as was erroneously  stated in “Carter slams PM, praises Abbas” (May 3). Furthermore, the prize  recognizing those talks was awarded in 1978 and was bestowed jointly upon  Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian president Anwar Sadat.

<title>Media Comment: Enemy-supporting journalism</title>
<date>2/12/2015</date>
<content>
American actress and comedian Roseanne Barr  apparently reads the English-language edition of Haaretz and as a result,  exploded against Rogel Alpher, a columnist and blogger at the paper, on November  23. She became a media critic after reading his piece calling upon the Jews of  France not to make aliya but rather to stay in France.He added, as this  paper reported: “Don’t flee Muslim fascism into the arms of Jewish fascism.  Nothing for you in Israel... To emigrate from France to Israel now is like  emigrating from Palestine to Nazi Germany in 1933... Israel has stopped being  the Jewish state. It is a bi-national apartheid state...




The Zionist  enterprise is dead. Committed suicide.”Barr’s answer to Alpher was a  very blunt and insulting tweet: “Stfu [shut the f*** up] privileged fat  skinhead.”Alpher’s reaction was, “she’s been for several years already  very much psycho.”We are no experts in psychology but we think Barr’s  expressions fall well within the normative dialogue that goes on the record in  the pages of Haaretz and, for that matter, a few other newspapers and news Web  sites, notably Yediot Aharonot and its Ynet site whose Igal Sarna regularly  employs Nazi themes against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others he  hates.Our Media Comment columns focus on Israel’s local media but there  is a broader view that must be considered. Haaretz and Ynet promote their  content in English, aiming for a global audience. Whereas this paper also  publishes in English globally, there is a fundamental difference: The Jerusalem  Post, which if course is also in English, informs, while the goal of Haaretz and  Ynet is to persuade.Take for example a very popular form of modern  journalism: blogs. At Haaretz there is no pluralism in this regard. The  prominent blogs include Bradley Burston’s “A Special Place in Hell,” Chemi  Shalev’s “West of Eden,” Anshel Pfeffer’s “Jerusalem & Babylon,” Barak  Ravid’s “Diplomania” and Carlo Strenger’s “Strenger than Fiction.” While Moshe  Arens and Israel Harel are regular Haaretz columnists, their columns are not  always translated. In the rare event that there are right-of-center op-ed  contributors, they, too, are rarely translated. One of us (YM) volunteered  himself as a blogger but there was not even a response.Persistent  reading reveals the pervasiveness of the paper’s editorial line, which makes its  way into every possible section.There are the op-ed contributors who  also report, mixing views and news. Here is Amira Hass in her November 26  column: “[E]ither the politicians, army personnel and judges in Israel are  stupid... or they are consciously interested in escalation and the expansion of  Palestinian acts of desperation.”Gideon Levy employed an anti-Semitic  meme last August 5 when he opined on the Duma torching murders that “what is  concealed beneath the skin of most Israelis, you would find: the chosen  people...the next torching is only a matter of time.” His next favorite  term is “apartheid.” He does not depend only on his audience reading him, but  regularly travels abroad on trips sponsored by the most vicious anti-Israel  groups.His recent National Press Club address was reviewed on November 2  in the CounterCurrents blog: “Gidion [sic] Levy gives a wonderful highly  authoritative... description of the state of blind, deaf and dumb Israeli  acceptance of the inhumanity of Israeli persecution, degradation and homicidal  captivity of Arab Palestinians... who Levy reports are treated and considered as  sub human. Levy presents...illustrative examples of incomprehensible  macabre racism personally witnessed.”Here is Levy providing a balanced,  factual perspective on September 13: “What can we say about the Jewish majority  if it’s a majority for fascism, racism and hatred of Arabs and foreigners?” And  on August 2, relating to the Duma incident: “All Israelis are guilty for setting  a Palestinian family on fire.”What is tolerated by his publisher would  be denounced if it appeared in another paper. Even leftist Gershom Gorenberg, on  November 6, 2014, admitted, “It upsets me to read what Levy writes about my  city.” What Levy wrote was, “O Jerusalem, Israelis have already forgotten  thee... you can’t love a city when it’s immoral.” That the paper tolerates such  expressions while railing against much less incendiary writing elsewhere  indicates an ingrained prejudice both in the editorial offices and the  newsrooms.We’ll give The Wall Street Journal’s James Taranto the last  word on Levy. Directly following last March’s elections here, Levy wrote: “The  nation must be replaced... it is very ill indeed... truly broken, possibly  beyond repair.” Taranto’s piece was entitled “Annoy the Media, Vote Likud,” and  he observed in it that “some Israelis are not what you’d describe as pro-Israel.  Consider this reaction from Gideon Levy of Ha’aretz, the Jewish equivalent of  the New York Times.”Newspapers organize professional conferences, and  that is not unusual. Haaretz has organized, so far, two “Israel Conference on  Peace” in which the far-left political ideology is the dominant  theme.The accompanying special newspaper supplement was generous in  hosting, among others, the Palestinian Authority’s Jibril Rajoub. Rajoub is an  “acceptable Arab.” But i24 TV’s Lucy Aharish, who served as a moderator for the  two previous Haaretz conferences and also this year’s, is also an Israeli Arab  and a media personality in her own right, fell out of favor.Back in May  when she was honored by the state as one of the 12 torch lighters on  Independence Day, Levy managed to find something wrong with her selection,  casting her as a “good Arab,” akin to the American “Uncle Tom” epithet. To his  mind, she was chosen because she didn’t “dress like an Arab.”Her  outspoken declarations, on air, against Arab violence, the promotion of  terrorism and the unwillingness to compromise apparently really charged up  Haaretz’s extreme leftist non-Zionists.She asked, “Even if the status  quo on the Temple Mount has been broken, does that allow someone to go and  murder someone else because of a sacred place?” Haaretz’s Jack Khoury on October  19 and then Alpher on October 24 penned very critical and negative columns  against her. She was targeted. Alpher was especially denigrating, writing, “[I]f  Aharish were to speak differently, she would not have a job on Channel 2. If she  spoke differently, no one would have let her host a current affairs program on  Channel 2... .”On July 24, 2014, Haaretz published a column by Stephen  Games, a cultural critic formerly with the BBC and The Guardian, who asked, “Can  the BBC and other international news networks really provide ‘war reporting of  the highest standards’ from Gaza when their staff are threatened by Hamas  enforcers?” and called it “compromised coverage.”
When the atmosphere at  Haaretz is overwhelmingly post-Zionist, when the characterization of Israel  slides into Nazi imagery, when the negative is the most prominent news, can one  consider Haaretz to be a “news”paper?

<title>My word: BDS and Matisyahu’s bum rap</title>
<date>20/8/2015</date>

“All my life I’ve been waiting for I’ve been praying for For the people to say  That we don’t wanna fight no more There will be no more wars And our children  will play...”– “One Day” performed by Matisyahu 





The lyrics might seem  innocuous – pro-peace and world harmony, even – but hip-hop singer Matisyahu who  performs them was singled out as being out of tune with the message of an annual  music festival in Benicassim, near Valencia in Spain. As The Jerusalem Post’s  Herb Keinon put it: “If you plan on going to the Sunsplash Rototom Reggae  Festival in Spain this week, you better not speak the language of the Hebrewman.  If you do, they might kick you out.”Matisyahu’s sin was being Jewish.  The well-known singer shot to fame while he was still an ultra-Orthodox Jew with  a distinct hassidic look. He shaved off his sidecurls and beard and dropped the  haredi garb several years ago, but he is still a proud Jew: an American Jew; not  an Israeli.That apparently was enough for the festival’s  organizers.Facing intense pressure from the local BDS (Boycott,  Divestment and Sanctions) movement, they called on Matisyahu to clearly state  where he stands on Zionism and the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict.Matisyahu stood his ground, posting on Facebook: “They wanted  me to write a letter, or make a video, stating my positions on Zionism and the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict to pacify the BDS people. The festival kept  insisting that I clarify my personal views; which felt like clear pressure to  agree with the BDS political agenda.“Honestly it was appalling and  offensive, that as the one publicly Jewish-American artist scheduled for the  festival they were trying to coerce me into political statements.Were  any of the other artists scheduled to perform asked to make political statements  in order to perform?” As Douglas Murray suggested in an essay published by the  Gatestone Institute, “Spain has its own border issues. Perhaps Spanish  performers should henceforth be quizzed about their political attitudes before  they are allowed to perform abroad? Maybe the rest of the world should demand  that all artists from Spain sign a statement or make a video supporting Catalan  independence if they are to be allowed to perform in public?” Following the  uproar, the festival organizers flipflopped on the hip-hop and reinvited  Matisyahu, but the damage was done. Or perhaps not: The festival got more  publicity than it has previously generated in its 22-year existence and the bum  rap also exposed the ever uglier aspects of BDS. The call to “boycott, sanction  and divest” from Israel might start at the so-called Green Line but it never  stops there.And it has nothing to do with peace, cultural exchange and  human rights.As I noted last week, in a new level of absurdity mixed  with hypocrisy, a Norwegian film festival refused to screen a prize-winning  Israeli documentary about disabled children. According to a Yediot Aharonot  report, Roy Zafrani’s The Other Dreamers was rejected because the festival  organizers didn’t want to screen an Israeli movie that didn’t deal with “the  occupation” in some negative form or another.A few months ago I noted  that singer Achinoam Nini, better known abroad as Noa, had also faced attempts  to silence her when she performed in Spain. Ironically Nini, who represented  Israel in the 2009 Eurovision along with Israeli-Arab Mira Awad, is a passionate  and outspoken peace activist. Unlike Matisyahu she actually does try to convey a  political message in her performances – one of coexistence.But BDS is  part of the particularly sinister far Left. BDS supporters don’t want  normalization. They don’t want anything other than the delegitimization,  demonization and eventual destruction of Israel.BDS País Valencià and  RESCOP, the two groups behind the attempt to ban Matisyahu, issued a long and  detailed defense of their reasoning. Point 8 of the statement, for example,  read: “As citizens of conscience who also abhor all forms of racism and racist  incitement, our call for excluding Matisyahu’s performance is a valid ‘common  sense’ boycott against an artist who refuses to disavow his shameful racial  incitement and hateful messages. Matisyahu’s religious or ethnic identity is  entirely irrelevant to our call for excluding his performance.”Of course  his religious and ethnic identity is irrelevant: They’ll put pressure on anyone  who shows a measure of support for Israel, no matter who they are or where  they’re from.Take the case of Emma Carter. According to a Yediot  Aharonot report this week, the British tourist who fell in love with Tel Aviv  was forced to close her Facebook account after posting: “There are a few factors  I consider when liking a place – people, food and architecture! All are fully  met in Israel....”Carter praised the warmth of Israelis she met, the  sense of security – and the Iron Dome anti-rocket system – and the ice-cream  shops open 24 hours a day.This was too much. Carter discovered who her  true Facebook friends are: She was accused of supporting an “apartheid state”  and a country of murderers who steal Palestinian land – as if the people who  have never visited Israel know more about what it’s like than somebody who’d  just come back from a trip and seen it firsthand.Carter said that when  she set out for Tel Aviv, accompanying a friend who wanted to celebrate her 40th  birthday there: “As an Englishwoman, all I knew about Israel were the wars in  Gaza.”That’s all anybody would know if the BDSers had their way.  According to the Yediot story, Carter ended up closing her Facebook account as  the attacks on her (and Israel) mounted up and Facebook warned her that her post  was “offensive.”MANY BDS and pro-Palestinian groups are proud to have  Jewish members, and they take great pains to stress that they are not  anti-Semitic. Perish the thought.During last summer’s war in Gaza, I  received an email from a group called BDS Italy so filled with the  self-righteousness of the far Left that it made me laugh out loud, even as the  rockets were still pounding down on us at a rate of about 100 a day.“BDS  Italy expresses its unequivocal and absolute condemnation of the shameful  posters plastered around the city of Rome by the neo-fascist group Militia, as  well as the general co-optation [sic] of the Palestinian cause by the extreme  right to spread anti-Semitism,” it read. “BDS Italy denounces anti-Semitism as  racist and reactionary ideology and condemns the use of Palestinian suffering as  a pretext and tool for spreading this vile ideology. In particular, we condemn  the fascist call to boycott Jewish- owned businesses, a call which includes an  appalling ‘blacklist.’ “BDS Italy notes that the campaign for Boycott,  Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel... has nothing to do with the  odious and despicable maneuvers of fascists new and old.”For the BDS  promoters to describe the blacklist of Jewish- owned businesses as “appalling”  is especially absurd.What is BDS if not a blacklist of companies  associated with the Jewish state? An email I received from BDS South Africa last  week tried to explain why the campaign had singled out Woolworths for its  consumer boycott campaign. “Several retailers in South Africa have some sort of  trade relationship with Israel. Boycotting all of them at the same time is not  feasible so we focus our campaigns and move from one target to another as we  reach our goals.....“While the individual Woolworths cherry may not come  from an illegal Israeli settlement, the supplier in all likelihood according to  various reports, has activities in the settlements making the supplier and  Woolworths guilty of violating international law.“In addition, it is  well documented that Israeli agricultural companies are using Israel’s main  water supplier Mekorot which has illegal activities in the illegal Israeli  settlements. Woolworths is aware of this but has failed to clarify whether any  of its Israeli produce come from companies that use Mekorot.”By this  standard they should boycott the Palestinians, not support them: Both the  Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, for example, use  electricity supplied by Israel; PA officials and Hamas members regularly receive  medical treatment in Israeli hospitals; and far from avoiding Israeli academic  institutions, BDS founder Omar Barghouti studied at Tel Aviv  University.My answer, as always, is to counter the boycott with a  buy-cott, favoring blue-and-white products.If individual BDS supporters  feel compelled to boycott all Israeli cultural, medical and technological  developments that’s their right, even if their lives will be poorer, shorter and  more miserable as a result.But wouldn’t it be better to promote true  coexistence? “One day,” as Matisyahu might say to anyone who’s not too  prejudiced to listen.

<title>My word: Belonging and acceptance</title>
<date>7/5/2015</date>
<content>
The problem with the Ethiopian immigrants is not that  they’re black, it’s that they’re transparent, opined a journalist a few years  ago. No more.Members of the Israeli-Ethiopian community were definitely  seen and heard during the wave of recent protests, culminating in Sunday’s clash  with police at Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square.




Images of the members of the  Jewish black community decrying discrimination and police brutality were quickly  carried around the world and Israeli TV stations canceled their scheduled  programs to broadcast live footage of the demonstration in which scores were  injured, both police and protesters.
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}The violence caught much of the  country by surprise: Thinking of the community as “quiet” is part of the  patronizing bon ton that many “Ethiopians” find so annoying.At least  part of the problem of the protest which got out of control was that it was  legitimate rather than legal: The demonstrators had genuine grievances to voice,  but had not applied for a permit to hold the demonstration.As a result  there were no defined route, hours and, most important, no leadership who could  control the angry youths.According to some people present, there were  also elements from both far Left and far Right who took the opportunity to  exploit the situation – to exploit the 135,000-member Ethiopian community, in  effect. The far Left finds the images of blacks being beaten by Israeli police  fit in nicely with its narrative of “Israeli apartheid” (the case of migrant  workers is a cause célèbre in certain circles) while the far Right wanted to  emphasize the picture of police violence, which they claim is often directed  toward them.Perhaps the saddest aspect of the demonstration was that as  very small groups hijacked it for their own purposes, the reasons for the anger  and pain that led to the rally in the first place became less and less the focus  of attention.Given the sensitivities involved, it is hard even to find  the politically correct, or at least socially acceptable, description for the  community.The vast majority of those demonstrating this week were not  “Ethiopian immigrants” but Sabras, part of the generation born in Israel. They  also resent the “Ethiopian” label, although, as I pointed out in conversations  with friends, it is common to describe somebody by their perceived community:  “Russians” include people from Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and other  Russian-speaking states; “French” includes immigrants (veteran and new) from  Belgium and Switzerland; and I have got used to being described as “Amerika’it,”  a description which is miles off the mark for someone who was the third  generation born in London.Among those with whom I discussed the  situation was colleague and neighbor Tsega Melaku, one of the leading members of  the Ethiopian-Israeli community, not known for taking things quietly.I  live on the same street as Melaku in a rapidly gentrifying Jerusalem  neighborhood, and we are both members of the board of the Jerusalem Association  of Journalists.We are also both banned from donating blood to Magen  David Adom, I note: me because I visited England at the height of the “mad cow  disease” scare; Melaku because she was born in Ethiopia.Melaku, who took  a leading role in the “blood protest” in 1996, fighting the stigmatization of  the community as an AIDS risk, doesn’t get my British sense of humor. I didn’t  at first understand how hurtful it was for the Ethiopian community that their  blood was simply thrown out as possibly tainted.Melaku, who missed  entering the Knesset on Moshe Kahlon’s Kulanu list due to a technicality, was  for a while considered likely to become the first “Ethiopian” minister in the  government.With her outspoken, colorful personality, Melaku treads the  very thin line separating the thought-provoking from the provocative.She  breaks stigmas when she speaks of them. For example, at a time when she was the  head of Israel Radio’s Reshet Alef station – the first woman in the post as well  as the first Ethiopian – she was approached by an imperfect stranger who asked  if she was available to clean his home.It still happens, now and again,  Melaku says. People don’t see her BA (in political science and sociology) and MA  (in business and communications); they see the color of her skin. As a  politician, she quips, she wanted to use her skills to try to clean society and  put it in order; she’s not available for any other type of  housecleaning.Melaku has written about her experiences in a recently  published book (in Hebrew) titled “Not in Our School.” Education is a key theme  for Melaku and she insisted that both her sons, now aged 18 and 21, went to a  “good” school in Jerusalem.When I ask her this week how she has been so  successful, she puts it down to education and her own assertive  nature.Breaking another stereotype, she notes she received a good  education in Ethiopia before she emigrated from Gondar in 1984 at the age of  16.“It’s not a matter of money,” she says. “There’s plenty of money but  it has to be spent correctly and it’s important to help children within the  system.” Separate “pet projects for Ethiopians” only further the stereotypes and  isolation, she says.She wants to see better integration of children in  regular after-school activities and youth movements, rather than in programs  aimed specifically at Ethiopians.Melaku would also like to see Israeli  schools teaching more about the history of the Ethiopian community and what they  endured to reach Israel. In Ethiopia, the Jews suffered from anti-Semitism, she  notes. It was a community that always dreamed of going to Zion.Melaku,  who made the journey without her parents and three siblings, spent the first  five months in Israel without family at an absorption center in Tiberias, and  was shocked by the expressions of racism she encountered here, including the  aspersions on her being Jewish.Ironically, growing up in Gondar, Melaku  hadn’t known there were white Jews.“How did you survive on your own, in  a new country, in a new language at the age of 16?” I ask.“You know me,  I’m tough,” she replies.The recent protests did not surprise her. “The  video of the soldier [Damas Pakada] being beaten by police was the last straw.  There was already a huge, ongoing pentup feeling of discrimination, isolation  and humiliation,” says Melaku. “There are people who have pent up their feelings  at the failed absorption process for decades.”She is still upset that  she wasn’t allowed to serve in the IDF, which was not interested at that time in  having female Ethiopian soldiers.There is an important generational  difference, Melaku notes. Her generation, and her parents who made the dangerous  journey to Israel eight years later, were willing to suffer more in silence.  Just being in Israel was the realization of a dream. Today, the generation born  in Israel is not willing to suffer and shouldn’t have to.The growth of  the independent-minded Sabra generation, however, has also resulted in a loss of  status for the traditional leaders of the community, the kesim, and this was  partly reflected in the lack of leadership at the rally, she says.“This  is a generation that spontaneously organizes protests via the social media,” she  notes.The fact that they are willing to organize and fight for their  rights gives Melaku hope.The protests, we both feel, cannot end this  time with some sweet talking of establishing a committee to look into the  problems. The problems are well known. And so are the solutions: integration,  education and abandoning the policy of creating artificial ghettos in certain  towns and neighborhoods.The Israeli-Ethiopian community shouldn’t have  to fight for acceptance more than 30 years after Operation Moses brought the  older generation here in what still seems like a miracle. And the struggle  against stigmas, stereotyping and, yes, racism, should not be theirs  alone.Nor should it be political.But violence cannot be fought  by violence.The demonstration in Tel Aviv on Sunday started with the  best of intentions but descended into chaos; the same can be said of the  absorption procedure.The Ethiopian community can at last be clearly  seen, but crossing the redline into violent protest will not help its message be  heard. The police needs to root out officers who abuse their power (and not just  against Ethiopians); citizens need to decry demonstrators who assault the  police.The protest was a cry for acceptance. It’s up to all of us to  stress that the protesters already belong.

<title>My Word: Drawing the Green Line</title>
<date>23/4/2015</date>
<content>
The question of where to draw the line is never simple. Neither is the question  of where and how the Green Line was drawn.These are boundaries, borders  if you will, blurred by tears.




Just over a year ago, Emily Amrousi wrote  a column in Israel Hayom under the title “Whose land is it?” In it she compared  the situation of Ramat Rahel and Kfar Etzion. The former is a kibbutz accepted  as being an enclave within Jerusalem’s municipal boundaries, the latter is a  kibbutz in the Etzion Bloc – within the general Israeli consensus but beyond the  pale for most of the world, a world that hasn’t felt comfortable referring to  the area as Judea since the Romans finally ended Jewish sovereignty there in 135  CE, and renamed the region Syria Palæstina.Both Gush Etzion and Ramat  Rahel were founded around 1926.The Etzion area particularly suffered  from deadly sporadic Arab riots that targeted Jews in 1929 and 1933. In 1948,  the fates of Kibbutz Ramat Rahel and Kibbutz Kfar Etzion diverged. Both came  under heavy attack from the Arab Legion in the War of Independence. Kfar Etzion,  after a brave battle, fell on the day the state was proclaimed. Most of its  members there were killed; the lucky ones were transported to a desolate  prisoner-of-war camp in Transjordan. Ramat Rahel managed to hold out. From that  point on, Ramat Rahel was considered a legitimate part of Israel, in contrast to  the four kibbutzim of the Etzion Bloc destroyed in 1948.  
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}The 1948 war,  was not about “the settlements” but the very existence of the Jewish state.  Ditto the Six Day War in 1967 in which the Jordanians lost Gush Etzion and it  returned to Jewish hands.Jews rushed back to rebuild the area. The names  of the current Jewish communities there reflect those of the original  pioneers.Last week, on her radio show on Reshet Bet, Liat Regev  interviewed twins Haim and Yitzhak Levinovitch, whose father, Yehoshua, was one  of the 127 killed in Kfar Etzion that fateful Friday, May 14, 1948.They  told how the residents and fighters, holding a white flag, were gathered  together as if for a photo – and were then mowed down, men and women dying  together.Strangely, for years they did not use the word “massacre” to  describe the slaughter. But massacre it was. One whose story is not often  told.THE SCENIC drive between Ramat Rahel and the Etzion Bloc takes  about 15 minutes. They are not “worlds apart” but the world thinks of them  separately. The dead Jews of Kfar Etzion do not count as far as the United  Nations, European Union and most countries are concerned.It’s one of  those double standards that sadly no longer astonish.The difference in  status between the two kibbutzim came to mind last week when the foreign  ministers of 16 European countries sent a letter to EU foreign policy chief  Federica Mogherini asking her to promote the labeling of products made by  Jewish-owned industries located beyond the 1949 armistice line, the so-called  Green Line.The move makes me see red on so many levels, it’s hard to  know where to begin. It’s also hard to know where it will end, but it does not  bode well.Defenders of the labeling idea say it will offer consumers the  means of making an informed choice about the products they are buying. But that  choice exists already. No one has to purchase a product labeled “Made in Israel”  just as nobody is forced to buy produce “Made in Spain” if they feel  uncomfortable about Spanish rule over the Basque region, or in Barcelona for  that matter.It is, of course, hard to avoid cheap “Made in China”  products but I’ve never seen a product labeled “Made in Occupied Tibet.” The  world doesn’t seem to have a problem with that, however.Wines from the  historically contested Alsace-Lorraine region do not come with a label in the  negative sense of the word. Why should uncorking a bottle from the Golan Heights  be any different? And to whose bloody hands are we meant to transfer control of  the Golan: Bashar Assad’s forces or al-Qaida, currently positioned along the  border with Israel? Or perhaps Islamic State? Both the Assad regime and Islamic  State have been preoccupied butchering Syrian and Palestinian residents of  Damascus and the surrounding area this month.Singling out Jewish  businesses does nothing to fight anti-Semitism, the oft-stated goal of European  countries such as France and Belgium as they witness the deadly toll of hatred.  It does even less to bring about a real peace with the Palestinians. It pushes  the Palestinian Authority further from the negotiating table. Why would they  risk giving up something in talks when they can gain so much by letting others  reduce Israel for them? Peace is more likely to grow from economic security  rather than the destabilizing threats of would-be peacemakers, but among the  chief victims of the boycott against Jewish businesses beyond the Green Line  will be the Palestinians who work in them. And labeling “settlers” as different  from other Israelis sets them apart as targets for terrorism.The timing  of the EU letter couldn’t have been more unfortunate. The story broke on the eve  of Holocaust Remembrance Day, leading Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman to  suggest: “They can mark all the products from Judea and Samaria and the Golan  Heights with a yellow star.”For a moment I had the uncomfortable image  of babies born in Jerusalem’s Hadassah University Medical Center on Mount Scopus  having “Made in Israeli-occupied territory” stamped on their bottoms. Then I  realized it wouldn’t be all the babies born there: just the Jewish  ones.The hospital was founded on Mount Scopus in 1934 but was besieged  in the War of Independence.In May 1948, a convoy was attacked by Arabs  as it left the hospital and all 77 doctors and nurses traveling home were  killed. The hospital then quickly fell into Jordanian hands, returning to Israel  in 1967 and being reestablished as a premier medical center, treating and  staffed by Jews and Arabs, in 1976.The labeling suggestion furthers the  delegitimization of Israel. Some ultra-liberal circles have already gone beyond  delegitimization to demonization. They must consider this a victory: On the one  hand they like to portray Israel as an apartheid state, on the other they  promote boycotts and sanctions of it, never stopping at the pre-1967  line.I am constantly bombarded with press releases about anti-Israel  “successes” like the statement I received last week boasting: “Palestinian  activists, led by the NC4P, BDS South Africa, PSA, COSAS, the ANCYL and others  successfully protested the Israeli Ice Hockey World Cup Game yesterday evening  in Cape Town. Marbles were released on the ice as well as red coloring to  reflect the blood of the thousands of Palestinians who suffer under Israel’s  apartheid government.”I waded through my mail but did not find a  condemnation of the brutal attacks on “foreigners” taking place in South Africa.  So let me cry out for them instead.When the world spends so much time  and energy on singling out Israel for its perceived abuses, it is allowing  atrocities to take place elsewhere. Boatloads of would be migrants are drowning  as they struggle to reach European shores; Christians and Muslims are being  slaughtered by jihadists throughout Africa and the Middle East.The cure?  Divert attention to Israeli homes, businesses and agriculture: It usually  works.Neither Jordan nor Egypt, both of which have since signed peace  treaties with Israel, established an independent Palestinian state in the  territories they controlled between 1948 and 1967. And neither wants to risk  strengthening Hamas, its jihadist partners or its Iranian sponsor now. But the  EU won’t let that get in the way. We see ourselves as the Start-up Nation –  producing medical and technological breakthroughs galore. The world sees us as  the Jewish upstart.There is still hope: Just this week the Israel  Academy of Sciences and Britain’s Royal Society announced a new joint  scholarship program, for instance. There is no boycott of Israel, the Europeans  say. Just those territories beyond the Green Line.But it won’t end  there.How fortunate for Ramat Rahel, that its oldest members managed to  avoid death and captivity in 1948.Too bad for the residents of the  Etzion Bloc that its pre-state founding members weren’t so lucky.
The  arbitrary 1949 armistice line might be the defining point for the European  Union, but I can’t help thinking of Europe in 1939.

<title>My word: Palestinians, football, fair play and fouls</title>
<date>21/5/2015</date>
<content>
Being born and raised in Britain  doesn’t make me an expert on football, but it gives me a good idea of what is  right and wrong on the sports field. And what’s going on in this particular part  of the world “is not cricket,” as the Brits say. It’s far from fair  play.Proving that whatever they are, they are not good sports, members  of the Palestinian Football Association continue to press for Israel’s removal  from FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association).




Crying  foul is Jibril Rajoub, the head of the Palestinian Football  Association.Rajoub, who served time in Israeli prisons for terrorism, is  fixed on one goal: getting Israel kicked out of FIFA. A vote to suspend Israel  would require a two-thirds majority in the 209-member body at its congress in  Zurich on May 29.See the latest opinion pieces on our       Opinion & Blogs Facebook      page 

 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}
This is not the first time the Palestinians have tried  to mix politics and sports, of course. More than 40 years have passed, but  Israelis are still traumatized by the hostage- taking and deaths of 11 members  of its Olympic team in Munich in 1972.Maybe I should feel relieved that  Rajoub, who is also the chairman of the Palestinian Olympic Committee and  refuses to condemn the Munich massacre, is now concentrating his efforts on  character assassination and delegitimization of Israel.“Armed  resistance” is still part of his lexicon, however.Rajoub has a way of  playing with minds and words: “We don’t need any more promises, committees or  postponements that only serve to prolong our footballers’ suffering. We need  actions in order to foster what football should be: a vehicle of peace, not a  tool to whitewash occupation and apartheid,” he wrote in an op-ed that appeared  on the Guardian website on May 19. Read that last sentence again and  weep.Rajoub clearly understands that football could be a tool for  creating peace and goodwill, but that’s not his aim. Any cooperation with Israel  – and there is a lot, including the use of Israeli sports facilities for  training – is “a tool to whitewash occupation and apartheid,” in his  world.Rajoub’s allegations against Israel, which he has been circulating  for the last two years, include the restriction of movement of Palestinian  players; preventing the transfer of soccer equipment from Israeli seaports to  the Palestinian Authority; the destruction of Palestinian stadiums; preventing  Arab teams from countries without formal diplomatic relations with Israel – such  as Iraq – from entering the West Bank to play against Palestinian teams; and –  the European flavor of the year – the recognition of Jewish teams located in  Judea and Samaria, which play under the auspices of the Israel Football  Association.Well, security measures do entail annoying delays, as anyone  who has traveled by air in the last 15 years or so is aware. Believe me, Mr.  Former Security Prisoner Rajoub, we’d all be happier if we didn’t have to worry  about terrorism.Palestinian soccer stadiums in Gaza would not be  destroyed by Israel if they were being used as a place to play football rather  than as launching pads for missile attacks and other terrorist  activity.Only in Israel-bashing “civil society” are attempts at security  measures considered apartheid while the demand that every last Jew be banned  from living in Palestinian- controlled territory is considered conducive to  peace.I don’t know whether to congratulate Rajoub on trying to improve  ties with Hamas in Gaza (whose charter still calls for the elimination of  Israel, and not just wiping it off the football-playing world map) or to wonder  whether this is just a tactical maneuver.We can assume that playing a  dirty game with football is part of a wider strategy of acting against Israel in  the UN and discussions about putting Israeli leaders in the dock at the  International Criminal Court in The Hague.As The Jerusalem Post’s sports  commentator Allon Sinai notes, “Rajoub’s approach to FIFA... has everything to  do with his own personal and national political aspirations and very little to  do with helping those who in many cases are truly in need.”The Post’s  London correspondent Jerry Lewis this week revealed that one of English soccer’s  former top executives, Simon Johnson, is campaigning against the suspension  move.“Even putting this matter to a vote risks bringing a complex and  emotive international political conflict on to the floor of the FIFA Congress  and to the heart of the international football family. It will doubtless  overshadow the Election Congress. Any debate on the matter would be  controversial, and, even if the vote to suspend were not to be approved, the  unity of the football family at the time of a Congress would be shattered, in a  public and controversial manner,” Johnson pointed out.“During the Balkan  conflict, the Afghan and Iraq wars, the Somalia conflict, the civil wars in  Sudan and in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, FIFA has kept  itself above politics and has not taken steps that might favor one side or  another in a political conflict,” he noted.The only countries that have  been suspended by FIFA are South Africa under the apartheid regime and  Yugoslavia under Slobodan Milosevic.THIS IS not exactly football’s  finest hour: Among FIFA President Sepp (Joseph) Blatter’s biggest headaches  ahead of his own attempts at being reelected at the FIFA congress in Zurich is  the controversy surrounding the decision to hold the World Cup in Qatar (in the  heat of summer) in 2022 and the uproar over the conditions of the foreign  workers slaving on completing the stadiums and facilities in time.Talk  about human rights infringements: This week the International Federation of  Journalists complained that a BBC team invited by the Qatari government to tour  the new accommodations for the construction workers was arrested by the  authorities and held for two days without charges.Blatter, visiting the  region to try to avert Israel’s suspension coming to a vote, told Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday: “Football is nowadays such a strong, strong  organization that we should go into a peace situation and not into a fighting  situation, and football shall connect people and not divide people... Yes,  football is stronger than all the problems there could be. I’m sure we will find  a solution.”But Rajoub was having none of that. “I don’t trust the  Israelis,” he told reporters after his meeting with Blatter the next day and  hearing details of a series of moves aimed at easing the situation: These would  reportedly include giving Palestinian players special identity cards and placing  special liaison officials at crossings with Palestinian areas to facilitate  movement; and exempting donated equipment from taxation.I agree with  Rajoub on one issue: Some of the fans of Jerusalem’s Beitar FC have crossed the  redline with racist rhetoric and acts. It has cost the club many former diehard  fans and many points as the Israel Football Association has taken increasingly  tougher measures against it.I wish Rajoub would take similar  action.Unfortunately, the Palestinian Authority continues to sponsor  sporting events and venues dedicated to terrorists, including Salah Khalaf, who  was behind the Olympic massacre. According to the Palestinian Media Watch NGO,  several schools, summer camps and sporting tournaments have been named after  Dalal Mughrabi, who participated in the 1978 Coastal Road massacre in which 37  Israelis, 12 of them children, were killed after Mughrabi and her partners  hijacked the bus they were traveling in. Abu Jihad, a founder of Fatah whose  terrorist credentials include planning the Coastal Road massacre, has a football  tournament named in his memory. There was also a football tournament named for  Wafa Idris, the first Palestinian female suicide bomber. Not so much a reminder  of the sporting spirit as the omnipresent promotion of terrorism.Israel  Football Association Chairman Ofer Eini remained optimistic regarding the FIFA  vote, citing the principle that guides many different games (and politicking):  It ain’t over till it’s over.Blatter, desperately seeking a way to  prevent the matter from being raised at the May 29 congress, has reportedly  proposed holding a friendly match between the Israeli and Palestinian national  teams at FIFA headquarters in Zurich.I doubt that his concept of a  “friendly match” is the same as Rajoub’s.Rajoub said he “likes the idea”  but it can’t take place without preparing the environment.Judging by the  photos of Palestinian youths holding symbolic red cards to “apartheid Israel” to  protest the meeting between Rajoub and Blatter, his idea of preparing the ground  consists of educating another generation in hatred.Rajoub is playing a  dangerous double game: On the field, he pretends to be a sportsman and dribbles  the ball; off the field, he pretends to be a man of peace while frothing at the  mouth.

<title>My word: Targeted boycotts and terrorism</title>
<date>19/2/2015</date>
<content>
President Barack Obama’s “random folk in a deli” comment sounded stupid when he  said it last week, referring to the victims, all four of them Jewish, in the  January attack on the kosher supermarket in Paris.We should be thankful  for small mercies.




When a similar pattern of attack on a meeting of  caricaturists in Copenhagen was followed a few hours later by a deadly assault  on a bat-mitzva party at a synagogue in the Danish capital on February 14, the  American president who has such trouble enunciating the words “Islamist terror”  did not, at least in public, pretend that death of a Danish Jewish guard was  just a matter of bad karma.My heart goes out to the families of Dan Uzan  and the man killed in the first attack and to the bat-mitzva girl and her  friends and relatives.Keep up to date on the latest opinion pieces on our new Opinion & Blogs Facebook page The attack wasn’t random, but I hope the girl will  grow up understanding that it wasn’t her fault. The assailant is to blame and  all those who aided him, be it logistically or by fostering the kind of  atmosphere in which anti-Semitism and hatred thrive.My sympathies are  also with the families of the 21 Egyptian Copts whose execution was shown on yet  another Islamic State slick, sick video. Their deaths weren’t random  either.They were a message to the Christian world.It wasn’t  subtle, although you might miss it if you stick your head in the sand and ignore  the images of the blood of the beheaded men flowing into the sea.The  death of four-year-old Adele Biton this week barely blipped on the radar outside  Israel and the Jewish world, but she too is a victim of terror. Tiny Adele died  of complications from pneumonia two years after suffering serious head wounds  when Palestinians threw rocks at the car she was traveling in with her mother  and sisters.There’s so much pain out there.And so much  stupidity.While all this bloodshed was going on – actually, much, much  more blood was being shed; Muslims have been killing Muslims in the thousands in  the four years since the outbreak of what was so optimistically termed the Arab  Spring – more than 100 British artists decided the best path to world peace is  to boycott Israel.In a letter to The Guardian on February 14, the group  known as Artists for Palestine UK wrote: “Along with more than 600 other fellow  artists, we are announcing today that we will not engage in business-as-usual  cultural relations with Israel. We will accept neither professional invitations  to Israel, nor funding, from any institutions linked to its government. Since  the summer war on Gaza, Palestinians have enjoyed no respite from Israel’s  unrelenting attack on their land, their livelihood, their right to political  existence... The Palestinian catastrophe goes on.“Israel’s wars are  fought on the cultural front too. Its army targets Palestinian cultural  institutions for attack, and prevents the free movement of cultural workers. Its  own theater companies perform to settler audiences on the West Bank – and those  same companies tour the globe as cultural diplomats, in support of “Brand  Israel.” During South African apartheid, musicians announced they weren’t going  to “play Sun City.” Now we are saying, in Tel Aviv, Netanya, Ashkelon or Ariel,  we won’t play music, accept awards, attend exhibitions, festivals or  conferences, run master classes or workshops, until Israel respects  international law and ends its colonial oppression of the  Palestinians.”A British-born Israeli friend couldn’t take the hypocrisy  and submitted his own letter, which the Guardian published this  week.Stephen Malnick, a doctor, wrote: “As a citizen of Ashkelon who was  nearly killed in the recent conflict with Gaza when part of a missile missed my  car by a few meters, I have a message for those artists with a selective  communal conscience. I do not want you to visit my city and insult 120,000  people who were under daily attack in violation of international law. There are  no military targets in Ashkelon but lots of Jews.“After you make a stand  against the extrajudicial killing of people in Gaza, and after you make a stand  on the whipping of a blogger in Saudi Arabia, and you apologize to the citizens  of Ashkelon, I will consider extending you hospitality.“I will continue  my daily tasks, including treating Gazans who are brought to the medical center  I work in for advanced medical treatment. Odd, isn’t it, that they visit but you  won’t? Even odder that I will welcome them and not you.”Malnick neatly  sums up the absurdity. He can heal Palestinian patients but there’s no cure for  either idiocy or hatred.And, no, State Department Spokeswoman Marie  Harf, providing jobs is not the answer to Islamic State’s recruitment efforts as  you so naively suggested on MSNBC’s Hardball. Military psychiatrist Maj. Nidal  Malik Hasan was employed, remember? He was working for the US Army when he went  on his killing spree, mowing down 13 soldiers at Fort Hood in Texas in 2009  while shouting “Allahu akbar” (which does not mean “For God’s sake give me a  job”).Leila Khaled, the former poster-girl for Palestinian terrorism,  was feted by some in South Africa during her visit last week. Following her  speech at the Durban University of Technology on February 11, the Students  Representative Council decided that “Jewish students, especially those who do  not support the Palestinian struggle, should deregister.”Vice Chancellor  Ahmed Bawa, showing moral courage in the current atmosphere, called the  deregistration demand “outrageous” and “a deep violation of our National  Constitution and every human rights principle.”But look out for Israel  Apartheid Week which kicks off on campuses in the UK on February 23 and spreads  from there around the global village for the next month. The atmosphere it  creates is lethal.The boycott movement is guilty of many sins. By  delegitimizing Israel’s existence it is legitimizing attacks on Israelis and  Jews everywhere.It also serves as a distraction, as my friend  noted.While the world obsesses over its distorted perception of Israel’s  treatment of the Palestinians, it does not focus on where the real injustice –  and mass murder – is taking place. There are millions of Muslim victims out  there. They aren’t the victims of Jews.Last month, I was asked by a  British radio station to comment on the remarks of member of parliament David  Ward. As marchers gathered for the solidarity rally following the Paris terror  attacks, he tweeted “Je suis Palestinian” and that the presence of Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Paris “makes me feel sick.”Ward serially  offends me: He has compared Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians to the  Holocaust, and last summer while Hamas and Islamic Jihad were launching  thousands of rockets on Israel he tweeted: “The big question is – if I lived in  
Gaza would I fire a rocket? – probably yes.”He later apologized if his  comments had given the impression he supported the rocket fire.During  the brief interview, I noted that now, more than ever, is a time for unity and  pointed out, not for the first time, that Israel is on the front lines of the  fight against radical Islam and global jihad.Hamas, a local offshoot of  the Muslim Brotherhood, was not firing rockets at Israel and planning  mega-attacks via its carefully constructed warren of terror tunnels because of  poverty and unemployment. On the contrary, if it stopped channeling so much of  its funds into terror, it could solve most of the socioeconomic problems from  which it suffers. But that’s not the goal. The aim is to try to bring down  Israel and establish its own Shari’a-abiding state in its place.That  some British parliamentarians – Ward is sadly not alone – and at least 100  artists prefer to support the forces of destruction against Israel does not  offer much hope when it comes to tackling Islamist extremism elsewhere,  including the pockets that can be found in Britain itself.Roger Waters,  one of the best-known boycotting artists, tried very hard to persuade Alan  Parsons not to perform here last week. It’s only because I don’t like violence  that I won’t recommend Waters take his act featuring an inflatable pig and go  fly the porcine prop above a stage in Gaza.Meanwhile, I’m praying that  Israel continues to avoid Gaza’s main exports: terror attacks, rockets and  mortars.Acts of kindness, random or otherwise, will always do more good  in the world than boycotts and terrorism. That’s why the plan by a group in  Norway to form a “ring of peace” around the synagogue in Oslo this Shabbat is  heartening. The organizers belong to a Muslim grassroots group trying to fight hate and  extremism.
Their acts are braver and better-intentioned than anything  Roger Waters and his ilk even aspire to.

<title>My Word: The United Nations and the fall</title>
<date>3/7/2015</date>
<content>
It’s probably a mix of my age and the fact that not everyone in the media world  has free access to social media – that’s “free” as in unmonitored – but  alongside Facebook friends and LinkedIn connections I also have emails and phone  numbers written down in a notebook and stuffed into a folder of business cards  that has grown fatter over the years.It was here I looked for some names  and contact details last week, and as I did so I realized how much the world has  changed – and not for the better.




I was trying to find the addresses of  Egyptian journalists I used to be in touch with, along with a couple of Libyan  journalists, a Tunisian writer and some Fatah-affiliated Palestinians based in  Gaza.
One of the Egyptians barely escaped with his life after the fall of  Hosni Mubarak and now lives in the US; the other – the one who a few years ago  told me: “The Sunni-Shi’a divide doesn’t exist. It’s being created by America to  split the Muslim world” – is also no longer reachable; my heart goes out to the  Libyans, as their country disintegrates around them; ditto the Tunisian, who  must now realize that the Jasmine Revolution was not as romantic as its named  implied.I was looking for them in the wake of a Black Friday followed by  a bloody weekend and even worse week. On June 26 the world was shocked when a  terrorist gunned down 39 beachgoers, many of them British tourists, at Tunisia’s  Sousse resort; the general public also did a double take when it learned that  the attack on an American-owned gas company near Lyon in France included the  decapitation of the terrorist’s former boss, whose head was impaled on the  factory fence.It is a mark of Western arrogance that it paid less  attention on the same day to the Sunni attack on a Shi’ite mosque in Kuwait  during Friday Ramadan prayers. The Sunni- Shi’ite divide is not a figment of our  imaginations; it is rocking the world as we know it. And giving the Shi’ite side  of it easy access to nuclear arms as well as an economic boost is not going to  solve the problem, whatever President Barack Obama and those negotiating with  Iran on his behalf believe.I searched, in vain, for the Cairo-based  journalist, not only to get her updated take on the post-Arab Spring world but  also for information on the wave of terror that has swept Egypt again, from the  assassination of the attorney-general to the attacks by Islamic State that left  some 70 Egyptian soldiers and policemen dead in Sinai on  Wednesday.Closer to home, terrorists claimed the life of 27-year-old  Malachi Rosenfeld, who was gunned down in a car as he traveled home with three  friends near Shvut Rahel, close to Shiloh in the Binyamin region, on  Monday.Israeli officials are wary of calling it a new intifada, but from  President Reuven Rivlin down it is being acknowledged that there is a wave of  attacks that is not the isolated efforts of “lone wolves.” These deadly assaults  seem to be well planned and they are being carried out against the backdrop of  sickening incitement.How is the world dealing with all this? Well, the  United Nations Humans Rights Council, as usual, has been busy bashing Israel for  “possible war crimes.”The UNHRC on Monday held a meeting on its report  into last summer’s war in Gaza, the war that was triggered by a chain of events  starting with the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teens, whose deaths did  not apparently warrant a UN investigation, and culminating in 51 days of  fighting. I wrote about the UNHRC probe last week: Suffice it to say my  conclusions are very different from those of the panel originally led by William  Schabas and later by Mary McGowan Davis.Like most Israelis, I believe  the casualties, on both sides, were the result of Hamas aggression and could  have been prevented had Hamas not launched some 5,000 rockets on Israel or had  abided by cease-fire agreements.Dropping all pretense of impartiality, a  joint delegation of the International Federation of Journalists and the  Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate, composed of IFJ President Jim Boumelha, PJS  President Abdalnasser Najjar and Vice President Naser Abubaker, took part in the  debate on the report in Geneva.The IFJ and PJS joint statement claimed  that Palestinian journalists and media premises were deliberately targeted by  the IDF during Operation Protective Edge, resulting, according to their figures,  in the deaths of 19 journalists and “over 350 injured.”The accusations  were the last straw for Haim Shibi, a board member (as am I) of the Jerusalem  Association of Journalists, who wrote an op-ed asking, rhetorically, whether  Boumelha had contacted Israeli journalists or officials before taking the side  of Hamas and accepting its casualty figures.Boumelha, who has refused  the JAJ’s offers to set up a hotline and other moves to professionally assist  the Palestinian media, is also behind the effort to oust Israel from the IFJ  (using the pretext of an argument over owed membership fees). “Now, alongside  the Palestinians, the Mediterranean branch of the IFJ includes such luminaries  of human rights – and press freedom in particular – as Iran, Iraq and Yemen.  Israel’s out,” wrote Shibi, adding that as long as Boumelha heads the  organization, that’s not a bad thing. (On a positive note, Shibi points out that  at a recent meeting of the European Federation of Journalists that he attended a  motion condemning Israel was rejected.) I DON’T want to give too much credit to  the “flotilla” that set sail from Sweden to save Gaza. Among the passengers was  former Tunisian president Moncef Marzouki, who obviously has a lot of spare time  and very strange priorities if his primary concern today is what’s going on in  Gaza.As the Israeli Navy towed the intercepted Marianne av Göteborg into  Ashdod Port, the Prime Minister’s Office issued a sarcastic statement welcoming  them to Israel and saying that they apparently got lost. “Perhaps you meant to  set sail for a place not far from here – Syria. There the Assad regime is  slaughtering its own people every day with the support of the murderous regime  in Iran.”The letter also noted that some 800 trucks a day pass from  Israel to Gaza and that since last summer’s operation Israel has transferred  more than 1.5 million tons of humanitarian aid into the Strip. The bloodbath in  Sinai reflected the reason that Egypt prefers to keep its Gazan crossing closed  (without being internationally vilified). Apart from Salafist attacks, President  Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s government is particularly prone to attack by Hamas, an  offshoot of Egypt’s outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.The flotilla  participants hadn’t so much lost their way as lost their moral  compass.This was a deliberate attempt not to deliver aid but to provoke  another international incident like the Mavi Marmara affair five years ago which  could be used to portray Israel, and Israel alone, as responsible for all the  evil in the world.In my search for former contacts, I realized that  there’s a party going on that I haven’t been invited to. It is strangely a  relief. Under the auspices of the United Nations’ Committee on the Exercise of  the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People – whose name says it all – a  conference has been taking place in Moscow this week, billed as a “meeting in  support of Israeli-Palestinian peace.”In the past, I attended similar  conferences in Moscow and in Vienna before turning down an invitation to a  meeting in Brazil. I couldn’t face the hateful anti-Israel rhetoric again, even  in a pleasant venue on a trip paid for by the UN.I think peace would  have a much better chance of growing were the Arab World and the Palestinians to  permit normalization, drop the incitement, and fight terrorism – even when it’s  aimed at Israeli and Jewish targets.To a large extent, the Palestinians  have already set up two independent states. The one in the West Bank – like  neighboring Israel, Jordan and Egypt – is wary of the precedent of the one in  Gaza.Ten years ago, Israel unilaterally pulled out, only to be followed  by Kassam and Grad rockets in an ever-growing radius of terror.My former  contacts there, being affiliated with Fatah, apparently ran from Hamas when it  took over shortly after the Israelis left.All the “peace flotillas” in  the world will not turn the beautiful Gazan beaches into a tourist resort with a  thriving economy as long as jihadist terrorism is allowed to thrive. Look  at Tunisia.And instead of being part of the solution, sadly the United  Nations is part of the problem.According to the press release issued on  the July 1 gathering in Moscow, MK Ahmad Tibi predictably accused Israel of  ever-increasing apartheid policies and “commended all states, businesses and  organizations that supported the movement to boycott Israel.” I note his own  boycott doesn’t stretch to giving up his well-paid Israeli parliamentary  position and perks.Vitaly Naumkin, director of the Institute of Oriental  Studies in Moscow, told the UN gathering that “Israel’s continued occupation of  Palestine” was exploited by extremist terrorist groups – notably ISIL/ISIS – to  recruit more youth.The UN needs to recognize the true nature of jihadist  terrorism in order to deal with it.The last thing the world needs is to  divert more attention and funds on obsessively fault-finding Israel, blaming it  even for the rise of the Islamic State. The UN should make sure human rights  everywhere are inalienable.

<title>No Holds Bared: Kerry’s broken moral compass</title>
<date>15/10/2015</date>
<content>
John Kerry’s comments about the recent wave of terrorist attacks spreading  across the State of Israel are contemptible.In response to the spate of  murders of Jews, Kerry attempted to diagnose the cause by stating, “There’s been  a massive increase in settlements over the course of the last years and there’s  an increase in the violence because there’s this frustration that’s  growing.”




This is an astonishing justification for cold-blooded murder of  Israeli men, women and children. John Kerry is offering excuses for the  terrorists and blaming the victims with these malignant words. This isn’t the  first time he has made such outrageous comments with regards to Israel and his  reasoning and logic reveal how broken his moral compass has  become.Kerry’s unfair and unjustified explanations don’t target only  Israel. He has never apologized for the false and overstated accusations that he  made during the Vietnam War against his comrades-in-arms. His slander included  painting them as ravaging hordes in Genghis Khan’s army, using the actions of a  few to broadly tarnish the heroism of the American military.Kerry’s  unfair bias and warped perspectives against the State of Israel have surfaced  repeatedly in recent years.In February 2014, Kerry warned that if Israel  did not make peace with the Palestinians, it would have to face the “increasing  delegitimization campaign that has been building up. People are very sensitive  to it. There are talk of boycotts and other kinds of things.”Abe Foxman  of the Anti-Defamation League slammed these comments. “Describing the potential  for expanded boycotts of Israel,” Foxman wrote, “makes it more, not less, likely  that the talks will not succeed; makes it more, not less, likely that Israel  will be blamed if the talks fail; and more, not less, likely that boycotts will  ensue.”Only two months later, Kerry said in a closed-door meeting, “A  two-state solution will be clearly underscored as the only real alternative.  Because a unitary state winds up either being an apartheid state with  second-class citizens – or it ends up being a state that destroys the capacity  of Israel to be a Jewish state.”He later tried apologizing for using the  word “apartheid,” but the genie was out of the bottle. That word has very  specific connotations and implications in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and  the fact he could even utter the word is very telling as to utter ignorance of  Israel’s thriving democracy.Then a mere two months after that statement  Kerry once again helped to harm Israel when he was captured on a Fox News  microphone criticizing an Israeli air strike. Without even knowing all the  facts, and notwithstanding Israel’s painstaking efforts to avoid civilians and  warn them about impending strikes against terrorist targets, Kerry still had the  audacity to offer sarcastic commentary by stating, “It's a hell of a pinpoint  operation,” again repeating, “It's a hell of a pinpoint operation.” Clearly,  Kerry had a problem with Israel even though they were doing everything in their  power to avoid Palestinian civilian casualties while trying to stop the more  than 14,000 rockets fired by Hamas from Gaza at Israel.Kerry  conveniently failed to condemn the US last week when the military accidentally  bombed an Afghanistan hospital, killing women and children in the process. Is  that a “hell of a pinpoint operation” too? Or does that standard only apply to  Israel? Now Kerry has again expressed a disturbingly amoral perspective on the  Palestinian-Israeli conflict and where the blame belongs. Does he really think  that settlements are the root cause of cold-blooded killers stabbing women and  children? Or that building houses is what causes terrorists to drive their cars  into groups of pedestrians, then exit the vehicle and begin hacking to death the  injured as they struggle to crawl away? Does he remember what happened in Gaza?  How Israel took the advice of international experts and did everything the world  asked them to by withdrawing completely from Gaza? How Israel literally removed  all 8,500 Israeli citizens from their homes in Gaza before evacuating every  single soldier from the area? Gaza at that moment became, in effect, an  independent Palestinian state. It could have become the Singapore of the  West.Instead, the Palestinians, in their first and only free democratic  election, voted the genocidal Hamas organization into power.Hamas then  took over the Gaza Strip, killing and imprisoning their Palestinian Authority  opponents, and proceeded to blast thousands of rockets into  Israel.Israel was then forced to defend itself, and the same experts and  world leaders who told Israel to leave Gaza now condemned the Jewish state for  simply trying to protect their families from being killed.Now Kerry is  calling for a Palestinian state in the West Bank.Everyone knows that the  Palestinian Authority is corrupt and weak, and if it weren’t being propped up by  Israel and by the billions of dollars of international donations that it mostly  embezzles, Hamas would overthrow the PA in a matter of days and repeat its Gaza  formula in the West Bank, firing untold numbers of missiles at Israel. This  inevitable scenario would force the closure of Israel’s international airport  and effectively shut down the country. Israel would then be forced to respond  with strikes that would lead to a war many times the size of the Gaza conflict.  And what would happen? The very same John Kerry and many of his world leader  colleagues would muster up their hypocritical righteous indignation and condemn  Israel once again.Kerry has also somehow managed throughout his long  political career to avoid criticizing or even making mention of the fact that  Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has officials who not only call  for the spilling of Jewish blood, but also for the genocide of all Jews on  Earth. One video documents the grand mufti of Jerusalem – a top religious cleric  appointed by Abbas himself – speaking at an official Palestinian Authority event  where he calls for the murder of every living Jew.Has Kerry every  condemned this? Has he condemned Hamas’s genocidal chants and daily calls for  the killing of all Jews? Has Kerry said anything to condemn Iran’s threats to  destroy Israel and commit genocide against the Jews in Israel? Not a  peep.What kind of leadership is this? What has happened to Kerry’s moral  compass? North is south and east is west for him.When Jews are being  hacked to death and radicals are contemplating whether to launch the next  attack, Kerry’s words are extremely destructive.
Kerry owes an apology to  the Jews of Israel to the American people he represents for choosing to justify  the murderous attacks committed by radical totalitarian Islamist terrorists  against innocent men, women and children.

<title>No Holds Barred: Farcical objections to Bibi’s speech to Congress</title>
<date>12/2/2015</date>
<content>
To call it ironic would be an  understatement.A president of the United States says at a press  conference with the chancellor of Germany, a nation that slaughtered six million  Jews 70 years ago, that he will not meet the prime minister of Israel to discuss  Iranian nuclear annihilatory threats because it would interfere with Israeli  democracy.




Now, it would be nice if President Barack Obama were more  generally caring about democracy and not just when it becomes a pretext to snub  the Israeli prime minister.I did not see the president stand up for  democracy when he recently met with the unelected king of Jordan.I did  not see him stand up for democracy when two weeks ago he traveled to Saudi  Arabia to pay his respects upon the death of the autocrat and arch-misogynist  King Abdullah.I did not see the president care much for democracy when  he decided to renew relations with Cuba, with the Castro brothers’ continuing to  run the country as a private fief.I did not see the president stand up  for democracy in his many meetings with Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who –  having already banned Twitter and YouTube – further entrenches himself as a  dictator with every passing day.And I did not see the president bring up  democracy upon his innumerable meetings with Vladimir Putin, the new czar of  Russia.No, it seems that only when it comes to Israel and Benjamin  Netanyahu does the president suddenly recall his democratic  principles.But at least the president has an honest pretext as to why he  will not meet with Netanyahu and why he dislikes him. Netanyahu plans to get up  in front of Congress and say the emperor has no clothes. That the president’s  Iran policy is dangerous and has failed.The talks with Iran have led to  the unfreezing of hundreds of millions of dollars for the mullahs while they  have barely dismantled even a bit of their nuclear program. And they talks are  never-ending and always extended.If the stakes were not so great – if  this weren’t an existential threat to Israel’s survival – then perhaps it would  have been best for Netanyahu to bite his lip. But given the choice between  offending an American leader and rolling the dice on Iran carrying out its  stated intention of wiping Israel off the map, the prime minister is right to  speak up.Perhaps it’s providential that the prime minister will be  speaking the day before Purim with its ancient story of Esther being presented  with a choice of popularity with the king or speaking up for her  people.But what pretext do the Anti-Defamation League’s Abraham Foxman  and the Union for Reform Judaism’s Rabbi Rick Jacobs have to publicly come out  against the prime minister’s speech? The ADL’s mandate is to fight  anti-Semitism.How does publicly upbraiding the prime minister for  wanting to address the congressional leadership on the Iranian nuclear threat  fulfill that mission? Abe Foxman has given decades of his life to the Jewish  people and is about to retire. I salute his courage and leadership. He commands  respect. But he more than most is well aware that Iran is the single greatest  threat to Jewish life on planet Earth. And Iran’s threats aren’t mere words.  They come from a government that is the world’s foremost sponsor of terrorism,  particularly against Jews. Would the head of the ADL really tell Israel’s  elected leader to turn down an opportunity to address the parliament of the most  powerful nation on earth about its greatest single threat? As for Rick Jacobs,  his public condemnation of the Netanyahu speech as “a bad idea” begs the  question of what would constitute a better idea in its place. Should Netanyahu  be silent and allow the American-led negotiations to drag out endlessly? What  makes no sense to me is how all this criticism comes as a result of not wanting  to offend President Obama.America is a democracy. The president gets  offended every single day. It’s countries such as Turkey, Russia and Cuba where  the leader never suffers offense.Did President Obama himself not just  offend the leaders of China by publicly welcoming and acknowledging the Dalai  Lama at the National Prayer Breakfast? Truth be told, I believe President Obama  should have given more offense to the leaders of Saudi Arabia when he visited  the country last month. He should have offended them by decrying their record on  human rights and the treatment of women. Indeed, a culture of offense is central  to democratic institutions just as a culture of deference is central to  one-party states.In 1953, president Harry Truman fired America’s  greatest general and war hero, Douglas MacArthur, for insubordination in Korea.  But Congress invited MacArthur to address a joint session in April 1951. It  would become one of the most famous speeches of the 20th century, bearing the  famous line: “Old soldiers never die; they just fade away.” I bet the  congressional leadership understood just what an insult it was to the president  to invite the man he’d just publicly fired. But as an independent branch of  government, they did it anyway.Truman survived and went on to become one  of the most distinguished presidents of the 20th century.I just finished  reading Lawrence Wright’s book Thirteen Days in September: Carter, Begin, and  Sadat at Camp David with its inside account of the Camp David Accords of 1978.  The book lays out Menachem Begin’s reasoning for giving Egypt the entire Sinai  Peninsula for a peace deal. Begin believed that returning any land would only  reward Egypt for its repeated aggression. Why, then, did he do the deal? Because  he believed that it would strengthen his relationship with Jimmy Carter and win  the president over as a friend to Israel. Well, we all know how that  turned out.Despite Israel having given away a land mass three times its  entire size and which it had won in a defensive war, Carter still became the  single biggest critic of Israel on the Western stage, going so far as to libel  Israel with the preposterous charge of apartheid. And his criticism never  abates. The lesson: Don’t cut deals to make friends. On the contrary, an  agreement should be signed only based on its ability to bring about real  peace.Does anyone truly believe that if Netanyahu were to cancel this  speech it would improve his standing in Obama’s eyes? President Obama seems to  want what Netanyahu cannot deliver, namely, a small Middle Eastern client nation  that takes orders from the United States and allows American policy to dictate  its security policy. But even if Obama’s policies were sound – and on Iran they  most definitely are not – this undermines the very idea of a sovereign Jewish  state.US Jews of every stripe – Republicans and Democrats – must be  grateful to President Obama for all he has done to strengthen Israel’s security  with increased military and intelligence cooperation between Israel and the  United States. And we must be equally grateful to the Republican Party for the  courageous decision to invite the prime minister to present his plan to prevent  Iran from carrying out its stated intention of perpetrating yet another genocide  of the Jews.

<title>No Holds Barred: Miriam and Sheldon Adelson's fight against BDS</title>
<date>8/6/2015</date>
<content>
The participants in the anti-BDS conference in Las Vegas this past weekend  witnessed a memorable spectacle. Here was Dr. Miriam and Sheldon Adelson, a  couple ranked among the 20 wealthiest in the world, sitting for two days through  50 presentations of organizations committed to fighting for Israel both on and  off campus. Sitting alongside them and not missing a session were Haim Saban and  his wife Cheryl. The sight of some of the world’s most influential Jews totally  dedicated to fighting Israel’s enemies was inspiring. The attacks that followed  from people like J Street president Jeremy Ben-Ami – who attacked me alongside  them – were revolting and beneath contempt. But we have come to expect such  hatred from J Street toward Israel’s defenders rather than its  enemies.




In my presentation at the conference I noted the old joke about  the professor who was asked what was worse, ignorance or apathy. To which he  replied, “I don’t know and I don’t care.” The Vegas conference took a giant step  toward ending both the ignorance and apathy that has allowed BDS (the Boycotts,  Divestment and Sanctions movement) to grow.When I took to the stage  Friday morning, I began by telling the crowd that there was a blessing in BDS.  For the first time, I argued, a challenge has come forth to bring American  Jewish youth into the ring, and demand they stand as Maccabees in Israel’s  defense. It’s no longer just Israelis age 18-21 who have to battle for Israel’s  survival.American Jewish youth have joined the fight.Hillel’s  excellent past president Richard Joel famously coined the Hillel phrase “Do  Jewish.” But in the age of BDS, every Jewish student has now been forced to  “Choose Jewish.” The BDS assault to destroy Israel and make it a pariah state  has raised the stakes and drawn the battle lines more clearly than ever before.  Sitting on the fence is, today, no longer an option.I further offered  the definition of a Maccabee: a Maccabee is an individual who will fight against  all odds in the firm belief that he can change the course of history. The  Maccabee trusts in the sacred words of the great Martin Luther King, who  famously said, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward  justice.” The Maccabee is unfazed by a superior enemy, and unintimidated by a  protracted, uphill struggle. He knows that it is not numbers but courage that  counts. After all, he knows with certainty that, in the end, history will submit  to the justice of his cause.A few years back, I heard legendary Apple  Macintosh evangelist Guy Kawasaki say that, at its inception, Apple employed  counterintuitive marketing: from the outset they sought to polarize and  bifurcate their audience. In essence, they were unafraid of factionalizing the  public into those who would love them and those who would not.It’s a  lesson that some of the big Jewish student groups who are reluctant to stand up  for Israel on campus have to learn. Don’t be afraid of being controversial. Drop  the argument that if you stand up for Israel you’ll alienate left-leaning Jewish  students who might not stop by for chicken soup on a Friday night. To the  contrary. Courage is courageous. They will be inspired by your example and will  follow your lead.I often hear myself described as “controversial.” No  doubt I am a rabbi who is both loved and hated. A preparedness to be unpopular  is what I have learned from Judaism, not to mention the world’s most influential  figures. No one experiences greater rejection by the Israelites than Moses, the  great prophet who redeemed them from slavery and gave them the Law. Mordechai  spares the Jews a holocaust but is described as being admired only by “most of  his brethren.” The Lubavitcher Rebbe saved the Jewish people from spiritual  extinction yet even today his legacy remains “controversial.” No American was  more hated in his lifetime than Abraham Lincoln, our greatest president, and  Winston Churchill was fired by the British right after defeating Hitler. But  each of these men saved their nations from extinction. And Jews today must fight  to save Israel from destruction, even if it makes them controversial.And  make no mistake – BDS seeks nothing other than economic annihilation of Israel.  As I’ve said many times, BDS is not about opposing occupation. If it were then  none of its proponents would ever use an iPhone since China has been occupying  Tibet since 1951, and they would never have a Turkish coffee since Turkey has  been occupying Cyprus since 1974. Nor would they drink Stolichnaya since it’s  made in Russia, which is occupying Crimea.Less so is BDS about  Palestinian rights. If it were, it would be boycotting Egyptian cotton over the  destruction of hundreds of Palestinian homes on the Gaza border last October to  stop Hamas from smuggling weapons.BDS has no interest in protecting Arab  life. If it did it would be boycotting the Assad regime for murdering 200,000  Arabs.The truth is, it’s about none of those things, and holds no values  except anti-Semitism and no goals except Israel’s economic strangulation. As  such, it cannot be fought through passive means.Many well-meaning  pro-Israel activists believe we can fight BDS by pointing to Israel’s nice and  cuddly side.They show the world statistics proving how much Israel  recycles and show photographs of Israel’s friendly restaurant scene.  Unfortunately, it won’t work. South Africa also tried to show off a nice side,  including the world’s first heart-transplant. But nobody cared. All anyone did  care about was that South Africa was a racist, apartheid  regime.Israel-haters like Omar Barghouti, co-founder of BDS, want to  falsely compare democratic and just Israel to apartheid South Africa; a vile,  fraudulent comparison of a racist regime to the Middle East’s only democracy and  the only place in the region where Arabs enjoy full human rights. The only way  to fight Barghouti and those like him is to attack their credibility and point  out their rancid lies.Barghouti, for example, is both a hypocrite and a  fraud.Even as he calls for an academic boycott of Israel, Barghouti  earned a masters degree from Tel Aviv University, and is currently a doctoral  student at the same institution.In effect, he is boycotting his  professors, his peers and even himself.Though 184,000 people signed a  petition calling on the school to expel him, Tel Aviv University has refused to  eject a student on political grounds. That speaks volumes about Israeli justice  and righteousness. Yet Omar Barghouti wants every Israeli academic to be ejected  from the academic world due his despicable hatred of Israel.Barghouti  was low enough to say that Israeli security checkpoints, designed to prevent  Jews from being blown to smithereens by Islamic terrorists, are “reminiscent of  common Nazi practices against the Jews.” To Barghouti’s nauseating morality,  opening the trunk of a car is similar to forcing a child into a gas  chamber.Leaving no stone unturned, Barghouti compares Israeli policy to  South African apartheid, even as he receives treatment equal to that of any  Israeli citizen, including subsidized higher education and the unrestrained  right of freedom of speech.It is time to take Israel out of the  defendants’ dock. It’s time for the Jewish community to embrace its own BDS,  being Bold, Decisive and Strong in the defense of the Jewish state.Sure,  some will accuse us of playing rough. Some will always favor a softer, more  agreeable stance.But to them, we must respond: if controversy is an  inevitable outcome of an effective campaign to defend the Jewish state, then it  is one we must embrace.

<title>No holds barred: Moving past Chabad’s reluctance on Zionism to fight BDS</title>
<date>16/7/2015</date>
<content>
With the global assault  on Israel concentrated on the world’s campuses, Chabad now faces a dilemma: Will  it rise to the occasion and defend Israel or will it see its primary mission as  spreading Judaism to the exclusion of protecting the Jewish state.The  two are not the same. The former assumes a risk of being seen as political and  Zionist. It also risks alienating left-leaning Jewish students – and there are  plenty of those at universities – who are unsympathetic to the Jewish  state.




Many Chabad emissaries have told me defending Israel gets in the  way of their core mission of serving as a home away from home for Jewish  students. For many, Israel is just too toxic.
And yet, Israel is, after  all, the Jewish state. And Chabad loves all things Jewish.As for  Chabad’s tortured relationship with Zionism, most of that is related to the  previous rebbe, Rabbi Joseph Isaac’s opposition to Israel being portrayed as a  secular replacement for the Jewish faith.Many would argue things have  changed substantially, with 60 percent of Israel’s officer corps now sporting  kippot and the die-hard secularism of Israel taking a backseat to the  significant rise of observance among the population.Chabad, along with  Hillel, is the best organization posed to lead the fight for Israel on campus.  But it requires a shift in thinking. Chabad wants students to embrace their  tradition. Few things are more important. But that commitment will falter  without Jewish pride, and the great test of Jewish pride today is the degree to  which we stand up for and defend the first Jewish state in 2,000  years.Chabad today is truly international, operating even more outposts  than the United States government. Chabad is not only the world’s largest Jewish  educational network, it is quite simply one of the world’s largest networks  period. Perhaps only the Catholic Church has a more extensive grid of schools  and educational outposts. Yet, for all its internationalism Chabad continues to  evince a largely parochial mentality. It is global in scope but not in  outlook.Indeed, Chabad’s continued insularity – wholly insistent on  spreading Jewish observance exclusively to Jews as opposed to having Jewish  ideas and values permeate the wider culture – is surprising and contradictory  given the rebbe’s universalist vision of a Messianic future. No Jewish religious  leader in modern times has thought so broadly or so grandly.The mind  labors to wrap itself around the breadth and scope of a personality who  envisioned reshaping human history and nature as we know it. Yet Chabad often  ignores the broader implications of the rebbe’s vision in favor of  bricks-and-mortar activism that is geared almost entirely to local provinces and  communities.Jewish internationalism is today embodied in the State of  Israel, the entity that has literally given the Jews a place among the  nations.Many in Chabad maintain that the movement’s global reach is  proof that it has embraced the rebbe’s international vision. But a truer  evaluation would have us conclude that Chabad’s expansion has been almost  entirely horizontal rather than vertical. Chabad has opened countless centers in  innumerable places.But it has penetrated more of the Jewish community  and not sought to influence the non-Jewish world.People come to Chabad  for its schools, its menorah lightings, its communal Seders, and inspiring  social programs like Friendship Circle. They rely on Chabad for summer camps for  kids and Torah classes for adults. What they do not do is come to Chabad for  answers as to why Israel is not an apartheid state, why Israel’s response to  rockets and attacks is proportionate and essential, or why Judea and Samaria are  an integral part of Jewish history from ancient times.Now, with Chabad  operating hundreds of centers on campuses throughout the world, it can take the  lead along with Hillel in being the global front line for Israel’s defense among  the young. Fixing this glaring omission is easier than one might  suppose.Most Chabad emissaries’ kids study together via an online  school. It can be easily redeployed to give Chabad emissaries the necessary  information to respond to the Israel-haters on campus and the training to  organize large-scale pro-Israel events that educate student minds as to the  righteousness of the Jewish state.Every global movement has an  international hub where the spokes of the wheel meet. Catholics have the  Vatican, the Muslims Mecca, and even the Mormons, who have experienced the kind  of spectacular growth reminiscent of Chabad, have endeavored to transform Salt  Lake City – once a sleepy desert colony – into a global pivot with the world’s  largest indoor conference center, seating 21,000.But Crown Heights, for  all its undeniable energy and excitement, remains but a section of Brooklyn with  a large, unadorned – some would say worn – central synagogue that appeals almost  exclusively to Lubavitchers. Even on Simchat Torah, its premiere annual event,  you will see only a handful of non-Chabad faces at 770.And as far as the  emissaries are concerned, Crown Heights is highlighted but once a year at the  Kinus gathering.It should be the priority of Chabad international to  build in Crown Heights a museum for the proper understanding of the Arab-Israeli  conflict and a center to educate future leaders how to be Israel warriors on  campus.A media network should be attached to the center that brings  experts on Israel to respond to the lies told every day about the Jewish state.  Just imagine what Chabad could achieve if its emissaries collaborated with a  central organ, a boiler-room think tank, focused on responding to the never-  ending lies about Israel.When I was at Oxford I was amazed at the power  and reach of the Oxford Union.Founded by students in 1823, it leveraged  the fame of the university to attract, as well as cultivate, world leaders whose  participation transformed the union into the world’s most famous debating  chamber. I used the union as my own model for creating the Oxford L’Chaim  Society, which similarly focused on world personalities, but this time lecturing  on the justice of Israel’s cause.Chabad is eminently capable of doing  the same in Crown Heights. Already, Brooklyn is being gentrified and becoming a  hub of young and highly educated professionals.Crown Heights is part of  New York City, the world’s financial, diplomatic, and media capitol. Crown  Heights is headquarters of the world’s most influential Jewish organization, and  Jews are news. With a little vision Crown Heights can emerge as a leading  American center for Israel defense with a broad global network of on-campus  activists who fight on the front line.Many will argue that a focus on  Israel has never been Chabad’s forte. I disagree.The Jewish people is  Chabad’s focus. No organization shows more Ahavat Yisrael, love for fellow Jews,  than Chabad. And right now six million Jews living in Israel face a global  threat from a cesspit of hatred directed toward them.Chabad should be  leading their defense.The writer served as the Chabad emissary at Oxford  University from 1988 to 1999.He has just published The Israel Warrior’s  Handbook.

<title>No holds barred: Please Peter, please don’t punish us</title>
<date>23/3/2015</date>
<content>
Last week in his worst anti-Israel rant to  date, Peter Beinart demanded that Israel be punished for electing Benjamin  Netanyahu. Those stubborn, stiffnecked Jews did it again, electing a candidate  not approved by Peter Beinart.The Jews must pay the price. How? “It  means pushing the Obama administration to present out its own peace plan, and to  punish – yes, punish – the Israeli government for rejecting it. It means making  sure that every time Benjamin Netanyahu and the members of his cabinet walk into  a Jewish event outside Israel, they see Diaspora Jews protesting outside. It  means loving Israel more than ever, and opposing its government more than ever.  It means accepting that, for now at least, the peace process is over and the  pressure process must begin.”

 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}
So much for Peter Beinart believing in  democracy. Israel voted wrong. It’s time for the Jewish state to be  slammed.There is much I can write about Peter, whom I have known since  my days as rabbi at Oxford. I could point out his double standards, demanding  that all Israeli goods from Judea and Samaria be boycotted, while he still uses  an iPhone even though China, where it was made, has occupied Tibet since 1950, a  fact I pointed out in my debate with Peter at Columbia.I could point out  that in his Haaretz column Peter seems to have finally lost it, producing his  worst piece of writing – sophomoric drivel – and sounding like he has taken  leave of his senses as he fulminates against the dumb Israelis who were not  smart enough to vote as Peter would. And I could point out the lunacy of Peter  now demanding “denying visas to, and freezing the assets of, Naftali Bennett and  other pro-settler leaders” as if they were terrorist leaders.But I’d  rather do something else.I want to write a plea to my old friend Peter  Beinart not to punish Israel.Please Peter. Please, don’t punish the  Jews.We know we’ve been naughty. We know that we’re racist, apartheid  practitioners who have “wielded brutal, undemocratic, unjust power over millions  of human beings in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.” We know that we’re terrible  people.But is there any way you can find it in your heart not to punish  us? Can we not beg of you to be long-suffering and have your mercy overcome your  justice? Did you not write, Peter, how much you love us, even as you hate us?  Don’t get me wrong, Peter. We know you’re right. We know that rather than Hamas  being punished for using children as human shields and firing 10,000 rockets  into Israeli cities, it’s the Jews who are wicked.WE KNOW that rather  than President Barack Obama carrying out his promise to punish Bashar Assad for  gassing thousands of Arab children, it’s democratic Israel who ought to be  disciplined. We know that rather than Saudi Arabia who beheads people and treats  women like chattel, it is Israel, with its free and open society and complete  equality for women, that deserves to be castigated.But can’t you find it  in your heart, Peter, to forgive us just this once, even if we don’t deserve it?  I take your point. Rather than calling on Turkey to be punished for occupying  Cyprus since 1974, or asking the United Nations to pass a single resolution  condemning Russia for its occupation of Crimea, which it has yet to do, it’s we  Jews who need to be shown who’s boss.You’re the boss, Peter. You can  hurt us.We tremble and quake at your anger. So please spare us so that  we Jews – brutal and racist as we are – can learn some of your empathy, love and  compassion.We want to be like you, Peter. You’re our hero. You are so  fine, so excellent, so, er, special. So please give us a chance.We  regret voting for Netanyahu. We didn’t know it would upset you so. Had we known  we wouldn’t have done it.Promise. Next time, might I suggest that you  please publish a column in Haaretz telling the Israelis for whom they should  vote so we don’t get into this sticky mess again.We live to please  you.As far as your threat, Peter, to have demonstrations against  Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders when they visit the US, please, please  don’t. It would be awful to see you standing in the rain outside the AIPAC  conference with the Neturei Karta guys and Students for Justice in Palestine  while 16,000 Jews are inside listening to Netanyahu. It would break my heart to  see you in the cold, holding that sign with the other people, inflicting your  punishment against Israel.Look upon us Jews, Peter, the way you would  look upon errant children.We lack your level of education. We don’t have  the broadness of your heart.Indeed, just so that we don’t piss you off  in the future, I move to abolish all elections in Israel, just in case we get it  wrong.We can make you emperor of the Jews, Peter, and my, how glorious  it would be, to have someone so unafraid to stand up to racist Israel as you to  rule over us.For now, until you accept, we can only dream.The  author, “America’s rabbi,” whom Newsweek and The Washington Post call “the most  famous rabbi in America,” is an award-winning columnist and the international  best-selling author of 30 books, including his most recent, Kosher  Lust.

<title>No Holds Barred: The Oxford debates on Israel</title>
<date>23/11/2015</date>
<content>
I’m on my way back to Oxford for another debate  this week. It’s become a regular pilgrimage back to the university where I  served as rabbi for 11 years and had, as presidents of our student society,  among others Ambassador Ron Dermer and Senator Cory Booker. At the General  Assembly in Washington, DC, last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke  about the two times that we hosted him at the university.Last year I  took my close friend Dennis Prager to the Union for a debate on Israel and  Hamas. It was easily the most hard-fought debate on Israel I have ever  participated in. It was ferocious, exhilarating, vicious, electrifying and  disturbing. The video of the debate has gone viral.




When I first called  Dennis, the celebrated radio host, to join me at the Oxford Union for their  premier Middle East debate of the season, Dennis was at first reluctant to come.  He has to broadcast his national show every day.I told him it was a  once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to defend Israel at the world’s most prestigious  debating society. Europe was turning against Israel. Oxford was the world’s most  famous university, educating future world leaders. The scars to Israel’s  reputation from the war in Gaza was still fresh. Now was the time. He agreed to  come.Dennis, like me, is a veteran of debates on Israel.But I  informed him that nothing could prepare him for the ferocity of the attacks on  Israel that we were likely to endure.Indeed, as the debate began before  a capacity audience, Dennis seemed stunned at what was being said. Israel is an  apartheid regime. Israel is slaughtering the Palestinians and is guilty of  genocide. Israel is doing to the Palestinians exactly what the Nazis did to the  Jews. What the Jews experienced in the Holocaust is exactly what the  Palestinians are enduring at Israel’s hand. Israel in its six-decade history has  had one goal: the theft of Palestinian land and the eradication of the  Palestinian people.America is like Islamic State (IS). IS beheads only a  few prisoners, but America annihilates innocents in Pakistan each and every day  with drone strikes. There is no real difference. Israel is guilty of war crimes.  Israel’s security fence is an apartheid wall that is built mostly through the  gardens and property of innocent Palestinians. Hamas does some bad things, but  it’s all Israel’s fault. Hamas is a bona fide resistance movement to Israel’s  occupation.Terrorism directed at Israelis is an organic response to  Israeli colonial rule.Many of the arguments came from world-renowned  Israeli academic Avi Shlaim, with whom I ironically always had a warm  relationship in the 11 years I served as rabbi to the students at Oxford. The  other arguments came from Kate Brooks, a highly intelligent female Oxford  doctoral candidate, with whom I interacted warmly at the pre-debate dinner, and  from Mishana Housseinioun a Berkeley-Oxford female professor. The rest of the  attacks came from Oxford students in the floor debate segment of the  program.I had heard all these things before. But never from some of the  most highly educated people in Europe. And never with such ferocity and  vehemence.Dennis and I fought back with equal ferocity. Hamas is a  genocidal organization that proudly touts its charter calling on the  annihilation of Jews utterly unconnected to any conflict. It seeks the murder of  all Jews, including those sitting in the Oxford Union chamber. It aids and abets  honor killings of Palestinian women, shoots gay Palestinians in the head on  false charges of collaboration, machine-guns all Palestinian protesters who dare  to defy its rule, violently punishes any form of criticism, engages in daily  forms of deadly incitement against Jews, celebrates when Westerners, including  in Britain, are blown up by bombs, ended any vestige of democratic rule once it  was elected and builds its military installations under hospitals and nurseries  so that the infirm and the vulnerable can serve as human shields to its cowardly  terrorists.Israel has tried since its creation to make peace with Arab  states and has endangered its security with repeated territorial concessions  that were met with nothing but terrorist attacks. Arabs in Israel live with  greater freedoms and human rights than any Muslim country on earth.There  is no excuse for terrorism. Jews even under the horrors of Hitler didn’t turn to  blowing up German children.The justifications for terrorism that were  being offered were an affront and an abomination to Islam which, just like  Judaism, abides by the commandment not to murder.The debate was  electrifying and deeply felt on all sides.Rather than being dispirited,  the small but defiant pro-Israel lobby that sat behind Dennis and me threw a  barrage of “points of information” at the Israeli-attacking  academics.When the debate was over the president of the Union invited  all to drinks. I sat with my opponents. I discussed their trips to Israel. The  wounds of the debate were raw but the Union tradition is one of courtesy and  mutual respect, whatever the disagreements.And rather than feel  dispirited, I was energized and alive. We defiantly shared the truth of the  noble and majestic democracy that is the Jewish state of Israel. We struck a  blow for the Jewish state in an extraordinarily hostile environment.My  friend and arch-Israel critic Naomi Wolf was present at the debate, having just  given a lecture attacking Israel for human rights abuses three hours before. All  this was curious, given that Naomi had withdrawn from our planned debate on  Israel in New York with the excuse that she was going to speak at Oxford. She  never mentioned that we would be there on the exact same day.As soon as  the debate was over a group of students asked me for an immediate meeting, that  night, to start up the Oxford L’Chaim Society once again to defend the honor of  Israel.And to be fair to the Union, we were not jeered, interrupted, or  heckled. Amid the ferocious battle for Israel and the hundreds of students  poised against us, we made our case with passion and each side respected the  other’s right to speak. That’s why I love the Oxford Union, and why I did  countless joint events with the Union when I was rabbi in Oxford.I  believe with all my heart that Israel can and will win arguments in the  marketplace of ideas, and Alan Dershowitz just won an Oxford debate.I  look forward to the debate this week. Wish me luck and God’s blessing!The  author, “America’s rabbi,” is the international best-selling author of 30 books,  winner of The London Times Preacher of the Year Competition, and recipient of  the American Jewish Press Association’s Highest Award for Excellence in  Commentary.

<title>No Holds Barred: Will Iran deal expose Jewish political impotence?</title>
<date>27/7/2015</date>
<content>
There is near unanimity among Jewish organizations in the United States and  Israel’s Jewish citizens that the Obama deal with Iran is a catastrophe that  must be stopped. With the predictable exception of J Street, which never saw a  deal against Israel that it did not support, almost no Jewish organizations have  come out in support of the deal. Israeli opposition to the deal runs across the  entire political spectrum with the exception of the Arab parties.But  whatever transpires with the Iran deal, and we can only hope Congress will kill  it and demand something much tougher, it has laid rest the persistent myth of  Jewish control.




Here is an American president who received nearly 80  percent of the Jewish vote in his first presidential election and 70% in his  second. He received oodles of Jewish financial support and the backing of tons  of Jews in the media. But that did not add up to a hill of beans when it came to  negotiating with a government that swears it will kill six million Jews in  Israel, not to say anything of its promises of “Death to America.”No, my  friends, the Jews control absolutely nothing.The Iran deal has exposed  global Jewish impotence.We can’t even get Senator Chuck Schumer, the  Jewish senator from New York who has enjoyed tremendous Jewish backing, to come  out against the deal. We can’t persuade democratic Senators from states teeming  with Jewish constituents, like New Jersey, California and Connecticut, to fight  the deal, the exception being the courageous and outstanding Senator from New  Jersey, Robert Menendez.Faced with an existential threat against the  only Jewish state on earth, and the first in 2,000 years, the Jews can only go  begging to their elected representatives to curb President Barack Obama’s desire  for détente with Iran, which repeatedly commits itself to a second  Holocaust.Ah, that old over-roasted chestnut of Jews having global  dominion. If only even a smidgeon of it were true. As anyone can see, precisely  the opposite is true.The Jews remain the only group in the world that UN  member states can threaten to exterminate and be rewarded with the unfreezing of  billions of their assets for doing so. The Jewish state remains the only country  in the world which the global media can malign with impunity. And Israel is the  only country against whom boycotts are demanded on university campuses even as  it remains the Middle East’s only democracy.When it comes to Israel you  can recite any lie and get away with it.You can claim Israel doesn’t  want peace and omit the fact that the land ceded by Israel to the Palestinians  in peace deals has been transformed every time into terrorist enclaves. You can  portray Israel as indiscriminately bombing Gaza and omit the fact that Hamas is  a genocidal organization committed in its charter to Israel’s destruction and  the murder of Jews worldwide, firing thousands of rockets to achieve that  goal.You can portray Israel as having a partner for peace in the  Palestinian Authority and omit the fact that it’s a dictatorship run by Mahmoud  Abbas, who has not gone to elections in more than a decade.You can  praise Abbas as a man dedicated to the Palestinian people and omit the fact that  he runs a kleptocracy that has given him $100 million and his sons Tarik and  Yasser illegal control of the construction and cigarette trade, among other  lucrative industries.Like Jimmy Carter, you can call Israel an apartheid  state and omit the fact that Nelson Mandela was a true apostle of peace who  languished in jail for 27 years, while Yasser Arafat is the father of  international terrorism and made his name by blowing up Jewish  children.You can label Israel racist yet omit the fact that Arab  citizens of Israel enjoy more rights than Arabs anywhere in the Middle  East.You can portray Israel as bigoted against its Arab citizens and  omit the fact that Arabs serve at the highest levels of Israeli officialdom,  including the Supreme Court, something unthinkable in an apartheid regime. You  can omit the fact that Israeli hospitals treated Abbas’ wife and the daughter of  the current Hamas leader.You can lie and blame Israel for the wars in  the Middle East while omitting the fact that the single greatest threat to world  civilization today is not the Jews and the puny State of Israel but radical  Islamic terrorism which is producing monsters like Islamic State, Hamas, Al  Shabab and Boko Haram.You can continually compare Israel to pre-1994  South Africa even as it offends the brave black population of that beautiful  country, who are models of reconciliation and forgiveness.You can  portray the Jews as having a right to Israel only by virtue of being displaced  in Europe after the Holocaust while ignoring the fact that the Jews are the  indigenous people of Israel. It is not I that says so but the Christian Bible.  Read the New Testament and try and find mention of a single Arab resident of  ancient Israel. The Jews were the land’s inhabitants and they were displaced by  a European colonial occupier: Rome. They were forcibly removed from their land  and displaced for 2,000 years, while a small remnant always remained. The Jews  prayed thrice daily to return to their land. And when finally granted the  political opportunity, they came and drained the swamps, irrigated the sands and  made the land so much more inhabitable for their Arab brethren that had migrated  there in the interim.The Jews were happy to share the land but it was a  sentiment sadly rejected by the Arabs. They rejected the 1936 Peel Commission  Partition. The rejected the 1947 UN partition plan. They rejected Israel’s  offers to return all conquered 1967 lands with their famous three “No’s” in  Khartoum: No peace, No recognition, No negotiation. And they turned the Oslo  peace accords – which granted Arafat political autonomy over 95% of the  Palestinian population – into a murder-fest by launching a never-ending terror  war against Israel’s buses, schools and cafes.Rather than President  Obama demanding from the Iranians to stop the never-ending incitement against  the Jews and the promises to annihilate them, rather than objecting to the  rampant assassination of Iranian gay men by the mullahs, rather than demand that  Iran stop murdering democratic protesters in the street, our resident rushes to  conclude a nuclear deal with Iran without so much as consulting  Israel.But while President Obama’s actions demonstrate the political  powerlessness of America’s Jewish community, we can still appeal to the sense of  righteousness and justice that should motivate all our elected leaders,  especially in Congress.Congress can kill this deal. Not because Jews are  flexing political muscle, but because the Iranian regime are monsters while  Israel, which is directly threatened by these brutes, represent the light of  freedom which has, after so many millennia, only shone in the Middle East since  1948.

<title>No more apologies for Israel</title>
<date>12/1/2015</date>
<content>
I have recently returned from a visit to Israel and can report that the state of  the State of Israel is excellent.How, one might ask, can this be when  Israel fought another deadly round of war in Gaza just this past summer and  random acts of terrorism in Jerusalem suggest another intifada may be imminent?  The answer lies in my confidence that the people of Israel have the courage and  wisdom to do what is necessary to ensure their own security, regardless of what  others may say or do.




Israel is the subject of severe criticism on many  fronts.It is attacked for its “occupation” of the West Bank, for its  building of Jewish “settlements” in that territory, for its construction of a  security wall to thwart terrorist attacks, and for its “disproportional”  response to rockets fired from Gaza at its citizens – just a few of the common  charges directed at Israel. It is characterized as a racist, apartheid  society.Of course, these, and other similar slanders against Israel, are  simply wrong as a matter of fact. But I won’t go into a lengthy rebuttal of  these baseless claims here or anywhere else for that matter. I have come to  believe that the time for an apologetic defense of the State of Israel is over.  Indeed, Bayit Yehudi chairman Naftali Bennett recently launched a pro-Israel “no  apologies” media campaign.Why stop engaging Israel’s enemies? Because it  does no good. How many times have you countered every charge thrown at Israel by  your anti-Israel friends and colleagues with undisputed facts that completely  refute whatever negative claim they might be making.  Settlements.Occupation. Desperation. Checkpoints. Apartheid.  Etc.And how many times have you actually changed the mind of an  anti-Israel critic or even given him or her pause? Right. Never. Not  once.Why is that? Because the mindset of the critics of Israel is not  fact-based or even rational. It is grounded in an agenda forged, at best, out of  a desire on the part of the anti-Israel exponent to fit into a certain social  set, whether it be academia, a liberal circle of friends or a Christian “human  rights” community. At worst, and, more commonly, the anti-Israel attitude is  grounded in good old-fashioned, but ever popular, anti-Semitism.One can  talk until one is blue in the face, but one will never convince someone who  instinctively blames Israel for the problems in the region that Israel retains  the moral high ground. I know. I have tried for 66 years.Aside from its  futility, it is time to abandon a defensive posture to supporting Israel because  it is not necessary.This is because it just doesn’t matter what the  critics of Israel say, think, or do. It doesn’t matter what you, your friends or  your cousin Bernie think about Israel.It doesn’t matter what the  columnists of The New York Times or The Washington Post, the heads of the  European Union or the United Nations, the leaders of think tanks, churches,  synagogues, charities, institutes, or the writers of op-eds, blogs, tweets, and  comments think either. It doesn’t even matter what the present holder of the  office of the president of the United States thinks.(For those of you  who say that what the president says matters because Israel could not survive  without the support of the United States, that support is not in  jeopardy.The United States does not provide financial support to Israel  out of charity, but in its own national interest.The US receives a  substantial return on its investment in the form of intelligence sharing,  training of US military and law enforcement personnel in Israel, and Israel’s  purchase of weapons and supplies from US companies providing jobs for American  workers. In addition, the vast majority of the American people recognize Israel  as their only friend and ally in a hostile Middle East and consistently support  Israel).The survival of the State of Israel does not depend upon any of  these elite institutions or individuals. Certainly, it would be nice to have  these entities express a more sympathetic attitude toward the only democracy in  the Middle East. However, their unwarranted and often abusive criticisms do not  pose an existential threat to the State of Israel or its people. From its  founding in 1948, Israel has managed to survive (and prosper) with support from  various countries, groups and individuals. It will continue to do  so.But, most importantly, Israel has managed to survive the wars and  terrorism launched against it because of the character of its people. As David  Ben-Gurion famously said upon the founding of the State of Israel: “What matters  is not what the goyim say, but what the Jews do.” Having just returned from  Israel, I am happy to report that the strength and wisdom of its people will see  them through. They are a strong, incredibly diverse and unbelievably intelligent  group of individuals. They know exactly what they are doing. And they will  prevail.After all, for them, the issues they confront are not mere  academic exercises as they are for the rest of the world.For the people  of Israel, these issues are a matter of life and death. And they have nowhere  else to go.

<title>November 30: Black Friday</title>
<date>29/11/2015</date>

Black Friday I came to Israel in 1959 when all the Jewish holidays were a joy to  celebrate. Jewish history is full of “Black Fridays.” Do we need a new one? What  about a nice “pre-Hanukka sale”?.




OLGA P. WIND
HolonLove for Leibler Not  for the first time did my husband and I want to cheer out loud after reading Isi  Leibler’s outstanding column (“Saving innocent lives must have priority over  civil liberties,” Candidly Speaking, November 26).He is one of the few  columnists who can put into words what we the people of Israel need to  hear.Yes, we are not ashamed to admit we are frightened for our children  and grandchildren and yes, although we are proud to live in our democratic  state, we agree with Leibler: enough with the murder of innocent people in our  streets. Our government has a number one duty to protect us from crazed  religious fanatics in every way that Leibler cites.This column should be  read by every one who cares about our future, particularly our  government.This is no time for genteel diplomacy.Guys, this is  the time for strong action, harsh words. Remember, we will not forget how you  dealt with this horrific crisis – when it comes to election time we will be  careful to use our votes to give you our message loud and clear.Pity  Leibler never chose to go into politics as a career.LINDA HIRSCH 
Netanya  

Learn from experience Regarding the story (“IDF recommends Israel strengthening  PA to help avoid security deterioration,” November 26) it seems the IDF has gone  crazy, seeing that the generals and officers have forgotten that when the Oslo  ‘peace treaty’ was signed a decade or so ago by Shimon Peres, Yasser Arafat and  a very, very doubtful Yitzhak Rabin, Israel presented Arafat with hundreds of  thousands of bullets and guns to kill all Palestinian ‘terrorists’ who were  preventing the ‘peace’ treaty from becoming a reality. Thousands of Israelis  were killed or wounded by those very guns and bullets, as well as by male and  female suicide bombs.It’s sad that our leaders, whether political or  military, never seem to learn from experience.TRUDY GEFEN 
Kiryat Ono Kudos to Boteach All credit must go to Shmuley Boteach for daring to step into  the “lion’s den” of the Oxford University debate, (“The Oxford debates on  Israel,” No Holds Barred, November 24). But having watched one of the debates  recently, I must ask whether it is worthwhile. A debate is when two parties  present their differing viewpoints on a subject previously decided by the  society’s committee. When one side has an obvious agenda that it wishes to  publicize via the debate, and is prepared to use downright lies to vilify their  opposition, it makes a farce of the whole event. Both sides must be required to  provide hard evidence for any claims they intend to make during the course of  the debate, otherwise the most infamous and vicious demonization can be  achieved, without redress. Once these disturbing things are said, any denial  rings hollow unless proof can be provided in response.What makes it  worse for me as an Englishman, is the oh-so genteel way the pseudo-intellectuals  went about delegitimizing Israel, with dinner before, and drinks after the  event.Why pseudo-intellectuals? Because people who are honestly  intelligent could never accuse Israel of being “apartheid” or guilty of  genocide.Maybe it’s time to start debating with people who are critical  but fair, and prepared to listen to arguments. They may even be swayed in their  opinion. Where are these people? 

ROBERT HICKINBOTHAM 
Tel Aviv Identity crisisThe underlying reason for the identity crisis facing Conservative Judaism in the  United States (“Amid identity crisis, Conservative Jews pay for rebranding a new  image,” November 27) was inadvertently exposed by Rabbi David Wolpe when he said  “he dislikes the movement’s name, not the least because of its unwanted  association with a political ideology.”Conservative Judaism is suffering  from a serious case of cognitive dissonance. Voting data indicates that the  overwhelming majority of American Jews are liberal; however, many of the liberal  positions, such as approval of same sex marriage, are in conflict with  traditional Jewish beliefs.Consequently, the Conservative movement has  attempted to reduce the tension by restating Jewish values in order to better  correspond to liberal political positions. Thus, liberalism trumped Judaism. To  their credit, most American Jews seem to be seeking authenticity rather than  political correctness, and this has resulted in a reduction in the number of  people who identify with the Conservative movement.The Conservative  movement in the United States performed a historically important function for  the better part of a century – it provided a home for those who could accept  neither Reform nor Orthodoxy – and kept millions within the fold of Jewry. That  historic mission may have been successfully completed and is no longer  necessary. The present leadership should be aware of this reality before it  redefines itself again and becomes a footnote in the long history of the Jewish  people.JAY SHAPIRO 
Jerusalem ‘Elected’ MKs Morris Kahn’s letter (“Not  acceptable,” November 29) decrying the egregious behavior of MK Oren Hazan, puts  his finger firmly on the biggest impediment to genuine democratic representation  in our electoral system. He describes Hazan as “an elected representative in our  Knesset,” but he is no such thing.He is in fact a crony selected by the  party leader of his group, which itself was chosen by a process of proportional  representation.At no time was Hazan ‘chosen’ by the electorate, for if  he were, he would have been rejected for the loathsome values he exhibits in our  parliament. I suspect there are more than one or two MKs who are grateful for  the current method of their selection for similar reasons.

Lone wolf attacks There is only one way to stop the ‘lone wolf’  attacks by Arabs.The Palestinian Authority should issue an order to  their people, for the immediate cessation of attacks on Israelis, for a one year  duration.It is virtually impossible to negotiate in a hostile  environment.During this period of calm, Arabs and Jews will be able to  visit each other’s community centers and try to establish some sort of  rapport.It won’t be easy but it can be done. During this period of calm,  the Palestinian leadership will meet with the Israel government and attempt to  find a way out of this impasse.Who will lose out? No one. The worst that  can happen is a return to the status quo, when the year of calm has ended. What  can be lost by trying? It’s worth taking a chance. Who knows, miracles have  happened before.ISSY RIEBACK 
Kfar Yona The past repeats 
I was looking  through The Jerusalem Post book Front Page Israel and came across these  headlines that I thought might resonate: ‘October 1933: Arab demonstrations  cause many fatalities; Violence and bloodshed in Jaffa’, May 1936: 3 shot dead  in Jerusalem cinema; More Jewish victims; Armed bandit fires point blank into  theater crowd, December 1947: Riots mark start of strike; 5 Jews 3 Arabs dead;  Arab mob loots, burns and stabs, March 1954: 11 bus passengers are massacred by  Arab marauders on Negev Road And where were the settlements then? Need one say  more?

<title>NUS boycott decision a dangerous step that makes dialogue even harder</title>
<date>4/6/2015</date>
<content>
On Wednesday, the national executive council of Britain’s National Union of  Students amended a Justice for Palestine motion condemning Israel for its  activities in Gaza and the West Bank and calling for a widespread implementation  of the Boycott Divestment Sanctions movement.The vote, held as a secret  ballot, was an entirely inappropriate response to an extremely complex issue.  There has been virtually no consideration of the effects this has on Jewish  students, and the many students of other faiths and no faiths alike who seek to  express their support and admiration for the state of Israel on campus, free  from fear and intimidation.




As a past Masa participant, I was taken to  the West Bank and saw firsthand the effects the BDS movement has on undermining  cooperation and marginalizing not just Israelis, but the many Palestinian  workers who rely on Israeli companies for substantially higher wages and  improved living conditions.Rather than taking positive steps toward a  peaceful solution, this motion is another backward, divisive step that serves to  undermine the work being done to promote moderate voices on both sides of the  conflict. Masquerading itself as a motion that promotes Palestinian human  rights, it actually shuns debate and makes dialogue on campus still more  difficult.This is especially true as Jewish societies (Jsocs) face an  uphill struggle in organizing Israel-related events on campus. Israeli  academics, expressing no political affiliation, are frequently banned from  speaking on campus while radical preachers roam freely, inciting hate and  anti-Semitism on campus.Masa enabled me to see Israel for what it is: a  flourishing democracy amid an unstable Middle East imploding into chaos. And  like any democracy, Israel has its many problems; indeed Israelis know them all  too well.But to draw parallels on apartheid-era South Africa, when  Israeli Arabs sit on the Supreme Court, represent Israel in its parliament, and  have full and equal rights is to misrepresent history, and is frankly  offensive.With Masa’s support, Jewish societies across campuses are  leading the fight to combat unjustified motions and the effects they have on the  wider student body. Together we are sharing the good that Israel contributes to  the world, and tackling the bad through open and honest conversation in order to  build a better Israel. While this motion is disturbing, Masa and students  supportive of Israel will only redouble their efforts to spread a positive  message to a complex issue.

<title>October 21: Holiest site</title>
<date>21/10/2015</date>
<content>
Holiest site I was extremely disappointed by the error that appeared in the  first paragraph of “UNESCO draft text: Kotel part of al-Aksa Mosque” (October  20). The Western Wall is not the “most holy site in Judaism.”




The Temple  Mount is! Saying that the Kotel is the holiest site in Judaism has resulted in  the ability of the Muslim world to claim rights to the Temple Mount.It  is about time the Jews stood up proudly and stated the truth: The Temple Mount  is the most holy site in Judaism and has much stronger historical and religious  ties to Judaism than it does to Islam.

DAVID NEUSTADTER 
Nof Ayalon  Preaching hatred From inside the Aksa Mosque, the most violent, anti-Israel and  anti-Jewish diatribes are being spoken (“Jewish devil worshipers will be  exterminated by Muslims, says al-Aksa preacher in sermon,” October  20).What can be done about people who speak in the name of their  religion and only know hatred? What kind of concessions can be made to such a  people? Are we back to the days of child sacrifice? Is this what the world wants  – that we should disappear through their killing our children and families? I am  proud to say that no people reveres life as much as the Jewish people. No wonder  we stand apart from those in the United Nations who lust for our  demise.We do not need UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon or US Secretary  of State John Kerry telling us to give in to the people who want to exterminate  us.THELMA SUSSWEIN 
Jerusalem Implicit converse Michael Freund  (“Responding constructively to terrorism,” Fundamentally Freund, October 20)  argues that “the message we need to start sending to the Palestinians is this:  the more you try to kill us, the more we will build.For every act of  Palestinian destruction, Israel should undertake an act of construction, and  move forward with an expansion of the Jewish communities in Judea and  Samaria.”I doubt Mr. Freund intends to convey the implicit converse –  that the less Palestinians engage in terrorism, the less we will build in Judea  and Samaria.What’s worse, though, is that his message presents  settlement expansion as a punishment. This reinforces one of the main  anti-settlement propaganda points – that Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria  is inherently contrary to the interests of Palestinians and is inherently an  obstacle to a just peace.It also undermines a reasonable argument in  support of at least natural growth of Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria –  that justice entitles these communities to the same rights that Arab communities  enjoy throughout Israel. The growth of Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria  can indeed be justified as an exercise of equal rights. It shouldn’t be  brandished as a threat.

SHALOM BRILLIANT 
Ra’anana ‘Slay him first’ One is  amazed at the opinion of rabbis Yaakov Ariel and David Stav, both reputed to be  experts in Torah law, who, in opposition to the views of equally renowned  Israeli rabbis, have publicly stated that restrained terrorists who pose no  further danger should not be killed (“Should wounded terrorists be killed or  saved?” October 16). It is precisely this type of convoluted logic that has  resulted in many murderous terrorists who were wounded and left alive, and later  freed in insane “prisoner exchanges,” to repeat their nefarious acts.It  would behoove the “learned” rabbis to remember: “When one comes to slay you, you  must slay him first.” This wise Talmudic admonition truly ensures that a  terrorist wounded in carrying out a horrendous attack will no longer present a  danger to innocent men, women and children.SHIFRA HOFFMAN 
Jerusalem 
The  writer is founder of Victims of Arab Terror International.I don’t  understand why the world is upset with our policy of shoot-to-kill. We need to  rebrand it as “assisted suicide.” Maybe then the world will accept  it.

REBECCA RAAB 
Ma’aleh Adumim Go to Hebron With regard to “A change in  protocol” (Grapevine, October 16), I would not fault any VIP visiting Yad Vashem  who asks himself, “What do the poor Palestinians in Hebron have to do with the  Holocaust?” Rather than an obligatory visit to Yad Vashem, I would suggest that  these visitors be taken to the small museum in Hebron that exhibits graphic and  disturbing photographs of the Arab pogrom of 1929.Back then, there was  no Israeli “occupation,” no “illegal” Jewish settlements or any “radical”  settlers.There was simply a small, defenseless Jewish  community.False claims by the Palestinian Arab leadership that the Jews  had taken over the Aksa Mosque (sound familiar?) led to the massacre and the end  of a Jewish presence in Hebron until after the Six Day War.Perhaps a  brief visit to the museum will serve as a stark reminder that the conflict  between Israel and the Palestinians has never been about territory or  settlements, but about the right of Jews to live in this land.KENNY  FISHER 
Jerusalem Letters about letters Reader Raphael Rosenbaum (“US  involvement,” Letters, October 20) condemns US Secretary of State John Kerry for  linking the current wave of murderous attacks to settlement activity. But to  deny that this and the serious (if necessary) restrictions on movement and the  negative statements by our ministers regarding the two-state solution have  exacerbated Palestinian frustration and despair is to bury one’s head in the  sand.AMIEL SCHOTZ 
Meitar Regarding “The Anusim” (Letters, October 20),  although there are potentially countless Bnei Anusim in South and Central  America, Iberia and numerous other places around the world, many have lost their  interest in or connection to anything Jewish.Even those who retain some  Jewish rites and customs and are interested in returning to the Jewish people  will not necessarily be interested in making aliya.So to call them the  “11th Tribe” might be somewhat over-optimistic.On the other hand, we can  be optimistic that they will seek, each in his own way, their forefathers’  stolen and forgotten heritage.Certainly, the State of Israel should take  this potential return of the Bnei Anusim seriously. A Knesset caucus was  recently established for this purpose. Still, the question of “return” or  conversion is complex, and both the political and religious authorities will  have to be involved, as they were in the great aliya from the former Soviet  Union (where some 30 percent of the olim were not halachically Jewish), the Bnei  Israel from India and the Ethiopian Jews.We must act sympathetically  toward those who genuinely want to reconnect with the Jewish people after 500  years of forced separation.JACK S. COHEN

The writer is a retired  professor and a board member of the Institute for Sefardi and Anousim Studies at  Netanya Academic College.Gets it wrong In “South African Jewry: A  personal account seen through the prism of Limmud FSU” (Comment & Features,  October 18), Chaim Chesler writes that “Israel took a highly ambivalent attitude  to apartheid and tried unhappily to sit on the fence when the whole world was  actively opposing it....”This is a gross and damaging  distortion.Writer Maurice Ostroff researched the position many years ago  and showed that the support of Israel for South Africa, compared to that of the  US and other western powers, was minuscule. However, it suits the Israel-baiters  to forget the facts and continue their hateful, unjustified  diatribes.

<title>October 8: Still no proof</title>
<date>7/10/2015</date>
<content>
Still no proofI was shocked by the editing of Yossi Melman’s “Intifada or not,  the West Bank is on fire” (Analysis, October 6). He writes about “Jewish  extremists” and what would happen if they were to “carry out another terror  attack like the murder of the Dawabshe family in Duma.”




How can your  editors let that go to print? There is lots of evidence that the attack was the  result of internecine strife. The result of the rapid mea culpas by Israelis is  what led to a severe uptick in Arab-on-Jew violence that has not yet  abated.Israeli authorities have spared no effort or expense to pin that  crime on Jews, including baseless orders for administrative detention, yet there  is still no evidence linking Jews to the crime.A retraction by Melman  and an apology to the Jewish people by The Jerusalem Post are in  order.DONI ZIVOTOFSKY, JerusalemImplacable hatred Reading how the mother  of Aharon Banita’s widow Adel said her wounded daughter had “tried to run away  with a knife in her neck,” but Arab bystanders mocked her and said, “Hopefully,  you’ll die, too” (“‘You loved everyone and everyone loved you,’” October 6), I  was reminded of part of the oral history of my family.My grandfather was  born in Jerusalem in 1884. One of his earliest memories was walking with his  father to heder (school) when he was about five years old. They were walking  through the shuk (outdoor market) when a gang of older boys started to hit  him.My great-grandfather told the bullies to leave the child alone and  “hit me instead.” The boys were happy to oblige. They knocked him down and cut  off his beard. My great grandfather then shouted to the shopkeepers – in whose  stores he shopped almost every day! – and asked them to call the ruffians off.  The shopkeepers just laughed.This implacable hatred has been going on  for more than a hundred years, passed from generation to generation. It  certainly has nothing to do with “the settlements.”Anyone who thinks we  will have peace by giving away pieces of our land is, in Adel Banita’s words,  “an idiot.”THELMA JACOBSON, Petah Tikva Recognizing the truth Your  editorial “Reacting to Terrorism” (October 6) woke me up to recognize a reality  – Israel and the West are destined to be defeated by Islamofacism.After  a century of attacks by Arabs, where their announced aim has been to wipe us out  (and they mean it), pundits have made a good suggestion: We should stop the  cycle of violence and our leaders should talk to them. After all, Western  leaders talked with Nazis. Eventually, though, these leaders came to realize  that talking was the problem, and not the solution.It is sad to see  Israelis who cannot face the fact that we are in a life and death struggle. If  we do not believe in our right to live in peace and are not willing to fight for  it, our fate is sealed.When we recognize what Winston Churchill  recognized, and act to eliminate our oppressors, we will continue the “cycle of  violence” until our enemies are simply strong enough to eliminate  us.PHILIP BRIEFF, Jerusalem I was very surprised to read your editorial  rehashing what you called the “cycle of violence.”It implies that we’re  simply stuck in a tit-for-tat, with lethal consequences.Let’s be honest:  The lethal violence would stop if Palestinian youths went to school, and not to  the roads to murder people with rocks and other lethal weapons.BARRY  LYNN, Efrat 

Makes no sense Glenn Field’s suggestion about Arab-Israelis (“The  Arab-Israelis and their potential role as the conflict’s true mediator,” Comment  & Features, October 6) makes no sense whatsoever.Arab members of  Knesset show little loyalty to the State of Israel and are not trusted by the  majority MKs and citizens.Moreover, the agitation of groups like the  northern branch of the Islamic Movement has done much to aggravate the conflict,  not simply between Jews and Arabs within Israel, but between Israel and the  wider Arab and Islamic worlds.The conflict’s real need is not a  mediator, but a transformation of Palestinian attitudes toward acceptance of a  Jewish-majority state in the Middle East. Unfortunately, at the moment this  looks like a task more for a Messiah than for a mediator.SHALOM FREEDMAN,  Jerusalem Coffee and factsLongtime reader James Adler (“Unreported news,”  Letters, October 6) has found “important stories reported by other major Israeli  news organizations” that he claims “did not appear in the Post.” He also claims  that “apartheid” is the “current reality in the West Bank.”How so? When  was Mr. Adler last here to personally verify unproven accusations against us?  For the umpteenth time, I invite him to join us and neighborly Arab co-owners in  our building for cake, coffee and fact-checking.ESTER ZEITLIN, Jerusalem  

All about greed After reading about how, if or when Israel will see the promised  billions from the new gas fields off our coast (“How Leviathan turned into an  antitrust headache,” Business & Finance, October 4), I noticed in the From  Our Archives section on the facing page that 65 years ago, prime minister David  Ben-Gurion, in a radio address, sought to coax merchants to return concealed  stocks to their shelves to help fight the pervasive black market in scarce  consumer goods.Then, as now, it seems that short-sighted people with  greed in their hearts made it difficult for the public good because they wanted  what they considered their fair share – if not more – of what we had.In  spite of the most serious and threatening problems we face today here in Israel,  we have an abundance, and in some ways an over-abundance, that is unparalleled  in Jewish history.What we have, no doubt, would boggle the mind of my  refugee grandmother from Austria who, in 1950, schlepped her kosher butcher to  have him slaughter a chicken, which she proceeded to turn into the centerpiece  of the most delicious meal her awestruck grandson would eat.So rather  than hold out for everything we think we can get, perhaps we ought to grasp not  only what we have, but what we need, as well as what we want for those who  follow us, and to do so without being greedy.MARC BERENBACH, Nahariya  It’s in the water Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz (“Simhat Torah: Abundance and the joy  of Torah,” Observations, October 2) fails to explain the real reason Simhat  Torah is celebrated on Shmini Atzeret, and not on Shavuot, the day the Torah was  received.On Shmini Atzeret, we have just thanked God for the harvest  grown with the abundance of rain of the previous year, and are now requesting  another year of plentiful precipitation.We are in such a jovial mood  that we are willing to chance a bit of chutzpah and say to God: “Let’s make a  deal. We will complete the reading of the Torah and immediately begin a new  reading cycle; in return, we will expect of You to reciprocate with a full quota  of rain for the coming season.”Since Torah is likened to spiritual  water, we’ll deal with a new cycle of spiritual water while God deals with a new  cycle of the real thing.

<title>Peter ‘Punish Israel’ Beinart’s hostility to fellow Jews</title>
<date>15/6/2015</date>
<content>
Peter Beinart has long had an unnatural obsession with me. To be honest, the  amount of column space he’s devoted to promoting my name is something for which  I should be compensating him.Last week he unleashed his latest tantrum –  this time in the form of a screed against me and Sheldon Adelson for fighting  the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement on campus.




Beinart  begins by introducing his by now familiar appalling factual inaccuracies that  are an affront to both reason and logic. He begins by saying that “everyone who  understands the [BDS] Movement knows that its recruits are progressives, and  that what tips them toward BDS is despair that there seems no other way to end  Israel’s immoral, undemocratic control of the West Bank and Gaza  Strip.”With this Beinart offers the over-roasted, farcical chestnut that  the growth of BDS is the product of an occupation.The BDS movement,  along with those who ascribe to it, is about one thing: the destruction of  Israel.It’s easy to prove.BDS has no interest in protesting an  occupation. If it did it would be boycotting Apple products, which are made in  China, since that country has been occupying Tibet since 1950 (and they haven’t  allowed the Dalai Lama to even visit his people since). I personally saw Peter  using an iPhone at our Columbia University debate last year, so clearly Peter  couldn’t care less about occupation either.Likewise, if BDS was  motivated by an opposition to occupation none of its adherents would drink  Turkish coffee, since Turkey has been occupying Cyprus since 1974. And no BDS  person would drink Stoli vodka in opposition to Russia’s occupation of  Crimea.BDS, moreover, cannot claim to have any interest whatsoever in  Palestinian rights. If it did, it would be boycotting Egypt for destroying  hundreds of Palestinian homes on the Gaza border last October to stop Hamas from  smuggling weapons. Moreover, it would boycott Hamas for executing scores of  Palestinians without trial (which Israel has never done, even with a trial),  while shooting others through the knees for publicly questioning their  legitimacy. The Palestinian Authority would also be boycotted for bringing an  end to elections and censoring the press. They might also call for divestment  from Lebanon for the actual apartheid there against the Palestinian population,  which is legally held back from entering the medical, legal and banking fields  or from participating in any other mainstream industry.BDS similarly has  no interest in protecting Arab life. If it did it would be boycotting Syria for  murdering 200,000 Arabs.BDS has no interest in promoting Arab human  rights.If it did it would be divesting from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt,  Qatar, Syria, Lebanon and every other Arab country where Arabs are denied the  most basic rights like freedom of press, freedom to protest their government,  and the freedom to vote – all of which are guaranteed to Arabs only in  Israel.BDS, rather, trades in anti-Semitism, with its primary objective  being the economic destruction of the world’s only Jewish state and the Middle  East’s only democracy.If only Peter had stopped his fraudulence at  that.But he goes on, now slamming groups dedicated to Israel’s future  like CUFI and ZOA, and lamenting the fact that they were invited to the anti-BDS  conference while J Street and the New Israel Fund were not. With this Beinart is  true to type, allying himself with organizations that are among Israel’s  greatest critics, while condemning those that are its foremost defenders. But  this should not surprise us since Beinart, already a public advocate for the  partial boycott of Israeli products, has removed himself from the pro-Israel  community by penning an article right after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s  election demanding that Israel be punished.“It means pushing the Obama  administration to... punish – yes, punish – the Israeli government... It means  making sure that every time Benjamin Netanyahu and the members of his cabinet  walk into a Jewish event outside Israel, they see Diaspora Jews protesting  outside.”But so petty is Beinart when it comes to Israel, and so  obsessed is he with finding faults with any efforts on Israel’s behalf, that he  even condemns the actual name of our anti-BDS summit: Campus Maccabees. He  complains that “Maccabees” refers to “religious zealots who... demanded that  Jews reject any interaction with foreign cultures.”That’s funny, because  I thought the word “Maccabee” was a universal term connoting a courageous  fighter for religious liberty and spiritual freedom. Indeed, even the United  States Supreme Court ruled that the menorah – the defining symbol of the  Maccabees – can be placed on public property since it’s considered by law to be  a universal symbol of liberty, as opposed to representing the Jewish  exclusionary racism that Beinart would have you believe.But not content  to trash me as a rabbi, leading groups who defend Israel, and even the very  Maccabees whom we celebrate on Hanukka, Beinart reserves his true fire for the  world’s foremost Jewish philanthropist, Sheldon Adelson, claiming that his  anti-BDS conference was really a cynical ploy to “empower himself and his  right-wing agenda.”Here is where Beinart goes off the rails, losing it  completely and falling into dangerous Protocols of Zion territory.As  depicted by Beinart, Adelson is now a Jewish “elder,” intent on political  dominion and world domination. In his own words, Adelson has “for years now...  been moving to dominate Jewish politics, both in Israel and the United States.”  Beinart’s uber-cynical, revolting attack on Adelson is yet another manifestation  of Beinart’s campaign to demonize those who disagree with him.This is no  surprise, of course, for demonization is the tool chosen by those who have no  facts and have already lost the argument.The truth is that it was very  inspirational to see Dr. Miriam and Sheldon Adelson, the world’s foremost Jewish  philanthropists, sit for two straight days listening to 50 presentations from  organizations advocating for Israel to hear their funding needs. And in doing  so, they set a model of commitment for us all to emulate.But if Beinart  has the right to draw parallels between our new anti-BDS campaign and what he  sees as ancient Jewish corruption among the Hasmoneans – whom he says “helped  destroy the Jewish state” – then we have a right to do the same for those  critics of Israel in modern times.Last week’s Torah reading relates the  story of the spies Moses sends to scout the Land of Israel. But after seeing the  giants who inhabited the land they return with the perfidy that the Children of  Israel cannot capture their promised homeland. In their own words: “We were like  grasshoppers in our own eyes, and so we appeared to them.” Long ago in ancient  Israel a group of Jews consumed by feelings of inferiority and inadequacy  projected this self-loathing on to the land. Peter Beinart and his fellow Israel  critics should take heed. I’m not surprised that someone like Adelson gets under  Peter’s skin. For while Sheldon Adelson represents Jewish pride incarnate and  has given inestimable time and resources to his people so that they may prosper,  Beinart has earned his name for being among the foremost Jewish critics of the  State of Israel.

<title>Reality Check: Stopping terrorism is not an end goal</title>
<date>11/10/2015</date>
<content>
As we approach next month’s 20th anniversary of the murder of Yitzhak Rabin, the gulf between what might have been and today’s reality becomes ever clearer. This is not to claim that had Rabin not been assassinated, peace and love would have broken out between Israel and the Palestinians.Indeed, it is far from obvious that Rabin would even have won the general election slated for 1996 given the wave of Palestinian terrorism that marked that period.




But had Rabin lived and prevailed over Benjamin Netanyahu in those elections, it is fair to assume that we would not have seen a staggering 264 percent increase (from 110,000 to approximately 400,000) in the number of Jews living in the West Bank since the signing of the Oslo Accords, a population growth that only serves to drive a possible agreement further and further away. Rabin’s disdainful view of the settler movement is well known, and the archive footage recently publicized in the new film Rabin: In His Own Words shows just how prescient he was.Back in 1976, he told an interviewer: “I see in Gush Emunim [the ‘Bloc of the Faithful,’ the ideologically driven founders of the settlement movement] one of the most acute dangers in the whole phenomenon of the State of Israel... Gush Emunim is not a settlement movement. It is comparable to a cancer in the tissue of Israel’s democratic society. It’s a phenomenon of an organization that takes the law into its own hands.”Today, almost 30 years later, the next generation of settlement leaders have continued on the same path. Despite an Israeli commitment not to build new settlements as part of the Oslo Accords, followed by Ariel Sharon’s promise to the Bush administration to halt new settlement activity, the settler movement, with the cooperation of different government ministries, has nevertheless built illegal outpost after illegal outpost, with the full intent of preventing any future Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and making life more unpleasant for the Palestinians living there.And in this, the settlers have been repeatedly encouraged by Netanyahu’s different administrations over the years, all of which have attempted to whitewash and “legalize” many of these outposts.Such actions clearly show the hollowness of Netanyahu’s Bar-Ilan speech in which he talked of adopting the two-state solution. As Rabin noted in his 1976 interview: “I don’t think it’s possible to contain [Jewish settlement] over the long term, if we don’t want to get to apartheid, a million and a half [more] Arabs inside a Jewish state.”IN FACT, some would argue that we’ve already reached that point. In response the recent wave of Palestinian stone-throwing, which proved lethal in the case of Alexander Levlovitz, many on the Right have called on the IDF to shoot stone-throwers on sight. As a senior IDF officer sarcastically noted in an interview in this weekend’s Yediot Aharonot, if such an order is given “we will of course also enforce it on Israelis who throw stones. After all, in our country, everybody is equal before the law. By the amount of stones thrown by Israelis on Arabs [in the West Bank] this week, the IDF should have killed 200 Jews.”And while the Israeli security forces were admirably quick to identify and capture the heinous murderers who gunned down Na’ama and Eitam Henkin in front of their four children, the Jewish terrorists who killed three members of the Dawabsheh family by firebombing their house in the Palestinian village of Duma are still at large. This, according to Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon, is because although the security forces know who was responsible for the deadly attack, Israel does not want to bring them to justice so as to avoid exposing intelligence sources.While the Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel is stoking tensions over the Temple Mount, Netanyahu is being disingenuous when he claims Israel is not seeking to change the status quo there. Under his premiership, there has been an ever-increasing number of senior politicians and ministers ascending the Mount to assert Israeli sovereignty there, despite the disastrous consequences of Ariel Sharon’s visit to the compound in 2000, which ignited the second intifada.This July, Housing and Construction Minister Uri Ariel ignored Israel’s real housing shortage and fanned the flames of unrest by calling for the building of the Third Temple on the Mount. Last month, again neglecting his day job, Ariel once more visited the site and told reporters “The Temple Mount is the holiest place for the Jewish people, and must be open for prayer at every hour to every Jew.” Despite such deliberately provocative behavior, Ariel is still a member of Netanyahu’s government.
The prime minister’s belated decision last week to ban all MKs from the Temple Mount is a step in the right direction, but for as long as Netanyahu narrowly views ending the current wave as terrorism as his end goal, we are doomed to repeat it in the future. As Rabin understood, Israel will only prosper if it manages to fully disengage from ruling over millions of Palestinians in the West Bank and removes those settlements throttling any prospect for peace.

<title>RIGHT FROM WRONG: Communist bedfellows</title>
<date>3/5/2015</date>
<content>
In 1983, four years after the signing of the peace treaty between Israeli prime  minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, I became acquainted  with a couple who lived in my Jerusalem apartment complex.The husband  was a teacher in the local elementary school; the wife worked for the Israel  Electric Corporation.




Within minutes of our first encounter, it became  apparent that they did not share my worldview. This was not a novel experience.  On the contrary, I had come to expect secular Israelis, especially those with  university degrees, to be somewhere on the Left. 
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}Still, the couple in  question turned out to be different from the others with whom I argued regularly  about politics and economics, until more urgent issues, such as whether our  babies had slept through the night, reminded us why we were friends in the first  place.Unlike the trendy Labor Party liberals all over the neighborhood,  who were buying up run-down Arab houses and renovating them with a vengeance  (made possible through much hard-earned cash from their parents), this man and  woman were bona fide, card-carrying communists. And their disdain for anyone  less ideologically “pure” bordered on hatred.It was like the split in  the 1950s between kibbutz members who remained loyal to Joseph Stalin and those  who in their awakening to the evils of the Soviet Union rejected him.My  neighbors, it seemed, were reenacting a schism that barely existed any more. I  found it fascinating to catch a glimpse of this bygone aspect of Israeli society  with which I had been unfamiliar.Even more interesting were our debates,  which had a peculiar flavor: so opposite were our positions that they almost  converged. The Israel- Egypt treaty brought this weird phenomenon to the  fore.The mainstream attitude in Israel towards Sadat at the time had  been one of awe at his great bravery in the face of internecine opposition on  the one hand, and admiration for his global realpolitik on the other.To  say anything else about him was practically blasphemy. And whenever I expressed  doubts about his motives or questioned how genuine a peace it would be – since  all the Egyptian leader had to do was say, “No more war,” and Begin handed him  the entire Sinai Peninsula, while giving the Palestinians “autonomy” – I was  dismissed as a right-wing fanatic.My communist friends, however, were  equally skeptical.“Sadat only initiated this move in order to leave the  Soviet access and ally himself with the United States,” they said. I agreed  wholeheartedly, explaining that this constituted the one real ray of light I saw  in the deal.They laughed, happy I was acknowledging the veracity of  their analysis, yet making fun of my siding with the US over the USSR.I,  too, was amused. I had discovered that it is far easier to spar over opinions  when the facts are not in dispute.Nor were these communists pacifists,  as were so many of their liberal counterparts.They even defended the  Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan, based on their belief that some things  are worth fighting for. On the latter point we did not diverge.This form  of polarization came to mind when reading Peter Beinart’s piece in Haaretz on  Thursday, titled: “For the American right, Israel embodies the values that  Obama’s US no longer does.”Using the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition  last weekend as a peg to list all the reasons why American conservatives (i.e.  Christians) care so much about Israel that it was the focus of the Republican  candidates’ addresses to the audience, Beinart starts off by dismissing the  “exaggerated” emphasis liberals put on theology as an explanation. “For  one thing, more secular conservatives are almost as pro-Israel as their  fervently religious counterparts,” he writes.Here is how Beinart sees  it: “Since the United States became a world power, conservatives have tended to  define America’s mission as leading the West against some global, existential,  civilizational foe. First it was the Nazis; then it was the communists; now it  is ‘radical Islam.’ The ‘West’ is an amorphous, fluid concept: part geographic,  part ideological, part cultural, part religious, at times even  racial.But however they define it, American conservatives have long felt  a special affinity for those Western outposts that define the frontier between  them and us...Today’s conservatives love Israel for a similar reason. In this  era, they believe, the West’s great enemy is ‘radical Islam.’ And the West’s  great outpost, on the frontlines against Islamic terror, is Israel. It’s modern;  it’s democratic; it’s pro-American.And it’s under attack from the same  forces that want to destroy the United States.”So far, so good.  Excellent, in fact.Can it be that I am in agreement with Beinart about  something? Anything? He goes on: “But there’s a twist. It’s not just that Israel  represents the West. It’s that Israel represents the West at a time when  many conservatives feel the United States no longer  does.”Exactly.“Conservatives love Israel for the same reason  anti-Zionists hate it,” he concludes. “Think about the words Israel’s harshest  foes use to describe it: colonial, imperial, settler, apartheid.What  they all convey is that Israel is a foreign creation, imposed by Europeans, and  sustained by the United States, at the native population’s expense. For the  American right, being a Western outpost in the Middle East makes Israel heroic.  For the anti-Zionist left, it makes Israel illegitimate.That’s why  Israel has become so important to the American right. For many conservatives  today, Western civilization isn’t only embattled in the Middle East. It’s also  embattled inside the United States. Thus, the struggle over how America treats  Israel is also a struggle over how America defines itself.”I could have  written those very words myself. But, whereas its author is bemoaning them, I  cheer at their justice. Communists, like my former neighbors, and Beinart really  do make for strange bedfellows.

<title>Right from wrong: To Israel with love</title>
<date>26/4/2015</date>
<content>
In his column in Haaretz on Wednesday, titled “Why I won’t be celebrating  Israel’s Independence Day this year,” Asher Schechter lists many reasons for his  dejection over the Jewish state and his absence from the holiday festivities for  the first time in 29 years.On a trip to New York, he had decided in  advance that he wouldn’t even join the event in spirit, avoiding “anything and  everything Israeli” for the day.




His description of the state of the  nation is as bleak as it is detailed.He writes: “The past 12 months in  Israel have been rife with internal and external conflicts, international  isolation and political corruption. It saw an operation in Gaza last summer that  claimed the lives of more than 2,000 Palestinians and 70-plus Israelis, and then  was almost instantly forgotten. It saw an ugly election campaign that pitted  Israelis against each other: right against left Jews against Arabs Ashkenazim  against Sephardim secular against religious – and the reelection of Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.”See the latest opinion pieces on our       Opinion & Blogs Facebook      page 

 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}
He then asks: “Should we raise a glass to  Israel’s rapid descent into a moral and political abyss? Should we congratulate  the young nation on its narrowing democracy, on the growing reliance of its  leaders on nationalism and bigotry, on the emotional numbness that seems to have  overtaken it in recent years? Should we cheer for the untimely death of the  two-state solution, or maybe Israel’s dangerous steps toward apartheid?” The  answer to his rhetorical questions, of course, is no.“As Israel  continues down its path of isolation and conflict, and does so with renewed  verve,” he explains, “I find my disappointment outweighing my sense of national  pride.”Impressive. And if Israel even remotely resembled the country of  his depiction, I would be equally despondent. Thankfully, it does not.On  the contrary, the Israel I inhabit – the one that actually exists – is  wonderland.In spite of being surrounded by enemies bent on its  destruction, it continues to be full of life, with a paradoxical flavor. It is  homey, yet cosmopolitan; provincial, yet worldly; war-torn, yet peace-obsessed;  frenetic, yet relaxed; religious, yet secular; Middle Eastern, yet Western;  conservatively single-minded, yet prone to every liberal fad on the planet; a  bureaucratic nightmare, yet heaven for individual expression and  entrepreneurship; judgmental, yet empathic; ill-mannered, yet proper;  marriage-oriented, yet a paradise for singles; exorbitantly expensive, yet a  tourist’s dream; economically shaky, yet able to weather global and local  crashes.Its imperfections are numerous, but public efforts to correct  them know no bounds. Complaints about the condition of and budgets allotted to  health care, welfare, transportation, education, defense and culture are  rampant, with some more justified than others. These gripes are constantly  underscored in the press, which is free to criticize anything and everything at  will, no matter how false – such as Schechter’s accusing Israel of “apartheid”  and blaming it for the “untimely death of the two-state solution.”No  country on earth at the age of 67 has ever come close to Israel’s achievements,  and being the “start-up nation” is merely the icing on the cake. Its true  greatness lies not in technological innovation, but in the fabric of its  society, which manages to balance and juggle every possible melting-pot hurdle  with miraculous wherewithal.In spite of its flawed politicians and  electoral system; in spite of ethnic and religious diversity and clashes; in  spite of rockets flying from Gaza (as one did at the close of Independence Day);  in spite of incessant and increasing diplomatic assault; and in spite of the  palpable threat of a nuclear Iran, the Jewish state is not merely a phenomenon,  but a fantastic place to live.Schechter says that he finds his  “disappointment outweighing [his] sense of national pride.”I, on the  other hand, grow more in love with Israel with each passing year.

<title>September 6: Taking issue</title>
<date>5/9/2015</date>
<content>
Taking issue Gershon Baskin’s long-standing and close relationship with  Palestinian leaders enables him to present his ideas on who might succeed  Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas (“After Abbas,” Encountering  Peace, September 3).




However, I take issue with two of his  comments.First, Baskin declares that Abbas is a man of peace and has  dedicated the last decades of his life to achieving peace, liberation and  independence for his people. How, then, does the writer explain Abbas’s refusal  to accept the offer made to him by former prime minister Ehud Olmert, which  would have provided all this for his people? My second criticism is of his  likening the situation here to that which preceded the fall of apartheid in  South Africa, while commenting that Marwan Barghouti is no Nelson Mandela, and  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is no F.W. de Klerk.As one who grew up  and spent 53 years of his life in South Africa, I can assure Baskin that his  comparisons are totally irrelevant. Israel does not even approximate being an  apartheid state. His comments suggest that he believes otherwise.MONTY  M. ZION

Disturbing account In “Losing the war of ideas” (Our World,  September 2), Caroline B. Glick gives a disturbing account of the consequences  of the West’s laissez faire attitude toward ideas. The destruction of the  ancient temples at Palmyra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, provides a timely  example.The West cannot comprehend any reason for this act. For us,  ideas and ideologies have their time – which might last centuries – before they  go, to be replaced by other ideologies that are more relevant and  current.Those ideas might have produced great engineering feats and  works of art, such as Palmyra, but, other than aesthetic pleasure, they have no  power over our beliefs. Is there a single follower of Bel worshiping at Palmyra  today? With ISIS and other extremist Muslims, however, ideas and ideologies are  eternal. Idolatry, especially, is forever present and forever evil. Even if not  a single actual follower can be found today, Palmyra might seduce us back again  tomorrow. So the fight must continue for all time.Unless we defeat  extremist Islam, the consequences will be a far greater destruction of heritage  sites and unremitting war against the “evil West.”CAROL CLAPSADDLE  
Jerusalem The King note It was with some amazement that I read the last segment  of the September 2 Grapevine feature (“Between Jerusalem and Rome”).I  was under the impression that any notes placed between the stones of the Western  Wall were sacrosanct. Wondering how many people would remove US television  personality Larry King’s note to read what he had asked of his Creator was  inappropriate, and should not have been given space, even in a gossip  column.SALLY SHAW Kfar Saba Letters about letters Reader Ester Zeitlin’s  sarcastic response (“Righteous response,” Letters, September 3) to David  Newman’s proposal regarding migrants (“The global migration crisis,” Borderline  Views, September 1) ignores the horrific conditions from which these people are  fleeing.I assume she would equally have opposed the British acceptance  of Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis.AMIEL SCHOTZ 
Meitar I agree 100  percent with reader Linda Silverstone (“Partners in worry,” Letters, September  3). And to make matters even worse, the crossword puzzles in The Jerusalem Post  are getting harder.It is all too depressing.BEATTIE GELLERT  
Netanya I agree with reader David Waintraub (“Change from without?” Letters,  September 2).Compared to the police force in my country of origin, the  Israel Police is a static force – no patrols, no police in the street. If  something goes wrong and you call the station or the emergency number, it takes  a while for an officer to come. If you need to make a statement or issue a  complaint, you are told to came to the station house.A major change is  necessary.Go to a station house. You’ll see a lot of cars with red  license plates in the parking lot. Send them all out into the  streets.Make policemen more friendly.Teach them to help  citizens, especially children and the elderly.Make the police more  local, like in many other countries, where there is no central law enforcement  authority overseeing them. Open the doors to more volunteers.Of course,  there is already very good police personnel.Look after them, but bring  in outsiders with plenty of determination to make the necessary changes. If  someone already on the force doesn’t like it, send that person home with a good  retirement package, and make space for someone new.MARIO SOIFER 
Ofakim I  am pleased that reader Dani Jacobowitz, all of 17 (“Open and closed,” Letters,  August 30), is already living his life in a way that satisfies his personal  needs and desires. But to say that others who feel differently about their  Judaism should do so indoors on Shabbat indicates a certain lack of  tolerance.While Israel might be “a Jewish state,” it is first and  foremost a state for the Jews – meaning all Jews, no matter what their  background, worldview or extent of religious practice. We all have a right to  live our lives without needing to cower behind closed doors, as we often had to  do while in exile.ARI BEN-SENDER 
Jerusalem I want to make sure that I  fully understand the message in reader Uri Hirsch’s August 30 letter (“Open and  closed”). My understanding is that since Ofer Liperman, franchisee of the Henris  café at the Sarona Market in Tel Aviv, does not “keep Shabbat” according to  traditional Orthodox guidelines, it is appropriate to force him to keep his  store open that day of the week.If this is the correct reading of the  letter (and I fear that it is), I would like to ask Mr. Hirsch for  substantiation of this position in the writings and halachic rulings of the  sages at any point in history. I am afraid his search will be in vain! Much  evidence can adduce just the opposite approach in this same vast body of  literature.As the High Holy Days rapidly approach, allow me to retell an  anecdote that makes the point clearly and unequivocally.It is told that  during one summer in Brisk, a very rich, but secular, member of the Jewish  community appeared on Shabbat in the synagogue where Reb Chaim Brisker (Rabbi  Chaim Soloveitchik, of blessed memory) prayed. The man begged the congregants to  help him raise the money necessary to pay a ransom for the return of his son,  who had been kidnapped. He was a man of means, but the amount being demanded was  exorbitant.Time went by and the response from the community was paltry.  On the eve of Yom Kippur, everyone rushed to shul to make sure Kol Nidre could  be said in a timely fashion.But Reb Chaim wasn’t there! They waited and  waited, and it got later and later. At some point, a messenger was sent to his  house to determine the cause of the delay. Perhaps he was not well.After  the messenger asked about the rabbi’s well-being, he asked, with utmost  humility, why he had not yet come to shul. Reb Chaim answered that he could not  bring himself to pray in a congregation that ignored the needs of a Jewish soul  – regardless of the nature of that person’s religious observance.

<title>Sinai Today: Honoring terrorists is dangerous</title>
<date>12/2/2015</date>
<content>
Leila Khaled, a convicted  plane-hijacker and senior leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine, was an honored guest of the South African Parliament at this year’s  State of the Nation address delivered by President Jacob Zuma.Her  supporters claim that she is a freedom fighter and not a terrorist, and they  point to a time when many people condemned Nelson Mandela as a terrorist. This  issue has immediate importance for the future of the civilized world, which  faces a crisis of violent terrorism across the globe.




Powers of  intellectual analysis and moral integrity must be deployed in defining the  principal and principled difference between a freedom fighter and a  terrorist.There is one crisp point which goes to the heart of the  matter, and that is that terrorists can be defined as people who willfully  target civilians. When the ANC embarked upon the armed struggle, it made it  clear all along that its policy was to target security forces and state  installations, never innocent civilians. Nelson Mandela and his co-defendants at  the infamous Rivonia treason trial were arrested for planning attacks on South  African government apartheid installations, not for attempting to murder  civilians in shopping malls, places of worship, and their homes.In his  speech from the dock in 1964, Mandela said: “Sabotage did not involve loss of  life, and it offered the best hope for future race relations. Bitterness would  be kept to a minimum and, if the policy bore fruit, democratic government could  become a reality.”By contrast, Leila Khaled, after having been part of a  team that hijacked a Trans World Airlines civilian flight on its way from Rome  to Athens, was arrested and convicted of the attempted hijacking of another  civilian aircraft a year later. During the latter incident, she charged at the  cabin of the plane mid-flight, and was knocked unconscious before she could do  anything with the grenades she was holding. She had removed the pins of the  grenades.Khaled also serves as a senior leader of the PFLP, which has  proudly claimed responsibility for a number of chillingly cruel murders of  innocent, defenseless civilians. Among the most infamous of PFLP operations was  the cold-blooded murder of the five members of the Fogel family. The PFLP  members entered the Fogel family home in the middle of the night, stabbing to  death the parents and three children aged 11, 4, and 3 months in their beds. The  three-month-old baby was decapitated. A neighbor who was alerted that something  was wrong by one of the surviving children described entering the room: “I  entered and saw that another boy survived, two years old. He was lying next to  his bleeding parents, shaking them with his hands, and trying to get them to  wake up, while crying.”Leila Khaled’s PFLP also claimed responsibility  for the November 2014 Jerusalem synagogue massacre in which four rabbis and a  Druse policeman were murdered by PFLP operatives armed with hatchets, meat  cleavers, and a rifle, attacking the worshipers as they were praying. The PFLP  in an official statement called the perpetrators “heroes” and said: “We bless  the operation and the two young men who carried it out.”This, then, is  the core moral distinction which we dare not forget – that terrorism is the  willful targeting of innocent civilians. There is no cause on Earth that can  justify targeting civilians. International law defines the willful injury or  killing of civilians as a war crime.The PFLP’s philosophy of death  places them – and their leaders – squarely in the camp of the worst terrorists,  who today wreak mayhem and destruction on decent societies the world over. The  killers who entered Charlie Hebdo’s offices in Paris and gunned down 12  journalists in cold blood, and their accomplice who murdered four Jewish  shoppers at the local kosher deli, are terrorists, not freedom fighters, even if  they intended to defend the honor of their religion.The Taliban soldiers  who entered a school in Peshawar and butchered 132 children are terrorists, not  freedom fighters. Likewise, the al-Qaida operatives who flew civilian aircraft  into the Twin Towers were terrorists, not freedom fighters.Islamic  State, which has massacred the inhabitants of entire towns and cities across  Syria and Iraq, wrought genocide on certain ethnic groups, and routinely behead  journalists and humanitarian workers, is an organization of terrorists, not  freedom fighters.This moral distinction is also crucial to understanding  the difference between Hamas – which fired thousands of rockets into densely  populated areas of Israel with the intention of killing as many civilians as  possible, and dispatched operatives to kidnap and murder defenseless  schoolchildren – and Israel, which although it was under constant bombardment,  undertook unprecedented steps in the history of warfare to avoid civilian  casualties.Words matter. The Talmud notes that God created the world  with words. Words create and destroy worlds. Confusion with words reflects moral  confusion. To honor a savage terrorist like Leila Khaled as a freedom fighter is  a moral outrage. But it is also dangerous. The civilized world faces a terrible  threat from violent terrorism.This threat can be confronted effectively  only if we have the moral clarity to define and understand the threat. Africa in  particular is under attack from the forces of barbarism.There is a  full-scale continental war taking place in Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, Mali, Libya,  Somalia, and other places.Since 2007, Nigeria-based Boko Haram has  terrorized communities across western and central Africa, staging bombings and  attacks that have killed thousands of civilians.Also during this time,  al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabaab has carried out nearly 600 terrorist attacks in  eastern and northeastern Africa, killing around 2,000 people and wounding  thousands more. These include the July 2010 Kampala suicide bombings that ended  the lives of 74 soccer fans enjoying the FIFA World Cup Final; the gunmen who in  2013 opened fire at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, killing 67 shoppers; and the  attacks on towns across the Kenyan peninsula that have left hundreds  dead.The African continent is facing a serious threat to peace,  stability, and the well-being of its people. Nigeria, in particular, has been  subject to an onslaught from Boko Haram, the likes of which should fill our  hearts with agony and moral outrage. In early January alone, more than 2,000  Nigerians were murdered by Boko Haram, and hundreds of children have been taken  captive in recent months.Instead of inviting Leila Khaled as a guest of  honor, the South African government should have invited the Nigerian mothers  whose children are being held captive by Boko Haram, as well the presidents of  the suffering African countries, as a sign of African solidarity in the fight  against terrorism.South Africans, who gave the world hope after the  defeat of apartheid, should be leading the way in the international community,  and at the very least in Africa, in confronting the evils of violent terrorism.  To honor Leila Khaled and, by extension, the culture of death and cruelty she  represents, makes a mockery of the values of human rights and democracy  represented by the South African Parliament.Moral clarity and the  principled distinction between good and evil are the bedrock of human  civilization. To honor an unrepentant terrorist is unforgivable. And  dangerous.

<title>South African Buzz: The Hamas visit to South Africa</title>
<date>19/11/2015</date>
<content>
In October a delegation from the terrorist  organization Hamas, headed its leader Khaled Mashaal, arrived in Cape Town. They  had been invited by the African National Congress, the political party that  rules South Africa. The planning, we were told, had taken nine years (one can  take that with a pinch of humus).Led by President Jacob Zuma, the ANC  apparently has the belief that they can play a role in a Palestinian-Israel  reconciliation.




After all, the ANC argues, South Africans were oppressed  by an apartheid white government and they eventually won through peaceful  dialogue. (Note that this word “apartheid,” which is being bandied about  nowadays with reference to Israel, has come to mean whatever the user wants it  to mean.) A letter of intent was signed by Mashaal and President Zuma concerning  South African support for Gaza. At a rally in Cape Town, Mashaal condemned ISIS  actions as extremism “not acceptable” to Islam (as the saying goes, he would,  wouldn’t he?).As expected, the Hamas visit caused shock to the Jewish  community in South Africa.Wendy Kahn, director of the SA Jewish Board of  Deputies, commented on the distress of the local Jewish community, essentially  asking why an organization whose charter is based on hatred of the Jews and the  need to slaughter them has been so warmly received.In South Africa, as  all over the Diaspora, anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism are likely to be a prelude  to killing Jews. Remembering that the historic Jewish narrative from time  immemorial to today contains suffering from hatred, pogroms and the Holocaust,  more violence against Jews seems to a natural and inevitable  development.A storm was caused when the largest South African newspaper,  the Sunday Times, would not accept a full page ad from a group called The South  African Friends of Israel. It finally recanted and last Sunday, November 8, the  ad appeared. It was the entire page 5. In large print it says: According to  Hamas, Jihad is the only way to achieve “peace.” The phrase “And it gets worse”  is used several times. For those who want to know more about who Hamas is, there  are 12 links on the page – including one to the huge welcome that the Hamas  leader got in Cape Town.Many see the visit as an obvious political  strategy to win Moslem votes in the elections next year. The Cape province, the  only one not ruled by the ANC, has a large Moslem population.On another  topic, after days of protests, uproar and demonstrations, South African  universities seem to have quieted down. The students were protesting a proposed  10% increase in fees for next year. Universities re-open here at the end of  January.The fee-hike proposal brought students at almost all the  universities onto the streets with their cry “
Fees Must Fall” (pronounced  “hashtag – fees must fall’). When the government canceled the 10% increase, the  student demands shifted to “free tertiary education.”The government then  promised that all monies would be found to ensure that the university fees don’t  increase next year. But where would the 2.7 billion rands come from? Easily  answered: Tax a sinking tax base even more. Remember the next year is two months  away! It seemed that the African Spring had sprung. Was it all over? On Friday  November 6, students at the University of Johannesburg defied a court order  barring them from going near their campus.The police were called in and  an unseemly brawl took place, resulting in 140 arrests students and staff. They  spent the night in jail, but were released the next day to a joyous reception  from their comrades.The University of Johannesburg started life as The  Rand Afrikaans University under the last white government and was known as a  bastion of apartheid. Now it has mostly black students. It is worth recalling  that a few years ago, this University and Ben Gurion University pledged to work  together on water development projects in South Africa.The project never  got underway. Pro-Palestinian (or more likely, anti-Israel) elements forced the  cancellation of the deal. Ironically, with South Africa facing a severe drought  and water shortage crisis, one wonders who the loser is.There has been a  lot of talk recently about climate change and global warming.Durban,  along the Kwa-Zulu Natal east coast, has a reputation for mild to hot weather  practically the whole year round. Even during the southern mid-winter, June to  August, when it is freezing inland, Durban people can go to the beaches. Many  don’t have winter coats, extra blankets, heavy sweaters or heaters in their  homes. “Winter?” they ask, “what’s that?” Yet in the last week in October,  Durban was “attacked” by cold gale-force winds emptying beaches and bending  trees over.Reports have been received of snow on the mountains less than  150 kilometers inland.
Snow? October? Something is wrong somewhere!  Perhaps the various discussions taking place should not be about global warming,  but rather about global freezing! With seagulls struggling to cope with the  plummeting temperatures, one wonders whether those who fly over Durban Bay might  be called baygulls – or bagels.

<title>South African Jewry: A personal account seen through the prism of Limmud FSU</title>
<date>18/10/2015</date>
<content>
My first exposure to Limmud FSU (although I had heard a great deal about it  before) was in 2005, when I led a group of Russian Jewish students from Russia  and Israel, together with my partner Sandra Cahn from New York, to Nottingham  University in the UK, to explore the possibility of adapting the Limmud model  for the tens of thousands of Russian-speaking Jews in the former Soviet  Union.Now, nearly 10 years later, Limmud FSU is up and running, not only  in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, but wherever there are large  concentrations of Russian- speaking Jews – in Israel, the US, Canada and most  recently in Australia. Over 35,000 people have attended our conferences and  festivals so far.




I was delighted and honored to be invited as a guest  presenter to speak about my long involvement with Soviet Jewry, at the recent  three-day Limmud conference held in Johannesburg and Cape Town in South Africa.  (There was also a one-day conference in Durban which I did not attend.) Although  I had visited South Africa before – in 1995 on behalf of United Israel Appeal,  when the country had just thrown off apartheid rule and I was head of the Jewish  Agency delegation to the former Soviet Union, this was my first opportunity to  meet and try to understand the country in more depth and the nature of the South  African Jewish community.The first disturbing conclusion that any  visiting Israeli must arrive at is the fact that there is a great deal of  anti-Israel rhetoric in the public sphere and a serious dichotomy between the  official South African attitude toward Israel and its relationship to Judaism,  and, by inference, with the local Jewish community.Obviously discounting  the Muslim world, it is my impression that South Africa is one of the most  anti-Israeli countries in the world today. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions  movement has managed to attract the support of high-profile members of the ANC  ruling party and influential people in civil society. The ANC hews to a strong  anti-Israel policy and is highly vocal in support of BDS, although it would seem  that Joseph Zuma, the president, who is by nature more of a pragmatist, is not  as strongly opposed as others on the extreme left of his party.Zuma and  his government continue to support a twostate solution and seem to be  withstanding pressures from the BDS lobby. Fuel is added to the flames by the  vociferous anti-Israel attitude of the deeply respected Archbishop Emeritus  Desmond Tutu, who just a year ago called for a worldwide boycott of Israel,  although he is prone to backtrack and deliver clarifications.Recently  the ANC, led by Obed Bapela, head of the ANC’s Committee on International  Relations, has been trying to introduce legislation which would preclude dual  nationality, although the government as a whole has distanced itself from the  proposal. One of the stated reasons behind the proposal is to prevent South  African citizens who also have Israeli nationality from joining the IDF. The  South African Jewish Board of Deputies and the Zionist Federation rejected these  attempts, stating: “[Mr. Bapela] has undermined the very core value of South  African democracy by proposing a change to our law purely to prevent one sector  of our society, in this case, South African Jews, from having a relationship  with Israel.”Although it is probably true to say that the vast majority  of South Africans have no interest or knowledge of Israel and might have a hard  time locating it on the map, in informed political circles, there is a growing  attempt to mobilize the highly volatile accusation of “apartheid” on behalf of  the Palestinian population, an accusation that naturally carries huge resonance  in South Africa (including among some prominent South African Jews). Moreover,  many South Africans remember that Israel took a highly ambivalent attitude to  apartheid and tried unhappily to sit on the fence when the whole world was  actively opposing it, and they have neither forgotten nor  forgiven.Historically, the Jews were never associated with the dominant  Afrikaner regime and its leadership. But the majority of the Jewish community  did not actively oppose apartheid although the anti-apartheid parties received a  high level of Jewish support. Many Jews were close associates of Nelson Mandela,  who died in 2013 and is still accorded a near saintly position in the country’s  pantheon; tangible evidence of this is the vast statue towering over Nelson  Mandela Square in Sandton, a wealthy area of Johannesburg, some 45 minutes from  the teeming black suburb of Soweto. In fact, Mandela’s first steps in the legal  profession were taken when he was hired as an articled clerk by the lawyer Lazar  Sidelsky in the 1940s – it was virtually unheard of at the time that a white  firm would take on a black clerk. That particular wheel came full circle when  Mandela, on his one and only visit to Israel (in 1999), met Barry Sidelsky, the  son of Lazar, who now lives in Israel. Another lawyer, Israel (Issie) Maisels,  was president of the South African Zionist Federation and defended 156 people,  including Mandela, in the notorious so-called “Treason Trial” of  1956.Mandela was apparently very offended that Israel was one of the  only countries that refrained from extending an official invitation to visit  after his release from prison in 1990. Two close associates and supporters of  Mandela, Arthur Goldreich, an artist and later head of industrial design at the  Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem and a fellow defendant in the  Treason Trial (he died in 2011), and the journalist Benjamin Pogrund, the former  deputy editor of the Rand Daily Mail, both came to live in Israel. In all, it is  estimated that some 20,000 South Africans have immigrated to Israel since the  establishment of the state.As I have said, there is a distinct and  palpable difference between the official ambivalent and often hostile attitude  toward the State of Israel, and that to the Jews and Judaism. We visited the  South African Jewish Museum of Jewish History in Cape Town, the benefactor of  which was Mendel Kaplan. (I had worked with Kaplan when, as chairman of the  Jewish Agency Board of Governors, he was active in the cause of the struggle of  Soviet Jewry.) We were impressed to see throngs of black, white and colored  children in organized visits to the museum, listening to their guide’s  explanations. Except for some few extreme voices, as in any other country, there  is very little evidence of anti-Semitism.On a visit to Constitution  Hill, the site of the highest constitutional court in Johannesburg built on the  remains of an old colonial prison, we saw a large display of animal bones,  simply titled “Gaza.” Our guide, a former Communist and anti-apartheid activist,  took pains to draw a parallel between Israel’s actions in Gaza as illustrated in  the so-called art work and the Nazis in the Second World War. We expressed our  outrage at his remarks. In the same building, we noticed among a display of  photographs of high court judges, one of Judge Richard Goldstone, author of the  ill-advised United Nations Goldstone Report that was issued in 2009 following  Operation Cast Lead,” the war in Gaza in 2008-09.When I commented on  this to our Jewish guide, we were shocked and surprised to hear him say  emphatically that “Goldstone was a zaddik [righteous person] who should get the  Nobel Prize.” When I pointed out the false claims of so-called apartheid  policies directed against Israel, the guide said, “Goldstone revealed the true  apartheid face of Israel.” When I reminded him that in fact, Goldstone had  himself retracted part of his findings in 2011, the guide denied it and said  Goldstone had stood his ground.At Limmud Johannesburg, we met David  Bilchitz, who is a professor of law at the University of Johannesburg and  current chairman of Limmud International. He told us that he and a group of  volunteers visited Limmud UK in 2005 (by coincidence, the same year as my first  visit). After two years of planning, the first South African Limmud events were  held in Johannesburg and Cape Town in August 2007. In Johannesburg the one day  event had received 200 preregistrations but on the day, 400 people turned up.  Since then the growth has been exponential – 700 in 2008 and 1,000 by 2009.  Johannesburg changed to a multiday residential event in 2011, as did Cape Town.  This year, the 10th anniversary, there were 1,000 in Johannesburg, including 450  day visitors, 700 in Cape Town and 220 in Durban.Wayne Sussman, chairman  of Limmud South Africa says, “Limmud SA had a massive impact. There were over  550 crammed into the hotel in Johannesburg for Shabbat. Hundreds more came on  the Sunday. In Cape Town the hotel was so packed that there was not enough space  to accommodate them. Durban had its biggest turnout in the last few years. The  general feedback from all three communities was overwhelmingly positive. We have  grown among the Orthodox part of our community but at the same time there was a  strong turnout of those who would define themselves as secular and/or on the  Left. Most of our volunteers and leaders are young people."Limmud SA  attracts the mainstream, the fringe, the core and the  periphery," Bilchitz says, “Limmud has transformed the South African  community. Whereas most events cater only to a particular segment of Jews,  Limmud SA allows individuals to experience the full richness that comes from  celebrating the diverse range of Jewish experience and  understanding.""Limmud not only builds bridges, but it has also brought a  creativity and stimulation that has re-energized the community. Limmud is doing  in South Africa what it is doing across the world today in 40 countries. It is  providing an answer to the question of what an open positive modern [Jewish]  identity looks like.”And yet, not everything is sweetness and light. It  was my impression that the average age of participants was substantially older  than in other Limmud events across the world (although it should be noted that  many whole families attended). This might well be because some young people tend  to leave to study at universities abroad – especially in the US, Australia and  Canada and do not return – leading to an aging population.South Africa  practices reverse discrimination so that a white student has to be especially  gifted to be accepted to a leading university. Evidently, however, the average  age at Limmud was lower than in other community events and activities in the  country.The Orthodox rabbinate in South Africa is highly conservative  and in fact the chief rabbi of South Africa, Rabbi Warren Goldstein, issued an  edict calling on all Orthodox rabbis to refrain from attending  Limmud.Dr. Goldstein even set up a very successful competing event  called Sinai Indaba – literally “Meeting” in the Zulu language, suggesting  family interconnectivity.This Torah-based meet is the biggest event for  South African Jewry today, attracting nearly 7,000 people. It is only fair to  point out that Dr. Goldstein is by no means an anti-Zionist. His concern is to  keep and build up a viable Jewish community in South Africa.Sussman says  that there has been a distinct turn towards religion in the country, especially  in Johannesburg.“The community has always been traditional but there has  been a turn to religion since the 1980s with more people observing Shabbat and  the festivals and keeping kosher. The majority of the community that goes to  synagogue at all, chooses an Orthodox one.”This Orthodox attitude to  Limmud has always been the case even in the UK, its birthplace. The highly  regarded former British chief rabbi, Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks refused to  participate in or even visit Limmud, although his successor, Chief Rabbi Ephraim  Mirvis, to his great credit, did participate last year.Nevertheless,  Limmud events are still boycotted by many of the Orthodox community – including  haredi rabbis – this is the case not only in the UK and South Africa, but even  in the former Soviet Union. Orthodox rabbis still cannot come to grips with the  open-minded egalitarian, pluralistic and liberal character of Limmud  events.But having said that and as we saw for ourselves, the fact is  that many kippa wearing observant people are actually actively participating in  Limmud events despite the rabbis – in South Africa as elsewhere.So I ask  myself, is there a long-term future for the Jews of South Africa? On the one  hand, the Jews do not suffer from any form of discrimination or anti-Semitism  and are fully a part of South African life – in business, in the professions, in  studies, in society. On the other, there are few Jewish families in the country  that do not have close family living abroad. I cannot foresee where the Jewish  community might be in 30 or 50 years’ time – or even the South African white  population in general.For all the benefits of living in what must be one  of the most beautiful lands on earth, the country is beset by violence which  affects blacks and whites equally so that many of those who are economically  well-off, necessarily live behind high walls and in security guarded gated  compounds. Perhaps South Africa will follow in the footsteps of neighboring  Botswana where a working modus vivendi has been achieved among the various  ethnic strands of the population.Wayne Sussman tells us confidently:  “Yes, there is a future for South African Jewry. There is no doubt that our  country and our community face major challenges. There is load shedding, our  economic growth is way below its potential and many of our core industries are  struggling.At the same time, most of the community is middle  class.They are able to send their kids to good schools, and this of  course, includes the Jewish day schools which are being turned into modern  educational facilities which will compete with the best schools. In 2016 a  Holocaust and Genocide Museum will open in Johannesburg. There will continue to  be great business opportunities in South Africa and in the whole African  continent.”
Prof. Bilchitz sums it up, “The South African constitution  holds out the dream of a nation that is unified across its diversity and  guarantees dignity and respect for all. Jews are one important strand of the  tapestry that makes up this great country with a long and proud history of  making a difference. Whilst there are some challenges South Africa is facing, I  hope that Jews will be part of addressing these and helping contribute to the  country’s development.”

<title>South African ties</title>
<date>30/4/2015</date>
<content>
On Monday, South Africa celebrated the 21st Freedom Day, which commemorates the  country’s first post-apartheid election, when non-whites received full voting  rights.The celebrations at the South African embassies in Tel Aviv and  Ramallah were marred, however, by Israel’s decision to prevent Blade Nzimande,  South Africa’s minister for higher education and training, from entering either  Israel or areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority.




In a speech on  Tuesday in Ramallah, Mlungisi W. Makalima, South Africa’s representative to the  PA, criticized Israel’s decision to block Nzimande’s from attending the  inauguration of special relations between Bir Zeit University and Johannesburg  University.The move, he said, “has done nothing to dampen the  determination to reap the benefits of this agreement” between the  universities.
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}South African Ambassador to Israel Sisa Ngombane, who is  based in Tel Aviv, said his country’s representatives were “disappointed” by  Israel’s decision.Some leaders of South Africa’s Jewish community also  criticized the move. Both the Jewish Board of Deputies and the Zionist  Federation called the diplomatic flap “regrettable,” arguing that “regular  interaction between Israel and South Africa and mutual visits of political  leaders, parliamentarians and government officials, as well as business people,  media, tourists and family visits, are to the benefit of both South Africa and  Israel and foster greater understanding between the two countries.”While  we agree in principal with these Jewish leaders and with the South African  diplomats, it is important to note that there is a wider context to Israel’s  decision.“In many respects I felt that Israeli apartheid is worse than  South African apartheid,” Nzimande said last August during a speech at the  University of Johannesburg, according to the Daily Maverick. Nzimande, who was  recalling a trip he had made to Israel a decade before, said that Israel’s  ambassador to South Africa should be expelled and that South Africa’s ambassador  to Israel should be recalled. He made the comments at a time when the IDF was in  the Gaza Strip, locating and destroying terrorist tunnels and rocket launchers  used by Hamas to attack Israeli civilians.Nzimande supported the  decision in 2011 by the University of Johannesburg to end academic cooperation  with Ben-Gurion University. The cooperation, which began in August 2009, focused  on helping South Africa improve its water purification and micro-algal  biotechnology research.Nzimande, who is the South African Communist  Party’s general secretary, has said in the past that his party would boycott  Woolworths for carrying Israeli products.Still, we have argued in the  past – for instance in 2010 when Noam Chomsky was denied entry to deliver a  speech at Bir Zeit University – that even the most caustic critics of Israel  should be allowed into Israel.Part of the reason is that it makes good  sense. Nzimande would have received just a fraction of the media attention he  enjoyed if Israel would have simply allowed him to visit Bir Zeit University,  attend Freedom Day celebrations at the Movenpick Hotel in Ramallah and visit  other locations in the West Bank.Also, by banning Nzimande, Israel gives the  impression it is being spiteful or petty or has something to  hide.Instead, it should show both Palestinians and South Africans its  willingness to be open to even the most reprehensible opinions, such as  Nzimande’s position that the situation in the West Bank is “worse than South  African apartheid.”In the end it is not Nzimande but rather the South  African government that determines the country’s policies vis-à-vis Israel. And  as long as there are full diplomatic relations between the countries, ministers  should be permitted into areas under Israeli control.South Africa has  much to gain from cooperation with Israel. As the country enters its third  decade since making the transition from apartheid to democracy, South Africa  faces many challenges, from overcoming grinding poverty to increasing literacy,  from improving health standards to developing natural and human  resources.
It would a shame if a distorted view of the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict led South Africans to further weaken fruitful  cooperation with Israel, a country that has much.

<title>Success and pitfalls of Palestinian anti-normalization</title>
<date>31/5/2015</date>
<content>
On May 28 a Jerusalem Hug event near Damascus Gate was attacked by a half-dozen  Arab men who claimed to be “anti-normalization” activists. Arab media reported  that youths were trying to “prevent the establishment of effective normalization  near Damascus Gate and the Aqsa mosque.”Evidently this was viewed as a  successful “direct action” to stop the “normalizers.”




The attack on the  peace event is the latest in a string of actions taken against coexistence and  peace groups. The “anti-normalization” agenda is a fascinating phenomenon. At  the same time that Palestinian officials work with Israeli officials in the  international arena, on issues such as getting the PA to drop its bid to suspend  Israel from FIFA, on the ground local young activists think they are stopping  “normalization.” So what is anti-normalization? What is its logic? Is it  successful? The crusade against normalization has as its central theory that  Israel uses moderate and peace-minded Palestinians to create a veneer of  normalcy. When Jerusalem Fatah leader Ahmad al-Ghoul spoke with Ma’an news about  why he opposed the Jerusalem Hug event, he claimed that the organization had  “deceived Palestinians into joining it by luring them [with] permits to enter  Jerusalem.” He argued that coexistence or peace organizations like this “equate  the victim and the executioner and show the world a picture of Palestinians and  Israelis living in peace and love.”
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}In the worldview of  anti-normalization the theory is that while peace activists holding hands next  to Damascus Gate and singing brings together Jews and Arabs in an example of  coexistence, this makes Israeli rule appear benign.The main thrust of  anti-normalization activists is devoted to pressuring Palestinians not to  cooperate with Israeli Jews. Professor Mohammed Dajani fell afoul of this in  March 2014 when he took students from Al-Quds University to visit Auschwitz. He  told an interviewer at Moment Magazine what happened next: “Students marched to  my office holding placards that said ‘depart you normalizer’ and handed my  secretary a letter warning me not to come back to the university.”Dajani  was critiqued in the Palestinian media. In another interview the professor noted  that while Palestinians do not object to organizations that discuss moderation  and peace, “They are against normalization of relations with Israel and the  Israelis. But you cannot disconnect one from the other... if you believe in  moderation you believe in peace and reconciliation... you can’t make peace with  the other without dialogue with the other.”But the anti-normalization  agenda says it is better to sever relations with Israelis entirely, whether it  is academic cooperation, peace hugs, research or anything.A Palestinian  woman who works with Israeli peace activists and appeared on a radio show hosted  by Israelis told me she was criticized by her friends as a  “normalizer.”“They said I should cut off all ties with Israelis and  Jews,” she said.The violent attack on the hug event was indicative that  those who think they are opposing “normalization” often can’t tell the  difference between Palestinians, Israelis, Jews or foreign activists.The  men who showed up and assaulted people attacked indiscriminately film crews,  European activists, Palestinians from the Jericho area. It didn’t  matter.TO REALLY understand what is at play in the anti-normalization  agenda one needs to go back to the Oslo years. When there was a vibrant  two-state concept, Palestinian civil society felt it could work with Israelis  toward that goal. In the old days before the intifada and the construction of  the separation barrier (often called “security barrier” by Israel or “apartheid  wall” by Palestinians), there was a great deal of mingling between Palestinians  and Israeli Jews. But the second intifada changed all that and many Palestinian  activists came to see even the most moderate peace groups as actually  functioning as an extension of Israeli policy to keep Palestinians as  permanently without a state and under control of Israel.The Palestinian  Campaign for Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) is very clear:  normalization is “the participation in any project, initiative or activity in  Palestine or internationally that aims to bring together Palestinians and  Israelis without placing as its goals resistance and exposure of the Israeli  occupation and oppression against the Palestinian people.” PACBI argues that any  work involving dialogue or reconciliation is unacceptable because it is not in  the framework of struggle against Israel’s actions. Ironically, the real targets  of their manifesto (which is worth reading in full online) are other peace  groups like OneVoice, which clearly support a twostate solution.It is  surprising to those who think they are helping Palestinians to realize how deep  this animosity goes. An article about Balata refugee camp in Nablus in Haaretz  quoted a nurse as saying “part of the effort to normalize the occupation is  these tempting offers of medical or economic cooperation. The Israelis know we  need this in order to improve our lives and it also helps their image inside  Israel and abroad.” Thus Israeli groups trying to provide medical care for  Palestinians are portrayed as doing it primarily for propaganda purposes and  “normalizing” the situation.The real story is that there is a total  disconnect between Israeli Jewish society and Palestinian society. The total  separation of these societies, that accelerated during the intifada, is almost  complete.Jewish Israelis don’t go to Palestinian areas, they don’t have  Palestinian friends and they don’t have Palestinian colleagues.The tiny  bits of contact are seen as “normalizing.” The events Israelis hold in which  they think they are supporting Palestinians, like holding a party complete with  beer in Tel Aviv to “support the South Hebron Hills,” or posting on Facebook to  help a Palestinian who needs medical treatment in Gaza, take place in a cocoon.  They “help” Palestinians they never meet.Some of the logic behind the  critique of the coexistence groups can be understood.Israeli coexistence  groups that run programs in the West Bank take place at the behest of the  Israelis. Palestinians can’t go to Tel Aviv to participate usually, so they  feel, in the words of one, “like we are in a zoo and people come to coexist with  us when they want. Then we go back in the cage and they go home.”Another  part of the story behind anti-normalization is that it is basically a middle  class phenomenon of ideologically educated activists and elite intellectuals, or  what was once called the “haute bourgeoisie.” Poor Palestinians, some tens of  thousands of whom travel to work in Israel, are not accused of normalization,  nor do they care about normalization.At the same time the governing  officials of the Palestinian Authority know they must interact with Israeli  authorities over everything from receiving tax payments to water and security  issues. As much as they might hate that cooperation, it takes place daily, as  evidenced by Jabril Rajoub’s negotiations that resulted in a climbdown from the  FIFA suspension demand. Of course for doing so he was ridiculed on social media  and said to be “working with the Zionist enemy” on Facebook, but he was not a  “normalizer.”So the targets of normalization become academics, and a few  pockets of Palestinians here and there who want to engage in dialogue work. The  real massive infrastructure of Israeli-Palestinian interaction, whether it is  workers, cement companies, electricity, hospitals, fire departments, and things  like that are not part of the “normalization” story, even though if you read  through the PACBI and similar statements, they logically would be. That’s  because while some people in Balata may be annoyed that a peace group helps a  Palestinian child and then brags about it abroad, they aren’t actually annoyed  when a child needs emergency care and is transported by the Red Crescent to  Jerusalem.One Red Crescent volunteer said it made him physically sick to  have to go through the checkpoints and deal with Israelis, but the greater  desire of seeing a person in need receive treatment justified it.In  Jerusalem, anti-normalization activists will sometimes target Palestinians who  want to study at Hebrew University or work in West Jerusalem at a good  job.But blue-collar workers who wash dishes are not castigated.  Normalization due to necessity is acceptable; normalization due to choice is  seen as a demon.For most Israelis it doesn’t matter, because they are  not interested anyway in coexistence or peace work or academic collaboration.  There is almost a schadenfreude mentality that sees the “peaceniks getting what  they deserve,” when peace groups are attacked. That feeds a cycle of “see, look  what the Palestinians are, we told you so.”The question for Palestinians  should be what is being accomplished through anti-normalization. It has been  almost 10 years of trying to prevent normalization.Most contacts with  Israelis are at a bare minimum. Yet the goal of opposing Israel’s policies is  not being achieved.
The Israeli partners have been ditched, the  international partners have let the Palestinians down. Anti-normalization may  have run its course. But to what end? Follow the author on Twitter @Sfrantzman

<title>Suggestions for the anti-Semitic slurs list</title>
<date>16/11/2015</date>
<content>
Toward the end of the year, the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) will be publishing  again its annual list of leading perpetrators of major anti-Semitic and  anti-Israeli slurs and incidents. This list serves as a principal address for  identifying these perpetrators and to some extent bringing them to account. My  suggestions as to whom to include are as follows: The European Union is a  foremost candidate for the SWC list, primarily because of its actions against  Israel and its negligence in fighting anti-Semitism. Here are but a few examples  of such actions and negligence: The EU has chosen to identify and label products  from the Golan Heights and the disputed territories on the West Bank alone,  ignoring the products of other occupied and disputed territories in the world,  such as the Western Sahara, Kashmir, Tibet and many more. This use of double  standards against Israel typifies modern anti-Israelism, and has been at the  core of anti-Semitism for many centuries.




More than 40 percent of EU  citizens of 16 years and older agree with the statement that Israel is  conducting a war of extermination against the Palestinians. This is not only a  sign of Europe’s ongoing moral deterioration, it is also partly the result of  official EU incitement against Israel and the lack of action against  anti-Israelism.The number of anti-Semitic incidents in many of the EU’s  member countries has been increasing for years.The European Fundamental  Rights Agency (FRA) has not even succeeded in obtaining basic data on  anti-Semitic incidents from all EU member countries. The FRA has also removed  the European definition of anti-Semitism from its website. The existence of such  a definition is an essential prerequisite for a coherent European strategy to  battle anti-Semitism. Furthermore many EU countries bring in refugees from  countries where extreme anti-Semitism is rife. These immigrants are not even  asked to sign a declaration that they will adhere to standards of democratic  behavior.Another prime candidate for the 2015 list of slurs is the  British Labour Party. More than 250,000 voters supported its new leader, Jeremy  Corbyn. He thus obtained an absolute majority in the first round of the  leadership elections.Corbyn has called Hamas and Hezbollah his  friends.He received funds from Ted Honderich, a promoter of anti-Israel  violence, and only distanced himself from this retired academic when his  donation became public. Notably, Corbyn did not return the money. He also  appeared together with Holocaust denier Paul Eisen and donated to his charity  Deir Yassin Remembered, an extremist organization.The Jewish Chronicle  has raised many additional questions about Corbyn’s positions.Veteran  Jewish Labor MP Gerald Kaufman deserves a place on the SWC list in his own  right. He has claimed that “Jewish money, Jewish donations to the Conservative  Party” have led to a Conservative pro-Israel “bias.”Kaufman has also  accused Israel of fabricating over half of the stabbing attacks of civilians by  terrorists in Jerusalem.He fomented further controversy earlier this  year when he said that Israel uses the Holocaust to justify murdering  Palestinians. In the past Kaufman has likened Israelis to Nazis. Even Corbyn has  had to condemn some of Kaufman’s remarks.A further candidate is Denmark.  Its previous government brought in a ban on the religious slaughter of animals  for the production of halal and kosher meat.This squeamishness is  somewhat surprising, since Copenhagen has for long been the bestiality capital  of Europe and has attracted many tourists mainly visiting to have sex with  animals. Legislation against this practice was only enacted this year. The  Copenhagen zoo slaughtered Marius, an 18-month old giraffe, because his genes  were considered too common for breeding purposes. Similarly, they also killed  and publicly dissected a healthy lion for “educational” purposes, with many  children in attendance to learn from this morally and educationally highly  questionable form of entertainment.Another candidate for the SWC list is  the Norwegian daily Dagbladet, a paper with a long record of printing  anti-Israel hate cartoons and articles. This year, among other such offerings,  it published a comic strip likening Israel to Nazis and North  Korea.Jeremiah Wright is an American Christian inciter-pastor.In  August he participated in a rally with the leader of the Nation of Islam  Reverend Louis Farakhan, who has already merited a mention in a previous SWC  list of anti-Semitic slurs. Wright called Israel an apartheid state and said  that “Jesus was a Palestinian.” This hate-monger should be included in the list  of slurs, especially since in the past he served as pastor to US President  Barack Obama and his wife Michelle for many years.Finally it would be  worthwhile for the SWC to introduce the option of lifetime nomination for repeat  offenders, who produce an unabating flow of anti-Semitic slurs and incitement.  One possible candidate for this mention is the South African Jewish cartoonist  Zapiro. His anti-Israel cartoons include comparisons of Gaza 2014 to the German  bombing of the Spanish village Guernica in 1937, drawing parallels between the  pogroms and the Holocaust with Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians. The  caricatures also reflect the suggestion that South African Jews are brainwashed  by Zionism. Zapiro’s cartoons frequently allude to anti-Semitic libel such as  claims that Israel is guilty of trying to destroy mosques on the Temple Mount  and also depict the idea that the US blindly follows Jewish and Israeli  interests.There are still a few weeks before the list is published and  additional extreme slurs will probably find their way into the press. If other  commentators also publicize their recommendations for inclusion in the SWC list  this can be of great help in increasing public debate and awareness regarding  particularly prominent anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli slurs. Thus this list can  become even more widely known as the principal address for identifying such  smears.

<title>Terra Incognita: Isolate anti-Semitism on campus, don’t exaggerate it</title>
<date>1/3/2015</date>
<content>
"We do experience a lot of anti-Semitism in a lot of different ways,” says a student in the video “Jewish Voices on Campus,” posted on Youtube by Aaron Goldenberg. His is one of many testimonies of Jewish students speaking out about intimidation they feel on campus.Some tell tales of people stomping on Israeli flags. A student at one university says he is afraid to walk by himself on campus sometimes. Orthodox students are reported to remove their kippot. A student says he is confronted by “hate rhetoric” of pro-Palestine groups who shout “free, free Palestine.” A student from the University of Oregon recalls that in July 2014 someone painted swastikas on fraternity mailboxes.




The trend in many Jewish- and Israel-centered media outlets is to discuss a “rising trend of anti-Semitism on campus” and the phenomenon of Jewish students feeling threatened and intimidated. An online survey by Professor Barry Kosmin and Associate Professor Ariela Kaysar and released by Trinity College’s Louis D. Brandeis Center found that 54 percent of students said they had experienced or witnessed anti-Semitism on campus in the past year. The students volunteered for the survey and “anti-Semitism” was self-defined by those answering the survey.The website Jpupdates.com, which covers Jewish political news, reported on February 25 about a survey conducted by well known pollster Frank Luntz. According to the report his survey of 800 students at 60 of America’s best universities found that “40% believe that anti-Semitism is a problem on campus. 30% believe campuses are hostile to Israel. 25% believe the student body is pro-Palestinian.”
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}

A video posted by Step Up for Israel called “Crossing the Line 2: The New Face of Anti-Semitism on Campus” claims that “pro-Israel students who want to stand up against BDS feel that their voices are not heard.” The video highlights an Ohio University event where the student senate president poured a bucket of fake blood onto her head to protest Israel in a video.The Ohio incident is a microcosm of the debate on how anti-Israel behavior constitutes a threat to Jewish students.Becky Sebo told Haaretz, “Jewish students in particular are feeling very singled out by the video. Many Jewish students are feeling concerned about their safety and how other students will respond to these accusations against Israel.” Rabbi Danielle Leshaw, director of Hillel, claimed the video “makes Jewish parents want to bring their kids back home to the safety of the Jewish suburbs.”THE STORY we are being told is that supposedly rising levels of anti-Israel activity on campus are making Jewish students “feel unsafe.” Almost every week there are stories in newspapers about anti-Semitic incidents. On February 27 swastikas were discovered in a dorm at George Washington University where there are 3,000 Jewish students.On February 26 Chabad Rabbi Dov Hillel Klein told a radio show on Voice of Israel hosted by Gil Hoffman that “Jews are starting to feel uncomfortable” after Northwestern University students passed a boycott motion against some companies in Israel.The radio program’s title is emblematic of the exaggeration inherent in these reports: “Has Northwestern University become unsafe for Jews?” Of course the answer is no. Why would a boycott motion against a few companies doing business in Israel passed by a student council make an entire university “unsafe”? How is a Jewish student more unsafe the day after such a motion is passed? There are around 200,000 Jewish students studying on campuses in America. According to a list by Jewish Studies at San Diego State University, many schools have huge Jewish student populations. NYU has 6,000 Jewish undergraduates, constituting 28% of the student body. Harvard is estimated to be 25% Jewish. The University of Maryland has 5,000 Jewish students and is 23% Jewish.Let’s step back. Consider the case of the University of Cincinnati student who claimed that he was threatened by anti-Semitism because he heard about a sign saying “with Jews you lose” by someone “running for office.”That person was Robert Ransdell, who was running for US Senate in Kentucky. His sign was anti-Semitic, but it affects Jews living in Kentucky who aren’t in university just as much as it supposedly affects students at the University of Cincinnati. Why would students feel especially threatened? The fact is that when you set out to make a documentary about anti-Semitism on campus, you will find the students who want to talk about anti-Semitism. You will find highlights of the worst incidents. America tends to encourage and reward groups that highlight being victims, and in such a culture you will find people who want to discuss being victims. But just because people answer “yes” on a survey doesn’t mean that an objective study of anti-Semitism would show that it has increased.Consider the 200,000 Jewish students, the campuses that have a vibrant and massive amount of Jewish life. Are these students really threatened? The reality is that Jews are safer on US college campuses than anywhere else in the world.The decision by many groups to turn almost every act of aggressive pro-Palestinian activism into a form of “new anti-Semitism” has encouraged Jews to feel that every time they see a pro-Palestinian rally, hear a professor talk about Israeli “apartheid” or hear of a BDS motion, they are witnessing anti-Semitism. But the reality is that those same students, if they moved to Israel, would find many professors who call Israel an apartheid state and even some who support boycotts. So are Israeli students also running in fear from anti-Semitism? Shulamit Aloni, the former education minister of Israel, Israel Prize winner and longtime Knesset member, claimed Israel is an apartheid state. According to the view that critics of Israel are stoking anti-Semitism, Aloni would have been considered a threat to Jewish students on campus.Many of the radical pro-Palestinian voices on US campuses are themselves Jewish. In the wake of the Gaza war last year Jewish Voice for Peace, which supports BDS, claimed to expect more than a dozen campus chapters to open. That’s not necessarily anti-Semitism, but could be pro-Israel students being made to feel uncomfortable by other students, some of whom are also Jewish.It seems essential that rather than exaggerate the levels of anti-Semitism on Campus, actual anti-Jewish incidents, like an attack on a Jewish fraternity house at UC Davis, need to be confronted, condemned and the perpetrators brought to justice. The inflammatory reports on these varied and rare incidents cause large numbers of students to feel threatened, when not only are they secure but probably living in the best and safest time in history to be a Jewish student on a university campus in the US.Some Jewish students claim that high levels of anti-Israel activity make them feel uncomfortable expressing their affinity with Israel. But rather than shrinking in fear, they should be encouraged to be outspoken in their support and to document instances of actual anti-Semitism at pro-Palestinian events, like people shouting “Hitler was right.” Don’t conflate all of it; a few dozen BDS students shouting “free Palestine” is not an anti-Semitic event.Lumping all of it together allows the actual anti-Semitism to go unpunished.A university student who once over four years hears someone make one anti-Semitic joke may truthfully answer on a survey that they have witnessed anti-Semitism on campus. However, before and after college they are equally likely to hear an anti-Jewish comment, or encounter a swastika painted somewhere. They are not actually suffering more anti-Semitism on campus, in fact they are probably suffering less.Let’s do a better job reporting, explaining and examining the levels of anti-Semitism and calling out those incidents that must be addressed, rather than unintentionally exaggerating and turning campuses into places of fear.

<title>Terra Incognita: The downside of the Rabin myth and cult</title>
<date>26/10/2015</date>
<content>
When I was in high school I painted a portrait of Yitzhak Rabin on a large  canvas. It’s a strange black and white painting, that bears little resemblance  to the original photo it was taken from.Today’s mythmakers and their  fellow-travelers abroad who never met Rabin invent tales about him, painting a  caricature of this man that also bears little resemblance to reality – and is  not healthy for Israel.




“Yitzhak Rabin was a great man, a great soldier,  a great prime minister, above all a great leader.” These words, written by  national director of the Anti-Defamation League Jonathan Greenblat, could well  have been written by any number of the commentators who this week will eulogize  Israel’s murdered prime minister. You can tell a lot about a culture and a  nation by how it mourns.In Israel there is an annual event associated  with the anniversary of Rabin’s death, and with this twentieth anniversary there  is an entire week of mourning events, television programs and commentary devoted  to it.It’s hard to understand some of it. Professor Yedidia Stern, vice president of the Israeli Democracy Institute, sees  the killing as a failure of Judaism to respond to the re-creation of a sovereign  Jewish state. There is a huge amount of collective guilt and shame and desire to  seek scapegoats and find those responsible. At the same time there is a massive  industry of hagiography. At its worst it reads like talking points from a North  Korean television series on Kim Il-sung, the “great leader”: if not for him the  state would not exist, the perfect man, infallible, honorable in victory,  dignified in defeat, strong, courageous, articulate, modest, mild-mannered,  heroic, handsome, great soldier, academic, intellectual, strong of will but  caring and loving, family man, brilliant orator and politician.  Caesar.Maybe what Rabin has needed over the years is less of the  honorifics and more nuanced understanding.The admiration for Rabin and  the way in which his memory is transmitted in Israel and among some in the  Diaspora Jewish community tends to be tinged with a rose-colored melancholy for  a lost Israel. This is tied up in nostalgia for the mythological Old Left that  once ruled Israel. In some ways it is reminiscent of the old American obsession  with John F. Kennedy and Camelot, the ridiculous narrative of Oliver Stone,  namely that if only JFK had lived, the Vietnam War would not have happened. But  subsequent years have shown JFK’s myth to be fragile. American politics moved on  from the old hatreds between Richard Nixon and Kennedy. Israel’s politics can’t  move on.Surveys in Israel continually show that Israelis are losing  touch with Rabin’s legacy. A recent Ma’ariv poll revealed that only 65 percent  of respondents thought Yigal Amir killed Rabin. Other data shows large segments  of the population pay no heed to Rabin. Yossi Sarid claims that this is part of  the “second assassination” of Rabin, his being forgotten.The Left holds  on to Rabin wishing for the revival of its cause, but in so doing clutches his  legacy so tight as to make it impossible for other sectors of the population to  take part. Some on the Left, perhaps many, still hold hatred toward Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom they blame for creating a “climate of  hostility” in the lead-up to the murder.Sarid noted that when Netanyahu  came to the Yitzhak Rabin Center for an event marking the Entebbe raid earlier  this year he didn’t offer “a single word of commemoration, let alone expression  of regret or asking for forgiveness.”This section of Israel lives in the  past; they still see the rallies before the murder, when “Bibi riled up cohorts  on the balcony” in Zion Square in Jerusalem, and Rabin was portrayed in an SS  uniform. It’s understandable they don’t want to “forgive or forget,” but it  means Israel is held hostage to 1995.When those like Sarid all claim  that Rabin’s policies were “buried with him,” it seems that the death of the  two-state solution is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Only Rabin could bring about  two states, he died, so Israel will fail now. You can see in foreign op-eds the  slowly emerging feeling that Israel has no future. Two professors write at The  Washington Post that real Zionists must boycott Israel and force it to leave the  West Bank, while Assaf Gavron claims the country is on a “downward spiral into a  savage and unrepairable society.” The death of Rabin is intricately linked to  the alienation that many Israelis and Liberal Zionists in the Diaspora feel from  Israel. It feeds a kind of self-flagellating cult, a religion of inescapable  Israeli failure.THE PROBLEM is that the entire edifice is based on bad  history. For instance, Lev Grinberg writing at +972 claims that when Rabin died  he was hit by “three bullets that killed Israel’s left wing bloc.” In this  narrative Israel’s “left wing” parties consisted of Labor, Meretz and “the Arab  parties” and only Rabin could have brought this together. “Rabin brought them  [Arab parties] in, and his assassination shoved them out.”Peter Beinart  also believes this story, claiming in an article “that between 1992 and 1995,  Yitzhak Rabin, [was] the one Israeli prime minister who forged an alliance with  the Arab parties.”Which Arab parties were those? There was only one Arab  party in the Knesset after the 1992 elections, the Arab Democratic Party led by  Abdul Wahab Darawshe. The other “Arab” party was Hadash, which is a joint  Jewish-Arab communist party. According to the Historical Dictionary of the  Arab-Israeli Conflict, “Despite its desire and efforts, Prime Minister Yitzhak  Rabin was not prepared to include the ADP as part of the ruling coalition.” The  Knesset website confirms that the ADP and Hadash were not part of his  government. The ADP did support the Oslo Accords in the Knesset and was able to  obtain some financial support for education in the Arab minority sector in  Israel.Was that Yitzhak Rabin’s great “alliance” with “Arab parties”?  More like a political deal with one Arab party.The modern narrative of  Beinart and others doesn’t need to fact-check whether it was “Arab parties” or  “party” because the main thing is to look at 1995 through the lens of 2015.  Today in Israel the Joint List consists of several Arab parties, so it must have  been the same back then.Yossi Sarid, who speaks so highly of Rabin now,  didn’t have the same view in 1990. According to a New York Times article that  year, as an MK and leader of the Citizen’s Right’s Movement he said, “The  testimony from dozens of soldiers has made one thing clear: The soldiers and  officers in the field heard the Defense Minister [Yitzhak Rabin] and top-ranking  officers instruct them to beat Palestinians in a policy of punishment and  deterrence.”It turns out Rabin had ordered “force, might and beatings”  as a response to the Palestinian intifada. If Netanyahu said the same today he’d  be called a radical right-wing racist.Beatings were Rabin’s solution to  stone throwing, not arrests, just beatings and brute force.Robert  Slater, writing in Rabin: Twenty Years After, notes: “While Israelis did not  appreciate the turmoil and suffering, embittered as they had been forced into  killing and beating up Palestinians, they supported Rabin’s tough  stance.”Rabin disliked the settlements, to which in a recently released  1976 recording appearing in the documentary In his own words he refers to as a  “cancer.” But it wasn’t mere settlement beyond the Green Line Rabin had a  problem with. The “cancer” he saw was people taking the “law into their own  hands” and settling a “crappy insignificant place” in the West Bank. Settlements  in the Golan or Jordan Valley or strategic areas were good strategy, unlike the  right-wing “believers” who “if we don’t want to get to apartheid, a million and  a half [more] Arabs inside a Jewish state,” had to be stopped.Bad  strategy bothered him. As defense minister he complained that the IDF, in having  to run around “450 villages in the West Bank,” could not bring its strength to  bear. “Handling an entire population we cannot use the IDF’s principal weapons,”  he said. He understood that fighting people armed with stones and knives was  turning the army into the very thing he had ordered it to be, a force that meted  out beatings. But in his dealings the government was pragmatic, trying to stymie  new construction over the Green Line in a November 22, 1992 cabinet decision and  then allowing loopholes in 1993.Rabin was not a great leader, he was a  decent leader.He wasn’t a brilliant military commander. At least he was  honest about himself. In 1992, suffering political critiques that he was a drunk  who couldn’t handle pressure, he told Hadashot that he had suffered a  “breakdown” on the eve of the Six Day War. His hagiographers today could be more  honest. There won’t be another Rabin. The invented Rabin so often heard of today  never existed. But Israel does exist and they would do well to work on the  project at hand, than chiseling on a statue to adorn it when it’s  gone.

<title>Terra incognita: The myth and madness of the ‘white tribe’</title>
<date>26/4/2015</date>
<content>
In an ‘Independence Day special’ the  website Walla published an “introduction to the new tribes of Israel.” It read  like a sort of 19th century travel guide, like some great European explorer’s  racially-tinged descriptions of his encounters with the natives. The tribes that  Walla “discovered” included the haredim (ultra-Orthodox), National Religious,  Arabs, Russians, Mizrahim and “the white tribe.”The odd article, in  which it defined the “white tribe” as consisting of “elite, secular, Ashkenazi”  Israelis, might be taken to be a kind of a purimspiel or April Fool’s joke if  the issue wasn’t so deadly serious. The concept of white tribalism is not an  invention of one website, but rather a growing trend in Israel.




Ravit  Hecht, writing at Haaretz on April 22, discussed the feelings of the Israeli  Left, “who felt [they] had been punished by a ‘tribal vote,’” and referenced the  “white Ashkenazi camp.”See the latest opinion pieces on our       Opinion & Blogs Facebook      page 

 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;} In many countries the concept of race, ethnicity  and especially the concept of being a member of a proud “white” group has been  challenged in recent decades. But in Israel it has gone the opposite way, such  that pride in being a member of a mythological “white tribe” is growing. Israeli  Hebrew publications, particularly in the political Center and Left, use this  term often. It is important to understand what they mean and to confront their  terminology.The “white tribe” concept is not always clearly understood  by those who employ it.Nehemia Shtrasler, an economics commentator,  discussed the politics of the “white tribe” and its views of haredim in 2013. He  claimed that “white tribe”  “refers to an amorphous group comprising Jews  of Ashkenazi origin who live in north Tel Aviv and who deeply despise the  haredim.” He contrasted those who dislike haredim with those who defend them:  “The people who believe this nonsense [of defending haredim] are a few whites  who also live in north Tel Aviv, but who do not see themselves as part of the  white race.”In 2012 when Shaul Mofaz won the leadership of Kadima,  Culture and Sport minister Limor Livnat claimed that “the white tribe will turn  to Yair Lapid and the Labor Party,” an allusion to the theory that Lapid is  “white” and the Labor party appeals to “white” voters.In response Yifat  Ben Hay-Seger, a lecturer at Bar-Ilan University, noted that Israeli society was  a modern version of the 12 tribes. “And among these tribes,” she wrote, “is a  wide range of skin color: white, brown and even black. It is not always possible  to figure out one’s origin by one’s skin color. Who doesn’t know Ashkenazim who  are dark, or Mizrahim who have light skin and eyes? Thus the expression ‘the  white tribe’ is not a matter of color, but rather constitutes a clear  hierarchical distinction between Ashkenazim and Mizrahim.”The fact is  that there are large numbers of people in Israel who go to sleep at night  self-defining as a “white tribe.” They have cultivated a sense of white  superiority. In the era where the world is going the other way, challenging the  concept of “white privilege” or challenging racial and ethnic structures, some  Israelis are going in the opposite direction, trying to set up boundaries to  their “racial” identity as “whites.” Did they not see the failure of this model  in other countries? It may be worth reminding Israelis of two interesting books  on this subject. In 1981 television producer David Harrison published the book  The White Tribe of Africa which argued passionately that the Afrikaners in South  Africa, whose leaders had established Apartheid, were a kind of indigenous  “white tribe” on the African continent by virtue of their long residence there  and having developed a unique culture. Harrison’s conception of the  Dutch-descended white minority in South Africa as a tribe has not vanished.  Jacob Zuma, the president of South Africa, made similar comments to Afrikaners  at a speech in Sandton in 2009, saying they were unique as a “white tribe” on  the African continent.Themba Moses Msimang, writing at  Africasacountry.com, disagreed with this concept: “The juxtaposition of  ‘black tribalism’ with ‘white tribalism’ allows for the fallacious claim of  parity between oppressors and oppressed.”Agree or disagree with the view  that Afrikaners are a “white tribe,” why on earth would anyone want to import  that concept to Israel? It’s as if the “white elite” in Israel want to dig as  deeply as they can into the hole at the bottom of which is the self-fulfilling  prophecy of the BDS movement, accepting the accusation of Israeli  apartheid.The “white tribe” manifesto is not born of self-critique in  Israel. It isn’t like the adoption of “white privilege” among some Jewish  Americans who identify as “white” and foist upon themselves the burden of  “privilege.”This is a topic of discussion among some Jews in America.  Writing at The New Republic, Phoebe Maltz-Bovy argued that Jews are accorded  “the unearned advantages white people, Jewish and otherwise, enjoy.”A  fascinating 2008 book by Eric L. Goldstein, The Price of Whiteness: Jews, Race  and American Identity, argues that Jews had to sacrifice their racial  distinctiveness in order to achieve inclusion among the white American  elite.A visceral representation of this problematic situation can be  found in the 1980 classic Caddyshack, in which a loud-mouthed and demonstrably  Jewish character appears on a golf course and shakes up the local WASP  elite.What is well known is that American Jews may have embraced  “whiteness” when it was convenient and necessary to gain entrance to society,  but there was never a widespread notion of “white pride” among Jews, who often  viewed themselves as partners in the struggle for the civil rights of ethnic  minorities.The “price of whiteness” Goldstein alludes to is that, having  gained entrance to the “white club,” Jews perhaps lose out on some of the  benefits of a society in the US that now awards multiculturalism.But in  Israel the bizarre concept of “white tribe” has gone the other way. Jewish  immigrants from Europe never had to gain entrance to elite society. They created  the myth of being an intellectual elite; as columnist Richard Cohen described  them, “fighting intellectuals, rifle in one hand and a volume of Kierkegaard in  the other.” Rather than reducing their reliance on a “white identity” over time  in the Middle East, they have clung tenaciously to a myth of European  superiority and a “secular Ashkenazi” identity.The “white tribalism”  posits that, in the words of one author, “we are now fighting a political and  cultural war for Israel’s identity.”This manifests itself in insane  proposals for creating ethnic ghettos and bantustans in Israel.Carlo  Strenger and Judd Yadid at Haaretz proposed “cantonization” in an October 7  article, where each “ethnic” and religious group would get its own canton. One  cannot escape the feeling that among a self-defined “liberal” elite there is  adoration of a race-based nationalism that failed miserably  elsewhere.David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s first prime minister, echoed this  weirdo logic in a 1962 cabinet meeting. Fearing that Israel would become a  “Levantine nation” he noted “the problem is what character the Oriental [Jews  from Muslim countries] communities will be. They will be the majority in the  nation...whether we will succeed by artificial means to elevate them...the  question is what kind of Jews they will be. Will they be the Jews we want them  to be, or will they be like the Jews of Morocco?” When “the Jews” were not  assimilated into a “European” standard, the ideology of “white tribe” emerged as  another solution: Assimilation didn’t work, so let’s define ourselves as a  superior tribe.What happened in Israel is that an unfortunate group of  people have been conditioned to cling to and embellish a myth of “white tribe”  beliefs; and they have been encouraged in their views by the media. They have  ascribed to being “Ashkenazi” – which is a religious tradition, not an ethnic  one – the quality of being different and superior. They have adopted the same  racist views against the other “tribes” that Jews were subjected to in  Europe.It would be better to abolish this childish tribal  identification, that is more befitting an ideology of the late 19th century than  the 21st.“White tribalism” is probably one of the worst concepts that  has befallen Israel, and creates a self-fulfilling racist insularity. The more  some on the Left and Center embrace this race-based heresy, the worse becomes the  state’s ability to create an integrated, open-minded society that will succeed  in the long term.

<title>The 2005 French riots and the country’s ethnic separation</title>
<date>4/11/2015</date>
<content>
Ten years ago, at the  end of October 2005, major riots erupted in France. Two youngsters from Clichy  sous Bois near Paris were accidentally electrocuted after entering an  electricity substation. Their friends claimed they had been fleeing from the  police.This led to an eruption of riots lasting three weeks, during  which time the authorities lost control for several days.




Over nine  thousand cars were torched during those weeks. Among the institutions burnt were  kindergartens, schools, shops, libraries and a theater. Eighteen religious  institutions were attacked, including three mosques and two  synagogues.Although England also had its share of violent riots in 2011,  these riots as well as other social unrest in Western Europe over the past  decade never attained the magnitude of the 2005 autumn riots in  France.Ten years after the riots, it is important to take stock of what  happened then and since. The importance of this review goes beyond French  society in general and its Jewish population. It is also vital in analyzing and  understanding the current situation in parts of the Muslim world, including the  present Palestinian terrorism.One of the shrewdest analysts at the time  was the Jewish philosopher Alain Finkielkraut. In an interview in Haaretz he  stated that “in France, they would like very much to reduce these riots to their  social dimension, to see them as a revolt of youths from the suburbs against  their situation, against the discrimination they suffer from, against the  unemployment. The problem is that most of these youths are blacks or Arabs, with  a Muslim identity.“Look, in France there are also other immigrants whose  situation is difficult – Chinese, Vietnamese, Portuguese – and they’re not  taking part in the riots. Therefore, it is clear that this is a revolt  with an ethno-religious character.”He added, “The looters do not demand  more schools, more day-nurseries ... more buses: they burn  them.”Finkielkraut also made stronger remarks during the interview, for  which he subsequently came under heavy criticism.He was forced to  apologize for some of his comments.Several months after the riots Léon  Sann, head of the ethics commission of a hospital, wrote a detailed essay on the  disproportionately large extent of criminality among minority youngsters from  the “difficult” suburbs. He presented statistics which had been gathered over a  multi-year period. He pointed out that this criminality had manifested itself in  attacks involving buildings, transport, schools and hospitals and quoted sources  showing that minorities represented 60 percent to 70% of young  delinquents.The autumn 2005 riots made it clear that the many earlier  attacks, mainly by Muslims against Jewish institutions, were merely a prelude to  the main target: French society. In autumn 2005 Jewish institutions were rarely  specifically attacked, exceptions being the synagogues at Pierefitte and Garges  les Gonesse. At one point in the rioting and over several days, the French  authorities even warned the Jewish community that they were unable to protect  it.After the riots the French authorities announced they would take  measures to improve the integration of minorities.Yet to date this issue  remains hugely problematic. The French term for suburb, “banlieue,” has become  pejorative, with many of these suburbs being characterized by poverty, crime,  unemployment, high Muslim populations and social isolation from the rest of  France.It was again internationally publicized during the ill-fated  visit of a group of Dutch officials to the Paris suburb Saint Denis last month,  to study the radicalization there. The visitors were attacked by a group of  hooligans. They were kicked and beaten, one of them even receiving a head wound,  and were forced to flee. Some of their possessions were stolen.In the  wake of the Charlie Hebdo and Hyper Cacher massacres in January 2015, French  socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls, speaking of the minority ghettos, said  that there is a “territorial, social and ethnic apartheid” separating these  neighborhoods from the rest of France.As is so often the case, the  situation of the Jews is a prime indicator of the problems of the societies  where they reside.Feelings are rife in the Jewish community that there  is little future for selfaware Jews in France. These have greatly strengthened  in the past 10 years. So has Jewish emigration. Several Jews have been murdered,  all by Muslims. In the summer of 2014, nine synagogues were attacked by Muslim  hooligans.The above illustrates some of the many facets of France’s  inability to put its house in order, after the extent of its disorder was so  clearly demonstrated in the 2005 riots. Nevertheless, those who have failed at  home now demand major-player status in dictating how Israel should behave. In  March this year France wanted to bring a resolution to the UN’s Security Council  on the Palestinian- Israeli conflict. In October it proposed that international  troops be stationed on the Temple Mount. Perhaps it would have been more  effective to send foreign troops to some of the “apartheid” areas in  France.The destructive element present in the French riots, so well  identified by Finkielkraut, has since become much more visible in many sections  of the Muslim world. The factors driving this destructive element are often more  cultural than socio-economic in nature.This element has also been  evident in Palestinian society for many decades, whose leaders have been far  more interested in destroying Israel than in building their own  society.The aim of the current terrorist activities, acclaimed and  glorified by Palestinian leaders, is to further complicate relations between  Jews and Arabs, both Israeli as well as Palestinian. These actions lead to the  destruction of jobs for Palestinians. Arab workers in Jewish neighborhoods now  may feel threatened, which was not the case before the new outburst of  Palestinian terrorism.The culture to which, among others, the French  rioters and the Palestinian terrorists and inciters belong has caused much  trouble already throughout the world.These destructive cultural  elements, often also religiously oriented, so vocally and violently present in  the Muslim world, are likely to cause many more grave problems in the future as  well.

<title>The balloon has burst</title>
<date>22/7/2015</date>
<content>
The agreement between Iran and the world powers is a done deal. The main issue before us now is the never-ending and unresolved conflict with the Palestinians.The nursery school children sat in a circle and sang merrily: “They punished me  too harshly, they sentenced me to death and then / I sat in the electric chair  and said goodbye Mercedes-Benz.” It’s highly doubtful they understood any of the  words other than “sat” and “chair.” Some of them might also have known what  “punished” meant. As they raised her chair in the air, the girl whose birthday  they were celebrating looked down happily at her excited friends –  children.




Our country isn’t run by children, and those who do run it  ought to understand that when something is over, it’s over. Like a burst  balloon, it will never again be what it once was, no matter how loud a kid  yells. The agreement between Iran and the world powers is a done deal. Whining  won’t make a balloon whole again, and won’t undo the agreement. 

It is a rallying point for  our enemies, the pretext that is turning the whole world against us, the reason  for the threats from the Hague and the threats of boycotts. It doesn’t matter  what atrocities are being committed in the nations around us, and it doesn’t  matter that the Palestinians don’t want to and aren’t capable of signing a peace  agreement, or that if they had an autonomous state in the West Bank it would  look like the one they already have in the Gaza Strip. At this stage, these  facts sound more like arguments for mitigation of punishment in the sentencing  hearing than evidence of innocence in the trial itself. The world has already  handed down a guilty verdict, and it won’t allow itself to be confused by the  facts.The burden of proof has to be transferred to the Palestinians.  What we should do now is offer them their own state with provisional borders on  the land defined as Area A and Area B, with territorial continuity that will  enable them to go from Jenin to Hebron without seeing a single Israeli soldier.  And they won’t have to relinquish any of their demands. They can continue to  demand the right of return, the 1967 borders, or the boundaries set by the 1947  partition plan or the 1937 Peel Commission. We have demands too, and when the  time comes, they’ll all be on the table for discussion. In the meanwhile,  they’ll have a state. Isn’t that what they and the rest of the world have been  clamoring for all along? What’s wrong with this arrangement? We don’t have  permanent borders today either.A political storm is raging around us and  the winds are getting stronger every day. There is no way to hold it back.  Standing with our arms stretched out and pretending it’s a pleasant breeze won’t  make it so. And it poses substantial danger for Israel. Our economy is export  heavy, and we can’t afford to receive the kind of treatment South Africa got.  What’s more, a binational state is a much worse option. Anyone who has trouble  imagining what that would look like should pay a visit to east Jerusalem –  stones, Molotov cocktails, knives, hatred, death.Welcome to the local  version of Libya, Iraq, or Syria. If we don’t want a binational solution and we  don’t offer an alternative, we’re left with charges of occupation, oppression,  apartheid, etc., which invite South Africa-style sanctions.The truth  doesn’t matter in the slightest.We have to be realistic and proactive.  If we don’t take the initiative, someone else will, and the result will be much  harder to swallow. The extreme Left has to wake up. Nothing close to John  Lennon’s vision in “Imagine” will ever come into being. Hell is all around us,  and the cavorting demons will never treat us with civilized, Scandinavian-style  neighborliness. The extreme Right also has to open its eyes and see the millions  of Palestinians here. The secret hope that they will all move elsewhere or  decide to convert to Judaism is a fantasy. It’s not going to happen.
We  have suffered a blow from the world, especially from our closest ally, America.  Why not make judicious use of the compensation package they’re holding out to  us? It’s not financial compensation we need, but American support for a  “Palestinian state with provisional borders” program. The Palestinians will be  forced either to accept it or to explain why they don’t want a state. More  importantly, it will get the world off our back.

<title>The Human Spirit: Waters by the waters</title>
<date>13/8/2015</date>
<content>
Here’s a fantasy. I’m walking on the beach in the Hamptons,  and I run into Roger Waters, the former Pink Floyd superstar.It’s not so  far-fetched, because Waters lives in Southampton and my sister-inlaw has long  lived in East Hampton. No, I’m not a Pink Floyd groupie. But Waters – who uses  his position as a music legend to urge other musicians and artists to refrain  from performing in Israel – has become a leader in the Boycott, Divestment and  Sanctions movement against Israel. Recently, in Haaretz, he received extensive,  near-worshipful coverage.




Leaving aside Haaretz giving Waters so much  exposure, I imagine I’m sitting on one of those Hampton staircases that leads  down the bluffs to the waters, and get a chance to answer his complaints. Of  course, I’m trying to get BDS-Waters to modify his position. Remember, this is  fantasy.Background Thirty years ago, Roger Waters, now 72, was the lead  singer, lyricist and creative force in the wildly popular and extremely  influential rock band Pink Floyd. (“We don’t need no education, we don’t need no  thought control.”) He’s British but left England because of a law banning the  hunting of foxes, deer and mink with dogs. He reportedly no longer wanted to  live in a country where human rights were violated. We don’t want no thought  control. His epiphany regarding BDS came when, in 2006, “to his eternal shame,”  he was criticized for accepting a lucrative gig in Israel.Haaretz  reporter Gideon Levy spent two days in Southampton with Waters. He reports that  Ambassador Ron Dermer had failed to engage Waters in dialogue.Waters  said it “was like talking to a pit bull.” I don’t want to make that mistake. So  I’m going to summon my least pugnacious personality.Barbara Sofer: Hello  there Mr. Waters. I hope you don’t mind speaking to me. I’m a Jew and a  Zionist.Roger Waters: Some of my best friends are Jews. A relative of  Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal, and Israeli journalist Gideon Levy came to dinner  the other night. I even have Jewish grandchildren from my  daughter-in-law.I know that you are devoted to what you see is justice,  and that you keep saying you actually want to help us befuddled Israelis by  supporting the Palestinians.The inspiration for your rectitude is the  example of your late father, who recanted his passivism and died in the fight  against the Nazis. But are you aware that the original BDS against Jews was  created by the Ku Klux Klan and later the Nazis? Those perpetrators also  justified their actions with supposed lofty goals.As I said in Haaretz,  and will say again: If you’re determined to stand on the side of truth, justice,  liberty, human rights, individual freedoms, political equality and freedom to  worship whatever you want, all of that – from time to time, situations crop up  that demand your attention more than other situations, because they’re blatant  and they’ve been going on for a long time. People also complain about anybody  making comparisons between apartheid South Africa and Israel.But  particularly in the occupied territories – but also in Israel, in my view – the  comparisons are valid.Doesn’t it feel strange that you’ve named the  single democracy in the Middle East as the source of oppression and violation of  human rights? A land with free elections and courts and free press. My  Palestinian friends prefer to bring their cases to Israeli  courts.Because I work at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, where  Arabs and Jews, Israelis and Palestinians strive together to save the lives of  Arabs and Jews, Israelis and Palestinians, even terrorist victims and  terrorists, I am puzzled by the apartheid comparison.I also swim in a  pool that’s mixed Jews and Arabs, shop in a supermarket that caters to Orthodox  Jews and Arabs with large families, and eat at lunch counters with other Jews  and Arabs.Your BDS co-leader Prof. As’ad Abu Khalil from California  State University has been quoted repeatedly that the real goal of BDS should be  stated unambiguously: to take down the Jewish state.I appreciate your  own frankness that BDS isn’t about settlements, as some claim, or whether  seltzer machines are made over the Green Line, but about the essence of the  State of Israel. After all, it was Tel Aviv, not Shiloh, that in the end you  refused to perform in. We all know it’s not really the mosques of Jerusalem that  our enemies yearn for but the hi-tech achievements of Tel Aviv.That’s  why you switched your concert 50 km. away to the mixed ethnic village of  Neveh Shalom.I can imagine your disappointment when mostly Jews from Tel  Aviv attended. By the way, that wasn’t because of imagined roadblocks, just  traffic jams. If you’d wanted to be sure you had Arabs in the audience, you  could have performed at one of our Israeli hospitals.I’ve been back to  Israel since that concert, touring with UNRWA. When I see the rubble and the  filth in Gaza, I think I have to keep working on BDS.The billions that  have been invested in Gaza have been diverted from playgrounds and job training  to attack-tunnels and rockets aimed at my children and  grandchildren.Everyone knows the rockets are completely  useless.They’re simply a legal and justifiable means of expressing rage  at the occupation.I’ll send you a photo of a kindergarten where one of  those useless rockets fell. And speaking of children, the most offensive part of  what you said in your recent interview was your message to us Israelis: “I would  like to say that in 1945, or 1947- 8, you had the goodwill, the sympathy and  good wishes of the rest of the world. You were a bit like the United States  after 9/11. But you’ve sadly frittered away that goodwill and you need to look  at what happened in 1947-48, and what has happened since.” With all due respect,  the death of six million persons, among them a 1.5 million children – starved,  beaten and incinerated – was not much of a trade-off for transient  goodwill.Somehow I missed the part about goodwill that was extended to  Holocaust survivors who went back to their homes in Poland only to be murdered  by the people who had stolen their property, or the attitude of your British  countrymen toward homeless survivors who wanted to come ashore in  Haifa.You Israelis are to blame for the prolonged statelessness of the  Palestinians and the starvation of the young of their diaspora in  Syria.Don’t you think it’s a stretch to blame us Jews for the problems  of Arabs in Syria? There are problems we’re not to blame for.If you mean  my remarks in a recent interview on historical parallels, stating that I would  not have played Vichy France or Berlin in World War II, it was not my intention  to compare the Israelis to Nazis.But even you have to concede that  oppression breeds oppression.Actually, I don’t concede that at all.  Holocaust survivors didn’t become oppressors. They went into helping professions  more than those who didn’t go through the Holocaust.Like it or not, BDS  is here to stay. The more visible BDS becomes, the more likely it is to have a  good effect on the eventual outcome of the situation that exists between the  Israeli people and the Palestinian people.Not one shred of proof  substantiates that BDS does anything to promote peace. Just the  opposite.As I said in Haaretz, you Israelis need to find the courage to  live with your neighbors. You need courage. It takes courage to look at the  reality rather than trying to maintain the image of a false reality.The  bold music decisions you made 30 years ago in Pink Floyd don’t give you the  authority to lecture us on courage. We’ve got plenty.Our Left and Right  disagree on only one issue.Those on the Left think those on the Right  are belligerent, and those on the Right think those on the Left are dreamers but  pray that they’re correct and that the manifold risks we’re willing to make for  peace will pay off after all.Next time you come to Israel, I promise to  give you my own version of the peace tour.

<title>No holds barred: The Israel apartheid lie</title>
<date>20/4/2015</date>
<content>
Last week I received a call from Washington Square  News, NYU’s student newspaper, asking me to respond to the charges of 130 New  York University professors who signed a petition calling for a boycott of  companies doing business with Israel since the Jewish state has now become  apartheid South Africa. I gave them the following quote: “Any professor who  calls Israel an apartheid state is guilty of ignorance, moral blindness, and an  assault on the sacred memory of Nelson Mandela, who they are of necessity  comparing to Yasser Arafat. Mandela was a man of peace who brought together  people of different races in harmony and equality. Arafat is the father of  modern international terrorism. And Hamas, whom polls show would win an election  in the West bank, is dedicated in their charter to the genocide of Jewish people  wherever they may be found.”
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}




The comparison of the Palestinians, rather  than the Jews, to black South Africans has become a regular and deliberate  distortion that degrades the peace, harmony and reconciliation that black South  Africans have shown in comparison with innumerable Palestinian terrorist groups  committed to Israel’s annihilation.On May 28, my organization, The World  Values Network, will host the third Annual Champion of Jewish Values  International Awards gala in Times Square. The dinner will honor courageous  fighters for Israel, like Senators Bob Menendez and Ted Cruz as well as Newt  Gingrich and Sheldon and Miriam Adelson. It will also commemorate those who  perpetuate Holocaust memory, foremost among them Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Elie  Wiesel and Anne Frank’s best friend Jacqueline Van Maarsen, who is making the  journey from Amsterdam by ship at the age of 86. It seems incredible to me that  just 70 years after the Holocaust the Jews are being maliciously portrayed not  as victims but culprits, not as a nation defending its existence but as a people  hell-bent on viciously degrading others for reasons of racial  superiority.The truth, of course, is that in Israel today there are 1.6  million Arab citizens who make up 20 percent of Israel’s  population.These Arabs enjoy the same rights as their fellow Jewish  citizens. They, along with Christians, Druse, Baha’i, Hindus, women and  homosexuals all have equal rights to live their lives in freedom and safety. As  my friend Mitchell Bard argues to rebut the Israel-is-apartheid lie, among the  many notable Israeli Arabs there are two Supreme Court justices, the captain of  the Israeli Hapoel soccer team, the Israeli ambassador to Ecuador and a general  in the Israel Defense Forces. Arabs have their own political parties and have  served in the Knesset as members of their own parties as well as the non-Arab  parties.Contrast with the treatment of Palestinians in Arab countries  where they are denied citizenship and often persecuted.In Lebanon, for  example, Palestinians are banned from owning property or passing it on to their  descendants, and they are also barred from employment as lawyers, doctors and  more than 20 other professions.The obscene comparison of Israel with  South Africa also ignores the fact that Israel is a multicultural society with  people from more than 100 countries, many of them people of color. Israel is  also the first country in history to airlift tens of thousands of black men,  women and children from Africa and give them citizenship rather than enslave  them. Today, more than 130,000 Ethiopian Jews live in Israel and have served in  the Knesset, achieved high ranks in the military, served as an ambassador and  won the Miss Israel contest.When asked whether they would prefer to live  in Israel or the Palestinian Authority, 77 percent of Israeli Arabs chose  Israel.Furthermore, 64% of Israeli Arabs said that Israel was a good  country to live in, even as they voice other complaints – all part of living in  a democratic society where they can fearlessly criticize their  government.In South Africa skin color determined every aspect of your  life from birth until death. Black South Africans could not vote and were not  citizens of the country in which they formed the overwhelming majority of the  population. Laws dictated where they could live, work, go to school and travel.  And, in South Africa, the government killed blacks who protested against its  policies. By contrast, Israel allows freedom of movement, assembly and speech.  Some of the government’s harshest critics are Israeli Arabs who are members of  the Knesset.In the West Bank Israeli policy is obviously not based on  race but is a result of Palestinian terrorist attacks against Israel’s  population. Since the signing of the Oslo agreements in the 1990s, 97% of  Palestinians in Judea and Samaria have been governed by the Palestinian  Authority and, following Israel’s disengagement from Gaza in 2005, 100% of the  Palestinians there have been ruled by first the PA and now, sadly, Hamas. The  denial of basic freedoms these Palestinians face – such as freedom of assembly,  speech and the press – are attributable to Palestinian, not Israeli policies.  The serious offers of peace which Israel made under prime ministers Ehud Barak  and Ehud Olmert to resolve all issues relating to the West Bank were rebuffed  first by Yasser Arafat and then by his successor Mahmoud Abbas.Far from  being a white, colonial settlement, the establishment of the State of Israel is  analogous to African-Americans who had been forcibly removed from Africa  returning to create, say, the country of Liberia. The Jews too were forcibly  removed from the Land of Israel by the Babylonians and then the Romans to be  slaves and vassals. But they thirsted for freedom and therefore returned in  great throngs, joining a smaller number of their people who had always remained  in the Holy Land. Together, they rebuilt their ruined country.The  comparison of the Palestinians, rather than the Jews, to black South Africans,  is unfortunate and misdirected.Whereas Black South Africans inspired the  world with their decency and humane capacity for peaceful coexistence with their  white brethren even after having been so grievously wronged, our Palestinians  brothers have tragically embraced hatred, terrorism and racism.Arab  newspapers are filled with grotesque caricatures of ethnic characteristics of  Jews. Innocent Palestinian youth are brainwashed by the likes of Hamas and  Hezbollah to grow up and blow up Israeli buses. Nelson Mandela rose to become  the foremost statesman of the world by preaching forgiveness and  reconciliation.Yasser Arafat ushered in modern terrorism and then stole  hundreds of millions of dollars from his own people, who continue to live in  abject poverty despite being the largest per capita recipients of international  aid in the world.Apartheid is one of the greatest moral abominations of  modern times and directly contravenes the greatest of all biblical teachings,  namely that every human being is created equally in the image of God. Racism is  not only disgusting, it is profoundly heretical, denying as it does a common  heavenly Father to the human family. It was the Hebrew Bible that taught us, in  its very first chapter, that all humanity reflects the divine countenance, in  every color and in every shade.The author, “America’s rabbi,” whom The  Washington Post calls “the most famous rabbi in America,” is the international  best-selling author of 30 books, including The Fed-up Man of Faith: Challenging  God in the Face of Tragedy and Suffering.

<title>The laundering of anti-Semitism through universal public values</title>
<date>14/5/2015</date>
<content>
Recently, I spoke in the first-ever Canadian parliamentary special debate  on the rise of global anti-Semitism. One of the main themes in this  parliamentary debate, as well as in my talk to the earlier, historic United  Nations General Assembly Forum on anti-Semitism, was one particularly insidious  manifestation of this new permutation of hatred.I am referring here to  the laundering or masking of anti-Semitism under universal public values –  laundering under the protective cover of the UN, the authority of international  law, the culture of human rights, and the struggle against racism.




As  Canadians, the UN is part of our DNA; international law is a centerpiece of our  identity; and human rights is an organizing idiom of our foreign  policy.
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}Indeed, as the Canadian minister of justice, the struggle against  racism and hate was a focus of my work, including introducing the first-ever  National Justice Initiative against Racism and Hate.Regrettably, the  laundering of anti-Semitism under universal public values effectively subverts  these values as it seeks to portray Israel and the Jewish people as the enemy of  all that is good and the repository of all that is evil. This strategy is not  only prejudicial to Israel, but undermines these universal values themselves –  incriminating the UN in these pernicious and prejudicial falsehoods – as  illustrated in the following brief examples.First, the laundering of  anti-Semitism under the protective cover of the UN found dramatic expression in  December 2014, when the General Assembly – in yet another annual discriminatory  ritual – adopted 20 resolutions of condemnation against one member state,  Israel, in comparison to only four resolutions against all other states  combined. This singling out of one member state for differential and  discriminatory treatment is a standing denial of the UN charter commitment to  “equality of all nations large and small,” while the major abusers of human  rights continue to enjoy exculpatory immunity.A second example – and  here one of laundering under the authority of international law – occurred this  past December 17, when the Contracting Parties to the Geneva Convention put  Israel in the docket for violations of international humanitarian law. This was  only the third time in 50 years that any state has been so accused. On all three  occasions, that state happened to be Israel, with the worst of the human rights  violators – such as Syria or Iran – given yet another exculpatory pass.A  third example is the laundering of anti-Semitism under the culture of human  rights, where the UN Human Rights Council, mandated to promote and protect human  rights pursuant to the UN Charter, regularly singles out Israel for differential  and discriminatory indictment. This is a clear denial of equality before the law  in the international arena, as well as the violation of the principle of equal  protection for states that are the standing targets of major human rights  violators.One might add that on the agenda of every session of the UN  Human Rights Council is a permanent agenda item number 7 called “violations by  Israel of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.”Agenda  Item 8 speaks of “human rights violations in the rest of the world.” You thus  have an Alice in Wonderland situation where one state is singled out for  indictment even before the hearing begins.Finally, anti-Semitism is  laundered as part of the struggle against racism, involving not “simply” the  indictment of Israel as an apartheid state – the kind of rhetoric that is so  prominent in the campus culture – but involves the call for the dismantling of  Israel because it is an apartheid state, where apartheid is defined as a crime  against humanity under international law.And more: where Israel must be  dismantled not only because it is an apartheid state, but a Nazi one.The  call for its dismantling emerges, therefore, as not just hortatory but  imperative; for how can you have an apartheid Nazi state existing as part of the  international community? Accordingly, all supporters of this apartheid Nazi  state – which could reference all participants in this Global Forum – are deemed  collaborators in an international criminal conspiracy, which has an intimidating  and silencing effect on students on campus, if not supporters of Israel  generally speaking.But what should concern us is not only the laundering  of anti-Semitism under universal public values and the resultant  delegitimization of Israel and the Jewish people, but that this laundering of  anti-Semitism under universal public values undermines the values themselves –  it erodes the integrity of the UN; diminishes the authority of international  law; corrupts the culture of human rights; and shames the real struggle against  real racism.Accordingly, and in part because of this understanding, the  Canadian Parliament, pursuant to its special debate on anti-Semitism,  unanimously adopted a resolution – one which could be a template for this Global  Forum, if not for parliaments generally – that: a) Condemned... “the alarming  increase in anti-Semitism worldwide... which constitutes not only a threat to  Jews but an assault on our shared democratic values and our common humanity”; b)  Reaffirmed in the words of the Ottawa Protocol on Combating anti-Semitism  (referred to as a model for domestic and international implementation) that  “criticism of Israel is not anti-Semitic, and saying so is wrong. But singling  Israel out for selective condemnation and opprobrium – let alone denying its  right to exist or seeking its destruction – is discriminatory and hateful, and  not saying so is dishonest”; c) Called upon the government to advance “the  combating of anti-Semitism as a domestic and international  priority....”As the adage goes – and as reaffirmed by this resolution –  it may begin with Jews, but it doesn’t end with Jews. Universal public values  are on the line as well.The writer is a member of the Canadian  Parliament, emeritus professor of law at McGill University, and the former  minister of justice and attorney-general of Canada.

<title>The PA’s audacity</title>
<date>8/4/2015</date>
<content>
Rancor sometimes produces useless gestures of self-harm that  are described as “cutting off your nose to spite your face.” In normal  circumstances self-inflicted malice is senseless, but the Palestinian Authority  follows a unique brand of logic.Indeed, by PA criteria there could be  massive propaganda advantage to cutting off its own nose and blaming  Israel.





 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}Ramallah’s refusal to accept tax revenue collected on its behalf  by Israel is a cogent case in point. Israel froze these funds in December after  the PA decided to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague and thereby  instigate proceedings against Israel for alleged war crimes.Israel had  failed to dissuade the PA, a supposed peace partner, from carrying out its  cynical ploy. The revenue freeze was imposed to demonstrate that adversarial  provocations come at a price.But, as on previous occasions, Israeli  punitive reactions are short-lived – no matter how justified. This time, too,  the government relented following pressure from Washington and handed over to  Ramallah NIS 1.37 billion.But Israel held back a symbolic NIS 160,000 to  defray a fraction of the PA’s NIS 2b. debt to the Israel Electric Corporation.  The PA is also in massive arrears to Mekorot for water piped to it and to  Israeli hospitals for unpaid medical bills.According to PA President  Mahmoud Abbas’s arithmetic, however, this token deduction amounts to “a full  third of the total.” Therefore, he said, he refuses to accept any of the money  and is prepared to take Israel to the ICC over the matter. The Palestinian  media, which Abbas controls, is already rife with threats that “Israel’s  thieving would be the first war crime on which it would be tried  internationally.”It might be absurd to presume that collecting a small  portion of enormous outstanding utility bills can be portrayed as a war crime.  But what holds true for other nations is not so in Israel’s case.While  it is increasingly trendy overseas to condemn Israel on miscellaneous trumped-up  charges – including apartheid, wholesale oppression, dispossession and much more  in the same fallacious vein – few anywhere are aware that the supposedly  downtrodden Palestinians essentially enjoy free electricity courtesy of average  Israelis.It might make for fascinating legal high jinks if Abbas does  press this matter at the ICC, after having brazenly racked up alarming debts and  then gallingly waited quite content to have Israelis pick up his regime’s tab.  It would be interesting to see if anti-Israel bias could move jurists abroad to  actually rule that it is an inalienable Palestinian right not to pay any bills  but to enjoy free electricity, as well as other utilities and services, at the  direct expense of Israeli consumers.It is safe to assume that no such  precedent exists in the annals of jurisprudence. Still, serial non-fulfillment  of financial obligations by the Palestinians – in many spheres, not only  vis-à-vis the IEC – has not dampened Ramallah’s chutzpah.To be sure,  this is not the first time in which Israel announces it will deduct money to pay  debts from PA revenues, but time and again international pressure quickly causes  the government to backtrack. It would be no surprise if this episode is  similarly concluded.Nonetheless, the government cannot keep playing nice  and avoid damaging our international image at a cost to the Israeli economy. The  PA’s unbridled fiscal delinquency cannot be subsidized by Israeli citizens, even  if the upshot would be bad press and the usual mud-slinging  abroad.Israel clearly possesses a range of options to make sure that its  resources and population are not unconscionably exploited, especially by forces  that lose no opportunity to ingrain enmity to the Jewish state. To then expect  that state to keep bankrolling the PA is akin to extortion.Israel must  show the PA that it will not be cowed by shakedowns. Attempted blackmail will  only intensify unless Israel indicates that it will not accept losses and  inflict pain on its own citizens just to escape yet another demonization  drive.
The more Israel appears to fear slander, the more potent the  weapon of slander becomes in the ongoing anti-Israel offensive.

<title>The Schabas Commission – Hear our voices</title>
<date>18/1/2015</date>
<content>
On December 29, the  Palestine Center for Human Rights – Gaza forwarded to its list-serve a press  release in English and Arabic, soliciting testimony for the United Nations  Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict. The commission,  headed by Canadian law professor William Schabas, has been collecting  Palestinian testimony about Gazans hurt in the conflict for months now. The  deadline for submission of testimony is January 31, 2015. The commission claims  that it has been trying to collect the testimony of Israelis, too, but that the  Israeli government has blocked access.Nonetheless, the commission says  it is “in the process of interviewing a wide spectrum of witnesses and victims  in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory using technology to overcome  the physical distance.”




The jaundiced Goldstone Report – produced by a  similar commission investigating the 2008 round of the Gaza conflict (Operation  Cast Lead) – lends justification to the government’s decision to shun the  Schabas Commission.The Israeli government also refused to cooperate with  the Goldstone Commission, believing that – no matter what the evidence truly  showed – the commissioners would produce a report incorrigibly biased against  Israel, based upon foregone conclusions. The commission did not  disappoint.After receiving the information from a follow-up  investigation, Judge Goldstone himself retracted central accusations of the  initial report, announcing in The Washington Post: “If I had known then what I  know now, the Goldstone Report would have been a different  document.”Judge Goldstone followed up with a New York Times op-ed,  adding that “The charge that Israel is an apartheid state is a false and  malicious one that precludes, rather than promotes, peace and  harmony.”The stated mandate of Schabas’s commission is: “To investigate  all violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights  law in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem,  particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, in the context of the military  operations conducted since 13 June 2014, whether before, during or  after.”It is not clear whether this tasks the commission with  investigating violations which originate in “occupied territory” (like Hamas  missiles landing in Sderot, Beersheba, Ashdod and Ashkelon, or fired from  hospitals) or violations that affect only people living in “occupied territory”  (which might preclude people targeted and hurt in west Jerusalem, Tel Aviv or  other major Israeli cities). However, if the commission is to conduct a  meaningful assessment of the violations in the context of the war, it should  clearly be looking at both. Post-war investigations are not victimhood  competitions, but any commission tasked with such investigations must be exposed  to the evidence that the Palestinians have no monopoly on suffering – and the PA  and Hamas have calculatedly caused plenty of misery to both Arabs and Jews,  Palestinians and Israelis, alike.Per the UN Commissioners’ press release  requesting submissions of testimony: “The Commissioners wish to make it clear  that they interpret this mandate to include investigations of the activities of  Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, including attacks on Israel as well as the  Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip and Israeli actions in the West  Bank including East Jerusalem. The Commission of Inquiry is looking at a broad  range of alleged violations committed by all parties, and is considering the  full range of human rights, including economic, social and cultural  rights.”However, a close read of the commission’s website indicates an  initial bias vis-à- vis the suffering in this round, as well.This  predisposition is discernible in the commissioners’ explicit interpretation of  their mission, inter alia, to investigate (only) Israeli actions in the West  Bank and east Jerusalem (while apparently ignoring Hamas activity there). Also,  although the solicitation of testimony is available in English, Arabic and  Hebrew on the site, the press release publicizing the solicitation apparently  didn’t make it to the Israeli media and is available on the commissioner’s site  only in English and Arabic (indicated by the letters “E” and “A”). While Hebrew  is not an official language of the UN, it is curious that the commission would  translate its solicitation of testimony to Hebrew but not the announcement  ostensibly meant to inform Israelis of its existence.The commission’s  anti-Israel prejudice is no surprise, though. Professor Schabas is on record  naming Benjamin Netanyahu his “favorite” to indict at the International Criminal  Court, supposedly “echoing” the initial Goldstone Report – even though Netanyahu  was not Israel’s prime minister during Operation Cast Lead and was never  mentioned in the Goldstone Report.In addition, testimony will be  accepted only in Hebrew, Arabic and UN official languages. On the surface that  constraint would seem reasonable; however, it effectively ignores and hobbles  many elderly Jews – who still speak chiefly Amharic, Yiddish, etc. and escaped  anti-Semitic persecution in their countries of immediate origin to eventually  find themselves subjected to rocket attack here.The restriction also  discourages Thai and Filipino caregivers, African migrants and many others  traumatized here by Palestinian- sourced violence from submitting  testimony.One suspects that a commission led by Professor Schabas – who  has slandered Israel as being an “apartheid state” – might simply be oblivious  to the true diversity of the populations here adversely impacted by Hamas’s  rockets and other violence fomented via Palestinian incitement this past  summer.The commission should not be handed a “pass” on its lopsided  solicitation and consideration of victim testimony.Some Israelis have  discovered the solicitation and – with the help of organizations like the  International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists – succeeded in  submitting testimony to the commission.Private citizens have recently  put up a website, hearourvoices.org (currently in English, Hebrew and Russian)  to provide more information about submitting testimony. Unless the commission is  presented with a representative volume of gripping first-hand testimony by those  in Israel who were impacted by the Palestinian violations of international law  this summer, there is nary a chance that the Commission can be true to its  ostensible mission – much less held accountable to it.Even if, like the  initial Goldstone Report, the conclusions of this “Commission of Inquiry” are a  foregone conclusion, all Israelis should be able to have their voices be  heard.

<title>The Schabas Commission without Schabas</title>
<date>6/2/2015</date>
<content>
The exclamations of joy  following the resignation of William Schabas from the United Nations  Fact-Finding Commission to investigate alleged violations of international human  rights law and international humanitarian law in the context of the military  operations conducted since June 13, 2014, during the Israel-Gaza conflict, which  he headed are both premature and exaggerated. On the face of it, Schabas’s  resignation constitutes an Israeli victory. This is so since Schabas reasoned  his resignation in view of Israel’s allegations of his bias.On the face  of it, Schabas’s act is praiseworthy as he seemed to have followed the biblical  commandment to be “guiltless before the Lord, and before Israel.” His  resignation, however, brings to the fore the question, why did Schabas accept  the nomination in the first place. The answer is clear – he accepted the  nomination for the same reason that United Nations Human Rights Council offered  it to him.




Schabas’s expertise in international law and specifically in  the area of international criminal and human rights law is unquestionable. There  is, however, no lack of experts in this field who are not stained with bias  against a party whose case they are going to decide.Schabas’s hostility  toward Israel was well known even before the commission started its mission,  indeed before the letters of nomination of its members were signed. This did not  stop the United Nations Human Rights Council from nominating Schabas to this  delicate mission and did not stop Schabas from accepting the  nomination.One must not be surprised at this nomination. The bias of the  council against Israel is evident from the very resolution that established it.  It called for “an independent, international commission of inquiry to  investigate all violations of international humanitarian law and international  human rights law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East  Jerusalem, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, in the context of the  military operations conducted since 13 June 2014, and to report to the Council  at its twenty-eighth session in March 2015.”Schabas’s history is packed  with hostile remarks against Israel and against its leaders. He participated in  the Russell Tribunal, a citizens’ group of legal experts and activists that  works to hold Israel accountable for violations of international law. In his  speech at the tribunal, Schabas said that it is his “profound belief, [that] the  international law can be used to demonstrate and underscore the violations  committed by the State of Israel, and moreover can be used to hold accountable  individuals who have perpetrated international crimes against the people of  Palestine.” Asked about tools for prosecuting Israel, Schabas said: “I would  have been inclined to talk about crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the  crime of aggression, all of which I think can be shown have been perpetrated at  various times during the history of the State of Israel. These are all crimes  that have become increasingly robust in their definition in recent decades and  for which we now have international institutions capable of prosecuting the  crimes... With a bit of luck and by twisting things and maneuvering we can get  them before the courts.”When talking about Western leaders that should  be placed before the International Criminal Court, Schabas said: “My favorite  would be [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu in the dock.” He regarded Netanyahu  as “the single individual most likely to threaten the survival of  Israel.”To Schabas’s credit we must note, however, that he did not  discriminate between Israeli leaders. He called likewise for trying president  Shimon Peres in the International Criminal Court. In his own words: “Why are we  going after the president of Sudan for Darfur and not the president of Israel  for Gaza?” On the other hand Schabas was most sympathetic with Iran and with its  leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.In a 2009 blog post, following the second  Durban conference, Schabas wrote about the failure of the UN to hold a mature,  thoughtful and productive conference on racial discrimination that “those who  deserve the blame are Israel and its friends, who have manipulated the truth  about the nature of the work of the United Nations by gross exaggeration of the  role and intervention of certain fanatics,... and provocative politicians like  Mohamed [sic] Ahmadinejad, who in desperation make absurd statements that  probably deserve to be ignored rather than exaggerated.”Schabas  co-sponsored a “Center for Human Rights and Cultural Diversity” conference in  Iran where he was keynote speaker. The center, which accuses Israel of apartheid  policies, had strong ties to the Iranian regime and with its president Mahmoud  Ahmadinejad.He moreover did not regard Ahmadinejad’s crusade to wipe of  Israel as advocating genocide but as rather expressing “political views.” In  regard to the Iranian nuclear program, Schabas even wrote that Iran “very  arguably has a claim to require nuclear weapons for defensive  purposes.”Schabas’s attitude toward Israel is sharpened by the way he  looks at Hamas. “If we look at the poor people of Gaza,” he wrote, “all they  want is a state – and they get punished for insisting upon this, and for  supporting a political party in their own determination and their own assessment  that seems to be representing that aspiration.” No wonder he refused to regard  Hamas as a terrorist organization. He said it would be improper for him to make  such remark, as “we must open a new page and try this issue in the most neutral  and objective manner.”All this did not stop Schabas from accepting the  nomination, rejecting the UN Watch NGO’s demand to disqualify himself. In its  statement UN Watch wrote: “Under international law, William Schabas is obliged  to recuse himself because his repeated calls to indict Israeli leaders obviously  gives rise to actual bias or the appearance thereof.” As clarified by its  director Hillel Neuer, “You can’t spend several years calling for the  prosecution of someone, and then suddenly act as his judge... It’s absurd and a  violation of the minimal rules of due process applicable to UN fact-finding  missions.”In an interview in an Arab paper – where else? – Schabas  pointed out that the demands that he quit from the commission come only from  Israel and from the Israeli media. He stated, moreover, that he does not hate  Israel and that he “will put his prior positions aside.” One may wonder how this  could be possible.Even a superman – Schabas himself prefers the word  “Spider-Man” – cannot “put his prior positions aside” and hand down an  evenhanded verdict.The way Schabas handled the commission’s  investigation substantiated Israel’s concerns. In an obvious attempt to prevent  Israelis from testifying before it, Schabas made clear that the invitation to  “individuals, groups and organizations to submit information and documentation  related to its mandate” is being communicated to the media in English and Arabic  only and did not appear in Israeli media. This in spite of the fact that the  commission was instructed “to hold hearings and meet with witnesses and victims,  as well as gather information from a wide variety of sources.”So what  made him step down at this stage “immediately?” Schabas explained that he was  resigning in view of Israel’s accusations against him. Yet these accusations  were made from the moment the commission was nominated. What happened was that  Israel was successful in revealing that Schabas concealed the fact that he wrote  a paid opinion for the PLO that together with Hamas composes the “experts’  government” of the Palestinian Authority. This finding was too much even for the  Human Rights Council, and its president decided to seek legal advice about his  position from UN headquarters.All this led to Schabas’s resignation,  although he did not regard even this fact as relevant, since “My views on Israel  and Palestine, and on other subjects, are well-known and very public.” He did  resign, however, since he found it “difficult for the work to continue while a  procedure is under way to consider whether the chair of the commission should be  removed.”Yet before celebrating Schabas’s resignation we must pay  attention to an addendum to his letter of resignation.Schabas decided to  resign “in order to prevent Israel’s accusations against him from distracting  attention from the writing of the report and publication of its  findings.”This “innocent” remark must put Israel on guard. Not  only did the Schabas Commission encourage the flow of selective evidence, the  deadline for submission passed days before Schabas’s resignation. He emphasized  that the commission had largely finished gathering evidence and had begun  writing the report and he did not want the issue to overshadow the work of the  inquiry that “is at a decisive stage.” 
Anyone familiar with work of legal  commissions, indeed of any legal panel, knows that the resignation of the  chairman at this stage will hardly have any bearing on the report. The panel  members consult with each other all along the deliberations, and certainly so at  the stage when the commission is in the midst of writing its report. We also  know that the chairman – although regarded as first among equals – plays a  significant role in shaping the findings. Now that the bias of Schabas against  Israel became evident even to the UN Human Rights Council, Israel must insist  that the commission be dissolved, or we may get the Schabas Report though not  signed by Schabas.

<title>THE WRITE OUTLOOK: In South Africa, freedom of speech does not mean freedom to be heard</title>
<date>3/9/2015</date>
<content>
There is the danger that freedom of speech is fast becoming a question only of  volume. And that those who scream loudest in the defense of this precious  liberty, drown out those who are actually trying to say something. Which means  very simply, that freedom of speech becomes a numbers game.The examples  are numerous and can be drawn from all arenas. University campuses, the media  and parliament are the main flash points and it is worth taking a brief look at  these in order to try and appreciate the complexities.




South African  university campuses in general have a strongly anti-Israel bias. The BDS  activists have hijacked South Africa’s apartheid history and laid claim to it as  their own. The schools have become ground zero for Israel Apartheid Week, which  is a weeklong anti-Semitic festival, now skillfully incorporated into the  academic year.Wits University in Johannesburg, in its defense, has tried  to create some balance and to allow representation and debate on both sides in  the spirit of academic freedom, but given the demographics this is hardly  possible.Very simply, no Israeli and no one supporting Israel is easily  able to get a word in edgewise. No Israeli musician is able to perform  unchallenged and no viewpoint, other than that of the BDS movement, is given  freedom of expression. Anyone with a view alternative to the Israel- Apartheid  narrative is drowned out, bullied and intimidated into silence, which is ironic,  considering that one of the major criticisms of the former Apartheid government  was its control of this vital right.Contrast that to the contrived  incident where the head of BDS South Africa was removed from a gym for wearing  an “Israel is Apartheid” T-Shirt, after having been asked politely by the Muslim  manager numerous times to not be provocative. He so happened (pure  coincidentally, he insists) to have been with a journalist who successfully made  this into a public incident that outraged every media outlet in the country.  Freedom of expression was being challenged, and it was the Jewish Zionists who  were doing so. (In any event, it has long been suspected that we control the  press.) And the entire country nodded in agreement.The South African  Parliament is no different. With everyone screaming that it’s their right to  speak, it is impossible to hear anything but the loudest and the most  numerous.The relatively new Economic Freedom Fighters party under Julius  Malema is particularly guilty of shouting down speakers, but the more mature  African National Congress more so of trying to control expression in  parliament.Very often sessions end in chaos and the bewildered public is  left dumbfounded and confused. Constitutional rights might have been protected,  but they have not been realized.As the young South African democracy  struggles through its dangerous adolescence, as it oscillates between being a  screaming rambunctious youth and a more mature citizen of the world, South  Africa, its politicians and its citizens battle to find the balance. And without  accepting that the necessary partner to the right to express one’s opinions is  the obligation to allow others to do the same, there is little hope that this  will ever be achieved. Only when it becomes less about volume and more about  respect for all viewpoints will South Africa become a real democracy.

<title>The write outlook: This is not Disneyland</title>
<date>30/5/2015</date>
<content>
South Africans  remember well the build-up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The country became a  giant construction site, people registered and converted their homes to  accommodate international visitors; the daily countdown to readiness, the  stadiums and the flags all added to the excitement that soon would engulf the  country.What marred the anticipation of the experience was the  negativity of the international press, and in particular the British media. They  had pre-determined that anyone visiting the country would be raped, robbed and  murdered in their beds (perhaps not an unreasonable assumption given the  countries crime statistics), they claimed that the stadiums would not be ready  in time and that the infrastructure would not cope under the strain.




Day  after day South Africans read and defended against the accusations that were  hurled their way by British media. The UK media were wrong on all accounts and  for a few blessed weeks South Africa (and even its criminals) not only behaved,  but also managed to put on a spectacular event.
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}And that what makes the  BBC’s recent trip to Qatar particularly interesting, and somewhat different in  approach to that of 2010. The BBC, amongst others, was invited by the Prime  Minister’s Office on a PR exercise for a showcase visit.The intention  was to display the improvements to migrant workers’ lives in the country and to  prove the falsehood of the claims of horrible abuse, of poor working conditions  and appalling living facilities.The BBC accepted. There was no pretense  as to what this jaunt was. Respected London PR firm Portland Communications  arranged the trip and everyone went knowing full well why they were  there.Only it didn’t turn out that way. When the BBC crew did wonder off  on their own, and when they did try to speak to migrant workers, they were  arrested and interrogated for two days. They were held without explanation and  told it was a matter of “national security.” They were shown photos of  themselves taken a few days prior, proving that they had been under surveillance  throughout their trip. Try as they did, the BBC could not give Qatar the benefit  of the doubt, much as it would have liked to. Or in the now immortal words of  the Qataris when interrogating the journalists, “This is not Disneyland!” Never  was there a more apt description of the region.Throw into this mix the  recent visit by Tokyo Sexwale, the former South African minister of human  settlements, to Israel and the Palestinian areas earlier this month on the  invitation of the Palestinian Football Federation. The trip was a fact-finding  one and a result of the pressure for Israel to be expelled from FIFA, as a  consequence of its “human rights abuses.” Given Sexwale’s history as a  well-known anti-apartheid activist, he seemed well equipped to take on the task.  And indeed he was. Because on his return to South Africa on May 8, not only did  he fail to endorse the PFF’s bid for Israel’s expulsion from FIFA, but he  described the situation between Israel and the Palestinians as being “two cheeks  on the same face” swollen with tears. He was clearly moved by what he saw but  did not place the blame at Israel’s door.He will present his findings in  Zurich.This month has also seen the visit to Israel of none other than  FIFA president Sepp Blatter. His intention was to deflect the push for Israel’s  expulsion and the fallout that would no doubt follow.Defending Israel’s  expulsion, given the choice of Qatar to host the 2020 World Cup, and the  latter’s human rights record, would drag FIFA into a mud brawl that would leave  no one sparkling.As the 2010 British media onslaught on the South Africa  World Cup failed, so too did the Qatari PR exercise, as did the Palestinian  attempt to show Sexwale a situation that didn’t exist. Media bias, expensive PR  and political lobbying can be dangerous and damaging, but the fiction can only  be sustained for so long, because after all, only Disneyland is actually  Disneyland.The writer is the author of Carry On Baggage – the story of a  man who thought he traveled light.

<title>Think About It: Our surreal reaction to the new European guidelines</title>
<date>15/11/2015</date>
<content>
On November 11 the EU issued guidelines with regard to products originating in  territories that Israel occupied in June 1967:“1. The EU, in line with  international law, does not recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the territories  occupied by Israel since June 1967, namely the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip and  the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and does not consider them to be part  of Israel’s territory , irrespective of their legal status under domestic  Israeli law.




“2. The application of existing Union legislation on  indication of origin of products to products originating in Israeli-occupied  territories has been the subject of notices or guidance adopted by the relevant  authorities of several Member States. There is indeed a demand for clarity  ...about existing Union legislation on origin information of products  from Israeli-occupied territories. The aim is also to ensure the respect of  Union positions and commitments in conformity with international law on the  non-recognition by the Union of Israel’s sovereignty over the territories  occupied by Israel since June 1967. This notice also aims at maintaining open  and smooth trade, is not hindering trade flows and should not be construed to do  so.“5. When the indication of origin of the product in question is  explicitly required by the relevant provisions of Union law, it must be correct  and not misleading for the consumer....“7. Since the Golan Heights and  the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) are not part of the Israeli territory  according to international law, the indication ‘product from Israel’ is  considered to be incorrect and misleading in the sense of the referenced  legislation....”I have deliberately quoted from the guidelines at some  length because I believe that given what these guidelines actually say, Israel’s  reaction has been exaggerated, to the point of being hysterical and even  surreal.Netanyahu’s reaction to the new guidelines was “shame on you”  (you being Europe). He added that the main victims of such a policy will be  Palestinians who work in Israeli enterprises in the territories, and that the  fact that Europe singled out Israel and its conflict with the Palestinians out  of “200 other conflicts around the world” for such treatment resulted from  hypocrisy and double standards.Why Europe should be ashamed of itself in  this case is not clear. Europe (like the United States) has been consistent in  its refusal to recognize Israel’s sovereignty in the territories it occupied  (conquered or liberated) in June 1967, and the fact that in the past it made do  with words rather than actions doesn’t change the basic facts.All of  Israel’s efforts in the last 48 years to change the position of Europe and the  United States on this issue have failed, and Netanyahu wagging his finger at  them now is simply pathetic. Israel knows exactly what it has to do in order to  change the European and American position, and if it chooses not to do so (and  it certainly has the right to decide what it wants to do), then it should accept  the consequences. And let us be honest: if the consequences are having to  indicate the exact origin of products, dayenu.The argument about the  Palestinian workers is embarrassing.It is the same argument used by the  South Africans in the apartheid years against the boycott of South African  products, except that in our case we are not talking of a declared boycott, and  if the Palestinians workers feel that they are being wronged, let them speak for  themselves.The fact is that most Palestinians would be happier if Jewish  enterprises were replaced by Palestinian ones, which is also what the Europeans  are talking about when they call for an end of the Israeli occupation.As  to Israel’s conflict with the Palestinians being singled out from “200 other  conflicts around the world,” first of all, even if there are 200 ongoing  conflicts around the world, only a few involve states occupying foreign  territories and trying to change the demographic reality through settlement.  Yes, the Soviet Union did that for decades, and in 1990 Russia voluntarily left  many of the occupied states, but recently reoccupied the Ukrainian Crimea (a  majority of whose population, even before the occupation, was  Russian).China is another culprit with regard to Tibet and many other  territories which it has systematically colonized.Turkey occupied  northern Cyprus, and around 100,000 settlers from Turkey are said to have joined  the indigenous Turkish population. There are a few more examples, but most of  them are third world countries, to which we certainly have no interest to be  compared.Of all the countries on the list which Israeli spokesmen and  journalists mention as being in a similar situation to Israel in this respect,  only Turkey is, like Israel, a member of the OECD, which prides itself on its  democratic and international law principles. Israel joined the OECD in 2010,  after it was called upon to prove its commitment to democratic and various  international law principles (I participated in the preparation of some of the  relevant documents). Turkey was one of the founders of the OECD in 1961, and  probably would not be admitted to the organization if it were to request to join  today.But the Turkish example is not relevant in the current context.  First of all, the products of northern Turkish Cyprus are all marked as such,  and given the fact that only southern Greek Cyprus is a member of the EU, and  northern Cyprus is not recognized by anyone but Turkey, the situation is very  different to that of the Israeli settlements in the occupied  territories.Secondly, northern Cyprus broke away from the united Cyprus  after an unsuccessful attempt between 1960 and 1974 to establish a truly  binational state (in the constitutional rather than demographic sense). Though  Turkey’s unilateral move in 1974 was condemned by everyone, what it attained in  practice – a two-state solution – would certainly be welcomed by Europe if it  were applied to the Jews and Palestinians in Israel/Palestine, even by force.  But what Israel is doing is the exact opposite.Finally a word about the  statement by deputy foreign minister Tzipi Hotovely, who said that those who  call for a boycott of products from the Golan Heights, Judea and Samaria are  delegitimizing Israel. First of all, the EU is not calling for the boycotting of  products from these territories, but only having them labeled as such. Second,  there is no delegitimization of Israel in this act – just of Israel’s occupation  of territories that the Europeans (and everyone else) claim are not part of  Israel under international law.In short, if anyone thinks that Israel’s  official reaction to the new guidelines are going to benefit Israel in any way,  he ought to do some rethinking. In my opinion this reaction makes us look like a  bunch of fools.In fact I would argue that the guidelines may be viewed  as a useful tool in the fight against the call of the Boycott, Divestment and  Sanctions (BDS) movement for a complete boycott of Israel, by enabling the  majority of Europeans, who wholeheartedly support Israel’s right to exist in  security but reject its occupation of the Golan Heights, the West Bank and east  Jerusalem, to avoid purchasing products from Jewish settlements in these  territories, but to continue to purchase Israeli products from pre-1967 Israel,  until such time as Israel’s permanent borders are determined.This will  certainly weaken the appeal of the BDS.
Incidentally, while I do not have  a preference for products from the Golan Heights, Judea and Samaria, I certainly  do not boycott such products, and believe everyone has the right to do as he  pleases in this respect without being badmouthed.

<title>Trevor Noah – a little too soon to panic</title>
<date>1/4/2015</date>
<content>
South Africa is once again part of an anti-Israel fracas. This time it is a  number of derogatory tweets made about Israel, Jews, women and fat people by  Trevor Noah, the newly appointed anchor of The Daily Show. A soon as his name  was announced a number of Internet warriors reacted immediately, calling out  Noah on the tweets and expressing their concerns.Given the use of social  media to spread anti-Semitism in the past few years this reaction is  understandable. The question however is exactly how worried should the Jewish  world really be about the new Daily Show host? The answer, I would argue, is  that we can probably relax a bit and enjoy the program.




It seems to me  that Noah is partly a victim of being a comic in the 21st  century.See the latest opinion pieces on our       Opinion & Blogs Facebook      page 

 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;
Although well loved in South Africa and other parts of the  world, not many people know him in the United States. The first place Daily Show  fans went after his surprise announcement was to his twitter page, immediately  exposing his offensive tweets.It also didn’t help that Noah is replacing  Jon Stewart who is well known for searing anti-Israel critiques or that South  African celebrities have a bad habit of occasionally using their fame to try and  link Israel with the former apartheid regime. The combination of all of this  certainly didn’t make a great first impression on those unacquainted with his  work.Unfortunately twitter doesn’t do a great service to Noah’s brand of  stand-up comedy.Being a mixed-race South African, indeed he does focus  quite a bit on racial topics. He is in fact highly skilled at taking the racial  angst that still drives much South African discourse and engaging with it in  clever, nuanced and humorous ways. The 140 characters of the twitter format  simply don’t allow for any of complexity and he comes across as blunt and  caustic.All this certainly doesn’t excuse the tweets, which use some  classic anti-Semitic tropes and garden variety anti-Israel sentiment that we  have all heard before. Those that want to criticize the tweets are well within  their rights, but as Joel Pollack at Breitbart.com has argued, they also hardly  show evidence of entrenched anti-Semitism in the man or his work.The  debate about where comics are allowed to cross the line is fraught with  conflicting ideas and I don’t intend to get into it. What I can say however is  that the South African Jewish community is more attuned than most to what  constitutes anti-Semitic and anti-Israel rhetoric on the artistic scene. The  country even boasts its own small but obnoxious group called “Artists against  Apartheid,” who are full backers of the Boycotts, Divestments and Sanctions  campaign. The group includes a number of comedians, but Trevor Noah is not among  them. In fact in all the years Noah has been playing to full houses across the  country the issue of Jews and Israel has never been a problem.While  fighting anti-Semitism is an important issue, getting the reaction right is  always hard. In this case the massive level of outrage accompanying the tweets  has worked against the local community.Noah’s appointment to the comic  big leagues has been greeted with widespread delight in the country, including  among his former Jewish classmates from high school. To also have a flood of  criticism dampen this excitement creates the opportunity for real anti-Semites  to play the dual loyalty card and finger the Jews as spoilers of South African  talent doing well overseas.I suspect that Noah is not going to be  everyone’s cup of tea on the Daily Show, but before you make up your mind based  on a few tweets I would suggest that they at least check out his live  performances first. While we are waiting to see how well he does in his new  position, from a Jewish perspective it is probably to soon to panic.

<title>Tweeting Hitler</title>
<date>13/7/2015</date>
<content>
As the social media director of Israel education organization StandWithUs, I see  a lot of anti-Semitic nonsense on the Internet. Yet I was honestly surprised by  the fanatical anti-Semitism on Twitter following SnapChat’s Tel Aviv Live  feature last week.SnapChat, a mobile application which enables users to  share photos and videos that automatically delete themselves after a set number  of seconds, regularly features “Snaps” (photos and video clips) from cities and  events around the world. Last week, they had a feature on Tel Aviv which  featured Israeli food, Israeli beaches and some beautiful shots of Israeli  diversity.




But despite the light-hearted theme of the photos and videos  shared on SnapChat’s Tel Aviv Live, many in the Arab world (and anti-Israel  activists from all over), took to Twitter to express their anger – or rather,  anti-Semitism.After tweeting in celebration of Snap- Chat’s Tel Aviv day  using the hashtag 
TelAvivLive, StandWithUs alone received dozens of tweets in  both English and Arabic with pictures of concentration camps, Adolf Hitler,  Saddam Hussein, and alleged Palestinian victims (many of which were  faked).Some of the anti-Semitic messages included sentiments such as, “I  know Allah is the most merciful and I hope and who knows if maybe Allah have  mercy on 
Hitler’s soul [sic].”Another reads, “To all these Jews in  
TelAviv 
TelAvivLove I wish Hitler was still alive,” alongside a picture of  Hitler saluting. The Hitler adoration continued throughout the day with  thousands of photos, videos and messages praising Hitler.Lest you think  it was “not anti-Semitic and simply anti-Israel,” one tweeter set the world  straight by sharing, “This is the real Israel! Did you understand why did HITLER  killed Jews? Hitler was right. 
TelAvivLive 
Israel [sic].’’ In response to  hundreds of complaints, SnapChat caved to anti-Semitic uproar and added a West  Bank live feature the next day. In and of itself this is wonderful, but in  response to the disgusting behavior on social media from those who despise  Israel, it’s disappointing to say the least.Whereas Tel Aviv Live was  used to highlight beauty and coexistence, West Bank Live, while much of the  content was unrelated to Israel, was still used to delegitimize Israel, with  many snaps showing the alleged oppression of Palestinians at the “apartheid  wall” and checkpoints. But response from Israelis on social media was quite  different from the response to Tel Aviv Live: virtual silence. Imagine for a  moment that Israel activists responded to the West Bank Live feature the same  way the Palestinian activists responded on social media the day before? Why is  this behavior accepted when it occurs against Israel? Anti-Semitism on social  media has long been an issue given the open nature of Facebook, Twitter and  similar platforms. Although Facebook and Twitter both claim they take reports of  anti-Semitism very seriously, there seems to be little evidence that this is the  case. There have been repeated incidents of Facebook claiming pages such as  “Death to Zionist baby killer Israeli Jews” do not violate Facebook’s standards  of hate-speech.Additionally, Facebook doesn’t have a function to disable  comments or mass delete them, inviting anti-Semites to spam and harass users and  pages with thousands of hateful comments.Speaking from experience,  there’s very little one can do to stop such harassment other than deleting each  swastika- ridden comment one by one.Don’t believe it? Look no further  than IDF Arabic Spokesman Avichay Adraee’s Facebook page, or even the  StandWithUs Arabic page. Nearly every post is littered with outrageous  anti-Semitic photos or curses in Arabic.While Facebook occasionally  removes pages or users for anti-Semitism, on Twitter one rarely gets results at  all.After reporting over 100 tweets with photos of Hitler last week,  many of which included threats, Twitter has not removed these profiles. They  have, however, responded to many reports claiming that the tweets “do not  violate their policies.” There’s a reason Twitter has become a means of  communication for terrorist organizations like Islamic State.During last  summer’s operation with Gaza, the StandWithUs Facebook page, which has grown  exponentially and has a weekly reach of up to 40 million people, was spammed  with anti-Israel hate speech in the form of thousands of nasty comments on each  picture posted – and this isn’t including the thousands of profanity-laden  threats and general hate speech we received on the page.Things became so  severe during Operation Protective Edge that we even had to file a police report  after receiving a credible death threat. I am no fan of censorship but one has  to wonder: if Facebook and Twitter are aware of this kind of hate speech – and  they are, because it is reported – why is (seemingly) so little done to address  it, and why isn’t there a more efficient mechanism to eliminate it? No one seems  to care when swastikas are trending on Twitter, or there are pages titled “Death  to Israel.” Clearly such comments should “violate community standards,” and  tweeting hundreds of photos of Hitler and calling for genocide against Jews  should not go largely unnoticed by most of the world, and largely unaddressed by  social media giants like Twitter and Facebook.There’s a fine line  between opposing Israeli policy and tweeting pictures of Holocaust victims,  spamming young Israelis and claiming that “Hitler is returning for you.” By not  addressing these incidents, they empower anti-Semites to continue doing the most  offensive things they can think of: tweeting pictures of the Holocaust and Adolf  Hitler to Jews.Facebook and Twitter, you have provided a wonderful  outlet for disseminating alternative information, but the rampant and disgusting  anti-Semitism on social media must stop. We are doing our part in reporting. Now  it’s your turn.

<title>Useful idiots who support BDS – and the rabbis who foolishly stand with them</title>
<date>3/12/2015</date>
<content>
There are many issues one can debate in the Jewish community, but endorsing a boycott of Israel is completely off limits. Why, then, does the president of Hebrew Union College sit in leadership positions with people who endorse BDS and meet with Hamas? Founded in 1940 by the sons of John D. Rockefeller, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund claims to be a “private, family foundation helping to advance social change that contributes to a more just, sustainable and peaceful world.” This organization, that wants “peace,” gave $140,000 in June to the Jewish Voice for Peace, an organization that openly endorses BDS and supports a Palestinian “right of return.” It calls Palestinian stabbings and shootings “Palestinian popular resistance” and shared a statement on its Facebook account that praises “a new generation of Palestinians… rising up en masse against Israel’s brutal, decades-old regime of occupation, settler colonialism and apartheid.” Melissa Berman, the founding president and CEO of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, Inc., “an innovative nonprofit philanthropy service launched by the Rockefeller family in 2002,” sits on the International Advisory Council of the New Israel Fund, which openly boycotts Israel and supports labeling of products.




Kathleen Peratis, an advisory board member of the New Israel Fund and a partner at the New York law firm of Outten & Golden LLP, supports BDS – and is a leader of the New Israel Fund, also sitting on its International Advisory Council. Peratis wrote an op-ed, “If you want two states, support BDS.” Describing BDS as a “non-violent tool,” she writes“[N]ot buying Sodastream or Gush Etzion wine is a start.” Peratis has met with Hamas members. As The Washington Post describes, she recounts her experience with Hamas “as a fun-filled joy fest spent with friends.” She quotes one smuggler as saying: ”Please tell your friends that Hamas people are ordinary people. We are not barbarians.”These idiots are joined on the International Advisory Council of NIF by the president of Hebrew Union College, Rabbi Aaron Panken, the largest Reform college in the United States, and the senior rabbi of Temple Israel of White Plains, one of America’s preeminent Conservative synagogues. Regardless of differences on certain issues, a boycott of Israel is extremism which must be rejected.There are many issues one can debate in the Jewish community, but endorsing a boycott of Israel is completely out of bounds.Leaders of Hebrew Union College and Temple Israel of White Plains must stand with Israel, and demand that their leaders resign from the board of an organization which boycotts Israel and endorses labeling.

<title>US Jews must stop funding enemies of the IDF</title>
<date>24/12/2015</date>
<content>
The adage about two Jews and three opinions is one which is likely to remain a  perpetual reality for our people. There is room for views on the Left and the  Right, whether we agree or not, as long as those ideals are rooted in loyalty  and fairness. There are certain opinions, however, that we cannot accept: those  rooted in deception, intended to cause harm, yet presented under the guise of  legitimate concern. Views that lead to actions which undermine the safety and  security of Israel and the Jewish people cannot be welcomed, nor given credence,  much less financial support, by those who believe in Israel as a Jewish  nation.Actions that seek to undermine the men and women who serve in the  IDF; ones that would have Israeli citizens arrested in foreign countries and  charged with war crimes; ones that would see Israel brought before the  International Court of Justice at The Hague, are  unacceptable.




Additionally, those who would encourage and support a  boycott of Israel, painting the country and its people as an apartheid nation  and people, cannot be seen as beneficial in any way, as they only help to make  Israel appear illegitimate to world bodies and the court of public  opinion.This, of course relates to the ongoing debate in Israel about  the NGO Shovrim Shtikah – Breaking the Silence, and its primary benefactor in  the United States, the New Israel Fund. Breaking the Silence it has recently  been revealed is simultaneously funded by Palestinian entities opposed to the  existence of the Jewish state.In May 2015, Breaking the Silence provided  57 testimonies against IDF soldiers for a report intended to prove that Israel  not only used excessive force during the 2014 Operation Protective Edge, but  callously targeted Palestinian women, children and noncombatants.It has  also been revealed that report was partly commissioned by the Palestinian  foundation The Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Secretariat,  operating in Ramallah. The Secretariat noted in a report published in 2015 that  it paid Breaking the Silence to bring it testimonies against the  IDF.Additionally, Hamas, at no less than nine events it held worldwide,  used the Breaking the Silence report to promote the idea of bringing Israelis up  on war crimes charges. Two were held in Scotland, under the auspices of MAP  (Medical Aid for Palestine) and the anti-Israel Scottish National Party. Other  events took place in Zurich, Luxembourg, Madrid, and in several places in the  United States, under the banner of the New Israel Fund.Following the  intense advocacy of the Hamas-backed groups, last month an IDF reservist who  served in the Operation Protective Edge was detained over accusations of war  crimes after landing in Britain on a business trip. He was released after  Israel’s embassy intervened, but it confirmed that groups are working hard to  expose individual Israeli citizens to international scrutiny.Last week,  20 IDF combat soldiers began a campaign to urge donors to groups opposed to the  IDF – and funded by the New Israel Fund in America – to recognize the damage  their money is causing. Letters were delivered to more than 100 major donors to  the New Israel Fund, including Barbara and Eric Dobkin, Murray Koppelman, the  Leichtag Foundation, the Jewish Communal Fund, and Rabbi Gordon Tucker of Temple  Israel of White Plains, New York.Offering the benefit of the doubt, the  letter stated, “The goal that you sought to achieve with your donation was to  support Zionism and support organizations working for human rights and against  anti-democratic activities. You support organizations that you believe work  towards creating a better, saner, more democratic, and more moral  Israel.”They called on these donors to use their clout to “[d]emand that  the New Israel Fund cease and desist from supporting organizations that defame  IDF soldiers, in Israel and around the world. These include organizations such  as Breaking the Silence, B’Tselem, Yesh Din, the Public Committee Against  Torture in Israel (PCATI), Gisha – Legal Center for Freedom of Movement, and  Machsom Watch.”It cannot be ignored that Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon  forbade the entrance of Breaking the Silence to all IDF bases, and Education  Minister Naftali Bennett announced that he forbade the entrance of Breaking the  Silence to all schools.Within the US Jewish community there is no  shortage of opinions. There are issues of religion which our rabbis and leaders  argue over.When it comes to the State of Israel, however, the Israel  Defense Forces must be a holy entity for our people. When work delegitimizes the  State of Israel, seeks to have it citizens threatened as they travel around the  world, and causes the military to be anything less than a force of strength and  security against Israel’s enemies, it harms the Jewish state.It is time  for donors to the New Israel Fund to stop funding the enemies of the Jewish  state.George Birnbaum is a former chief of staff to Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu.Hank Sheinkopf, CEO of Sheinkopf Communications, is a  political strategist who has worked on campaigns in four continents.

<title>Washington watch: Bluffing for peace</title>
<date>7/10/2015</date>
<content>
Benjamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas went to the United Nations General Assembly  last week with the same message: I want peace, I am ready to make peace and the  only thing preventing peace is the other guy’s intransigence.Neither was  very convincing.




Prime Minister Netanyahu declared, “I am prepared to  immediately, immediately, resume direct peace negotiations with the Palestinian  Authority without any preconditions whatsoever.... I remain committed to a  vision of two states for two peoples.”He has a credibility problem. In  his election campaign seven months ago he told supporters there would be no  Palestinian state on his watch. He later tried to walk that back but not  everyone was buying. Especially President Barack Obama, who said he would  “reevaluate” the relationship in light of those remarks. He has yet to reveal  the results of that process, and it is certain to come up when Netanyahu meets  with him at the White House November 9.While Netanyahu was expressing  his questionable support for two states last week in New York, his top diplomat,  deputy foreign minister Tzipi Hotovely, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party, was  in the same building saying just the opposite.Not only is she an  outspoken opponent of Palestinian statehood but she wants to annex the rest of  the West Bank. Transfer of any additional territory is not “even on the list of  options we’re offering the Palestinians,” she said. Which raises the question:  as the nation’s senior diplomat, whom does she speak for? Also in the building  that day was Netanyahu’s newly appointed ambassador to the United Nations, Danny  Danon, another Likudnik and outspoken opponent of Palestinian statehood who also  wants to annex the West Bank. Back home, Netanyahu’s top negotiator with the  Palestinians, Interior Minister Silvan Shalom, and Defense Minister Moshe  Ya’alon feel much the same.Netanyahu has never asked his own Likud Party  or any coalition he headed to endorse the two-state approach.As for no  preconditions – not quite. In the same sentence that he mentioned his commitment  to two states he said the Palestinian entity must be “demilitarized” and  “recognize the Jewish state.”Netanyahu has other issues he has taken off  the table in advance, including no compromise on Jerusalem, which he insists  must remain Israel’s undivided capital.That could be a deal breaker  right away since Palestinians insist on making the capital of their state in  east Jerusalem. Then there’s Netanyahu’s opposition to any Palestinian right of  return for refugees and refusal to evacuate of any settlements. He has  accelerated construction of housing and infrastructure on the West Bank that is  absorbing land on which the Palestinians expect to build their state, a  deliberate provocation clearly intended to make creation of a viable Palestinian  state much more difficult.His governing coalition is arguably the most  far right in Israel’s history, with two-thirds of the seats held by opponents of  Palestinian statehood. If Netanyahu were honest about wanting peace, he could  have put together a centrist coalition.There was nothing in his UN  speech offering his vision for peace, no hint of a timetable, no mention of the  shape of the two states.“If Netanyahu is serious about movement with the  Palestinians he has to change the government and bring in those who want to make  peace, and he has to make sure his own party will support the two-state solution  based on a settlement freeze and the 1967 borders,” said former deputy defense  minister Ephriam Sneh.Speaking on a conference call organized by Israel  Policy Forum last week, Sneh said Netanyahu’s interest in forming a regional  strategic alliance with the Arab states against Iran and Islamic State is out of  the question “as long as we occupy the West Bank.” There is “no alternative to  the two-state solution.”He believes there are enough votes in the  Knesset to form a pro-peace government, if Netanyahu is sincere about cutting a  deal with the Palestinians.If Netanyahu is bluffing about wanting peace,  so is Abbas.Sneh praised the Palestinian president’s commitment to  working with Israel against violence. “You can’t find another Palestinian leader  who is more pro-peace and anti-terrorism,” he said. Netanyahu has “humiliated”  him and the prime minister’s attitude and policies, particularly settlement  expansion, have made the Palestinian leader weaker in relation to Hamas, which  derides Abbas as Israel’s policeman because of the effective job his forces are  doing in security cooperation.Abbas’ UN speech was anything but  conciliatory, however.It was inflammatory and filled with venom and  lies.His failure to condemn last week’s murder of a mother and father in  front of four of their children and to rebuke some senior figures in his Fatah  faction who have praised recent attacks on unarmed civilians as heroic acts, was  unconscionable to Israelis.At the UN podium he used words like “colonial  military occupation,” “brutality of aggression and racial discrimination,”  “breach of international humanitarian law,” “ethnic cleansing,” “apartheid,”  “racist annexation,” “the most ferocious enemy of peace” to describe  Israel.Those words of hate – echoing the rhetoric coming from much of  Netanyahu’s own Likud base – overshadowed his call to “build bridges of dialogue  instead of checkpoints and walls of separation.”He rejected Netanyahu’s  call for unconditional talks instead of challenging its credibility. “It is  futile to go into negotiations without clear parameters and in the absence of  credibility and a specific timetable.”Abbas, 80, in the 11th year of his  four-year term and loath to calling new elections or sharing power, spoke of  Jerusalem as the birthplace of Jesus (actually Bethlehem) and the ascension of  Muhammad, but he didn’t mention any Jewish ties to the city founded by King  David more than 3,000 years ago. Arafat claimed there never was a Jewish Temple  on the Mount and Abbas has done nothing to contradict that.Abbas and  Netanyahu each have given the other good reason to doubt his intentions. With  Abbas’ incendiary language and Netanyahu’s aggressive settlement construction  both have shown themselves to be long on rhetoric, short on vision.Each  complains he has no partner for peace, and seems intent on proving  that.“We are very close to another intifada,” said Sneh, a retired  general who was the IDF West Bank administrator in the 1980s. “The Palestinians  are frustrated, Abbas’ negotiations don’t bear any fruit and the teens of today  don’t remember the huge price the Palestinian community paid for the second  intifada” that led to the deaths of more than 3,000 Palestinians and 1,000  Israelis between 2000 and 2005.
Both seem oblivious to the impending  tragedy their intransigence ensures.

<title>Washington Watch: Netanyahu retreats on Palestinian state</title>
<date>11/3/2015</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tries hard to be all things to all people.  He’s a tough-talking but risk averse strongman who threatens to attack Iran’s  nuclear sites but tries to bully the United States into doing it for him. He  says he is grateful for US President Barack Obama’s support and in the next  breath bites the hand that feeds him. He talks about making peace with the  Palestinians but finds endless excuses to avoid it.Those traits were on  display this weekend as questions arose about his commitment to the two-state  approach to peace. In the six years since he first seemed to endorse the concept  in a speech at Bar-Ilan University, his position has gone from “yes, but” to  “hell, no” with a few stops in between.




Two things happened last Friday  to focus new attention on the issue. Nahum Barnea reported in Yediot Aharonot  that in secret talks in London in August 2013, Netanyahu’s envoy and personal  lawyer, Yitzhak Molcho, indicated a willingness to withdraw to the 1967 borders  with some land swaps, to recognize a limited right of return for Palestinian  refugees and make major concessions regarding Jerusalem.The prime  minister’s office at first denied any knowledge of the document, then called it  a forgery and finally said it was an American proposal never agreed  to.
 .middle-script{ max-height:5px; max-width:670px; font-style: italic;} .middle-script .fb_iframe_widget {top: -30px; float:right;}Turns out they did know about the proposal. Amb. Dennis Ross, the  longtime US negotiator, said he’s the author and it came out of talks he  participated in with Molcho and representatives of Palestinian President Mahmoud  Abbas, and that no formal agreement was reached. Netanyahu’s supporters  suggested to reporters the leaked document was a White House conspiracy to  undermine the prime minister with his settler/nationalist base.The  second matter was a newsletter distributed by Netanyahu’s Likud Party at  synagogues Friday night saying the Bar-Ilan endorsement of two states has been  “annulled” and “Netanyahu’s entire political biography is the struggle against  the establishment of the Palestinian state.”Did he or didn’t he change  positions? Netanyahu’s office let the story percolate over the weekend before  issuing a non-denial denial. The Likud newsletter was written by Knesset member  Tzipi Hotovely, an advocate of annexing the West Bank, and she was speaking for  herself.So Netanyahu does support a two-state solution? Not really. Last  month he wrote on his Facebook page: “I’m against giving up Judea and Samaria  because all that space will become a terrorist base of radical Islam.” Earlier  he told a campaign rally “each piece of land from which we withdraw... would be  taken over by radical Islam.”This week he said Palestinian statehood is  “simply not relevant” for the indefinite future because “any land that is handed  over would be grabbed by Islamist extremists.” In other words, fuhgeddaboudit.  “There will be no withdrawals” and “no concessions” to the Palestinians,  Netanyahu said Sunday.The subject of peace never came up in last week’s  congressional speech. Not one word. It was all about Iran. That was very  different from his 2011 address from the same platform. “We will be very  generous on the size of a future Palestinian state,” he declared then.He  was bluffing. Starting with his 2009 Bar-Ilan speech, Netanyahu has put so many  conditions on statehood that his yes really means no. And in those six years he  has done nothing to advance the idea.He avoids committing to discuss the  1967 lines as a reference point for permanent borders, rules out any division of  Jerusalem, demands Palestinians recognize Israel as the Jewish state and insists  on indefinite Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley. Meanwhile he  continues taking Palestinian land for expanding settlements or building roads  and bypasses to keep Jews and Arabs apart in the West Bank – creating what  critics say is the infrastructure for an apartheid system based on occupied  territory.What does he really want? The status quo. But the Palestinians  won’t accept that and neither will the Americans and the Europeans, who intend  to press the next government to revive peace talks with the  Palestinians.The next prime minister has to worry more about the  Europeans than the Americans. Not only are they Israel’s most important trading  partners but they have no friendly political base to run interference when the  government wants to apply pressure. It’s not for nothing that when Netanyahu  wanted to sabotage the Iran negotiations he went to Washington and none of the  capitals of the five other powers in the negotiations.Netanyahu has said  a binational state is unacceptable because it would threaten Israel’s survival  as a Jewish and democratic state, and he’s ruled out a Palestinian state for the  foreseeable future. What’s the alternative? Indefinite occupation? Israeli  author Amos Oz wrote, “The status quo in Israel is an illusion, to be replaced  by the unacceptable – one Arab state.” These two cannot live in harmony in a  single state after “having inflicted so much pain on each other for so long,” he  said. “It is either two states by choice or one – Arab – state by  default.”Netanyahu never wanted to endorse the two-state solution  although five of his predecessors already had. He went along reluctantly – and  with caveats he knew the Palestinians would find unacceptable – under pressure  from Obama. That and a settlement freeze were to be the keys to launching talks  with Abbas.Netanyahu agreed to a 10-month partial freeze and Abbas  dawdled away the first nine months before agreeing to talk and then demanded  Israel extend the freeze indefinitely if talks were to continue. Once more – and  not for the last time – negotiations collapsed because neither side was willing  to take them very seriously.Each has regularly promised not to make  unilateral and provocative moves, but they both did anyway, giving each other an  excuse to walk away.Netanyahu likes to say he has “no partner for peace”  but that he has “natural partners” for forming the next government, Naftali  Bennett and his right wing religious-settler party, Bayit Yehudi. Bennett is an  outspoken foe of Palestinian statehood, wants to unilaterally annex three fifths  of the West Bank and says the Torah is Israel’s deed to the land.
That  should give some idea what Netanyahu means when he says Palestinian statehood is  “simply not relevant” for the indefinite future.

<title>We must fight BDS in the name of human rights</title>
<date>11/6/2015</date>
<content>
There is a  growing and widespread concern among Jews in Israel and  outside, and among  friends of Israel everywhere, at the increasing  threat posed by the BDS  movement. At three conferences in the past few  days – in Las Vegas convened by  Sheldon Adelson and Haim Saban, at The  Jerusalem Post Conference in New York,  and at the Interdisciplinary  Center Herzliya at which I spoke – discussion about  the BDS movement  and how to tackle it has continued apace.Our fight  against this movement will not be easy, nor won overnight or  without  cooperation, determination and support. But it is a fight we  can and must win,  not just for the survival of Israel or the safety of  the Jewish people, but for  the world.




But to understand how to win this fight, it is necessary to  stand back and see the wider phenomenon of which it is a part.

Universities in particular should be vigilant in  ensuring freedom of  speech, which means listening respectfully to views contrary  to one’s  own. A fundamental precondition of justice is Audi alteram partem: Hear   the other side. Otherwise universities are in danger of becoming what  Julien  Benda described in The Treason of the Intellectuals,  environments for “the  intellectual organization of political hatreds.”However, the larger  phenomenon which forms the backdrop for the BDS  movement has become ever clearer  in the course of the 21st century. It  is the latest incarnation of the denial to  Jews as a distinctive faith  and people the right to be: the right to govern  themselves in the land  of their beginnings.Anti-Semitism is not a static  phenomenon.It is a virus that mutates, thereby defeating the immune  system of free  societies. During the Middle Ages, Jews were hated for their  religion.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, they were hated for their race.   Today they are hated for their nation state. For a thousand years they  were the  most conspicuous non-Christian presence in a Christian Europe.  Today the State  of Israel is the most obvious non-Islamic state in a  largely Muslim Middle East.  Anti-Semitism is not simply about Jews. It  is an offense against the fundamental  dignity of difference.Contrary to popular presupposition, it is not easy  to justify hatred in  public discourse. That is why anti-Semites have always  sought  validation from the highest source of authority within a given  culture.In the Middle Ages, that was religion.Hence religious  Judeophobia.In the 19th century, it was science, in the form of the  so-called  scientific study of race, and Social Darwinism, the belief that  society  operates like biology, in which the stronger survive by eliminating the   weaker.Ever since the end of the Second World War the highest source of  authority has been human rights.That is why, during the parallel  sessions of NGOs that accompanied the  notorious United Nations Conference  Against Racism in Durban just days  before 9/11, Israel was accused of the five  cardinal sins against human  rights: racism, apartheid, crimes against humanity,  ethnic cleansing  and attempted genocide. Today any assault against Jews must be  couched  in the language of human rights.The simplest way of  understanding the sustained assault against the  State of Israel is that in 1948,  1967 and 1973 its enemies sought to  put it in a military crisis, and failed. In  1973 with the international  boycott they tried to put it in an economic crisis,  and failed. In  1975 with the “Zionism is Racism” motion in the United Nations  they  sought to put it in a political crisis, and failed. In 2001 and 2002,  with  the relentless waves of suicide bombings, they tried to put it in a   psychological crisis, and failed. Now, with the BDS movement among  others,  Israel’s enemies are seeking to put it in a moral crisis, and  to some extent  they may succeed.The first sign of this is that among young Jews Israel  – which was once  the great unifying factor amongst Jews worldwide – has become,  in at  least some circles, a divisive one.The second is the attempt to  make public opinion in European societies  so hostile to Israel that, eventually,  some Jews may feel forced to  make a choice, between supporting Israel on the one  hand and living in  Europe on the other – a point made forcibly some years ago by  the  French-Jewish intellectual Alain Finkielkraut. This must be resisted   unequivocally, as many Jews are doing, in the name of human rights  themselves.  Israel remains the one genuine democracy in the Middle  East, with a free press  and independent judiciary, the one place where  religious minorities can safely  live their faith.The ultimate aim, of course, is to leave Israel so  isolated in the  international arena that its enemies can seek its destruction,  God  forbid, without fear of significant reprisals other than from Israel   itself.The rebirth, in this mutated form, of anti-Semitism within living   memory of the Holocaust should be chilling for anyone with a genuine  sense of  humanity. An assault on Jews or the Jewish state is never an  assault on them  alone.It is an assault on religious freedom itself. Today, when  Christians  are being persecuted and Muslims murdered by the forces of radical   political Islam, all who care for human rights, particularly European   governments and their Jewish communities, must stand together with the  Israeli  government in their defense, refusing to allow the cause to be  hijacked by those  whose ultimate agenda is neither freedom nor  democracy but something altogether  older, darker and very dangerous  indeed.

<title>What began with the Jews has crossed a new threshold for Europe</title>
<date>16/11/2015</date>
<content>
The Charlie Hebdo/Jewish supermarket attacks of January 2015 followed years of  anti-Semitic terrorism in Europe and Israel which have now led over the edge of  the abyss into general mayhem.Despite the French government’s welcome  measure of placing armed military personnel outside vulnerable Jewish targets, a  cognitive disconnect has continued in media and political rejection of the  features common to European and Israeli victimology.




A London  Metropolitan police official at September’s Counter-Terrorism Summit in Israel  expressed his concern with Islamic State, al-Qaida and Boko Haram, but admitted  that Hamas and Hezbollah did not reach his radar screen.Yet all  jihadists view the Jew as a tactical target within a consortium of enemies that  include America, Western values, Christianity, moderate Muslims, women and  homosexuals. The strategic target is the delicate fabric of democracy  itself.In the slum belts around French cities, twin cries in Arabic now  resonate among native-born Islamists,fired up by jihadist imams and Internet  sites: “Maut al Yahud” (Death to the Jews) and “Na’al Fransa” (Curse  France).These young Europeans, recruited to IS in Syria/Iraq or  Pakistani Koranic schools, are now returning home as trained  murderers.The political sophistication of the Friday 13 Paris atrocities  lies in the total lack of sophistication in the choice of targets: a sports  stadium, restaurants, a theater. Not ministries, banks, stations, military  installations, but coordinated attacks on the general public.These  black-uniformed, suicide-belted, “Allahu Akbar” shrieking “martyrs,” crouched  and swiveled their Kalashnikovs in 360 degree turns, for maximum carnage.  Multiple locations for simultaneous assaults augmented general panic and  confusion, especially for security and first responders.These are the  appurtenances of Middle East terrorism – honed over years against Israel – now  transplanted to European soil.Yet Europe appeases these forces of evil  by supporting and endorsing the demonization subsets underpinning the terrorism  against Israeli civilians: boycott, now called “labeling” of Jewish export  products; a defensive fence labeled “apartheid wall”; a “right to return”  campaign for the great-great grandchildren of refugees from 1948 British Mandate  Palestine; their current leaders’ theft of Jewish heritage and the constant  attrition of anti-Israel UN resolutions disproportionate to the condemnation of  any other member state.
Paris is only a way station as London, Berlin,  Amsterdam, Brussels and Rome take preventive measures. As Europe rebuilds its  border fences, profile-sifting trained and potential jihadists among the current  refugee wave, perhaps opinion will now bridge that cognitive synaptic  association, that was so axiomatic for Simon Wiesenthal, “what starts with the  Jews never ends with them!” A maxim that can be paraphrased as: “The suicide  bombings, intifadas, knife stabbings, car rammings that began in Israel do not  end there!” Anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism, anti-Israelism in Europe only serve the  mutual enemies of both Israel and Europe.

<title>What is flawed: The EU’s report on Israel or NGO Monitor’s analysis of the document?</title>
<date>1/6/2015</date>
<content>
Last March, the European External Action Service (EEAS) published its reports on  the implementation of the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) in 2014 and  recommendations for actions in the so-called neighborhood countries. These are  the countries encircling the European Union from the east and south – “a ring of  friends.”Although they don’t have a clear European perspective of  becoming member states, they are encouraged to integrate as much as possible  with the EU’s internal market and to adopt the basic values of the EU. For that  purpose they receive substantial EU funding for projects that are similar to  those funded in the candidate countries.




An annex to the country-specific  reports includes statistical data, indicators and benchmarks on democracy and  human rights. This is quite interesting considering the fact that the European  Commission until now has abstained from providing similar data on the candidate  countries where such comparisons could have pressed them to make more progress  in their accession process.As regards Israel the progress report is  overall positive, and it’s no wonder that Israel compares well with all other  neighborhood countries – which either have become failed states, torn apart by  civil wars, struggling with frozen conflicts and turning down EU offers of  association agreements.The report on Israel comes with some caveats. It  deals with the progress made between January 1 and December 31, 2014, in the  implementation of the EU-Israel ENP Action Plan.Developments outside  this period are taken into consideration where relevant. Israel seems to take  EU’s reporting seriously as it has addressed some of the recommendations of last  year’s report.More recommendations could probably have been implemented  if only the two parties had met regularly during 2014. It comes as a surprise to  read that no EU-Israel Association Council or committee meetings were held in  2014. Unfortunately EU-Israel relations aren’t as good as they used to be and  need to be realigned, taking into account the challenges in the  region.Nevertheless, the report claims that cooperation and bilateral  dialogue with Israel was far greater than in 2013.Meetings took place in  all 10 association subcommittees, which serve as policy dialogue forums  involving both EU and Israeli officials. The main source of information in the  report comes obviously from these meetings and official data published by  Israeli authorities.Although the report, in its own words, is not a  general assessment of the political and economic situation in Israel, it’s  useful for anyone following the development in Israel and its relations with EU.  It’s farfetched to call it an anti-Israel report as it includes plenty of  positive assessment of Israeli policies. Overall it’s a balanced  report.As it states, implementing common values such as respect for  human rights in the occupied territories and in relation to minorities continued  to pose a challenge during 2014.Criticism of Israel, however, is matched  with positive comments when they’re due. Just to mention one example: Israel has  accepted a large number of recommendations made in a review by the UN Human  Rights Council.My main remark against the report would be that it  underestimates corruption in Israel.It’s hardly true that the perception  of corruption, according to Transparency International, remained at a  “relatively low level” in 2014 because it was more or less the same as in  2013.It’s known to all that Israel has dropped several steps in the  international ranking and this is well illustrated by the number of recent  corruption scandals, prosecutions and convictions affecting all spheres of  Israeli society.They have involved a former prime minister, ministers,  party- linked associations, mayors, officers, police, rabbis, judges, lawyers  and businessmen. If it were not for the pervasive corruption and the ongoing  conflict with the Palestinians, Israel would be a perfect candidate for EU  membership, judging from the EU report.It came therefore as a total  surprise that NGO Monitor, under its president Professor Gerald Steinberg,  recently denounced the EU report on Israel as “flawed” and accused it of being  based on material from a narrow group of “fringe NGOs resulting in a distorted  approach that has affected the report’s content and credibility.”NGO  Monitor was founded in 2002, after the World Conference against Racism in  Durban, South Africa, where Israel was painted as an “apartheid state” and  Zionism compared to racism. It sees as its mission as making NGOs accountable by  providing information about their activities – especially those claiming to  advance human rights and a humanitarian agenda in Israel.To its credit  it must be said that NGO Monitor is generally doing a good job of collecting  information about the funding of these NGOs and the background of those working  in them. Such information is not always easy to collect – even the European  Commission, despite its lip service to transparency, has refused to disclose all  information.NGOs and their managers need to be scrutinized, and some  have been found to be involved in boycotting and delegitimizing Israel. It  wouldn’t be credible on the part of the EU and member states to fund NGOs with  an anti-Israeli agenda and then use them as sources when reporting on Israel  without carefully checking the facts.But NGO Monitor itself doesn’t act  as an unbiased monitor, checking all NGOs operating in Israel, irrespective of  their political affiliations. Its main target group is human rights NGOs that  are critical of the Israeli government.Its attitude toward NGOs  receiving external funding is similar to that of Russia. An Israeli NGO that  receives EU funding is obviously seen as a “foreign agent.” NGOs receiving  funding from the Israeli government or right-wing foundations abroad seem to be  off its radar (see its list of Israeli NGOs).When analyzing the EU  report, NGO Monitor didn’t discover any factual errors.Its criticism is  almost always about quibbling with words and complaining that context is  missing. This is not a sufficient reason to accuse the report of being flawed.  Nor does NGO Monitor prove that EU relied only on “selective NGO  reports.”NGO Monitor complains that Israel is singled out as the only  ENP country that has a particular chapter devoted to responsibilities under  international law although there are other ENP countries involved in territorial  disputes or frozen conflicts (e.g.Armenia and Azerbaijan). But isn’t a  separate chapter justified in Israel’s case? Israel is the only country that  occupies territories and continues to build in them.“Settlements are  illegal under international law [and] constitute an obstacle to peace,” the EU  states. But NGO Monitor claims that such a statement “has the effect, if not the  intention, of minimizing the significance of violent attacks against these  Israeli civilians.”Who is jumping into conclusions and distorting  reality if not NGO Monitor?

<title>When it comes to Israel, World Vision needs an eye exam</title>
<date>4/2/2015</date>
<content>
The  toxic mix of lies, ignorance, and half-truths that drive the global movement to  delegitimize Israel have washed up at one of the most widely known international  Christian aid organizations.Last week, an Evangelical publication  excerpted a speech delivered by Steve Haas, the vice president of World Vision,  to students at the Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. Haas – drawing on his  authority as a leader of a Christian relief agency that operates in nearly 100  countries with a $1 billion annual budget – called for a radical course  correction within the Evangelical Movement, away from supporting  Israel.




The theological rationale that Haas presents is far from  revolutionary. It’s basic Christian Gospel 101. Be salt and light.Care  for widows and orphans. Follow the example of the Good Samaritan. Haas argues  that evangelicalism has become too focused on Heaven at the expense of advancing  social justice in God’s Kingdom on earth, urging his audience of aspiring  pastors and theologians to go out to correct evil in the world through  love.So, in our troubled world, which evils and injustices rose to the  very top of Haas’ list? Famine and poverty in Africa? Genocide in Syria and  Iraq? Boko Haram? Gay men being thrown off of rooftops in the Muslim world?  Charlie Hebdo commentators being gunned down in Paris by radical Islamists?  Beheadings on YouTube? No – through World Vision’s clouded lens there are only  three injustices – past and present – that merit mention: the genocide in  Rwanda, AIDS, and ending Palestinian suffering at the hands of the Israeli  government.Judging from the strange caricature that Haas draws of Israel  – and the Christians who support it – World Vision has even less sense than it  has sight.Haas levels the familiar and intellectually bankrupt apartheid  charge against Israel, failing to mention that the only truly free Arab  population in the Middle East lives in the Jewish state, where they vote, sit in  the Knesset and the Supreme Court, and hold significant places in Israeli  popular culture – in venues from Miss Israel to Top Chef – and generally enjoy a  higher standard of living than Arabs anywhere else in the region.Haas  laments the rapid decline in numbers of the Palestinian Christian community from  20 percent of the population to less than 1% over the past 65 years, attributing  this to Israeli occupation. It’s an interesting assertion, considering that  two-thirds of Palestinian Christians left the West Bank and Gaza before 1967  when Israel took control of the territories. Meanwhile, Israel today has the  Middle East’s only growing Christian population. In contrast, Hamas is forcibly  converting, subjugating and murdering the Christians of Gaza, while the  Palestinian Authority has imposed laws inspired by Sharia and discriminatory  practices that have left Christians feeling increasingly uneasy and  fearful.He goes on, writing, “It should challenge people when they hear  the average income for an Israeli is $26,000, but for a Palestinian it is around  $2,100.” Perhaps Haas should have challenged himself to examine the many causes  of Palestinian impoverishment.It might have something to do with the  Palestinian leaders – from Yasser Arafat to Khaled Mashal – who became  billionaires drinking from the planet’s largest trough of international aid at  the expense of their people.The surge in the Palestinian standard of  living that came from economic integration with Israel and the efforts of  reformers like former PA prime minister Salam Fayyad have been consistently  turned back by Palestinian leaders, who have chosen terror against the Jewish  state and repression of their own population over economic development and  peace. Look at Gaza. The Palestinian leadership had ample international support  to turn the area into a Singapore of the Middle East – but instead transformed  it into one giant launching pad for Iranian missiles.One wonders why  Haas is completely silent on these incontrovertible facts. Ignorance? Or  deliberate deception? His misrepresentation of Israel is coupled with an all-out  assault on Christian Zionists – who he claims are wedded to a narrow theological  interpretation that blinds one to Palestinian suffering, the importance of  social justice, and ultimately, the authentic path of faith.The truth is  that I and countless other Christians are pro-Israel precisely because of our  drive for social justice for all peoples in this world, here and now.  Evangelicals – particularly in the Millennial generation – have never been more  engaged, organized and firm in their commitment to justice for Israel and the  Jewish people, as well as the Palestinians.I have crossed through  checkpoints dozens of times to visit my Christian brothers and sisters, and my  Muslim friends in the Palestinian territories. I have brought Palestinian  teenagers to live with our church family over their summer breaks. Our ministry  has devoted significant financial resources to support Palestinian Christian  churches.It’s specifically because of this experience that I’m  pro-Israel. Time after time, Palestinian Christians have shared with me the  hardships of their lives – and the vast majority of what I hear has to do with  the increasing persecution they face at the hands of Hamas, the PA and broader  Arab world. It’s a stark contrast to life in Israel, where minorities are  protected, debate is accepted and democracy is enshrined.Of course, like  any other country, Israel is not perfect. There are profoundly complex problems  that must be solved between Israelis and Palestinians, including the status of  the disputed territories.There is deep pain on both sides of this  conflict. That’s why those of us in positions of Christian leadership have a  sacred responsibility to advance real education, real dialogue and real facts.  In a situation that calls for depth and thoughtfulness, Steve Haas’ narrow and  dangerously one-sided presentation is quite far from what one would expect from  a “Christian peacemaker.”World Vision’s reminder to love the neighbor  different from us is a good one.Yet, Christianity teaches us that love  without truth is no love at all. The way that we love our neighbor is not to  validate his falsehoods, or nurture his illusions, but rather to deal in the  truth that can eventually make him free. Those of us who care about Israelis and  Palestinians have an obligation to speak out and say: World Vision needs an eye  exam.

<title>Why Alan Parsons is 99% correct</title>
<date>15/2/2015</date>
<content>
‘Music knows no borders, and neither do I,” English musician and producer Alan  Parsons wrote on his Facebook page last week, in response to Pink Floyd’s Roger  Waters’ request that Parsons cancel his scheduled concert in Tel Aviv. Parsons  was right not to get his music into the debate about BDS (a movement promoting  boycotts, divestment and sanctions) and the labeling of Israel as an apartheid  state, both of which Waters supports.The debate about BDS is a heated  and tough one: on the one hand, many support it – as Waters wrote in August 2013  – in order to make Israel comply with principally admirable “international law  and universal principles of human rights.” On the other hand, many leading  supporters of BDS – like Chicago-based Ali Abunimah – do so for a vision  contrasting the two-state solution, which is officially enshrined in all UN  resolutions on the Israeli-Arab conflict.




The question of whether BDS is  legitimate or not may be bypassed by asking whether it’s effective. I usually  recommend that supporters of Middle East peace to help build Palestine over  attempting to destroy Israel: instead of protesting against an Israeli factory  in the West Bank, buy a fine bottle of Palestinian olive oil. Others fiercely  disagree with me, and I can understand why: if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  is likened to South African apartheid, it is easy to argue that the tactics  adopted to combat the latter will also be effective regarding the former. I  don’t share that premise, and therefore do not share that conclusion.  Nevertheless, even if I did believe in a full-scale boycott, I would make one  exception: music.A behavioral experiment performed six years ago at the  University of London proved that quick blasts of happy music make people  perceive others’ faces as happier, even when looking at faces with completely  neutral expressions.Another study, conducted two years ago in Finland,  showed that music creates a sense of achievement and opportunity among  youth.When Bob Dylan was asked about his 1975 album Blood on the Tracks,  he replied: “A lot of people tell me they enjoy [it]. It’s hard for me to relate  to that. I mean... people enjoying that type of pain, you know?” However, a  study published in the Frontiers in Psychology Journal in June 2013 gives a  solid scientific answer accounting for how sad music, too, leads to cognitive  appraisal, a re-evaluation of our state of mind, and ultimately to  pleasure.Whether at a checkpoint near Bethlehem or on a bus in Tel Aviv,  are we really lacking angry Israelis and Palestinians with a lower sense of  achievement and opportunity, and with even less room for self-criticism? Roger  Waters should have a look at the studies cited above, stroll around Jerusalem,  and he too will realize that music is not something that both peoples deserve –  it is something they need. If the academic references are not sufficient to sway  peace-loving readers in the right direction, possibly my own personal story  will.At the age of 17 I had the unforgettable chance to play in an  Arab-Jewish orchestra of Youth and Music Israel. There I learned to appreciate  the aesthetics of the other side’s art, but also to exchange words for the first  time with Palestinians. Since Israel has an education system that  compartmentalizes secular, national- religious and ultra-Orthodox Jewish and  Christian and Muslim Arab-Israelis, most people in the region grow up without  ever talking to each other. Music was my opportunity to break that silence and  replace my suspicions about Arabs with empathy.I was conscripted a year  later into the IDF. I knew that so long as the politicians don’t solve the  conflict, some of us still have to engage in combat sometimes. Upon returning  home on the weekends I would pick up the phone to Wafa and Anan, who played oud  and kanun with me in the orchestra. I also remember when I wanted to strum some  Bob Dylan on my guitar, I could not access a website with chords for his songs  because it was blocking Internet users with Israeli IP addresses in the name of  BDS. These two anecdotes, of an Israeli soldier’s friendship with fellow  Palestinian youth on the one hand, and of an Israeli soldier unable to sing  peace songs on the other, are perfect examples of why music cannot be made part  of the conflict – it must be part of the solution.Personally, had it not  been for music, I would never have engaged in politics. Thanks to music I have  attended countless demonstrations for peace, I have worked hard to build the  first ever and the largest caucus in the Knesset for a twostate solution,  campaigned to prevent legislation against Palestinian land expropriation, and  organized for hundreds of Israeli students and myself to meet Palestinian  Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in his chamber in Ramallah last year in order  to lend civic support to the (regrettably failed) diplomatic talks he led with  the Israeli government.Alan Parsons wrote “Everyone – no matter where  they reside, what religion they follow, or what ideology they aspire to –  deserves to hear it [his music] if they so choose.” That idea is validated not  only by academic research, but by my own personal experience. Therefore, Alan  Parsons was only 99 percent right. When Parsons writes to Waters that he prefers  avoiding the BDS debate since “this is a political matter,” while he is “simply  an artist,” he slightly misses the point. It is precisely because the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a political matter that music must not know  borders.

<title>Why Roger Waters fails to sway prominent musicians into boycotting Israel</title>
<date>7/10/2015</date>
<content>
Roger Waters tried again to sway a prominent musician into boycotting a scheduled performance in Israel. First, he tried to get Bon Jovi to boycott Israel based on his claim of it being an "apartheid" regime. When he realized that the performance would proceed as scheduled, he resorted to listing a litany of wrongs committed by Israel to the Palestinians and claimed that Bon Jovi was complicit. Let's examine some of his arguments and see why he continues to fail to sway intelligent artists, ranging recently from Dionne Warwick, to Robbie Williams and the Rolling Stones. 




First, Waters argues that Israel is an "apartheid" regime. As anyone who has been to Israel knows, Israel does not meet the definition of an "apartheid" country. Arabs have the right to vote, the right to a free press, serve in Israel's government (there are over 14 Arab members in Israel's cabinet), and even sit on Israel's Supreme Court. The justice who convicted former Israeli President Olmert of corruption was an Arab. Just as America grapples with Ferguson and charges of racial discrimination, there may be instances of injustice to Arabs that occur in Israel. However to try to brand Israel as apartheid is simply untrue and libelous. Second, Waters fails to mention that the founders of the Boycott Israel (BDS) movement do not support Israel's right to self-determination, while only supporting the Palestinians right to self- determination (and statehood). Simply put, the BDS doesn't want to see a Palestinian State living peacefully side by side with Israel, but rather built on the ashes of Israel. Third, Waters has lost credibility with his outlandish comments, including that Israel has treated the Palestinians "worse than the Nazi's treated the Jews", and that Hamas truly wants peace with Israel while their charter and recent proclamations continue to call for the destruction of Israel.  Intelligent artists also know that the following is true: 1) You can't hold an entire population responsible for the actions of its government. If that were the case, should we assume that all artists who perform in the US support every action of the US government, whether domestically or internationally? Of course not. 2) Israel is a pro-western style democracy that has a natural love for western culture - and in particular, music. Artists know this and love performing for their fans--not for any government. 3) Intelligent artists know the power that their music has. It has the power to open hearts and minds, build bridges amongs different cultures, and help to unite those from disparate backgrounds. 4) Artists know that conflicts are complex, and that resorting to name calling, brow beating, and frankly distortions and outright lies is not helpful towards finding resolutions. Recent violent attacks against innocent Israeli's show the power that rhetoric has to incite.  While Waters (and we) laments the loss of innocent life, his functioning as a "bull horn" for spreading untruths and misinformation only fan the flame rather than seek to use the power of music and culture to unite. David Renzer, Chairman, Spirit Music Group and Steve Schnur, Worldwide Executive of Music, Electronic Arts are the Co-founders Creative Community for Peace (CCFP), an organization dedicated to promoting the arts as a bridge to peace and to countering the cultural boycott of Israel. CCFP is comprised of people from a cross-section of the cultural world who represent a broad range of opinions on politics and on the best path to resolving the conflicts between Palestinians and Israelis. But we all agree that singling out Israel as a target of cultural boycotts will not further peace.

<title>Why UCC’s BDS vote matters</title>
<date>8/7/2015</date>
<content>
Islamic State at the gates. Iran on the brink. You can be forgiven if you didn’t hear that the General Synod of the United Church of Christ (UCC) just overwhelmingly passed a resolution to divest from companies that “profit from the occupation” and to boycott settlement products.In the era of massive anti-Israel campaigns from the UN to US campuses, why should we care about a small and rapidly shrinking denomination? In fact, their votes provide us a shocking moment of clarity into the mindset of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) supporters in mainline Protestant churches. For once, they came clean about what they really hoped to accomplish: Sticking it to the Jews, it turns out, is more important than pursuing global justice – or even protecting fellow Christians.

Raheb used the occasion to change every reference to Israel in the scriptural passages he read with the word “Palestine.” (Raheb on an earlier occasion has argued that Jesus was a Palestinian; that he, Raheb, would be a closer DNA match to Jesus than Israelis, who are imposters descended from Khazars of the Russian steppes who converted to Judaism a thousand years ago.)

Nonetheless, for the first time, a majority of delegates at a US church convention had voted to hang the “apartheid” noose around the Jewish state’s neck.The failure to achieve the two-thirds vote was likely due to an impassioned speech by the Rev. Marisa Brown Ludwig, a courageous associate pastor from Massachusetts, whose church dates back to 1714. Rev. Ludwig argued that passing such a resolution would be a “knife in the heart” of their Jewish friends. As the last speaker before the vote, her words apparently had some effect. The “big lie” would have to wait to gain this church’s seal of approval.The digital ink on the two resolutions had scarcely dried when Rev. John Dorhauer, the new general minister and UCC president, made a remarkably honest statement. He said that he had no choice but to comply with the vote, but that he did so “with a deep awareness at the pain that I will cause to people... wondering if the benefits of our divesting from those companies is equal in cost to the relationships that we have with people who are critical to our movement towards justice, not just in Palestine but in many other places.”In other words, while the theme of the synod was justice, and aware of the chilling effect the resolutions would have on joint work with other partners in parts of the world where the UCC could make a difference, the delegates still prioritized sticking it to the Jews. Indeed, the synod did not turn its attention to trouble spots around the world in which hundreds of thousands have lost their lives, women and girls have been kidnapped and raped, children forced into armies and 60 million people in the last few years have left their native lands desperately seeking a safe future.Nor did the synod spend time developing an action plan to assist those we would think are most on their minds: endangered and persecuted Christians. Entire historic Christian communities have been destroyed. Christians live in perpetual fear of their lives in a huge swath of the globe from Nigeria northeast to Iran. None of that seemed to matter to the church activists of the UCC. Demonizing the Jewish state does.Anti-Semitism is irrational, sometimes unconscious and often counterproductive – as it will be to the mission of the UCC and other churches who have embraced the BDS poison. Whatever resolutions they pass about the Holy Land, we can be sure that no Palestinian will be helped, hopes for peace will be pushed back further as Palestinian leaders are given to believe that they can have it all without even having to return to the negotiating table.
Those Jews committed to interfaith dialogue and mutual trust with Christians should take heed of the extreme anti-Israel sentiments seeping their way into mainstream Christendom. These developments demand that we engage our Christian neighbors, that we debunk the lies – political and theological – with the truth about our people’s 3,500-year relationship with the Land of Israel. If we fail to do so, the UCC votes will be a mere harbinger of the onslaught to come.

<title>Words and deeds</title>
<date>22/7/2015</date>
<content>
On Sunday, at the beginning of a three-day visit to Iran to explore business  ties, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel declared that it will be impossible  for his country to normalize relations until the Iranians recognize  Israel.On Monday, the Iranians rejected Gabriel’s call.




“We have  totally different views from Germany on certain regional issues in the Middle  East and we have explicitly expressed our viewpoints in different negotiations,”  Iranian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marziyeh Afkham said on  Monday.  See the latest opinion pieces on our       Opinion & Blogs Facebook      page 


It is a worn-out saying, but actions really do  speak louder than words. Iranians were not paying attention to Gabriel’s empty  statements, but rather to the alacrity with which the Germans – before any other  European country – rushed to Tehran to reap the benefits of a new era of  economic cooperation with Iran.The ink on the nuclear arms agreement has  barely dried; the deal has yet to be ratified; the sanctions have yet to be  removed; yet the Germans are clamoring to do business.That Gabriel made  pro forma statements regarding Israel hardly registered with the Iranians, and  rightly so.Much more significant was the fact that leading heads of  German industry had schlepped all the way to Tehran.And of course there  is Gabriel’s own record vis-à-vis Israel. In 2012, during a visit to Israel, for  instance, he called on Jerusalem to negotiate directly with Hamas, and planned  to meet with the terrorist organization himself, though he was prevented from  doing so by the security situation in the Gaza Strip.During the same  trip, which included a visit to Hebron, he referred to Israel as an apartheid  state on his Facebook page, though he later clarified that he did not intend to  compare Israel with South Africa.Since we seem to be on the verge of a  very different Middle East with a resurgent Iran reasserting itself as an  internationally recognized threshold nuclear state that openly supports  terrorism while carrying on active trade with the West, it is worth looking at  the behavior of Germany, Europe’s most economically powerful state, vis-à-vis  Israel.We know that we have to be careful here. Israel often misreads  European – and German – politics and often ascribes the darkest of motives. But  this is not to say that Germany has not over the years made major foreign policy  blunders regarding Israel. And the basis of Israeli mistrust is not solely  Germany’s Second World War record.In 1967, when Israel was on the verge  of being overrun by the combined armies of our Arab neighbors and Israelis were  digging mass graves in preparation, no European country – including Germany –  came to Israel’s aid.In 1973, there was a repeat of the same despicable  behavior with only Portugal serving as an exception to the rule of European  callousness by granting the US overflight rights to rush us much-needed  supplies.Chancellor Willy Brandt’s Federal Republic refused.In  2000, when Israel put on the table an offer of Palestinian statehood over some  97 percent of the territories and received in return a deadly backlash of  terrorism that exposed the sick underbelly of Palestinian society, European  political leadership did not rush to our defense.Of course, there were  exceptions. Joschka Fischer, Gabriel’s predecessor as vice chancellor from 1998  through 2005, proved to be a true friend of Israel.And Chancellor Angela  Merkel has significantly improved Germany’s relations with the Jewish  state.Speaking to the Knesset in 2008, Merkel said that the existence of  the Jewish state was part of Germany’s raison d’etat and nonnegotiable. And  these are not just empty words. Merkel’s Germany has provided Israel with vital  military aid and has stood by the Jewish state in international  forums.In this context, it was only fitting that Gabriel insist  Germany’s normalization of economic ties with Iran be conditional on Iranian  recognition of Israel.
Too often, however, there is a great deal of  distance between German leaders’ words and deeds. This was clearly on display  this week in Iran.

<title>Zahalka's hysterics</title>
<date>3/10/2015</date>
<content>
MK Jamal Zahalka (chairman of the Joint List’s Balad component) loves to grab the limelight. At any venue and at any pretext he’ll stage self-scripted horror shows, casting himself in the starring role, which inevitably involves shouting indignantly in apparent outof- control righteous rage.This has become the provocative staple of his parliamentary activity, bankrolled by the Jewish state’s taxpayers.




The abuse he hurled at both Jewish visitors and police on the Temple Mount last week, significantly during the Succot festival, is only the latest production he mounted.There was nothing spontaneous and unrehearsed about his performance. He positioned himself at the Mugrabi Gate – the only one through which non-Muslims may enter. Why he waited just there isn’t difficult to work out.No sooner were Jews allowed in than his histrionics began.He accosted the unresponsive visitors with pejoratives such as “criminals, fascists, racists” and “lunatics.” He hectored at policemen for letting the visitors through (according to the status quo) and punctuated his screams with “Get out of here! You have no place here! You are not wanted here! By what right are you here?” But the most damning indications of his true motives are the videos he proudly released of himself aggressively confronting the visiting Jews.Had this not been premeditated, odds are that Zahalka wouldn’t upload to the social media evidence of his hysterics.But Zahalka was pleased by his routine. He knows his electorate and he has good reason to assume that his seemingly stirring defense of exclusive Muslim rights on the Mount and his simultaneous anti-Jewish outbursts can only score him political points in his constituency.It’s via vehement theatrics that the self-professed atheist and graduate of the Hebrew University’s pharmacy school earned his political stripes. He rose to prominence through sensational in-your-face effrontery – the more bellicose and taunting, the greater its effect and the greater the returns on his investment in inflammatory melodramas.Zahalka’s repertoire is impressive, opening with his stint as understudy to the absconded spy Azmi Bishara, his predecessor as leader of Balad.Zahalka boosted his reputation early on with earsplitting, abrasive heckling in the Knesset plenum that repeatedly disrupted speeches by Shimon Peres and Amir Peretz. He has since lashed out blusterously at a host of MKs, most recently at Labor dove Stav Shaffir.He illegally visited Syria and Lebanon, met with Hamas hotshots and hobnobbed with convicted Hamas collaborator and agitator Raed Salah, chief of the Islamic Movement’s Northern Branch. Zahalka continually calls Israel a “terror state,” lambastes Ehud Barak as “a war criminal” and refers to Benjamin Netanyahu as “the Angel of Death.”In 2013 – with his then-fellow Balad MKs Haneen Zoabi (who participated in the 2010 Mavi Marmara provocation) and Basel Ghattas – Zahalka sponsored legislation to define Israel’s Arab minority as an autonomous national unit, an “indigenous nation” as distinct from “colonialist immigrant groupings slated for integration.”While stunts to challenge Israel’s sovereignty form the leitmotif of Zahalka’s polemics, they more than anything do a colossal disservice to Israel’s Arab population. Israeli Arabs’ inherent interests hinge on integration and not segregation – even if it’s voluntary and belligerent segregation, as Zahalka in effect advocates.Ironically, Zahalka passes up no opportunity to rail against Israel’s “apartheid regime.”Sadly, he gets away with his subversion and will likely suffer no repercussions from fanning the flames on the Temple Mount either. Arab politicians such as he, who exploit Israeli democracy to undermine Israel, do not further the cause of coexistence. They intentionally and cynically do the reverse. They create a vicious cycle whereby they radicalize the Arab sector, turn pugnacious propaganda into a vote-getting ploy and thus generate further radicalization.This is the last thing this country’s Arabs need.Looking around them at the mayhem and deadly dysfunction in neighboring states, they can surely conclude that their lot is vastly superior to that of their brethren across the borders.
They live in the Middle East’s freest and most thriving state. Disdainfully deprecating and delegitimizing it, while promulgating seditious agendas for its obliteration, is hardly conducive to building bridges. That should be elementary.

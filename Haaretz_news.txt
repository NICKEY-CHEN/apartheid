<title>How Jewish is Israel?</title>
<date>Fri May 19 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
If we concede A.B. Yehoshua's claim that Israel is the source of Jewish identity in today's world, we reduce Jewish identity to a conversation between anti-Semitism and a blood-and-soil nationalism that is Jewish only in the sense that anti-Semites use the term i.e., racial. But if, instead, we define "Jewish" on the basis of the universal ethical challenges at the core of Judaism, then not only is the Diaspora an essential condition of Jewishness, but Israel's own claim to a Jewish identity is open to question. 
The idea that the modern State of Israel expresses some ageless desire among  Jews across the Diaspora to live in a Jewish nation state is wishful thinking. Before the Holocaust, Zionism had been a minority tendency among Western Jews, and scarcely existed among those living in the Muslim world. And a half century after Israel's emergence, most of us choose freely to live, as Jews have for centuries, among the nations. That choice is becoming increasingly popular among Israeli Jews, too: 750,000 at last count - hardly surprising in an age of accelerated globalization that feeds dozens of diasporas and scorns national boundaries. 
The State of Israel was created by an act of international law in 1948, largely in response to the Holocaust. It was violently rejected by an Arab world that saw it as a new Western conquest of the territory over which so much blood had been spilled to defend Muslim sovereignty during the Crusades, so like most nation states Israel had to fight its way into existence. Its victory came at the expense of another people, whose dispossession was the precondition for Israel achieving an ethnic Jewish majority. And the conflict fueled by the unresolved trauma of its birth has condemned the Jewish state to behave in ways that mock the progressive Zionist dream of Israel fulfilling the biblical injunction to Jews to be a "light unto the nations." 
Former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg puts it eloquently: "The Jewish people did not survive for two millennia in order to pioneer new weaponry, computer security programs or anti-missile missiles. We were supposed to be a light unto the nations. In this we have failed. It turns out that the 2,000-year struggle for Jewish survival comes down to a state of settlements, run by an amoral clique of corrupt lawbreakers who are deaf both to their citizens and to their enemies. A state lacking justice cannot survive. More and more Israelis are coming to understand this as they ask their children where they expect to live in 25 years. Children who are honest admit, to their parents' shock, that they do not know." 
So, while Yehoshua challenges the Jewish identity of the Diaspora, Burg  challenges the Jewish identity of Israel. Of course, they use different definitions of "Jewish." Yehoshua dismisses religion, and says it is the land and language of Israel that defines him. I am not religious, but I share Burg's belief that Judaism is fundamentally an ethical challenge epitomized for me by the famous "on-one-leg" definition by Hillel: "That which is hateful unto yourself, do not do unto others; all the rest is commentary." 
The fact that in Israel, Hebrew was transformed from a liturgical language to eclipse the Yiddish, Ladino and Arabic in which Jews had communicated for hundreds of years is a remarkable feat of nationalist social engineering, but nothing more. The notion of identity deriving from the soil seems to owe more to 19th-century European nationalism than to Jewish ethics. I can't see anything Jewish about investing hills and piles of stones with a spiritual significance worth dying and killing for. 
Growing up in apartheid South Africa was an object lesson in Jewish ethics. Yes, there was plenty of anti-Semitism in the colonial white society, but the mantle of victimhood belonged to others. And if you responded to the very Jewish (although in no way exclusively so) impulse to seek justice, you found yourself working side by side not only with the remarkable number of Jews who filled leadership roles in the liberation movement, but also with Christians, Muslims, Hindus and others, each articulating their own traditions within a common identity based on the common values. 
Judaism's universal ethical calling can't really be answered if we live only among ourselves - and Israel's own experience suggests it's hard to live only among ourselves without doing injustice to others. As physical threats to Jewish existence in the Diaspora have receded, Zionists today cite the specter of "assimilation." But assimilation holds no fear for the happy Diaspora-ist who expresses his traditions as just that - traditions - alongside those of others. 
The idea that Jews should live in a ghetto is one from which Jews were, mercifully, liberated variously between the 18th and the 20th centuries. A.B.  Yehoshua and others want to revive something we're better off without. All of the great Jewish intellectual, philosophical, moral and cultural contributions to humanity I can think of were products not of Jews living apart, but of our dispersal among the cultures of the world  . Maimonides or Spinoza, Marx, Freud, Einstein or Derrida; Kafka, Proust or Primo Levi; Serge Gainsbourg or Daniel Barenboim; Lenny Bruce or Bob Dylan - I could go on ad nauseum - all are products of our interaction with diverse influences in the Diaspora. 
Jewish identity is always in flux and contested. The Zionist moment is a comparatively brief one in the sweep of Jewish history, and I'd argue that Judaism's survival depends instead on its ability to offer a sustaining moral and ethical anchor in a world where the concepts of nation and nationality are in decline. Israel's relevance to Judaism's survival   depends first and foremost on its ability, as Burg points out, to deliver justice, not only to its citizens, but to those it has displaced. Until then, Israel's own Jewish identity also remains uncertain.

<title>Muslim leader gets interfaith award in U.S. despite Jewish protests </title>
<date>Fri Oct 06 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
The Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations gave an interfaith award to a prominent Southern California Muslim leader despite strong objections from Jewish organizations who criticized him for comments made about Israel.
Dr. Maher Hathout received the John Allen Buggs Award on Thursday for his contributions to relations between religions. Hathout, 70, is a retired cardiologist who is chairman the Islamic Center of Southern California.
The commission called him "an inspired and tireless voice for greater interfaith understanding and alliances."
The decision drew bitter criticism from some Jewish leaders, who pointed to comments the Egyptian-born Hathout made at a rally in Washington, D.C., in 2000.
Speaking at a Jerusalem Day rally, Hathout said: "We did not come here to condemn the condemned atrocities committed by the apartheid brutal state of Israel because butchers do what butchers do and because what is expected from a racist apartheid is what is happening now."
Hathout said earlier this year that his remarks had been "harsh." He said they sprang from anger over the way Israeli authorities were treating Palestinian protesters in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the last Intifada.
Organizations including the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles and the American Jewish Congress condemned the honor, and one previous recipient returned his John Allen Buggs Award in protest.

<title>The Jewish lobby approves</title>
<date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
The chair of the Israel Architects' Association, Yitzhak Lir, turned last week to a British architect, Lord Richard Rogers, and invited him to head the panel of judges for the David Azrieli Prize, which will be awarded to the most outstanding student final project in the schools of architecture here. 
Rogers was chosen, says Lir, because he is "an exceptional architect." However, the chief motive for inviting him was Rogers' repudiation of his previous support for the Architects and Planners for Justice in Palestine, a British organization that called for a boycott of those involved in construction in the territories to the detriment of Palestinian rights. 
Lir, who a few weeks ago condemned the identification by major architectural figures (including Rogers) with the APJP, expressed complete satisfaction with the fact that Rogers "had second thoughts and now sees things in a different light. I am glad that he is no longer against us and is now for us." 
Lir was a little hasty in his tribute to the highly acclaimed British architect's second thoughts. According to the British and American press, and those closely associated with the affair, Rogers began to see things in a different light only after massive pressure from Jewish organizations and politicians in the United States. He found out the hard way that taking a moral stand could cost him the huge and eminently desirable projects he is currently planning in New York. 
The affair began with the first meeting of the APJP, which Rogers hosted in his offices in London on February 2. Dozens of architects and intellectuals attended the meeting, and Rogers made the introductory statements. News of Rogers' involvement in the organization's activities shot across the Atlantic and outraged Jewish organizations in New York. 
One of Rogers' current projects in New York is the enlargement of the Jacob K. Javits Center in Manhattan. The late Senator Javits was a passionate supporter of Israel, and various parties warned Rogers that his "suitability" for the $1.7 billion project, one of the largest in New York, would be in doubt if he continued to support APJP's "extreme stand." 
The story ignited a storm, and Rogers was forced to work hard to calm things down. He hired the American public relations expert Howard Rubinstein, a specialist in damage control with a seven-figure income, and, last week, while still recovering from surgery, Rogers flew to New York. He held highly publicized meetings with his critics, who cross-examined him regarding the steps he had taken, and launched an intensive campaign of clarifications and apologies. 
Rogers explained that he had hosted the APJP meeting only as a favor to an old friend, the British Jewish architect Abe Hayeem, a left-wing activist and one of the APJP's founders. He was not completely aware of the organization's nature and its goals, he said; in any case, he maintained, he left the meeting in his office after 10 minutes. 
Rogers publicly distanced himself from the APJP, repudiating its aims. He said that he had never supported any boycott of Israel, and that he is opposed to any economic boycott (although he had joined his friend Abe Hayeem and other architects in a boycott of the apartheid regime in South Africa). His repentance was accompanied by public support for construction of the separation fence and a call to Hamas to "renounce terrorism and recognize Israel's right to exist." 
Recent articles about Rogers note his Jewish extraction and tell how his family had fled from the Fascists in Italy in the 1930s. PR expert Rubinstein told "The Jewish Chronicle" that Rogers and his first wife honeymooned in Israel and added that if offered a project in Israel, Rogers would respond favorably. 
The paper also reported an embarrassing yet amusing tidbit: In a television interview in New York, Rogers said that the conflict in the Middle East was between "a terrorist state and a democratic state." Which was the terrorist state, the interviewer asked. Rogers, apparently confused, responded: "Israel." His wife Ruth, a Jewish American and the owner of a fashionable London restaurant, hurriedly corrected him: "Not Israel, not Israel." 
Rogers' clarifications mollified the Jewish lobby, which gave him its blessing to continue his work in New York. And the world of architecture lost an opportunity to restore its dignity and advance a courageous agenda. 
The dilemma Rogers faced was not a simple one. Taking a moral stand is a privilege that can be enjoyed by precious few, those who can afford to pay the price. Rogers - an architect with an international reputation and a wealthy member of British society - is one of those precious few. A refusal to back down on his part would have set a utopian standard to which others could aspire. 
Consequently, Rogers' choice is a resounding disappointment. The "prize" he received from the Israel Architects' Association for his conduct in this affair is a dubious one. The association, as the representative voice of Israeli architects, has never excelled in taking a moral stand on the issues that Rogers faced. It apparently perceives his behavior in this case as a form of legitimization for its own moral imperviousness concering similar issues. 
The invitation from the Architects' Association states that Rodgers is invited to head the judges' panel and to give the keynote address at the awards ceremony in late April or early May. The association has said it will cover all the costs of Rogers' visit and "to do everything in our power to make your stay pleasant and interesting." 
If he accepts the invitation, Rogers will discover that one of the schools whose students are vying for the David Azrieli Prize is located in the West Bank settlement of Ariel. If he takes the trouble to visit the school, he is assured of an interesting visit to a land lacerated with checkpoints, apartheid roads and separation fencing. Pleasant it will not be; perhaps as a result he will have third thoughts.

<title>200 Israelis, Palestinians protest new Israeli-only W. Bank road</title>
<date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
Roughly 200 Israelis and Palestinians turned out for a protest march Saturday against the construction of a new West Bank viaduct that will be open to Israeli traffic only.
The viaduct will run along the existing Route 60 from the Etzion settlement bloc to El Arub.
Among the demonstrators were activists from all the Palestinian factions, including Fatah and Hamas, as well as members of Israeli organizations "Anarchists Against the Fence," "Ta'ayush," and "Fighters for Peace." 
The demonstrators said the viaduct, which they termed an "apartheid road," not only discriminates on the basis of race but will also necessitate the expropriation of land from the Palestinian villages of Halhul, Beit Umar, and El Arub.
"This is a protest against the apartheid road that will be constructed," said Ta'ayush activist Avihai Sharon. "Route 60 will be for Palestinians, while above it a viaduct will be built for Jews only."
"The road will also steal land from Palestinian villages like Beit Umar and Halhul".
The march set out from Beit Umar and ended in the El Arub school. Cooperation between Hamas and Fatah activists was evident in the demonstration, despite the severe tensions between the two factions.

<title>Abbas tells Mandela: S. Africa has role to play in Mideast peace</title>
<date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
JOHANNESBURG - Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas met anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela yesterday as he wound up a three-day state visit to South Africa and headed home to face factional violence in Gaza. 
During a brief courtesy visit to Mandela's Johannesburg home, Abbas paid tribute to the African National Congress veteran as the "father of all liberation movements." 
He said that South Africa, which enjoys good relations with the Palestinians, Israel and the United States, could play "a productive role in the peace process." 
Mandela looked relaxed as he joked with his visitor in front of photographers. 
Abbas met Friday with President Thabo Mbeki. 
In a toast at a dinner in honor of Abbas late Friday, Mbeki said South Africans felt solidarity with the Palestinian people. 
"This visit is very special to all of us because for many decades both our peoples have occupied the same trenches, and shared similar experiences and anxieties in our quest for freedom and independence," Mbeki said according to a text of his speech released yesterday. 
Mbeki said that South Africa's peaceful dismantling of apartheid and transition to multiparty democracy should serve as an example in the Middle East. 
"We are convinced that there is no other road to peace between Palestine and Israel except the road of negotiations to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution," he said.

<title>Academic boycott expires after two U.K. unions merge</title>
<date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The recent decision by the largest lecturers' union in Britain to encourage an academic boycott of Israel has expired, as was expected when it was implemented, said the union's general secretary this weekend. 
Although the controversial decision was made only May 29, it stopped being valid two weeks ago because the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) has merged with another British union, the Association of University Teachers. 
Mackney, general secretary of NATFHE and the merged union, sent a letter Saturday to a British lawyer representing Jewish lecturers against the boycott.  
The letter confirmed that the boycott decision was no longer valid. 
NATFHE's decision encouraged lecturers to boycott Israeli institutions and individuals who do not publicly dissociate themselves from Israeli policies related to the occupation and from discrimination in the field of education. 
It had previously been reported that the boycott decision would be valid for only a short time because of the merger.  
Nonetheless, Israeli anti-boycott groups said yesterday that they saw the move as an achievement of their struggle against the decision. 
The International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom, a group that was founded at Bar-Ilan University in response to an earlier academic boycott and was a key player in fighting NATFHE's move, said in a statement yesterday that it was "pleased to announce that [the decision] has been canceled." 
Education Minister Yuli Tamir said she "welcomes the cancellation of the British academic boycott thanks to the tireless efforts of all the relevant groups in this matter." 
By contrast, MK Rabbi Michael Melchior, the chairman of the Knesset Education Committee, noted that the expiry was a technical matter and "therefore does not indicate anything about a change regarding Israel." 
"The celebrations over the revocation of the British academic boycott of Israel are premature and baseless," he said. 
False pretenses
Supporters of the boycott said that the Israeli lobby falsely presented the expiration as a cancellation and a victory. 
The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, an umbrella organization encompassing dozens of Palestinian nongovernmental organizations, said: "The significance of the academic boycott against Israel adopted by the largest British academic union cannot be viewed in legalistic terms," it said. "Its moral weight should not be underestimated."  
The group added that NATFHE's decision has proven that boycotting Israeli academic institutions because of their cooperation in preserving a special form of anti-Palestinian "apartheid" remains a priority for progressive Western and human rights activists.

<title>Academics: Boycott may hurt junior researchers</title>
<date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Monday's decision by Britain's largest lecturers union in favor of an academic boycott of Israel has worried some academics here. Yesterday they said that although it would probably not have an immediate impact on prominent Israeli researchers, it may affect their younger colleagues who have not yet established themselves in their fields. 
The union has decided to boycott Israeli academics who do not publicly disassociate themselves from Israel's "apartheid policies." 
"We don't know at what pace the practical impact of the decision will be felt," said Zvi Ziegler, a professor at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and chairman of the Israeli Inter-Senate Committee of the Universities, when asked for comment on the decision by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE). "But our fear is that the decision gives legitimacy to people who are debating whether to boycott Israel." 
Ziegler stressed that all Israeli scientists are dependent on colleagues from abroad at various stages of their academic careers. 
"No one will prevent Nobel Prize winner Aaron Ciechanover from publishing an article in a scientific journal," he said. "But a young scientist who sends an article to a British journal is liable to encounter editors who hesitate to publish his article and delay its publication." 
The Inter-Senate Committee, which sharply condemned NATFHE's decision on Monday, is currently focusing on "making the academic boycott completely illegitimate because it is an assault on academic freedom, and getting the senior academic establishment in Britain to publish a declaration that academic boycotts are unacceptable," Ziegler said. 
The Israel Science Foundation, the largest funder of basic research in Israel, sends out some 10,000 letters a year asking scientists to examine research proposals by Israeli researchers and decide whether they deserve funding. According to Professor Joseph Klafter, the ISF's chairman, about 10 scientists have refused to participate in the review process this year. He said that the foundation first began encountering such refusals following Operation Defensive Shield in March-April 2002. Such refusals typically say something like "I respect my Israeli colleagues, but until Israeli policy changes, I will be compelled to refuse your requests." 
A forum comprised of the presidents of all Israeli universities discussed the boycott at its meeting yesterday and issued a statement describing NATFHE's decision as "harmful and dangerous." Professor Moshe Kaveh, the forum's chair and president of Bar-Ilan University, said: "The mixing of politics and scientific research is a destructive phenomenon that must be fought aggressively." 
Professor Steven Rose, a prominent philosopher of science who serves as secretary of the British Committee for Universities of Palestine, said yesterday: "We recognize that this has not been an easy decision, with the extreme pressure put upon the Union by outside forces, including the Israeli government and the organized Israel lobby ... The vote is an historic step forward, both expressing our solidarity with Palestinian academic colleagues and also in helping persuade Israeli colleagues that it is time to cease silent complicity with the illegal acts of the Israeli state." 
Tomorrow, however, NATFHE is due to merge with another lecturers union, which will render the boycott resolution advisory only.

<title>A concert cry severs the silence</title>
<date>Wed Sep 20 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Some 92 minutes for a live broadcast on satellite TV. Such is the amount of time Al-Jazeera and Ramattan, a Palestinian news agency, alloted the "Conquering the Silence" concert in Ramallah on Sunday. During that time, musician Khaled Jubran, who produced and hosted the event, juggled artists performing in recording studios all around the world: Paris, Dubai, Cairo, New York, London and Beirut. An hour and a half after the opening note, organizers breathed a sigh of relief: Everything had gone as planned, except for a few hitches, which did not interfere with the festive atmosphere. Millions watched it all over the world.
Jubran seemed nonplussed by the pressure of such a complex production - one which he worked on with friends for three months - as he stood onstage at the Ramallah Cultural Center, juxtaposed by a couch and an enormous screen. He kicked off the event with a moving virtuoso, solo performance on the Arab buzuk and then proceeded to navigate the event smoothly. He joked with artists who appeared onscreen, but did not conceal his strident opposition to oppression and occupation. Such was the artists' objective for the evening: to break the silence. Satellite technology made it possible to mock the limits to freedom of movement imposed on them by appearing in tandem, despite prohibitions. 
In the first performance, Lebanese  director and actor Roger Assaf appeared in Beirut, emphasizing the walls and boundaries erected between nations of the Middle East and the ensuing silence. Assaf, who remained in the capital during the shelling in the recent war and who has written his impressions in numerous articles, described a trip to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to the Palestinian audience; his is a trip which can only be taken in the imagination. In the end, he begged the forgiveness of viewers for replacing the traditional moment of silence to mourn the dead with a moment of screaming. Live on screen, he removed his glasses, closed his eyes tightly, clenched his fists, and emitted a shriek which sounded like the groaning of a wounded heart. From then on, each performance seemed to be a continuation of that cry. 
The concert's virtual jaunt around the world revealed many different facets of music, dance, art and reached new summits. One performance featured a piece by celebrated guitarist John Williams. Despite his shy demeanor, he executed the piece with typical perfection. 
Musician Kamilia Jubran appeared onstage after Williams; she formerly led the Sabreen group. Jubran offered her own contemporary music style to accompany protest lyrics. Her rendition turns its back on all accepted forms of Arabic singing and oud playing. The Arabic instrument rang with grating dissonance under her hand and the music was an innovative departure from Western tonality and Arabic scales - her voice screamed more than sang. Hers was the only performance that challenged the audience in the auditorium: Some fidgeted in their seats and an audible murmur arose. 
Artists ascended and descended the stage and screen: Breyten Breytenbach, the South African poet who fought apartheid and was jailed for seven years read poems which he dedicated to Palestinian prisoners; Khaled Muhammed Ali, an Iraqi oud player exiled in Dubai, played a classic Arabic piece; Cairo poet Amin Haddad read the nationalist poems of his father Fuad Haddad, drawing resounding response from the audience when he called for continued resistance and mentioned the name of Hassan Nasrallah; and Palestinian actor Yusef Abu-Wardeh, who resides in Israel, stunned the crowd with his superb performance. 
The cultural face  of the Arab world
Finally, the moment that everyone waited for, adored Lebanese composer, singer, and musician Marcel Khalife appeared onscreen, causing pandemonium in the audience. A satellite gaffe which silenced Khalife for many, long minutes created anxiety and disappointment. The audience unanimously sang one of his songs and rhythmically clapped hands to fill the void. But Khalife went back on the air with the song, "Rita and the Gun," by Mahmoud Darwish. The erotic song of love between the poet and the Jewish girl he was forced to leave after 1967 brought the audience to its feet. 
"This protest is supposed to take the place of action. It's typical of middle-class residents here, who are capable of applauding Nasrallah despite the fact that he did nothing for them," said one Ramallah resident. But another Palestinian praised the way the concert "opened people's minds," by presenting artistic material in unfamiliar styles  and showing the cultural face of the Arab world - one which the West is anxious to suppress.He added that the Palestinian public was hungry for defiance and encouragement from artists after a long, depressing silence. "Any break in the silence is welcome," he remarked.

<title>Along with the boycott, some good news</title>
<date>Fri Jun 09 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The decision by NATFHE, the British college lecturers union, to initiate a blacklist with respect to their Israeli colleagues has been met with shock in Israel. It has rapidly become clear that the instigators of the boycott belong to that school of thought in Europe that regards the very existence of the Jewish state as an affront and an injustice. The re-emergence of the boycott initiative in the U.K. was followed closely by a decision by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) in Ontario to declare its own boycott of the Jewish state. Again, the motion that was passed included provisions - such as support for the right of return of 1948 refugees and their descendants to within Israel's borders - which are a coded demand for Israel's demise. 
These two victories for the boycotters might be seen as evidence that Israel is losing the ideas war in significant parts of the Western world, with the demand for Israel's demise moving steadily closer to the political mainstream. Closer observation of political trends, however, indicates a more complex picture. Those who seek Israel's destruction are indeed closer to the mainstream than ever before, but those who argue for a wholehearted identification with Israel are also increasing in numbers and influence in the political mainstream. The latest developments are a factor in a more general, growing polarization. 
Let's take a look at what's being said, and by whom. Taking the British example, it is worth examining for a moment the background to the boycott vote in the NATFHE lecturers union. The same NATFHE conference that supported the blacklist resolution also sent a vote of congratulations to the Respect party for its recent performance in Britain's local elections. Respect is a small and strange alliance of British Trotskyites and Islamists that has emerged in recent years. The blacklist vote, it appears, was the brainchild of activists of this organization. 
What may be learned from this is that the desire for the delegitimization of Israel is not a free-floating, generally-held notion in British political debate. Rather, it is embedded in a more general set of ideas currently on the rise, but far from dominant in Britain and other Western European countries. 
This set of ideas includes a generalized loathing of the U.S., fervent opposition to the Iraq War and a belief that radical Islam is analogous to anti-colonial liberation movements in being an inevitable, understandable response to oppression. One may encounter this belief system in its pure form in organizations such as Respect. It is visible in a more diluted version in the  editorial pages of a number of Britain's quality daily newspapers, and among backbench MPs of the Labour and Liberal Democratic parties. 
Outright rejection of Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state is one of the articles of faith of this belief system in its undiluted form. In the milder version, a view of Israel as analogous to now-defunct outposts of settlement left behind by receding European colonialism - such as Rhodesia and apartheid South Africa - is the preferred stance. Many of the ideas and prejudices held in these circles about Israel have been absorbed undigested from the norms of political debate in the Arabic-speaking world, via the alliance with Islamism. 
On the opposite side, as the debate grows in harshness, one may discern an increasing willingness to openly identify Israel as a valued ally. This is a cross-party phenomenon, though it is mainly to be found on the center-right in European politics. 
To continue with the British example, the new leadership of the U.K.'s Conservative Party combine an outspoken Atlanticism with an overt commitment to confronting the threat of radical Islam. In a speech given last year, William Hague, who will be the U.K.'s foreign secretary should the Conservatives win the next elections in Britain, told his audience that "the parallels with the rise of Nazism go further ... If only, some argue, we withdrew from Iraq, or Israel made massive concessions, then we would assuage jihadist anger. That argument ... is as limited as the belief in the 1930s that, by allowing Germany to remilitarize the Rhineland or take over the Sudetenland, we would satisfy Nazi ambitions." In less strident words, senior Labour figures have expressed a similar linkage. 
Of course, speeches given by politicians seeking office should be treated with caution. But the underlying idea here is a striking one. It holds that in the central foreign policy challenge of this generation, Israel is a natural, valued friend, its victory the victory of the wider Western world. 
In order to understand the passions raised in Europe by the Israel-Palestinian conflict, it is thus crucial to grasp that our dispute is no longer merely another item on the long list of foreign issues that occasionally trouble European political discussion. Rather, it has become to all intents and purposes part of the domestic debate. In the shrill, discordant attempt to single out the Jewish state as a uniquely nefarious presence in world affairs, whose rightful fate is dissolution - one sees into the heart of that alliance of far left and radical Islam that seeks appeasement and accommodation in the face of the Islamist challenge. And in the responses to the demonization of Israel may be glimpsed those forces coalescing to confront this challenge.

<title>Analysis / The IDF is out of ideas for fighting Islamic Jihad</title>
<date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
The Israel Defense Forces recently altered transportation arrangements in the West Bank. In effect, it has split the West Bank into three cantons - much like it used to do in Gaza.
Under the new orders, which are enforced by roadblocks and patrols, Palestinians are totally prohibited from moving from the Tul Karm region south toward Ramallah. In addition, severe restrictions have been imposed on traveling from the Jenin area southwest toward Tul Karm.
The restrictions, which the IDF says are temporary, are part of the army's manhunt for an Islamic Jihad network that murdered 24 Israelis last year. They were stepped up after the network's last attack, when a suicide bomber killed an IDF officer and two Palestinians near Tul Karm.
IDF inquiries indicate that the suicide bombers come from villages north of Tul Karm and proceed from Tul Karm toward Jerusalem, where they enter Israel through gaps in the separation fence.
The main difficulty in fighting Islamic Jihad lies in intelligence gathering. The organization's current activists are much more sophisticated than their predecessors. The IDF killed one of the network's leaders and arrested another, but seven or eight others are now running the show with extreme compartmentalization. The defense establishment believes that the network is preparing three or four suicide bombers to enter Israel at any given time. The absence of intelligence makes catching them more difficult, hence the drastic measures - like segmenting the West Bank.
Cutting Jenin off from Tul Karm is supposed to make it harder to transfer explosives, while blocking the way south makes it harder to reach Jerusalem. The changes may force the cells to alter their modus operandi, thus making it easier to catch them.
Over the last two years, the IDF has begun, albeit slowly, to remove roadblocks around Palestinian towns and villages. Fatah and Hamas have reduced their terror activity, yet now the IDF is resorting to drastic measures against a smaller, if more ruthless group.
But beyond the Jihad threat, cutting up the West Bank fits in with Sharon's plans: preserving settlement blocs, building the fence, possibly evacuating isolated settlements, and establishing separate road systems for Israelis and Palestinians. However, the roads designated for Palestinians are extremely poor, and international help in rehabilitating them is unlikely, as the whiff of apartheid hangs over the exercise.
The IDF has a tough job: Fighting terrorists operating within a civilian population requires deciding among several bad options. But the latest decision, cantonizing the West Bank, raises fears that the IDF is out of ideas in the war on Islamic Jihad. In the absence of answers, it is resorting to collective punishment.

NEW YORK - Under fire for his membership in a professional organization highly critical of Israel, Lord Richard Rogers, the British architect supervising the redesign of the Jacob Javits Center, has cut ties to the group in an effort to salvage his role in the $1.7 billion project.
But that hasn't satisfied several elected officials, including New York state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Rep. Anthony Weiner, who have each demanded Rogers be dropped from the project. And Friday, the chairman of the state commission overseeing the Javits Center redevelopment summoned Rogers to New York to discuss the controversy.
Rogers announced earlier this week he had severed his relationship with Architects and Planners for Justice in Palestine, a group of 60 prominent architects who have called on Israel to stop building settlements and the security barrier in the West Bank.
Last month, the organization issued a statement calling for a boycott of Israel and compared West Bank building firms to those that worked in South Africa during the apartheid era.
Rogers, whose other works include the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris and the Millennium Dome in Greenwich, England, hosted a meeting of the group at his London office but did not vote for the Israel boycott, his spokesman Howard Rubenstein said.
He has been quoted as saying that he supported "targeted activities" against Israel - a claim Rogers denies.
"I have never backed a boycott and I have personally never stated that I favor targeted activities," he said in a statement released Friday.
Rogers' statements were met with mixed reactions Friday from Jewish leaders.
Anti-Defamation League Director Abe Foxman said he had spoken to Rogers Friday, and was reassured by what he heard.
"If we didn't believe that people couldn't change hearts and minds, we wouldn't be in business," Foxman said. "As far as we're concerned, the issue is closed."
But others weren't convinced.
Weiner, a Brooklyn Democrat, released a letter Friday to the Empire State Development Corp. calling for Rogers' contract to be rescinded. The ESDC is overseeing the Javits project and has based its planning on Rogers' design, which would almost double the size of the center.
Weiner cited federal and state anti-boycott laws making it illegal to participate in boycotts of another country and said Rogers' stewardship of the Javits project would dishonor the memory of Javits himself.
"This is not just any project. This is a building that's named after one of the foremost fighters for the state of Israel," Weiner said in an interview.
Javits, a Republican, represented New York in the U.S. House and Senate from 1954 to 1981. He died in 1986, the same year the Javits Center opened.
Weiner added that he considered Rogers' public statements "too clever by half" and said he didn't believe they indicated a true change of heart.
"He's someone who is working on a very lucrative contract, and was caught being involved in an abhorrent organization," Weiner said.
Earlier this week, a spokeswoman for the ESDC told the Sun that ESDC officials were "satisfied" with Rogers' statements. But on Friday, ESDC chairman Charles Gargano announced he had requested a meeting with Rogers next week to review his relationship with the controversial group.
"I look forward to the opportunity to gain a better understanding of his position on these matters, which we take very seriously," Gargano said.
Silver, who had already urged both the ESDC and Gov. George Pataki to sever ties with Rogers, sent a letter to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg Friday urging him to discontinue Rogers' participation in the redevelopment of the East River waterfront.
"The message has to be clear: It's not the American way to punish people for their national origin," Silver said in an interview.
George Arzt, a communications strategist and one-time press secretary to former Mayor Ed Koch, said that while in some places an architect's foreign policy views may not seem relevant to his work, New York's ethnic stew presents an entirely different challenge.
"It's Israel, it's Ireland, it's Italy - in New York, people are very tied to the ethnic groups of their heritage," Arzt said. "Despite the fact that Mr. Rogers is a world-renowned architect, here in New York, the politics of the Middle East overwhelm any reputation he has."

<title>Balad MKs meet Hamas despite police intervention  </title>
<date>Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Israeli Arab lawmakers met with senior Hamas officials in the Al-Azariya neighborhood in East Jerusalem yesterday, after a large force of Border Police prevented them from meeting in the center of the city. 
Balad faction members Jamal Zahalka and Wasal Taha met Palestinian parliament members Mahmoud Abu Tir, Ahmed Atun and Mohammed Totah to express their solidarity and denounce Israel's decision to deny their residence right and expel them from Jerusalem. 
The meeting was scheduled to take place at the office of Minster for Jerusalem Affairs Khaled Abu Arafe, but after Border Policemen blocked access to the office, they were forced to relocate the meeting to a private house in Al-Azariya. 
According to Balad sources, the security forces also tried to stop the Palestinian minister from leaving the building to join the MKs as they left for the relocated meeting. He was able to leave the site eventually in MK Taha's car. 
The sources said also that Border Policemen stood at the entrance to the building and prevented the three  Palestinian parliament members from entering the building in East Jerusalem. 
Police, however, denied this report and it seems that the Palestinian legislators chose not to arrive after spotting police for fear of confrontations.  
The Arab MKs confronted the Border Policemen verbally. 
Zahalka told Haaretz that the meeting focused on the decision to deprive the three Palestinian MPs' Jerusalem residency. "This is a political decision in violation of international law that violates human rights and mutual agreements that Israel and the Palestinian Authority signed," he said. 
Meanwhile, the chairman of the interim Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, MK Yuval Steinitz is acting to prevent MK Taleb a-Sana (United Arab List) from taking part in the committee's debates, following the meeting of a-Sana and other MKs from his faction with Hamas MPs on Wednesday.  
Steinitz asked the Knesset's temporary speaker, MK Shimon Peres, to set up a temporary ethics committee that would forbid a-Sana from entering the committee's meetings. 
"I'll attend the meetings no matter what Steinitz says, he's behaving like the whites in apartheid South Africa," a-Sana commented.

<title>British academic boycott expires after teaching unions merge</title>
<date>Sun Jun 11 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The recent decision by the largest lecturers' union in Britain to encourage an academic boycott of Israel has expired, as was expected when it was implemented, said the union's general secretary this weekend.
Although the controversial decision was made only May 29, it stopped being valid two weeks ago because the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) has merged with another British union, the Association of University Teachers.
Mackney, general secretary of NATFHE and the merged union, sent a letter Saturday to a British lawyer representing Jewish lecturers against the boycott. The letter confirmed that the boycott decision was no longer valid.
NATFHE's decision encouraged lecturers to boycott Israeli institutions and individuals who do not publicly dissociate themselves from Israeli policies related to the occupation and from discrimination in the field of education.
It had previously been reported that the boycott decision would be valid for only a short time because of the merger. Nonetheless, Israeli anti-boycott groups said Sunday that they saw the move as an achievement of their struggle against the decision.
The International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom, a group that was founded at Bar-Ilan University in response to an earlier academic boycott and was a key player in fighting NATFHE's move, said in a statement Sunday that it was "pleased to announce that [the decision] has been canceled."
Education Minister Yuli Tamir said she "welcomes the cancellation of the British academic boycott thanks to the efforts of all the relevant groups in this matter."
By contrast, MK Rabbi Michael Melchior, the chairman of the Knesset Education Committee, noted that the expiry was a technical matter and "therefore does not indicate anything about a change regarding Israel."
"The celebrations over the revocation of the British academic boycott of Israel are premature and baseless," he said.
Supporters of the boycott said that the Israeli lobby falsely presented the expiration as a cancellation and a victory.
The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, an umbrella organization encompassing dozens of Palestinian nongovernmental organizations, said: "The significance of the academic boycott against Israel adopted by the largest British academic union cannot be viewed in legalistic terms," it said. "Its moral weight should not be underestimated." 
The group added that NATFHE's decision has proven that boycotting Israeli academic institutions because of their cooperation in preserving a special form of anti-Palestinian "apartheid" remains a priority for progressive Western and human rights activists.

<title>British professor confirms 'silent' boycott of Israel </title>
<date>Fri May 19 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
A British professor has refused a request to write an article for an academic journal funded by Israeli universities, saying that he was taking part in a boycott of Israel. 
"Alas, I am unable to accept your kind invitation, for reasons that you may not like. I have, along with many other British academics, signed the academic boycott of Israel, in the face of the brutal and illegal expansionism and the slow-motion ethnic cleansing being practiced by your government," wrote Professor Richard Seaford, from the University of Exeter in England. 
Seaford wrote to Bar-Ilan University's Dr. Daniella Dueck, a member of the Scripta Classica Israelica editorial board who had requested that the British academic write a book review for the journal. 
Seaford, the head of the Department of Classics and Ancient History at Exeter University, told Haaretz that the academic boycott "is just a small contribution to the long-term raising of international consciousness which represents the only hope for an eventual just peace in the Middle East. In this respect, there is a parallel with the academic boycott of apartheid South Africa." 
On May 27-29, the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will debate a proposal in favor of an academic boycott against Israel. 
The International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom (IAB), established at Bar-Ilan University to take action against academic boycotts, published a statement yesterday in which it "warns that a silent boycott by British and Israeli academics is already taking place," and called on an anti-boycott network of some 500 academics around the world to oppose it. 
In March, the London Jewish Chronicle reported that U.K. magazine Dance Europe refused to publish an article on Sally Ann Freeland, an Israeli choreographer, and her dance company. The magazine conditioned the publication of the article on an explicit declaration by Freeland against the occupation, which she refused to make. 
The boycott began in the United States and Europe during the first intifada, and intensified in 2002 after Operation Defensive Shield, during which the IDF occupied West Bank cities. 
The boycott movement began in response to a request by Palestinian organizations, such as The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, an umbrella organization for dozens of Palestinian NGOs. 
An attempt is made almost annually in the U.K. to formally instate an academic boycott on Israel, through official decisions by lecturers' unions. 
The proposal slated to be discussed later this month by NATFHE differs from previous ones. According to the proposal, the current boycott will deal not only with the occupation, but also with discrimination against different populations in Israel, mainly in the field of education. 
The proposal encourages academics to "consider the appropriateness of a boycott of those that do not publicly dissociate themselves" from discriminatory and unequal policies. 
According to the IAB, "Such boycotts have no place in the academic community. Scholarship and research, and their expression in the open and free exchange of ideas, are among the foundations of civilization, and without them there can be no true advancement of human knowledge."

<title>Carter talks with U.S. rabbis about controversial new book </title>
<date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
PHOENIX - Former President Jimmy Carter prayed with rabbis who are angered by his new book's reference to apartheid in describing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but he did not change their minds.  
The Board of Rabbis of Greater Phoenix said they would not call for a boycott of Carter's book, "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid," but they also would not suggest that anyone read it.  
"I don't know if he gets the evil that we are facing," said Rabbi Bonnie Koppell of Scottsdale.  
Carter, 82, was met by a crowd of protesters Tuesday as he appeared at a book store in suburban Tempe to autograph copies of the book.  
He said he chose the title to shine light on the festering conflict and give Americans a different point of view than what they're used to.  
"I wanted to provoke debate," Carter said. "I wanted to provoke discussion."  
Carter's book follows the peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians during his presidency in 1977-1980.   
He is critical of all players in not reaching a better accord, but he is especially critical of the Israelis.   
He previously told The Associated Press that Americans are rarely exposed to anything other than pro-Israeli views in the news media.  
Koppell said Carter's word choice was "gratuitously provocative" and meant to add fuel to an already incendiary subject and sell more books.  
"I don't really see the book as helpful," said Koppell, who has read it.

<title>Cinder blocks and skullcaps</title>
<date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
The stones that were thrown by skullcap-wearing youths from the rooftops of Amona, and the rolling of eyes heavenward (and also at the Israeli public) that followed, injured not only the head of the policeman who was rushed to the hospital in critical condition, but also, to the same extent, the heart of Jedaism, the Torah itself.The police's special patrol unit is the same special patrol unit; the minions, the hilltop youth, are the same minions. Only religious Zionism is not what it once was. From a glorious movement, a symbol and model of Jewish renewal in our times, it has become an extremist movement, irrelevant to the Judaism of the majority of Israeli society. The knitted skullcap has given way to ski masks, and the hoe and the tablets of the Ten Commandments - the symbol of the Bnei Akiva youth movement - to cinder blocks and stones.
It used to be different. From the days of rabbis Isaac Jacob Reines and Judah Leib Maimon to the government ministers Haim-Moshe Shapira and Zerach Wahrhaftig, religious Zionism presented an entirely different face. Its teachers and leaders preached compromise, peace, finding a common denominator. Out of a deeply rooted and burning Torah belief, they clung to the value of sensitivity to the suffering of the "other."
Like tens of thousands of other people, I grew up in the lap of religious Zionism. Because of it, I immigrated to Israel and I educated my children in accordance with its philosophy. In the Bnei Akiva movement they educated us to love of the land, to commitment to and solidarity with the Jewish people, and to adherence to the values of the Torah. This was an equilateral triangle, the power of which was in the combination of all of its elements, and especially the maintenance of the balance among them.In the mid-1970s the process of sliding down the slippery slope began. Fanaticism, extremism and insensitivity to the "other" replaced the old values. The delicate fabric of religious Zionism unraveled. The Jewish people and the Torah were sidelined and their place was taken by the land of Israel. Not the land "of milk and honey" of the prophets" vision, full of justice and equality, but rather a fundamentalist, xenophobic land of Israel. A land of bullying and violence, of injured policemen and uprooted olive trees.
The violent event at Amona hammered another nail into the coffin of religious Zionism and made the Torah a synonym for bullying, extremism and hatred of the "other." In the minds of the settlers there are the rights of humans, and then there are the rights of "our people." The events at Amona have taught us that uncompromising violence and the flying batons of the police know no bounds and do not discriminate between Jew and Arab. All are the same, and smashing the head of an Arab leads easily to smashing the head of a Jew.
Similarly, there is no such thing as halfway democracy. An entire generation of religious Zionism has been raised on the idea that if between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean there are 4.7 million Palestinians, it isn?t terrible if they remain without rights, and if their 6- and 7-year-old children have to be accompanied by Israel Defense Forces soldiers on their way to school for fear of the wrath of masked Jews. Then so be it. They should say thank you and shut up. It is no wonder, then, that when democracy was exalted by the settlers during the period of the disengagement, nobody believed them.
Vox populi vox dei. Between the special patrol battalions and the battalions of the minions this week, the Torah and the philosophy of religious Zionism stood off in a corner, grieving and in disgrace, scorned, mortified and ashamed. In a single day, they had become identified with people in masks hurling rotten eggs at IDF soldiers and large stones, lobbed at the police of the state "of the beginning of our redemption."
No less appalling is the terrible silence of the leaders and teachers. As the years go by, in the name of Torah, fundamentalist voices that our fathers never imagined are being disseminated. Indeed, the wrath of the minions has fallen upon the leaders of the flock, who disappeared, their voices stilled. The redemptive genie has been released from its bottle and has started to destroy everything good in religious Zionism.
As a result of these distortions, most of the people living in Israel are no longer aware of the wonderful, gracious deeds of religious Zionist society here and now, the pioneering spirit that continues to throb within it, its rallying to absorb immigration or the splendid educational institutions it has established.
The difficult scenes at Amona have caused unimaginable damage both to religious Zionism and to the State of Israel. Their effects are influencing the solidarity of Israeli society, the country's image in the eyes of the world and the eyes of world Judaism, and its ability to stand strong in the face of the challenges that still await it.
It is a debate about which direction we are heading, but we must not compromise for a single moment about the methods we use to get there.
For a generation now we have been fighting for the justice of our existence. Facing us are belligerent neighbors who wish to destroy us and fundamentalist states that possess weapons of mass destruction. In this state of affairs Israel must choose another way. One way. Not the way of apartheid, but rather the way of the Jewish and democratic state.
Indeed, this way necessitates painful compromise. Compromise that does not concede the idea of the land of Israel or the idea of redemption. Not disgust, heaven forbid, with respect to the beloved land, but rather the opposite - adherence to it, inside borders dividing us and the Palestinian state, without which we will not be a Jewish state, from a desire to have in it a society that will be a light unto the nations. A society of justice and peace, for every human because he is human.
Rabbi Michael Melchior is an MK representing the Meimad Party in cooperation with the Labor Party.

<title>Davos chair apologizes for magazine's Israel boycott call </title>
<date>Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
DAVOS - The chairman and executive director of the Davos World Economic Forum on Thursday offered a sweeping apology to all delegates for an article calling for the boycott of Israel that appeared in a prestigious magazine issued by the forum. 
Professor Klaus Schwab, who founded the annual Davos conclave 35 years ago, said he was "shocked" to read, just today, the article that appeared in the magazine "Global Agenda." 
Some American Jewish leaders attending the conference said they were not satisfied with the apology. 
"As a publisher," said Mortimer Zuckerman of U.S. News and World Report, "I have to take full responsibility for everything that appears in my publications, whether I read them or not." 
Zukerman, a leading real estate developer, is a former chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. He said he would be meeting with Schwab later Thursday and recommending tougher steps. 
The magazine, "Global Agenda" was prepared for the economic forum by Euromoney PLC, a company that specializes in magazines. Schwab said he would rather forgo having a magazine altogether at next year's conference unless he had "absolute guarantees that this would not happen again."
Among the contributors to the magazine are such world leaders as Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 
Mark Adams, head of press at Davos, explained that the magazine had arrived just a day before the publication deadline and neither he nor Schwab had had the time to browse through it, let alone read the articles in depth. 
The two-page article in question was headlined "boycott Israel." Written by American academic Mazin Qumsiyeh, its message summarized in the subheading was "global civil society ought to boycott Israel until it ends its Apartheid-like treatment of Palestinians." 
As part of its historical review, the article asserted that, "Zionism can be seen as 19th Century style chauvinistic, ethnocentric... nationalistic response to prevalent European chauvinistic, ethnocentric nationalisms. It is in this sense an attempt at assimilation by some Jews following a now-outdated European colonial model."
In the last paragraph he proposes that "global civil society ... build a "Movement Against Zionism" or a global "Movement Against Israeli Apartheid."
In his letter of apology, which Schwab said he would circulate to all delegates at Davos, he wrote: "With great concern and pain I just learned that 'Global Agenda,' a publication distributed to our members at the Annual Meeting 2006, contains an article calling for the boycott of Israel. This article is totally in contradiction to my own, and the Forum's, mission and values. For 36 years I have been committed to fighting for better mutual understanding in the world. The Forum has been deeply involved in efforts to create better relations and reconciliation in the Middle East... 
"As soon as I learned about this article I immediately investigated how this situation could have developed. I concluded that there was an unacceptable failure in the editorial process... an insufficiently short period for review of content, for which there is no excuse. I, on behalf on the Forum, profoundly apologize. I would like express my regret to everybody and can assure everyone that appropriate steps have been instituted to ensure that this situation will never happen again." 
Schwab called in Israeli newsmen to say how "terrible and pained" he felt when the article was brought to his attention. "It happened. I have to take responsibility. I will apologize personally to such good friends and Shimon Peres and Prof Avishai Braverman. 
He said that he would apologize personally when he chaired a session of the full Forum on Friday.

<title>Do boycotts work?</title>
<date>Tue May 30 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Britain's largest association of higher education lecturers this week approved a resolution urging the union's nearly 70,000 members to boycott all Israeli academics and universities unless they actively renounced what the group called Israel's "apartheid policies" in the territories.
The move, which prompted fierce criticism from Education Minister Yuli Tamir, as well as Israeli university leaders and faculty, was the latest in a series of boycotts, divestiture campaigns, and other efforts aimed at pressuring the Israeli government to modify its policies.
To what extent do boycotts and divestiture campaigns influence Israeli governmental policy and actions? Can, and should, the example of apartheid-era South Africa be applied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?

<title>Floating voter / No red carpet for  Dalai Lama</title>
<date>Thu Feb 16 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
The Dalai Lama of Tibet arrived yesterday for his fourth visit in Israel.
Unlike his two previous visits, he will not be meeting Israeli officials this time. The papers reported that Avishay Braverman is the only one with whom he will meet, but Braverman is not a minister, and it is doubtful if he will be.
It was also reported that the government of China was very annoyed. The Chinese are wasting their anger this time: the visit is a private one anyway, and all the ministers are keeping their distance from the exiled leader.
In days gone by, Israel Radio used to air at dawn summaries of the daily newspapers' editorials. I was especially fond of this item, and used to listen with wonder to the ultra-Orthodox Hamodia warning China for its iniquities. I have no doubt a billion Chinese were also impressed, and from time to time felt fear gripping them, for some unknown reason. I knew what it was: Hamodia had issued a warning. Who wouldn't run for his life?
I have no idea if that item is still being broadcast and when, and whether Hamodia is still warning China, or if things have turned around and now China is warning Hamodia. In any case, China has warned Israel this week in no uncertain terms not to roll out the red carpet for the Dalai Lama, because China has a monopoly on red.
And yes, official Israel is panicking - after all, we know how to deal with repressive dictatorships, it's our specialty. How well we cooperated with South Africa in the dark days of Apartheid, Argentina in the days of the brown generals, and China of Tiananmen Square, with all those vital interests, talks, obligations.
We are more afraid of the Chinese than others are. Even the president of the United States has already met the Dalai Lama despite the protests, but none of Israel?s wimpy ministers will meet the man, who is regarded throughout the civilized world as a great fighter against violence and for peace.
I myself received a warning call from the Foreign Ministry when I was environment minister and later education minister − two other realms identified with the Dalai Lama. Those officials, who were afraid of their own shadow, threatened me with a sharp crisis and even the severing of relations with China, which cast a giant shadow.
I reconsidered, and decided to meet him after all. We met twice, talked, and I expanded my horizons.And what do you think happened after a single Israeli minister met the Dalai Lama? Surprise surprise − nothing at all. Some time later the president of China came to Israel, together with his education minister, and the Chinese and Israeli ministers signed an agreement between the two states.
As we well know, our ministers find it easy to be always afraid, even easier to be ashamed. How much harder it is to be just a human being and fix one's gaze on the enlightened side of the world.

<title>Israeli envoy slams Canadian union's move to boycott Israel</title>
<date>Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Israel's ambassador to Canada on Friday condemned a move by the Ontario leg of the country's largest public employee union to join an international campaign protesting Israel's policies toward the Palestinian territories.
National Jewish groups and prominent Jewish politicians have also blasted the move by delegates at the Canadian Union of Public Employees convention, who voted Saturday to support the campaign calling for sanctions and disinvestment from Israel until it recognizes a Palestinian right to self-determination.
The Ontario branch represents nearly half of the 450,000 union members across Canada in health care, education, social services, universities, transportation and other sectors.
Ottawa is a close ally of Israel, yet also a strong proponent of Palestinian statehood. Canada, under Conservative Party Prime Minister Stephen Harper, was the first country after Israel to suspend financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority in March because the new Hamas-led government refuses to renounce violence and recognize Israel.
The campaign to boycott Israel started last year, spearheaded by the Jerusalem-based Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center, and has been supported by a growing number of groups around the world, including many North American churches and 20 Quebec organizations.
Britain's largest college teachers' union voted Monday to consider boycotting Israeli academics over what members termed "apartheid" policies and discrimination against Palestinians.
The movement has outraged Jewish leaders, who say the strategy is anti-Semitic and fails to recognize Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist attacks by Palestinian extremists.
"Many, including members of CUPE, are questioning why CUPE is so unwisely injecting itself, its good name and the goodwill of its members in such a partisan and openly hostile manner into Middle East politics," Israel's Ambassador Alan Baker wrote in an editorial in the National Post on Friday.
Under the resolution approved by delegates, CUPE Ontario said it will develop an education campaign similar to one by the British Columbia CUPE chapter, which since 2000 has promoted a "solidarity campaign" with the Palestinians. The British Columbia chapter has noted that the International Court of Justice ruled in July 2005 that Israel's West Bank barrier was illegal and must be dismantled.
CUPE said in a news release after its Ontario convention that the Israeli "apartheid wall" has been condemned and determined illegal under international law.
The union noted that Canada's free-trade agreement with Israel was the only such pact the country has outside the Western Hemisphere. In Ontario, the provincial liquor control board carries more than 30 Israeli wines, many produced in the Golan Heights, CUPE said.
"Boycott, divestment and sanction worked to end apartheid in South Africa," said Katherine Nastovski, chairwoman of the CUPE Ontario international solidarity committee. "We believe the same strategy will work to enforce the rights of Palestinian people, including the right of refugees to return to their homes and properties."
MK Natan Sharansky (Likud) wrote in an editorial Thursday that he was "shocked and saddened" by the CUPE vote.
"This decision is totally out of sync with Mideast realities, and runs counter to every principle of justice and human rights," Sharansky wrote in The Globe and Mail.
Leaders of B'nai Brith Canada, the Canadian Jewish Congress and the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center also called the vote outrageous, saying Jewish and non-Jewish CUPE members had contacted them to complain they felt betrayed by the vote.
"What we are seeing is a blatant attempt by CUPE to advance a clearly politicized anti-Israel agenda that is inconsistent with the union's core mandate of serving its members," said Frank Dimant, vice president of B'nai Brith Canada.
The Anti-Defamation League harshly condemned the decision, calling it "deplorable and offensive." 
The decision was made by the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), which has 450,000 members. 
The union's decision says that it is joining an international campaign to boycott Israel and to impose sanctions on it, until it fulfills all UN resolutions including the right of return of Palestinian refugees from 1948. The union also intends to support pro-Palestinian organizations in an educational campaign, which will depict Israel as an apartheid state. It called on the national union to join and pass a similar resolution. 
ADL director general Abraham Foxman said "the union's resolution makes no effort to reflect current realities on the ground in the region. There is no mention of Israel's unilateral redeployment from Gaza and proposed action in the West Bank, nor is there any recognition of the challenges posed by ... Hamas' reign over the PA and its refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist or to renounce terror."

<title>Israeli scientists: British boycott may hinder younger researchers</title>
<date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Monday's decision by Britain's largest lecturers union in favor of an academic boycott of Israel has worried some academics here. They said on Tuesday that although it would probably not have an immediate impact on prominent Israeli researchers, it may affect their younger colleagues who have not yet established themselves in their fields.
The union has decided to boycott Israeli academics who do not publicly disassociate themselves from Israel's "apartheid policies."
"We don't know at what pace the practical impact of the decision will be felt," said Zvi Ziegler, a professor at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and chairman of the Israeli Inter-Senate Committee of the Universities, when asked for comment on the decision by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE). "But our fear is that the decision gives legitimacy to people who are debating whether to boycott Israel."
Ziegler stressed that all Israeli scientists are dependent on colleagues from abroad at various stages of their academic careers. 
"No one will prevent Nobel Prize winner Aaron Ciechanover from publishing an article in a scientific journal," he said. "But a young scientist who sends an article to a British journal is liable to encounter editors who hesitate to publish his article and delay its ublication."
The Inter-Senate Committee, which sharply condemned NATFHE's decision on Monday, is currently focusing on "making the academic boycott completely illegitimate because it is an assault on academic freedom, and getting the senior academic establishment in Britain to publish a declaration that academic boycotts are unacceptable," Ziegler said.
The Israel Science Foundation, the largest funder of basic research in Israel, sends out some 10,000 letters a year asking scientists to examine research proposals by Israeli researchers and decide whether they deserve funding. According to Professor Joseph Klafter, the ISF's chairman, about 10 scientists have refused to participate in the review process this year. He said that the foundation first began encountering such refusals following Operation Defensive Shield in March-April 2002. Such refusals typically say something like "I respect my Israeli colleagues, but until Israeli policy changes, I will be compelled to refuse your requests."
A forum comprised of the presidents of all Israeli universities discussed the boycott at its meeting on Tuesday and issued a statement describing NATFHE's decision as "harmful and dangerous." Professor Moshe Kaveh, the forum's chair and president of Bar-Ilan University, said: "The mixing of politics and scientific research is a destructive phenomenon that must be fought aggressively."
Professor Steven Rose, a prominent philosopher of science who serves as secretary of the British Committee for Universities of Palestine, said yesterday: "We recognize that this has not been an easy decision, with the extreme pressure put upon the Union by outside forces, including the Israeli government and the organized Israel lobby ... The vote is an historic step forward, both expressing our solidarity with Palestinian academic colleagues and also in helping persuade Israeli colleagues that it is time to cease silent complicity with the illegal acts of the Israeli state."
Tomorrow, however, NATFHE is due to merge with another lecturers union, which will render the boycott resolution advisory only.

<title>Jimmy Carter: Israel's 'apartheid' policies worse than South Africa's</title>
<date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter said in remarks broadcast Monday that Israeli policy in the West Bank represented instances of apartheid worse even that those that once held sway in South Africa.
Carter's comments were broadcast on Israel Radio, which played a tape of an interview with the ex-president, but did not specify to whom Carter was speaking. But has made similar remarks in recent interviews
"When Israel does occupy this territory deep within the West Bank, and connects the 200-or-so settlements with each other, with a road, and then prohibits the Palestinians from using that road, or in many cases even crossing the road, this perpetrates even worse instances of apartness, or apartheid, than we witnessed even in South Africa."
Carter said his new book
The book has sparked strong criticism from Jewish figures in the United States. Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, has said that some comments from the former president border on anti-Semitism.
"When you think about the charge that he has made that the Jewish people control the means of communication, it is odious," Foxman was quoted as saying last week. "If the Jews controlled the media, how come he is traveling around the country speaking about this book on talk shows?"
Carter has rejected the criticism of the book and its use of the word apartheid.
"I feel completely at ease," said Carter, about his commitment to the book, which accuses Israel of oppressing Palestinians. "I am not running for office. And I have Secret Service protection."
"The greatest commitment in my life has been trying to bring peace to Israel," Carter told the Atlanta Press Club last week. 
"Israel will never have peace until they agree to withdraw [from the territories]."

<title>Largest labor union in Ontario unanimously votes to boycott Israel</title>
<date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The largest labor union in the Canadian province of Ontario has voted unanimously to boycott Israel "until it recognizes the Palestinians' right of self-determination" and accepts all United Nations resolutions relating to Palestinians, including the right of return.
The Anti-Defamation League has harshly condemned the decision, calling it "deplorable and offensive." 
The decision was made by the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), which has 450,000 members. 
The union's decision says that it is joining an international campaign to boycott Israel and to impose sanctions on it, until it fulfills all UN resolutions including Resolution 194, which recognizes the right of return of Palestinian refugees from 1948. In addition, the union intends to support pro-Palestinian organizations in an educational campaign, which will depict Israel as an apartheid state.  
It called on the national union to join it and to pass a similar resolution.  
ADL Director General Abraham Foxman said that "the union's resolution makes no effort to reflect current realities on the ground in the region. There is no mention of Israel's unilateral redeployment from Gaza and proposed action in the West Bank, nor is there any recognition of the challenges posed by the terrorist group Hamas' reign over the Palestinian Authority and its refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist or to renounce terror." 
The vote by the Ontario labor union to boycott Israel came hot on the heels of a similar decision by British lecturers' made earlier in the week.
The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, the largest union of university teachers in Britain adopted this week a resolution encouraging an academic boycott of Israel. 
The decision by NATFHE, which has 69,000 members, enjoins members to consider boycotting Israeli academics and academic institutions that do not publicly take an explicit stand against the "apartheid policies" and discriminatory policy in the field of education. 
The resolution, passed at NATFHE's annual conference, aroused controversy, and at the end of the debate 53 percent of conference delegates supported it, while 38 percent voted against and the rest abstained. The resolution passed despite an aggressive and extensive campaign waged by Israeli organizations and Jewish groups in Britain and the United States. 
Members of the International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom, a body formed at Bar-Ilan University last year in the wake of an attempt to impose an academic boycott on Israel, said that "they will try to attack the resolution through legal channels." Last year, when a smaller British union, the Association of University Teachers (AUT), passed a resolution calling for an academic boycott of Israel, it was canceled a month later by means of a procedural clause in the AUT regulations that was found by a British-Jewish academic. 
Education Minister Yuli Tamir said that she will try to invite a group of senior academics from Britain to come to Israel "and prove that the boycott is on the fringes, and the mainstream actually views Israel as a partner."

Larry Garber is the CEO/Executive Director of the New Israel Fund (NIF)
Garber served as a senior policymaker with United States Agency for International Development (USAID) from 1993-99 and as Director of USAID's West Bank and Gaza Mission from 1999-2004 (full bio here
We will mostly discuss issues related to civil rights, the gaps between haves/have nots in Israel, and the Israel-Diaspora relationships pertaining to these topics. Readers are welcomed to send questions to rosnersdomain@haaretz.co.il
Dear Larry
I'll ask the last question for this week and dialog, and as most readers wanted to ask mainly about your involvement with Arab Israelis, I want to go back to the more general question of prioritizing the different competing causes that the NIF work for. How do you make the decision of what's more important, and more specifically, what do you think are the most 3-4 urgent issues on which you'd like NIF to have an impact in the coming years. 
Thank you for your time and cooperation.
Best
Rosner
Shmuel,
I appreciate your asking this more general question.  Too many people assume that the New Israel Fund works only in the Arab sector.  While we are proud of our efforts to combat discrimination against the Arab minority, NIF work in the Arab sector constitutes only 30 percent of our total program resources.  The remaining 70 percent of NIF programs address problems faced by other marginalized groups (e.g., new immigrants, the disabled, gays and lesbians, etc.) and, more generally, Israeli society (e.g., environmental degradation and non-recognition of Conservative and Reform movements) 
Five years ago, we undertook a comprehensive strategic planning process and identified the following major problems facing Israeli society: the widening gaps between rich and poor; and the lack of civic equality towards minority groups and towards those whose practices differed from religious orthodoxy.  These problems remain and pose subtle but real challenges to Israel?s security and democratic character.  For example, we read with surprise and concern that Israel, among developed countries, now has the largest gap between rich and poor and the highest percentage of children who live in households that are classified as falling below the poverty level, as defined by Israel?s National Insurance Institute.  This must change.
We maintain the areas of focus identified five years ago ? civil rights, social justice and religious pluralism ? even as we adapt our programs in response to specific developments.   Thus, last year we undertook a special campaign to ensure that the disengagement process was implemented in a manner that did not undermine Israel?s core democratic values.  And, we responded to this summer?s war with initiatives that addressed the psycho-social traumas inflicted upon segments of the population that were unable to leave their homes in the North and the economic hardships suffered by micro entrepreneurs, particularly women.  We also are now implementing new programs dealing with the problems of youth-at-risk in the Russian and Ethiopian communities and the mentally disabled.    
We are also concerned with the Israel-Diaspora relationship.  We track polls that show a growing disaffection with Israel among young Jews.  And, the vibrancy of the contemporary Jewish Diaspora experience is rarely appreciated by most Israelis.  We believe that the type of Israel-Diaspora partnership that NIF represents, and the type of civil rights and social justice issues that we address in Israel, provide opportunities to engage young Israeli and Diaspora Jews, who are determined to change the world or, in our language, to engage in Tikkun Olam.   
Let me close this dialogue with a personal note.  At the end of the day, I believe that Israel will prosper over the long-term only if a peaceful resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is attained.  And, having worked for five years with Palestinians, I am convinced that a majority of the Palestinians have reached a similar conclusion regarding what they need to achieve their aspirations.  However, unlike many of my friends, I do not believe that the starting point for achieving such a resolution is a new American diplomatic initiative, or even a dramatic change in policy by Israeli or Palestinian leaders.  Rather, attitudinal changes are required within both societies.  These changes will not come about merely through dialogues between Palestinians and Israelis, however worthy such efforts may be.  Instead, within each society a culture of tolerance and respect toward fellow citizens must be established, and an appreciation of what is required to sustain a democratic and prosperous society must be internalized.  These objectives motivated my work with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, and they do likewise for my current efforts with the New Israel Fund.
Shabbat Shalom and Happy last day of Hanukkah!
Larry
Dear Larry, 
You imply in your response to the previous reader that Israel's treatment of its Arab citizens is not equal. If that's the case, why do people jump all over the fact that former president Jimmy Carter called Israel an apartheid state? 
Nora Hassan,OH
Dear Nora,
I have not yet read Carter's latest book, so I will not comment on the content, or involve myself in the debate regarding Carter's motives, analysis or recommendations.  However, although Carter is apparently careful not to describe Israel as an apartheid state, his use of such a loaded term in the title, even if the reference is only to Israel's policies in the West Bank and Gaza, inevitably serves to provoke, rather than enlighten.  
Lest we forget, apartheid was a pernicious system of state-sponsored physical separation and constitutionally prescribed discrimination based on an overtly racist ideology. Israel, with a problematic history of unequal treatment toward its Arab citizens, is in no way comparable to the apartheid regime in South Africa. 
When I speak of Israel's unequal treatment towards its Arab citizens, my reference point is the contemporary U.S. experience with race. While the post-civil war amendments to the US constitution, theoretically, eliminated legal forms of racial discrimination, the reality was that, in much of the country, blacks could not purchase property in certain neighborhoods, send their children to quality schools, and participate in the political process. 
However, during the past 50 years, through a combination of political activism, civil rights legislation and precedent-setting court decisions, the situation has improved dramatically, although we are not free, nor may we ever be, of the legacy of our problematic history. 
The realities in Israel are also changing. In 1999, the Israeli High Court voided a practice that prevented an Israeli Arab couple from purchasing a home in the town of Katzir. And several months ago, the High Court voided a government policy that identified towns and villages as national preference zones because the policy was being implemented in a manner that discriminated against Israel's Arab minority.  
There are limits, however, to what can be accomplished through a litigation strategy. As is true today in the United States, the legacy of discrimination in Israel contributes to the lack of economic opportunities available to Israel's Arab citizens and to the poor physical and social infrastructures that affect their quality of life.  
We hope this will change. With the money that has been committed by the government and other resources that have been raised abroad, the government has a unique opportunity to address the wide economic and social gaps that exist between Jews and Arabs, and also among different segments of Israel's Jewish community.  
To monitor government commitments and to advocate for just reconstruction of the North during the post-war period SHATIL, NIF's technical assistance arm, has formed the North Star Forum, which comprises a conglomerate of diverse social change organizations. Already, the North Star Forum has convened a series of public hearings and organized demonstrations to ensure that the government's actions correspond with its rhetoric. 
Larry
Dear Mr. Garber,
I think the NIF got all mixed up. You think that by helping the Arabs (Arab Israelis and Arab Palestinians) you're helping the Jews. But it is not so. If you want to help the Jewish people - and the Jewish State - you should help, well, Jews, not Arabs. And so as to have a question at the end of my remarks let me ask this: Why do you invest so much of your money and effort in helping Arabs? Let the 22 Arab States contribute money for them. 
Thank you,Michael J. Nissenbaum
Dear Michael,
As I stated in a previous posting, NIF is committed to supporting Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.  Both Jewish tradition and democratic practice require that Israel treat all citizens in a non-discriminatory and just fashion. Unfortunately, as described in detail in the Orr Commission report, which was prepared following the events of October 2000 when 12 Israeli Arabs were killed by the police, Israeli governments have too often failed to respect these norms as they apply to the Arab minority. The result is that Israel?s Arab citizens, taken as a whole, rank at the bottom of virtually all socio-economic indicators and feel alienated from the state. 
In these circumstances, NIF is quite proud of the fact that for 27 years we have been a leader in funding organizations that advocate for equal treatment for all Israeli citizens, including the Arab minority. And, we are proud that some progress has been made, most notably as a result of a series of decisions by Israel?s High Court during the past decade that have proscribed the most egregious discriminatory practices affecting the Arab minority. Still, there is much work that needs to be done.
While I am comfortable relying on a values based argument, I am also are convinced that Israeli security requires the fair treatment of all citizens. Looking around the world, we see too many instances where the discriminatory treatment of an ethnic, religious or national minority leads to the minority?s rejection of the state's authority and the bloody consequences of an internal conflict. Certainly, the more effective and less costly approach is to address legitimate grievances forthrightly by changing laws, practices and attitudes.
NIF's promotion of equal rights for all Israelis was once viewed as a fringe position within the Diaspora Jewish community, but fortunately opinions are changing. The current head of the Jewish Agency, Zeev Bielski, has stated explicitly that his mandate covers the well-being of all Israeli citizens, Jews and Arabs. His view has now received the endorsement of the United Jewish Communities. And, an Inter-Agency Task Force on Israeli Arabs has now been operating for two years with a steering committee that includes the Anti-Defamation League, the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, the American Joint Distribution Committee, and the New Israel Fund.
Lastly, I would ask what those who critique my position want Israel to do. Establish two sets of laws governing the Jewish and Arab population, and overtly discriminate against the latter? Prevent the Arab population from taking advantage of living in a democracy by denying them the right to organize or to express themselves freely? I doubt such an approach would be tolerated by a majority of the Israeli population, and even Israel's friends in the international community would have a hard time defending such policies. 
Larry
Dear Larry,
My second question will be fairly abstract, but it is very important. I want you to try and draw for the readers the boundaries of Jewish-American intervention in Israel's affairs. And what do I mean: You (and the organization you work for) have many goals, some fairly consensual, some more controversial. However, your funding of social-justice activities in Israel can't be merely described as "social work," but rather as an ideological quest to change the nature of Israel. You try to promote certain Israeli policies and legislation; you recently called on the Prime Minister to reject a party or a person (namely, Avigdor Lieberman) from his cabinet. And other possible examples are endless. 
What is it that gives the New Israel Fund the right to meddle in internal Israeli affairs? Is it the fact that you have some Israelis as partners? Is it the money allocations? Is it the stake that every Jew has in Israel? And what will you consider an issue on which NIF can't take a position that's contrary to Israel's official policy? 
Best,Rosner
Shmuel,
Your question is abstract in the context of talking about American-Jewish organizations, in general.  As I constantly discover, there are many types of Jewish organizations and they would offer a range of answers to your question.  So, let me speak only as the Executive Director of the New Israel Fund.  
NIF was formed in 1979 as a partnership between Israelis and Diaspora Jews.  We have a single Board and a unified management structure.  Our program staff are all Israeli citizens; they live in Israel and they work directly with Israeli counterparts. Our grants committee, which determines the organizations that receive NIF support, is overwhelmingly Israeli.  Likewise, our SHATIL committee, which is responsible for supervising our technical assistance arm and implementing targeted projects.  Thus, when we take a position on a specific policy issue, we do so from the perspective of being part of the Israeli polity, and not as an external actor.  
More generally, NIF draws inspiration from both the prophetic tradition in Judaism and the Israeli Declaration of Independence.  When we seek to promote social change in Israel, these sources provide the intellectual basis for the policies and organizations that we support. At the same time, the Diaspora experience also may influence our substantive discourse and the approaches we use for achieving our social change objectives.
As an organization, NIF is firmly committed to Israel?s right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state. Our specific emphasis, for the past several years, has been on promoting civil rights and non-discrimination, social justice, and religious pluralism and tolerance for all Israelis. These objectives reflect our collective ? Diaspora Jew and Israeli ? understanding of both what is required to create a just and secure Israel.  
The Avigdor Lieberman case provides an excellent example of how our processes work.  When Prime Minister Olmert announced his intention to invite Lieberman into the government, we joined with a broad coalition of Israeli nongovernmental organizations to protest the decision and published an ad in the media explaining our concerns.  Ten days later, NIF President Peter Edelman and I published an op-ed in Newsday further articulating why including someone with Lieberman?s public views about Israel?s Arab citizens in the government coalition is so antithetical to Israel?s democratic values. 
We believe that, in a democratic society, the government should not be immune from criticism on any issue, even those that require a balancing of security considerations with human rights and other difficult issues.  Thus, we are thankful that Israel has competitive political parties, vibrant media outlets, active civil society organizations and a very independent judiciary.   In this democratic environment, NIF?s role is to support, consistent with our commitment to Israel?s special character and our agreed upon specific objectives, those nongovernmental organizations who seek to influence government policy, litigate before the high court or educate the Israeli public regarding particular matters. 
Larry
Dear Larry,
We will be discussing other issues this week, but I will start with the topic that now tops of the agenda around the world. As former director of USAID's West Bank and Gaza Mission (1999-2004), there aren't many Americans who can claim greater knowledge of Palestinian society than you. Does this help you to make an assessment of the recent moves by Abbas and Hamas? Are we on the way to the dreaded civil war? 
Best, Rosner
Shmuel,
Happy Hanukkah!
As you can imagine, I have been watching the situation in the West Bank and Gaza deteriorate with considerable consternation.  
Having spent five years as the Director of the USAID's West Bank and Gaza mission, I have many friends and former colleagues living in the Palestinian Territories. Their description of security and humanitarian conditions are depressing, and their expectations of a better future are growing increasingly faint.  
Tensions between Hamas and Fatah, at the political level and between their respective security forces, are real and escalating. Consequently, the likelihood of a civil war is a contingency that deserves attention by policymakers in Ramallah, Jerusalem and Washington.
I am always cautious, however, in predicting the immediate on-set of civil war. Several times during my tenure as USAID Director, and certainly in the year following Hamas' parliamentary electoral victory, the prospects of a civil war among Palestinians seemed imminent. Indeed, many in the international community and in Israel view such an outcome as a potentially positive development. 
The argument is that the Palestinians need an "Altalena" like event, whereby a single authority is recognized, and all independent militias dismantled by force or suasion.  Certainly, present circumstances are more dismal than ever before. 
The political rift between Fatah and Hamas is exacerbated by the fact that the various Palestinian security forces, many of which are dominated by Fatah loyalists, have not been paid their full salaries for months.  
At the same time, Hamas has been developing a security force to complement their existing militia. So far, we have only seen minor skirmishes, but the firepower is readily available for a much more sustained and bloody internal conflict.  
That said, I do not think a civil war is inevitable nor do I think a civil war would necessarily serve Israeli or U.S. interests.  Palestinians are accustomed to moving toward the brink of civil war, and then pulling back at the last moment. I suspect this may happen again. 
President Abbas' announcement on Saturday that he will seek early presidential and parliamentary elections may be a ploy to force Hamas to bargain more seriously about the formation of a National Unity government, which would obtain international legitimacy and facilitate the flow of aid from the international community and the withheld tax revenues from Israel.  
At the end of the day, Palestinian society, like Israeli society, is subject to many domestic political pressures and constraints. The party that instigates a civil war would lose significant public backing. And the reality of a Palestinian civil war is that Israel would be drawn more directly into the firing line and the restraints that have minimized the impact of what is happening in the West Bank and Gaza on the daily lives of most Israelis (i.e., excluding those in Sderot and the nearby kibbutzim) would be lifted.  
My last comment is that those who care about Israeli security should not look callously at the on-going suffering in the Palestinian Territories. Through my years as Mission Director, I became convinced that only when Palestinians (and Israelis) see positive improvements in their daily lives would the ground be fertile for the far-reaching concessions necessary for a permanent peace. We are continuing in the wrong direction; the further we slip into the abyss the harder it will be to reverse course.

<title>Major U.K. teachers union votes for academic boycott of Israel</title>
<date>Tue May 30 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The largest union of university teachers in Britain yesterday adopted a resolution encouraging an academic boycott of Israel. The decision by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE), which has 69,000 members, enjoins members to consider boycotting Israeli academics and academic institutions that do not publicly take an explicit stand against the "apartheid policies" and discriminatory policy in the field of education. 
The Guardian reported that the resolution, passed at NATFHE's annual conference, aroused controversy, and at the end of the debate 53 percent of conference delegates supported it, while 38 percent voted against and the rest abstained. The resolution passed despite an aggressive and extensive campaign waged by Israeli organizations and Jewish groups in Britain and the United States. 
Members of the International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom, a body formed at Bar-Ilan University last year in the wake of an attempt to impose an academic boycott on Israel, said that "they will try to attack the resolution through legal channels." Last year, when a smaller British union, the Association of University Teachers (AUT), passed a resolution calling for an academic boycott of Israel, it was canceled a month later by means of a procedural clause in the AUT regulations that was found by a British-Jewish academic. 
Education Minister Yuli Tamir said yesterday that she will try to invite a group of senior academics from Britain to come to Israel "and prove that the boycott is on the fringes, and the mainstream actually views Israel as a partner." 
On Monday, NATFHE secretary general Paul Mackney surprised the delegates with a speech against the motion. Secretaries general are not supposed to express their personal opinion, but are expected to support and work in accordance with any resolution passed by the union. Mackney was accused of "trying to undermine" the resolution. 
"Most of us are very angry about the occupation of Palestine. But this isn't the motion and it isn't the way," Mackney said. 
He also said that in order to adopt an academic boycott, a much more comprehensive debate on the issue must be carried out. "We need to develop a coherent and sustainable policy," Mackney said. 
He proposed that in place of the boycott motion, the union pass a resolution reaffirming solidarity with the Palestinians. 
'Reactionary and undemocratic'
Tom Hickey, a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Brighton and the sponsor of the boycott motion, argued at the conference that, "The majority of Israeli academics are either complicit or acquiescent in the Israeli policies in the occupied territories." 
According to Hickey, Israeli universities are places of freedom, but not for those excluded. "Where is the response from academic scholars to the horrors of life in the refugee camps? Where are the words of condemnation?" he asked. 
Ronnie Fraser, chair of Academic Friends for Israel, termed the resolution "reactionary and undemocratic," and warned that its passage "only brings dishonor and sheer ridicule upon our union." 
The motion ultimately passed by a delegate vote of 106 to 71. 
The NATFHE and AUT are slated to merge in early June. According to NATFHE, yesterday's resolution will last as official union policy only until the merger, after which it will be in the category of an advisory to the new union, which might adopt it or adopt a new policy. 
According to Prof. Hagit Messer-Yaron, vice president for research and development at Tel Aviv University, it is unlikely a scientist who has maintained ties with an Israeli scientist until now will sever these ties following the resolution passed yesterday. "However," she added, "whoever was inclined toward a boycott even before the resolution, has now received support." 
Prof. Yosef Yeshurun, rector of Bar-Ilan University and chair of the International Committee for Academic Freedom, ventured that "the decision will not have an impact on Israeli science in the near future. But you also have to take into account the long-term implications." 
According to Yeshurun, additional academic organizations in Europe might pass similar motions, and noted that such resolutions stand to hurt mainly young scientists who have not yet solidified a network of personal ties. 
Mackney said there were British academics boycotting Israel even before the "official boycott" was adopted. He added that he knows colleagues, who as a direct result of the debate provoked by the draft resolution "ask their colleagues in Israel about their attitude toward what's going on in the occupied territories." 
The efforts in Britain to impose an official academic boycott on Israel have received backing from dozens of Palestinian civilian organizations. The umbrella group Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel praised NATFHE for "leading the way in moral responsibility." 
According to the group, "The persistence of academic boycott efforts proves that many academics in the U.K. and beyond do not buy the disingenuous claim that boycott of Israeli academic institutions conflicts with 'academic freedom' or 'inadvertently promotes anti-Semitism.'" 
The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister, Lord Triesman, issued a statement yesterday saying: "We regret today's decision by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education to vote in favor of boycotting Israeli academics and institutions. The British Government has a record of supporting academic freedom for academics throughout the world. We also recognize the independence of NATFHE. We believe that such academic boycotts are counterproductive and retrograde. Far more can be obtained through dialogue and academic cooperation."

<title>Ministers, professors slam U.K. boycott of Israeli academe</title>
<date>Mon May 29 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Israeli leaders and academics Monday slammed a vote by the largest university and college lecturers' union in Britain in favor of a motion recommending that its members boycott Israeli academics and institutions that do not publicly declare their opposition to Israeli policy in the territories. 
The motion passed with 106 in favor and 71 against. There were 21 abstentions.
The 69,000-member National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) debated the proposal for the boycott at its annual conference in the northern English city of Blackpool. Two parts of the motion passed with a show of hands while a third went to a vote. Under the boycott, union members also will not submit articles to Israeli research journals. 
Education Minister Yuli Tamir lashed out at the boycott on Monday, calling it detrimental to the world of academia.
"The decision to boycott academic institutions is a move worthy of condemnation and revulsion," Tamir said. "Those how are implementing this boycott are harming academia's freedom and turning it into a tool for political forces." 
Last week, Tamir spoke with the British minister for higher education and requested that he act to prevent the boycott.
National Religious Party MK Zevulun Orlev, chairman of the Knesset Science Committee, appealed Monday to parliament members from Germany, Canada, Britain and France to condemn the teachers' union decision.
"This is a test of the free world," Orlev wrote to them. "We expect you to condemn this anti-Semitic and racist decision and to help institutions of higher education in your countries tighten their cooperation with science, technology and higher education institutes in Israel."
Haifa University also condemned the boycott.
"Any attempt to create ties between politics and academic research is simply McCarthyism. Haifa University rejects the decision by the British teachers' union to place a boycott on members of Israeli academia," university president Aharon Ben-Ze'ev said. 
"This is a hypocritical and callous decision that has no place in the academic world. Haifa University calls on all those who hold dear academic freedom to join us in fighting this decision and act to bring about its cancellation. The university will continue to cooperate with its colleagues and friends in Israel, Britain and around the world in an effort to defend the principle of academic freedom and to fight the intention to boycott members of Israeli academia."
The British government expressed its regret at NATFHE's decision, calling it counterproductive. 
Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister Lord Triesman issued a statement saying: "We regret today's decision by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) to vote in favor of boycotting Israeli academics and institutions. 
"The British Government has a record of supporting academic freedom for academics throughout the world. We also recognize the independence of NATFHE. We believe that such academic boycotts are counterproductive and retrograde. Far more can be obtained through dialogue and academic cooperation."
Triesman himself served as deputy general secretary of NATFHE in 1984 and was general secretary of the Association of University Teachers trade union from 1993 to 2001.
Israeli and Jewish organizations in the U.S. and U.K. ran campaigns against the boycott, including a series of petitions against the motion.
On Saturday, the Guardian published a letter
The NATFHE president, John Wilkin, also received a petition with 4,725 signatures from Scholars for Peace in the Middle East, an American organization whose mission statement includes encouraging academics "to develop effective responses to the ideological distortions, including anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist slanders..." 
On Monday, NATFHE Secretary General Paul Mackney surprised the union with a speech against the motion, prior to the vote.
"Most of us are very angry about the occupation of Palestine. But this isn't the motion and it isn't the way," Mackney said. 
He also said that in order to adopt a decision to boycott Israeli academia a much more comprehensive debate on the issue must be carried out.
"We need to develop a coherent and sustainable policy," Mackney said. 
The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel said, "The NATFHE vote proves once again that despite all the obstacles, boycotting Israeli academic institutions due to their complicity in maintaining Israel's special form of apartheid against the Palestinians remains prominent on the agenda of western progressives and human rights activists."
"This is a significant accomplishment considering the campaign of intimidation and bullying waged against proponents of the NATFHE academic boycott initiative by Israeli networks and powerful Zionist lobbies in the United Kingdom and the United States," the statement read.
"At this stage of the international boycott movement, Palestinian boycott advocates", they said, aim first to keep alive an open debate on the need for boycott and sanctions against Israel "until it fully complies with international law and universal human rights."

<title>New U.K. attempt to boycott Israeli universities, professors</title>
<date>Tue May 09 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The largest university and college lecturers union in Britain is likely to decide shortly to recommend that its 67,000 members boycott Israeli lecturers and academic institutions that do not publicly declare their opposition to Israeli policy in the territories. 
The boycott motion, which was drafted by the southeast region of the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE), will be brought to a vote at its annual national conference, which will be held May 27-29. It comes about a year after the last boycott by British lecturers. 
In April 2005, the British Association of University Teachers (AUT) decided to impose an academic boycott on Bar-Ilan and Haifa universities, but subsequently reversed the decision. The two lecturers organizations are slated to merge at the beginning of June. 
Unlike the previous boycott, which targeted two specific institutions, the current motion relates to all lecturers and academic institutions in Israel. Now that the University of Haifa has threatened the AUT with a lawsuit, the NATFHE motion is more cautious: instead of recommending the lecturers union boycott Israeli institutions, it calls on the union to suggest its members carry out the boycott. 
"The conference invites members to consider their own responsibility for ensuring equity and non-discrimination in contacts with Israeli educational institutions or individuals, and to consider the appropriateness of the boycott of those that do not publicly dissociate themselves from such policies," the NATFHE motion states. It also encourages lecturers to hold meetings on the issue on campus. 
'Apartheid policies'
The motion explicitly says NATFHE will recognize Israeli policies, while at the same time denigrating them as "apartheid policies, including construction of the exclusion wall and discriminatory educational practices." 
Ronnie Fraser, a NATFHE member who heads an organization called Academic Friends of Israel, said he didn't think any decisions made at the annual conference would have an immediate effect on the policies of the merged lecturers association, but his group called on NATFHE not to discuss the boycott altogether. 
"Academic work should not be blocked on political grounds," wrote Fraser in the name of the organization. Discrimination "on the grounds of nationality is pernicious," he said, calling academic discourse "crucial in keeping channels open to build opportunities for peace." 
In addition to the boycott motion, the annual conference will also discuss a motion condemning the "outrageous bias" of the British government in opposing Hamas' victory in the Palestinian elections and stating that NATFHE will "continue to help protect and support Palestinian colleges and universities in the face of the continual attack by Israel's government." 
In the past decade, the only country whose academia NATFHE has considered boycotting is Israel. 
Zvi Ziegler, a professor at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa who heads the Israeli Inter-Senate Committee of the Universities for the Protection of Academic Independence, said that if passed, the motion would provide justification for individuals to boycott Israeli academic institutions. 
"The decision may not be binding, but it will be the union's recommendation to all its members," said Ziegler. "It provides legitimacy for people who want to boycott Israel." 
Having learned their lesson last year, Israeli lecturers have already begun organizing meetings and conferences to speak out against academic boycotts. 
The Inter-Senate Committee, which was established in 2001 with the original purpose of preventing a change in the structure of Israeli universities, had all Israeli universities pass resolutions condemning academic boycotts and calling on academic organizations abroad - including in Britain - to pass similar resolutions. 
"We want to bring about a situation in which leading organizations say academic boycotts are improper," said Ziegler. "When they are faced with a leading academic body, organizations will hesitate to make a decision like this again."

<title>Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu to head UN mission to Beit Hanun</title>
<date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu has been named to head a United Nations fact-finding mission to the Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanun, where at least 18 civilians were killed earlier this month, UN officials said Wednesday.
The South African anti-Apartheid campaigner and former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town will travel to the Palestinian territory to "assess the situation of victims, address the needs of survivors and make recommendations on ways and means to protect Palestinian civilians against further Israeli assaults," according to the president of the UN Human Rights Council, Luis Alfonso De Alba.
Tutu chaired South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission after the end of white rule. 
Meanwhile, Anti-Defamation League National Director Abraham Foxman has condemned as an "overwhelming failure" efforts to reform and replace the UN Commission on Human Rights -  an organization widely criticized for concentrating its efforts on condemnations of Israel - calling its replacement a political tool of its Arab and Muslim majority.
The ADL said the new UN Human Rights Council has "ignored the world's worst human rights atrocities and instead has pursued Israel for political gain."
The 47-member council, which earlier this year replaced the discredited Human Rights Commission, has been severely criticized by some countries, including the United States, for moving four times to condemn Israel but not taking up human rights violations in Myanmar, North Korea or Sudan.
The Council has come under similar criticism from outgoing Secretary-General Kofi Annan. 
"From the day it opened for business, the UN Human Rights Council has never operated with any moral authority," Foxman said in a statement released on Tuesday. 
"The Council has failed in its most fundamental purpose: to monitor human rights abuses in all parts of the world. Instead, it has become a political tool wielded by its Arab and Muslim members who have the power of an automatic majority. The Council has ignored the world's worst human rights atrocities and instead has pursued Israel for political gain."
Earlier this month, the Council condemned an IDF artillery attack that killed 20 civilians in the northern Gaza Strip and ordered an on-site investigation by UN Human Rights Commissioner Louise Arbour.
The organization made no reference to Palestinian Qassam attacks. But when Arbour visited the area last week, she and her party were nearly hit by a Qassam that slammed into the Negev town of Sderot, in a salvo that killed a local factory worker.
"Closing in on six months since its first meeting, the Council has held one regular session and three special sessions and has yet to address a single state besides Israel," the ADL said in the statement. "The Council passed two resolutions yesterday condemning Israel while ignoring other more pressing problems around the world."
Annan chides Council 'preocupation with Israel'    Earlier this month, Annan declared that the Human Rights Council should broaden its focus beyond the Palestinian-Israeli issue to avoid accusations it is one-sided.
Speaking to reporters in Geneva for the last time before he is to step down as secretary-general at the end of the year, Annan said the council's preoccupation with Israel's actions in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories while ignoring the situation in Darfur had caused some to wonder whether it had "a sense of fair play."
"They [the council members] have tended to focus on the Palestinian issue, and of course if you focus on the Palestinian-Israeli issue without even discussing Darfur and other issues, some wonder 'what is this council doing?"' he said.
Annan's remarks coincided with the release of a council inquiry into Israel's actions during the monthlong conflict this summer, which accused Israel of "a significant pattern of excessive, indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force... against Lebanese civilians."
The inquiry, which was instigated by members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, was not mandated to look at the conduct of the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah during the fighting.

<title>Ontario union to boycott Israel</title>
<date>Thu Jun 01 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
The largest labor union in the Canadian province of Ontario has voted unanimously to boycott Israel "until it recognizes the Palestinians' right of self-determination" and accepts all UN resolutions including the right of return. The Anti-Defamation League harshly condemned the decision, calling it "deplorable and offensive." 
The decision was made by the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), which has 450,000 members. 
The union's decision says that it is joining an international campaign to boycott Israel and to impose sanctions on it, until it fulfills all UN resolutions including the right of return of Palestinian refugees from 1948. The union also intends to support pro-Palestinian organizations in an educational campaign, which will depict Israel as an apartheid state. It called on the national union to join and pass a similar resolution. 
ADL director general Abraham Foxman said "the union's resolution makes no effort to reflect current realities on the ground in the region. There is no mention of Israel's unilateral redeployment from Gaza and proposed action in the West Bank, nor is there any recognition of the challenges posed by ... Hamas' reign over the PA and its refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist or to renounce terror."

<title>Palestinians banned from Israeli cars near Green Line </title>
<date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
The ban on allowing Palestinians to ride in Israeli cars in the West Bank will mainly be enforced near the border with Israel, and not throughout the West Bank, a senior Israel Defense Forces officer told Haaretz.  
The officer said that he himself gives rides to Palestinians, and that he personally would not bother enforcing the rule as long as it is clear that the ride was "ordinary" and that the destination was not inside Israel.  
The officer acknowledged that the ban, instituted by GOC Central Command Yair Naveh, does not "sound good," but insisted that it was meant primarily to prevent illegal Palestinian entrants from being smuggled into Israel in Israeli cars, whose occupants are usually checked less carefully.   
The order was issued, he said, to foil a trick that Israelis who smuggle Palestinians into Israel have discovered in order to evade the prohibition on doing so: Because many checkpoints are not built exactly on the Green Line (which separates Israel from the West Bank), these Israelis could take their Palestinian passengers through the checkpoints and then let them off a few hundred meters later - still in Palestinian territory, but with easy access to Israel - without breaking any laws.  
However, the Yesh Din organization has asked Defense Minister Amir Peretz to overturn the rule, arguing that it, like several other orders approved by Naveh, creates a legal mechanism of separation on the basis of national origin in the West Bank. As a result, they said, it is clearly illegal, and "constitutes an international crime, the crime of apartheid."  
A statement abut the new policy issued by the IDF Spokesman's Office last week said it was intended to fight terror rather than merely reduce the number of illegal entrants.   
The senior officer explained that the order was clearly aimed at this as well, but that the number of illegal entrants seeking work is much greater than the number of terrorists.

<title>Palestinian university president comes out against boycott of Israeli academics</title>
<date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Israeli academics threatened by boycotts have received support from an unlikely source: the Palestinian president of Al-Quds University.
"If we are to look at Israeli society, it is within the academic community that we've had the most progressive pro-peace views and views that have come out in favor of seeing us as equals," Sari Nusseibeh told The Associated Press. "If you want to punish any sector, this is the last one to approach." 
Nusseibeh acknowledged, however, that his is a minority viewpoint among his colleagues. 
Britain's main academic association recently called on its members to consider boycotting Israeli professors, and a top Canadian labor union voted in favor of divestment from Israel. 
The 69,000-member National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education in Britain, censuring Israel for "apartheid" policies. 
"It just reminds people that somehow Israel is always singled out, that we're the case study," David Newman, a professor of politics and government at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Be'er Sheva, said.
Israel has been targeted by numerous boycotts throughout its history, ranging from weapons embargoes to product blacklisting to the blocking of Israeli web sites. 
But the latest resolution by the British association, encouraging a boycott of Israeli academics, touched a raw nerve in the Jewish state. 
"I wonder why not China, why not Chile, why not Burma, where the human rights issue is far, far worse than here," Newman said.

<title>Petition against British academic boycott garners 16,000 signatures</title>
<date>Sun May 28 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Before a resolution to impose an academic boycott on Israel is accepted, Israeli and Jewish organizations have already started their battle. With the possibility that the largest university and college lecturers union in Britain, the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE), will adopt a boycott resolution, the union's London offices and British academics have been bombarded in the past two weeks calling them to vote against the motion or even keep it off the agenda at the annual national conference in Blackpool this weekend. 
"The idea is mass action," Haifa Technion professor and chairman of the Inter-Senate Committee of the Universities for the Protection of Academic Independence (ISC), Zvi Zigler, said. 
Although the anti-boycotters argue that it is a campaign for academic freedom, it seems it is a political struggle, driven mainly by Israeli and Jewish organizations. The Anti-Defamation League quickly went into action: "Once again, a group of British academics is targeting Israel," the ADL said in a press release. The ADL circulated a petition condemning the boycott as an assault on academic freedom. Ken Jacobson, associate national director of the ADL in the U.S., said in a telephone interview that 12,000 people had signed the petition, which was sent to the president of NATFHE, John Wilkin. 
Wilkin also received a petition with 4,725 signatures from Scholars for Peace in the Middle East, an American organization whose mission statement includes encouraging academics "to develop effective responses to the ideological distortions, including anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist slanders..." 
Also fighting the battle is the International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom (IAB), which was created last year at Bar-Ilan University to fight academic boycotts against Israel and has a network of 500 members around the world. "IAB is responsible for at least 2,500 letters that were sent to NATFHE," Ofir Frankel, a doctoral candidate at Bar-Ilan who plays a major role in the IAB campaign, said. 
"We have issued press releases, warnings about what is happening, we have made sure our members send out letters. [Richard] Seaford, [the British professor who refused to write an article for an Israeli academic journal because of the boycott - T.T.] received hundreds of letters from us," Frankel said. 
The Guardian newspaper yesterday published a letter signed by over 600 academics and initiated by several organizations including Engage, which was established in Britain last year after the Association of University Teachers (AUT) adopted a resolution supporting a boycott of Bar-Ilan and Haifa universities. (The resolution was rescinded about a month later under pressure from Jewish and Israeli groups.) 
Yesterday's letter claimed the boycott motion, which "invites members ... to consider the appropriateness of a boycott of those who do not publicly dissociate themselves from [Israeli apartheid] policies" forces a political test on Israeli academics, which they called McCarthyism. 
"We oppose forcing academics to sign a statement to demonstrate political cleanliness," the letter said. 
Only four days
However, in an article published on the Guardian Web site by Steven Rose, a professor at the Open University in Britain and one of the founders of the British Committee for the Universities of Palestine, he asked, "If [an Israeli] institution does indeed ensure equity and non-discrimination, what have they to fear?" 
According to Rose, "The onus is on [self-styled friends of peace with justice in the Middle East] to answer: If not boycott, what? Forty-nine years of hand-wringing and resolutions by the international community have simply prolonged Israeli immunity and the sufferings of the Palestinians." 
Even if the boycott motion is approved, according to NATFHE national press officer Trevor Phillips, "it will only last four days." Shortly after the union's national conference, NATFHE will merge with the AUT. Following the merger, Phillips says, the resolution will be only an advisory for the united organization, which will make its own policy decisions. 
One of the sponsors of the motion, Tom Hickey of the University of Brighton's School of Historical and Critical Studies, said in a telephone interview that his colleagues must ask themselves whether they want to continue their activities in organizations that collaborate in their name in what is happening in the occupied territories. He added that he hopes the issue will receive its due during the conference and not be buried immediately with the usual argument that all action against Israel is anti-Semitic.

<title>Sweden labels Golan wines: 'Made in occupied Syrian land'</title>
<date>Thu Jun 08 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
Sweden has started to note that wines produced in the Golan Heights originate in "Israel, occupied Syrian land," the Golan Heights Winery has informed the Israeli Embassy in Sweden. Winery sources told Haaretz that the step is unprecedented and worrisome. 
The embassy is investigating claims that the warning is being issued for several wines on the Web site of the Swedish government's chain of shops that sell wine. The chain is the only Swedish body permitted to market alcoholic beverages. 
Swedish Jews have protested the step, claiming that the new way of listing the wines from the Golan Heights is a political move by a government body. The sources also said such an indication had never been made regarding any other country - not even South Africa during apartheid. 
The Golan Heights Winery approached the commercial attache at the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm this week, and requested Foreign Ministry intervention. "We produce wine, not politics," the winery said yesterday, adding, "happily, this subject does not bother most consumers in Europe."

<title>Tutu to head UN rights mission to Gaza Strip </title>
<date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 IST 2006</date>
<content>
GENEVA - Nobel Laureate Desmond Tutu has been named to head a United Nations fact-finding mission to the Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanun, where 19 civilians were killed by an Israeli artillery barrage earlier this month, UN officials said yesterday.  
The South African anti-apartheid campaigner and former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town will travel to Gaza to "assess the situation of victims, address the needs of survivors, and make recommendations on ways and means to protect Palestinian civilians against further Israeli assaults," according to the president of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Luis Alfonso De Alba.  
The mission will report its findings to the Geneva-based body by mid-December, the statement said.  
The shelling, which Israel said was unintended, came after Israel Defense Forces troops wound up a weeklong incursion meant to curb Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel from the town, which the Israeli army said was a rocket-launching stronghold.  
Tutu chaired South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission after the end of white rule.

<title>U.K. academics to back sweeping boycott of Israeli universities </title>
<date>Tue May 09 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>

The largest university and college lecturers union in Britain is likely to decide shortly to recommend that its 67,000 members boycott Israeli lecturers and academic institutions that do not publicly declare their opposition to Israeli policy in the territories.

<title>UN blasts Israel for plight of Palestinians</title>
<date>Wed Sep 27 00:00:00 IDT 2006</date>
<content>
NEW YORK - The human rights situation for Palestinians has deteriorated to a new low, a United Nations rights expert said yesterday, blaming the West for contributing to the "tragic" situation in Gaza and the West Bank. 
John Dugard, a South African civil rights lawyer, said Israel is largely responsible for the "intolerable" situation of the Palestinians. 
"I hope that my portrayal of hardships experienced by such people will trouble the consciences of those accustomed to turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to the suffering of the Palestinian people," Dugard told the UN Human Rights Council. 
"Gaza is a prison and Israel seems to have thrown away the key," Dugard said. Itzhak Levanon, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, rejected Dugard's allegations as "one-sided" and not reflecting reality. 
"What Israel chooses to describe as collateral damage to the civilian population is in fact indiscriminate killing prohibited by international law," Dugard said." 
"This report is characterized by errors of omission as well as distortions of both fact and law," he said, adding that Dugard described the situation in the territory of the Palestinian Authority in an "oversimplified manner." 
Dugard, an anti-apartheid civil rights lawyer in the 1980s, was appointed by the now defunct UN Human Rights Commission in 2001 to investigate only rights violations by the Israeli side. 
Dugard also criticized Western nations for cutting off funding to the Palestinian Authority after Hamas' victory in legislative elections in January. 
"In effect, the Palestinian people have been subjected to economic sanctions - the first time an occupied people has been so treated," Dugard said. "Palestinian people are punished for having democratically elected a regime unacceptable to Israel, the U.S. and the EU."

A UN mission to investigate the deaths of 19 civilians in the Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanun, led by South Africa's Desmond Tutu, has been delayed because Israel has yet to authorize the trip, a spokeswoman said Saturday.
The Nobel Peace laureate had been due to leave for the Middle East at the weekend, but he would not now leave before Monday, mission spokeswoman Sonia Bakar said.
"We are still waiting for a sign from Israel. It (the departure) will not be before Monday," she said.
Tutu was to begin leading a six-member team this weekend in the town to investigate the killings of 19 civilians in an errant Israel Defense Forces shelling November 8.
But Israel has yet to grant the South African anti-apartheid campaigner and former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town the necessary travel clearance, said three different officials close to the talks between the global body and Israel.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions were continuing, said they had yet to receive any indication from Israel that the mission will take place at all.
Israeli officials in Geneva said they were unable to comment immediately.
Tutu's team was supposed to report its findings to the UN Human Rights Council by mid-December.
The 47-nation council authorized the mission last month, asking Tutu to assess the situation of victims, address the needs of survivors and make recommendations on ways to prevent further casualties.
The shelling, which Israel said was unintended, came after its troops wound up a weeklong incursion meant to curb Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip town.
The IDF said Beit Hanun was a rocket-launching stronghold.
Tutu chaired South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission after the end of white rule. Tutu, who was in Geneva, could not be reached for comment.
Earlier Friday the UN Human Rights Council passed a seventh resolution criticizing Israel on Friday, this time for its failure to act on earlier recommendations that it end military operations in the Palestinian territories and allow a fact-finding mission to the region.
The rights body, which has only condemned the Israeli government in its seven-month existence, noted with regret its July resolution urging the release of all arrested Palestinian ministers has yet to be carried out.
"Violations of the fundamental rights of the Palestinians continue unabated," said Pakistani diplomat Tehmina Janjua on behalf of the 57-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference, which proposed the resolution. "The Palestinian ministers, officials and civilians have not been set free."
Janjua demanded that UN human rights expert John Dugard be allowed to conduct an "urgent" fact-finding in the region, which the council ordered at an emergency session only one month after it was called into existence to replace the discredited Human Rights Commission.
Criticism by the council brings no penalties beyond international attention. Countries, however, lobby hard to avoid having their rights records scrutinized.
Dugard, a former anti-apartheid civil rights lawyer from South Africa, has frequently clashed with Israel, who note that he has been mandated only with investigating violations by the Israeli side. The United States - which along with Israel is only an observer at the 47-nation council - also has dismissed Dugard's reports as one-sided.
Only Canada voted against Friday's resolution. Cameroon and Japan joined the 10 European members of the council in abstaining. The rest of Africa and Asia, along with all of Latin America, voted in favor.
Israel's ambassador to the global body in Geneva criticized the council for ignoring a Nov. 26 cease-fire agreement that ended five months of fierce fighting in Gaza.
"Why does this resolution fail to make any mention of the cease-fire between Israelis and Palestinians, that persists despite the continuation of Qassam rockets fired on Israel?" Itzhak Levanon asked the council.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the watchdog last month to deal with the Mideast conflict in an impartial manner, and said it was time to focus attention on "graver" crises such as Darfur.
Despite his plea, the council has passed only a watered-down resolution on the western Sudanese region proposed by African countries, which urged all parties to the conflict to end human rights violations.

<title>Balad to hold vote on whether to accept Israel as a Jewish state</title>
<date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
The Israeli-Arab Balad party will hold an assembly this Saturday in Shfaram to vote on whether to accept Israel as a Jewish state. Separately, members will vote on whether to oppose the upcoming Middle East Peace Summit
According to a statement released by Balad on Monday, the party's objections to the summit are based on its failure to focus on  the "right of return" for Palestinian refugees, the evacuation of settlements in the West Bank and the founding of a sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. 
The statement also said that the demand on the part of Israel for recognition as a Jewish state
The party maintains that the Annapolis summit will be used by the U.S., Israel and the Palestinian Authority to push aside legitimate Palestinian concerns in favor of superficial gestures. 
The statement closed with a call to the Palestinian Authority to resist U.S. and Israeli pressure to abandon fundamental Palestinian demands.

<title>Growing trend to delegitimize Israel worries Jewish leaders </title>
<date>Tue Jul 10 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
The trend toward delegitimizing Israel's existence as a Jewish state is growing not only in Europe, but also in the United States, according to Jewish-American academics and community leaders.  
Anti-Israel attacks are even beginning to affect Jewish supporters of Israel, who have been accused of trying to silence public debate, they said.  
This trend toward delegitimization will be one of the topics discussed at a conference on the future of the Jewish people that opens in Jerusalem this morning. The conference, which will be attended by researchers, heads of Jewish organizations and senior Israeli politicians, was organized by the Jewish People Policy Planning Institute.  
Avinoam Bar-Yosef, JPPPI's director general, said that anti-Israel attacks in the U.S. constitute a "long-term threat" to Israel's standing, American Jewish organizations and the pro-Israel lobby.  
"Public attention is currently focused on Europe, due to initiatives like the British academic boycott," he said. "In the U.S., the problem is still under the radar. But as a planning institute, we believe that it is necessary to formulate policy on this issue now."  
Brandeis University President Jehuda Reinharz told Haaretz that American academics are at the forefront of those denying Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. Veteran advocates of this position, such as Tony Judt and Noam Chomsky, were joined last year by Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer, both from reputable academic institutions, who charged that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) dictates American foreign policy. Their article, which generated shock waves, is being turned into a book, which is slated to be published in September. The fact that a respected publisher paid Walt and Mearsheimer an advance that is thought to have totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars attests to how hot the publisher thinks this issue is, Reinharz said.  
"My feeling - and that of many people - following Walt and Mearsheimer and other publications is that we are at the start of a new era with regard to attitudes toward Israel in the U.S.," he added.  
Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, believes that Jimmy Carter's book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, which was published last November, had a much greater impact than did other publications.  
"In the past, people who said that Jewish supporters of Israel control the media and politics belonged to the margins," he said. "But after former president Carter said it, it gained legitimacy in the mainstream. Today, the debate is already on questions such as to what extent the Jews dominate."  
Foxman said that Jews who challenge anti-Israel attacks find themselves accused of undermining freedom of expression.  
"I received letters from professors who claimed that when I accuse someone of anti-Semitism, I am trying to silence public debate," he said. "When the president of Harvard University said that the delegitimization of Israel helps anti-Semites, he was accused of silencing public debate. No one would have dared accuse him of this had he been talking about racism or xenophobia."  
Reinharz said that he is worried by the lack of effective response to anti-Israel publications.  
"I see no combined effort to fight this by the Jewish organizations, and in truth, I myself don't know how this could be done," he said.

<title>Jewish power </title>
<date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
If in the past anti-Semitism was mostly religious (Christian) and racist (Nazi), now it ranges from neo-Nazism through Iranian Khomeinism to the margins of political hostility toward Israel. Sometimes the boundaries are slim and fuzzy, advertently or inadvertently.  
It is common nowadays to defend anti-Semitic tones by claiming they are only sharp criticism of Israel. On the other hand, some hasten to condemn as anti-Semitic any criticism of the Israeli government's actions. Herein lies the importance of Abraham Foxman's new book: "The Deadliest Lies: The Israel Lobby and the Myth of Jewish Control," written by the head of the Anti-Defamation League and published last month, tries to define in clear language the fine line between hostility toward the state of Israel and outright hatred.  
However, perhaps Foxman's success in refuting the alleged takeover of Washington's foreign policy should not entirely negate international theories of Jewish influence. The considerable talk about "dual loyalties" has increased some Jews' hesitation to voice support for Israel openly. However, one must not forget that the legend of the Jews' power has afforded - and still is affording - a great deal of weight and respect for Israel in many developing countries. This has helped Israel in nurturing diplomatic and commercial ties, just as the Israel Defense Forces victories have helped the export of military products to Africa, Asia and Latin America.  
Nevertheless, it seems that in certain countries, like the United States and Britain, the legend has hurt more than helped. The issue became especially relevant in the wake of America's failure in the Iraq war and the increasing popularity of the claim that Israel's supporters pushed U.S. President George W. Bush into the hostilities.  
In his work, Foxman addresses the book about the pro-Israel lobby written by the political scientists John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt; an article by the Jewish journalist and historian Tony Judt, in favor of a binational state; and the book by former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, "Palestine: Peace not Apartheid."  
There is no doubt that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee is one of the largest and most successful lobbies in Washington. However, I remember that as far back as the early 1950s, when AIPAC consisted of its founder I.L. Kenan, one assistant and one secretary, it was considered the second most influential lobby in Washington. Foxman notes, and rightly so, that this was not due to "a sinister Jewish conspiracy" but rather the enthusiasm of most Americans for Israel. And indeed, in public opinion surveys last year, 48 percent of respondents said that they supported Israel, as opposed to 13 percent who expressed support for the Arabs.  
Hints of prejudice 
Nonetheless, Foxman notes that American public opinion hints at traces of prejudices toward Jews, and that these prejudices contribute to the fact that Jewish support for Israel arouses more suspicion than the affection other Americans feel for their families' countries of origin. He also contradicts the claim that Jewish ownership of important U.S. newspapers slants them in favor of Israel. Foxman notes that out of the 24,000 articles and commentaries that appeared on the front page of The New York Times during the six years of World War II, only 26 dealt with the Holocaust.  
In the second part of his book, Foxman denies the charges that Anti-Defamation League intervention led to the cancellation of a lecture Judt was scheduled to give in New York last year. In the lecture, he had planned to call for replacing Israel with a binational Arab-Jewish state.  
The third part of the book analyzes Carter's book, and here, too, Foxman is cautious about accusing the former president of anti-Semitism. Nonetheless, he explains why the title of Carter's book is not only unjust but also intentionally provocative.  
Foxman's book opens with warm remarks by former American secretary of state George Shultz. Shultz, too, stresses that criticism of Israel's deeds is legitimate, but that lies are something else. Lies are liable to be deadly, a basis for cruel and inhuman acts, and the Jewish people has suffered from lies more than any people, he writes.  
Shultz notes that the United States has hundreds of active lobbies representing many different interests. Jewish groups are indeed influential, but they do not all promote the same interests. Moreover, he adds, it is impossible to ignore the fact that Carter's opinions are on the anti-Israeli side. He concludes that the United States supports Israel because this is the correct thing to do politically and morally.  
In any case, it is worth putting the three books into the proper proportions. Despite the great amount of publicity and the debates surrounding them, the expectations or fears that they will dramatically change American public opinion are overblown. The Jewish establishment in the Diaspora as well as in the State of Israel must take care not to overexploit the goodwill and affection it maintains in many countries. There are already many signs that public opinion is changing in Europe and the United States. Only maintaining distance from extreme Israeli stances and showing a sincere desire for peace can prevent this.

<title>Jewish S. African minister slams critics of invitation to Hamas PM</title>
<date>Mon May 07 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
A South African cabinet minister, who is himself Jewish but also an outspoken critic of Israel, on Monday defended his invitation to Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh to make his first visit outside the Muslim world, saying it was "myopic" to reject opportunities for dialogue.
Intelligence Minister Ronnie Kasrils  provoked controversy last week when he extended the invitation during a visit to the Palestinian territories. He said South Africa's own experience showed the need to talk to all sides.
"Those who myopically object to such invitations merely show that they have learnt nothing from South Africa's transition," Kasrils said in a statement.
"Such logic as they espouse would not have allowed (apartheid era president) PW Botha to have met with the imprisoned (Nelson) Mandela nor his release by (former president) FW De Klerk as a partner in negotiations."
No date has been set for the trip, which Kasrils said had been endorsed by Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas.
South Africa's Jewish Board of Deputies has criticised the invitation, saying the "racist ideology" of Haniyeh's Hamas organisation, which leads the Palestinian unity government, stood in contrast to South Africa's own post-apartheid ideals.
"As Jews and South African citizens, we cannot but view these developments with the deepest unhappiness," board chairman Michael Bagraim said in a statement.
Kasrils used his visit to "reiterate the commitment of the South African Government towards the achievement, through peaceful negotiations, of a two-state solution based on a viable Palestinian state on the 1967 borders," the minister's statement said.
Since becoming Palestinian prime minister in March 2006, Haniyeh has visited Arab states, some Gulf states and Iran, but he has not travelled beyond that.

<title>Na'ima is threatening the Jewish majority </title>
<date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Although the school year began on September 2, Na'ima, 9, is still at home. Not one school in the city could find a place for her. Thousands of pupils in East Jerusalem are in the same situation. A city official in late August spelled it out in a letter to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI). Suheila Abu Ghosh, the assistant director of Manhi, the Jerusalem Education Administration, which belongs to the municipality and to the Education Ministry, wrote that "to our regret no places were found to absorb the 16 pupils who appear on the lists you enclosed with your letters, in grades two to eight." On official stationery of the municipality and the ministry, the person in charge of education admits there is no room in the schools for Jerusalem children who are legally entitled to compulsory education.  
In recent weeks, the Jerusalem Education Administration has been trying to find room for the 16 children for fear ACRI would turn to the High Court of Justice. As has happened every year in recent years, the threat to petition the High Court forces the Jerusalem Municipality to pressure school principals into crowding another Palestinian child into an already crowded classroom, to find a solution for the petitioners.  
At the start of school last year the education minister declared her intention of working to reduce the shortage of about 1,300 classrooms in East Jerusalem, but during the past year only 50 new classrooms were built there. Despite the commitment of the Education Ministry and the Jerusalem Municipality to the High Court, from 2001-2007, to build at least 645 classrooms in East Jerusalem (245 according to a 2001 High Court decision and 400 in the context of the promise given to the High Court this year), in fact, fewer than 100 new classrooms have been built since 2001.  
The petitions of parents whose children found no room in Jerusalem schools continue to be processed in the High Court, but the legal discussions, the focus on details, are concealing what any child can see: Jerusalem, which is celebrating the 40th anniversary of its reunification, is conducting a policy of separation.  
According to the report of the Coalition for the Advancement of Arab Education in East Jerusalem, only about half the Palestinian children in East Jerusalem, about 39,400 out of about 79,000, are at present studying in the city school system. Most of the others study in private schools, in United Nations schools or outside the city. About two-thirds of the public schools in East Jerusalem operate in rented apartments. And, still, hundreds of children remain without a place in Jerusalem's schools.  
During 40 years of occupation Israel built Jewish neighborhoods on Arab land in East Jerusalem, such as Gilo, French Hill, Neveh Yaakov et al, and - wonder of wonders - there are no children in these neighborhoods who have to turn to the courts in order to attend school. After all, it is unthinkable to have no room for Jewish children in the Jerusalem school system.  
Jerusalem, which is now joyously celebrating the 40th anniversary of its reunification, is a divided city. The discrimination in education is part of a consistent attempt to reduce the number of Palestinian residents in the city, so as to maintain a Jewish majority. These efforts are also reflected in the demolition of homes, the confiscation of land, the confiscation of ID cards from anyone who has gone to study elsewhere, for example, and in the crowded conditions in the schools. All these are the implementation of a policy that considers Palestinians second-class citizens.  
That's why there is no room for Na'ima in Jerusalem's schools. Na'ima, like thousands of other Palestinian children in Jerusalem, threatens the Jewish majority. The Israeli school system does not want Na'ima. It doesn't want Na'zz to remind it that maintaining the Jewish majority is an unethical goal. The educational policy in Jerusalem is a microcosm of the general situation in discriminatory Israel. A country that builds schools for children from one group and not from another is an apartheid state.

<title>8 rights groups ask High Court to rescind West Bank driving ban</title>
<date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Eight human rights groups petitioned the High Court of Justice on Sunday against a military order prohibiting Israelis from driving Palestinians in private vehicles in the West Bank. 
Attorney Michael Sfard, who filed the motion for Yesh Din, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Gisha, the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel and others, criticized GOC Central Command Yair Naveh's order, slated to take effect January 19.
Sfard said the order will "lead to a rift between Israelis and Palestinians who have legitimate social, political and commercial ties." 
The groups call the order reminiscent of apartheid, as it "implements an ideology of separation by creating criminal sanctions on different peoples." 
Separately, a human rights advocacy group has charged that Israel did not relinquish control of the Gaza Strip in the disengagement. 
According to a report by Gisha: Center for the Legal Protection of Freedom of Movement, although Israel removed certain components of control by ecacuating the Gaza Strip, it tightened its hold on others - namely the freedom of movement into and out of the Gaza Strip. The Gisha report is expected to be released to diplomats and European Union delegates in Israel later this week. 
"Imposing a strict curfew on the movement of people and goods in and out of the Gaza Strip and halting funding for public services have contributed to an economic and humanitarian crisis in the Strip of a severity unknown in the 38 years of occupation," the report states.

<title>Ahead of summit, N.Y. Congressman fears for Mideast stability</title>
<date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
WASHINGTON - There are people in Jerusalem who have not yet forgotten the criticism leveled at Prime Minister Ehud Olmert by Gary Ackerman, a United States congressman from New York and head of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia. 
He "kissed President Bush's ass," said the representative, in language that was not quite diplomatic, commenting to The Forward about Olmert's criticism of the new Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, after her visit with Syrian President Bashar Assad in Damascus last April. 
Ackerman's slaps at Olmert might have led one to suspect that the 64-year-old, 12-term congressman misses Ariel Sharon, Olmert's predecessor. And perhaps he really does miss Sharon a little, but the criticism that he levels today against Sharon's most dramatic decision - the withdrawal from Gaza - is harsh. It was, he says, "a mistake." 
But you supported this move.
"True," admits Ackerman, but he reminds me that there he didn't have many alternatives. As an American legislator, nobody consulted with him. The decision was presented as a fait accompli, and it seemed better to support it and to hope that the move would succeed than to express meaningless and useless opposition. In general, though, Ackerman says he feels that unilateral moves are not wise. Israel left Gaza without having anyone to whom it could hand over the keys. 
So is that the problem, that they didn't give Gaza to Abu Mazen? Would that have worked?
No, he says, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has to date not proven an ability to receive keys and to turn them in the lock as well. Therefore, this opposition was not available to Sharon. 
So if there is nobody to give it to, and unilateral withdrawal is a mistake, what should have been done?
"Under those circumstances," states the legislator, "it would have been preferable to continue the status quo." In other words, a continued Israeli presence in Gaza. And Ackerman hastens to explain that this is not "stating a position regarding the settlements." He does not think that Israel should have remained in Gaza forever, only for the time being, until there was someone to whom it could "transfer responsibility." 
Repeatedly, Ackerman refers to the need for a "dash of political realism," during a long conversation he had with Haaretz in his Capitol Hill office last week, shortly before he embarked on another lightning visit to the Middle East. 
Ackerman, who is Jewish, represents New York's Fifth Congressional District, which takes in parts of Long Island and Queens. He was a teacher in the New York City school system before entering politics (he served five years in the New York State Senate before being elected to the U.S. House for the first time, in 1983). And he is next in line to take over the chairmanship of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, when its current Democratic chair, Tom Lantos, retires. 
Ackerman's keyboard has worked overtime in recent weeks. His new pen pal: Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. In an October 19 letter he sent her concerning the peace conference planned for Annapolis, Maryland, at the end of this month, Ackerman and a Republican colleague from Louisiana, Charles Boustany (who is of Lebanese heritage), declared, "We believe the meeting in November could mark an important turning point" - and also recommended forceful steps to strengthen the Palestinian Authority and its leader. 
The letter was welcomed by dovish Jewish organizations like Peace Now and the Israel Policy Forum. We can "all learn from the example" of these legislators, said Debra DeLee, president and CEO of Americans for Peace Now (APN). Afterward, the establishment AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) also joined the supporters of the letter. Ackerman, with his typical political savvy, had managed to appeal to the tastes of many groups. 
In reality, the U.S.-sponsored meeting in Annapolis, the one that "could mark an important turning point," is making Ackerman squirm in his seat. As in the case of the mistake of withdrawing from Gaza, here too he hastens to mention that "this was not my decision." The facts were determined by others. "The moment a meeting has been announced, I don't want it to fail." 
But was the decision to convene a conference the right decision? Ackerman doesn't say it wasn't, but neither does he say it was. But what he is clear about is his belief that "you have to do homework before the exam." He adds: "The idea was too amorphous, very problematic in my opinion." 
Ackerman fears for another failure. Like the failure of the withdrawal from Gaza, for which Israel is to blame; like the "tremendous failure" of the elections for the Palestinian parliament two years ago, for which he blames the United States. It was President Bush, he says, who "forced his supposed best friend" - namely, Ariel Sharon - "to agree to Hamas participation in the elections." The consequences are well-known. 
Ackerman walks a thin line when he talks about the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. On the one hand, Ackerman has an unreserved love for Israel and is wary of backing steps that could endanger its welfare; on the other, he has a political need to align himself with the party ethos that sees the attempt to achieve an agreement as a crucial need. 
Added to these are his reluctance as a Democrat to show support for a step, any step, taken by the Bush administration, along with the understanding that the administration is now trying to accomplish something positive. But it is clear to everyone that there is a side that he supports in this story, or as he put it, "I have a dog in this fight." 
In late October, Ackerman and several of his colleagues, also Jewish legislators, met with former president Jimmy Carter, who came to the Hill to try and find a common language with them, after the major uproar engendered by his book "Palestine: Peace, Not Apartheid." Ackerman says his presence at the meeting was intended not to reconcile with Carter, but to explain to him what he thinks of his book. Among other things, Carter was told during the discussion that he had "lost the ability to present himself as someone who cares about Israel." Participants describe the off-the-record dialogue as "tough" and "unpleasant." 
Fears for the region
"I now fear for the stability of the region more than ever in the past," says Ackerman. His conclusion: We have to exploit the opportunity that Rice is trying to create. "You can claim that we have to wait for a Palestinian messiah, and that this is not the ideal time - but time is not on our side because politics move fast. The longer we wait the worse the outlook." 
Therefore - we have to act, and now. "To close the best deal possible." That's the reason for urging Rice to support a program for the rehabilitation and building of the PA. "To [make the Palestinians] decide now between Fatah and Hamas." In other words - denying vital support to Fatah today will bring Hamas to the West Bank and perhaps even further tomorrow. 
But there is also another side to the coin. Ackerman looks at Mahmoud Abbas and does not see a genuine leader who is capable of bringing about change. He says that he doesn't want to give money to the PA "without a specific goal" and without close supervision to insure that the goal has been achieved. Rice, he says, has to "insist" that the PA demonstrate that it is doing something "real" with American taxpayers' money. "We'll give to you only if you provide the goods, sounds less supportive and more conditional." 
The letter he co-signed is in effect an expression of his two personae - the "good Ackerman" and the "bad Ackerman." Apparently those who supported him chose to read into it what suits them, no less than what the legislator intends to say. 
Ackerman's criticism is directed at the administration and at the PA, but most of all at the "Arab world," which he says caused Bill Clinton to fail when it did not give Yasser Arafat the necessary push at Camp David in 2000. That is what Rice says about the Arabs, and what Ackerman says as well. Therefore he doesn't understand how a conference that was intended to have Arab participation could have been announced without the host, the United States, knowing in advance what "the Arabs are willing to give." Recently he himself met with the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., and complained that the diplomat's country had stopped sending money to the PA since the collapse of the Mecca agreement of last February between Fatah and Hamas. 
Though Ackerman is trying to adhere to the line being promoted by his party - which calls for greater American involvement in the peace process - occasionally he presents a relatively hawkish stance. For example, in a second letter to the secretary of state, from October 24, he discussed the crisis in Lebanon and recommended upgrading the economic and political sanctions against Syria. The same Syria that led him to criticize Olmert, after Jerusalem criticized the visit there by Speaker Nancy Pelosi last spring. 
Ackerman looks at the ongoing unrest and instability in Lebanon, and finds no reasons for complacency. "I said to the administration, you think that losing Gaza is problematic? Try losing Lebanon!" Like most of his Democratic colleagues, he will call for "dialogue" with Syria, but when he says it, it sounds like a very tough dialogue indeed. 
Wherever Ackerman looks in the region he sees a problem, which he chooses to illustrate with the help of a horrifying example. We, he says, are like people on the top floors of the World Trade Center on 9/11. We have to decide quickly what to do: To stay? To try to go downstairs? To wait for the rescue forces? "Not deciding is also a decision," he reminds us.

<title>Anti-Israel picket in South Africa: protesters for hire? </title>
<date>Fri Jun 08 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Z., a journalist from South Africa, was covering an anti-Israel demonstration Tuesday night outside the U.S. Consulate in Johannesburg. He says he was chased away after he discovered that some of the demonstrators were in fact homeless people from the surrounding townships serving as protesters for hire. The organizers categorically denied the allegations.  
Before the organizers could pick up on his presence, Z. managed to interview some of the participants in the candlelight vigil, which took place as a nationwide and government-sanctioned campaign called "End The Occupation."  
"There were several dozen protesters there, most of them Muslim. But there were also people who didn't seem to belong. They told me they were not pro-Palestinian activists, but homeless people bused in from the surrounding townships," he told Haaretz.  
"It was a particularly cold night and most of them refused to protest, opting to sit on the warm bus. The organizers refused to allow it. When I asked one black 'protester' if he was for Palestine, he replied: 'I am for nobody.' I had to laugh," Z. said.  
It was then that the organizers noticed Z. "One of the organizers, Salim Valli, accused me of being a Zionist agent. He told me this wasn't my country and I should get the hell out. The police accused me of provocation and asked me to leave. As I was doing so, one of the organizers took my picture. To be honest, I am concerned about my safety."  
Muhammed Desai of the Palestine Solidarity Committee of the University of the Witwatersrand, which organized the demonstration, rejected the allegations. "We categorically state that no protesters were hired and all those that gathered in protest against Apartheid Israel were present on their own accord," he said. "The allegations are a perfect example of Zionist propaganda to undermine South African solidarity with the Palestinian people."  
Earlier this week, South Africa's deputy foreign minister, Aziz Pahad, showed support for the campaign when he named Israel as "the only nation that has been able to defy the international community with impunity." At a reception for Arab ambassadors posted to Pretoria, Pahad said that "no other country has been allowed to get away with such blatant violations of international law."

<title>Antony Loewenstein - His Israel Question</title>
<date>Sun Apr 15 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
This week's guest is Antony Loewenstein. I speak with him about his book, "My Israel Question", the Arab-Israeli conflict and the relations between Jewish Diaspora and Israel. Readers can send questions.
Loewenstein is a Sydney based journalist and the author of the new book My Israel Question
Readers can send questions to rosnersdomain@haaretz.co.il
Antony,
I agree that "if Jews want nothing to do with a state that has no direct impact on their daily lives, this position should be respected." I have no issue with Jews stating that they feel no association with Israel - it is the logical outcome of assimilation. 
However, self-proclaimed Jewish "anti-Zionists" fail to take the next, logical step: to show indifference to Israel and let those who have relatives in Israel and a stake in the country go about their business. Why not demonstrate your indifference by ignoring the subject altogether? This is the paradox - Jews who are utterly alienated from their own roots claim a privilege to attack Israel based on their own Jewishness, thereby re-asserting the "ethnocentrism" they so passionately decry in Israel. 
And of course, many Israelis would love to reduce their country's dependence on the US. Sadly, having been cut off from French support on the eve of the 1967 war, and having lost billions in income due to the Arab boycott, they perceive themselves as lacking an alternative. As a state's first obligation is to protect its own citizens, rather than soothe the conscience of distant Sydneysiders, why should this criticism affect Israelis even one iota?   
Benaiah MosesLondon, UK
Judaism has always been a very broad church and this trend should most certainly continue. If Jews have the "right" to remain silent on Israel, then surely they have the equal right - I would say responsibility - to demand the Jewish state lives up to its claims of being a humane and moral nation. 
You claim that anti-Zionists should show indifference to Israel because they oppose the concept of a Jewish state. In fact, the opposite is true. Speaking for myself, I feel incredibly Jewish and am very proud of my religion's dissenting traditions. I write extensively about Israel and the Palestinians precisely because I care deeply about the fate of the Jewish people, not because I want to shun my background. 
You seem to be saying that being truly "Jewish" would automatically dictate an unquestioning love for Israel. Uncritical Zionists have pursued this path for decades, and contributed to Israel's current status as an international pariah . True friends of Israel, whether Zionist or anti-Zionist, want Israel to stop making excuses for not making peace. End the occupation once and for all, and become a truly modern nation. In its current form, it is rooted in a bygone era. 
When I co-founded Independent Australian Jewish Voices (IAJV) earlier in the year, a prominent Zionist leader in Australia condemned many of our members as "Jewish-born individuals", as if attending synagogue, giving money for Israeli trees and engaging in the community is the only way that Jews gain the right to comment on Israel. You seem to be making a similar argument. I am not simply condemning Israel because I am Jewish - this ethno-centric mentality is far too prevalent amongst Zionist Jews - but rather as a human being who is also Jewish. There is a major difference. 
You write that Israel would love to reduce its ties to the US, but is unable to do so. Well, then Israel cannot honestly call itself an independent nation. It is a client state, like many other similiar countries around the world. Washington has convinced Israel that it can act however it wishes towards the Palestinians and suffer no punishment as a result, such as reduced aid etc. Of course, the US is happy for Israel to behave brutally towards the Palestinians, because it has little time for their claims, wishes or rights. But as the US becomes less important in the Middle East - as the Iraq war has thankfully brought - Israel will have to make a decision. Stay wedded to Washington, or find its own path. The initial signs are not too positive. 
You rightly state that a state's first obligations are to its citizens, but Israel's behaviour is in fact endangering these very people. Maintaining and expanding the occupation, launching disastrous wars into Lebanon, encouraging war against Iran and still praising the "stability" of the Iraq war are all contributing to a decrease in safety for Israelis. How does the Zionist lobby in all honesty truly believe that a military strike against Iran will improve Israel's position in the Middle East? Virtually every Middle East expert - not working for the American Enterprise Institute or the Weekly Standard, of course - will tell you that, and yet the mainstream Jewish position on the Iranian "threat" is to attack first, ask questions later. Such reckless behavior almost proves the adage that Israel is a democracy for Jews where the military actually makes the major decisions. 
Israelis know that their country is becoming more internationally isolated, and it's not because of biased media or anti-Semitic governments. When, not if, America starts to exercise a more balanced policy in the region, how will Israelis react then? With indifference? I doubt it. 
I wonder how you believe criticism of Israel should be transmitted. Never? Silently? Only amongst friends? It's more than time for Jews to stand up and demand their homeland behave more morally and legally.
Best wishes,
Antony
Antony,
I try not to argue with my guests even when I strongly disagree with their views, so let me ask you this: Even assuming that you are right on the issues, and that Israel is an "anachronism" (whatever that means), there's one problem I think you don't address properly. Jewish Israelis will not dismantle their country just to please you or any other critic. If the Arab-Israeli conflict needs solution - and it does - yours might be one of the most impractical ideas. How do you envision the way forward for peace and stability and justice in a world in which real, practical, solutions matter? 
Rosner
You ask what I mean when I talk of Israel being an "anachronism." Let me briefly explain. I was liberally borrowing Tony Judt's expression. He wrote in 2003: "The very idea of a 'Jewish state' - a state in which Jews and the Jewish religion have exclusive privileges from which non-Jewish citizens are forever excluded -  is rooted in another time and place." I share this belief. 2007 is not 1948, and racially based nations are no longer as acceptable as they clearly were in the 20th century. Humans progress, and so do our ideas about race and religion.  
It is not impractical to talk of granting full rights to all Israeli citizens. It is not impractical to speak of the Jewish state allowing full marriage rights to both Israelis and Palestinians. And it is not impractical - indeed, it is essential if Israel is to remain even vaguely relevant in the 21st century - for the racially based occupation to end immediately. These are all achievable goals. Any nation that ignores such basic human rights should not be welcomed into the global community. Surely you would have objected to the ways in which apartheid South Africa both exploited and discriminated against its black population. This is exactly what is happening against the Palestinians in the occupied territories today.  
My earlier suggestions for a more humane Israel do not demand that Israelis cease to be Israelis, ignore their history (and suffering) or commit national suicide. I am in fact articulating a Jewish state that may have a future, unlike the current impasse that can only lead to its destruction. I say this with a heavy heart, not glee. How much longer will world support continue when the US's superpower status begins to recede? 
The majority of Israelis claim they want the occupation of the West Bank to end, yet barely put any pressure on their government to make this happen. Olmert's "convergence" plan was actually a ploy to gain international support for simply removing some settlements, and leaving many more. A desperate Palestinian leadership may accept this in the heat of negotiations - though it's unlikely the Hamas government would - but Israelis should demand ALL the settlements be removed, not just those with no strategic purpose.  
Moving forward on the Israel/Palestine conflict is not as difficult as Western commentators often describe. Both sides have intransigent elements, and both sides need to at least partially accept the other's narrative. This is no easy task. For example, Hamas (and the PLO before it) was told it must recognise Israel's right to exist. This sounds fine in principle, but Israel has never settled its borders, so is Hamas being asked to recognise the 1948 borders, or '67 or some other arbitrary lines? Israel, in its current form, is a constantly expanding entity and remains addicted to land acquisition. How many mainstream Jewish organisations in the West are actively pressuring the Israeli government to dismantle these ever-growing settlements? Their deafening silence suggests that their real interest is short-term political goals rather than long-term Israeli security.  
If you believe that my ideas are impractical for Israel's future, Zionists and the Israeli government would probably agree. But achieving peace is more than simply mouthing platitudes and hoping for the best. You want some practical solutions, so let me present a few. Israel must completely cease settlement expansion. The Palestinian government must end violence against Israeli citizens. Israel must allow the free movement of Palestinians in and out of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and unilaterally release thousands of Palestinian prisoners, many of whom are guilty of no crime other than legally resisting Israeli occupation.  
Danny Rubinstein writes this week in Haaretz: 
"If Israel and the Palestinian Authority fail to reach an agreement based on a two-state solution, the only alternative would be a single-state solution. There is no other prospect.  
"This single state would not be a "secular democratic nation," as the PLO advocated in the past, nor would it be a state of all its citizens...The strong Jewish majority would not allow that. The only option remaining would be an apartheid state, whose first signs - and possibly more than just that - are already visible in the West Bank and in Gaza.  
"In this case, the struggle in store for the Arabs of the occupied territories would be directed to achieving equal rights and equality within the State of Israel. This would include establishing full unity between them and the Arab Israeli minority - a unity that does not exist today." 
In many ways, the two-state solution is already a virtual impossibility. Only full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories would allow such a possibility and that simply isn't going to happen in the current climate. Years of Israeli stalling has resulted in the bi-national option becoming more palatable to many Palestinians and Zionist critics the world over.  
I would never dare tell Israelis or Palestinians how to resolve their age-old conflict, but my ideas have moved from the fringes to the mainstream in the last years. Demanding equal treatment for both Israelis and Palestinians within Israel's borders isn't a revolutionary thought, it's common sense. I often wonder why so many Jews are resistant to the concept of Palestinians being treated as fairly as Jews.  
Best wishes, 
Antony
Antony,
Here's a big challenge: For the benefit of my readers who haven't read your book - can you please present the abridged version of your main complaints regarding Israel, and a solution that would make Israel more acceptable to you? 
Best
Rosner
My book aims to articulate an alternative Jewish perspective on the Israel/Palestine conflict. In my view, the separation of Zionism and Judaism is one of the key challenges for 21st century Judaism. For too long, they have been inextricably linked. It is the duty of Jews, and all global citizens, to speak out against injustice, not just misbehavior against Jews. 
I believe that Israel can no longer be a Jewish state, a nation that actively discriminates against anybody who isn't born Jewish. Whether Arab or Palestinian, a modern country that wants international recognition and respect, cannot continue to institute policies that are racially based. For the record, I am equally against an Islamic or Christian nation or any other religiously-sanctioned country. Israel must recognize that a progressive state doesn't continue to find legal ways to bar Jews marrying non-Jews or Palestinians living with Jewish partners.  Apartheid South Africa instituted similar policies and the world finally reacted appropriately to such outrages. Jimmy Carter's recent book, "Palestine: Peace not Apartheid", succeeded in mainstreaming the realities of the occupied territories and detailed the day-to-day realities of life for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel must grant equal rights to all its citizens. 
Secondly, the Palestinian right of return is a sacred issue that will not simply disappear by Zionists wishing it would. Around five million Palestinians have the historical and legal right to return to land stolen in 1948, ethnically cleansed for the sake of a Jewish state. Arguably the vast majority of these Palestinians would not return to their ancestral lands, but they, like Jews, must have the right to do so. Many Jews and the Israeli government fear that such moves would dilute a Jewish state and make its future impossible. They're right, but only if a racially exclusive nation is their ideal. Israelis have the right to live in peace in their ancestral lands, and so do Palestinians. 
The occupation of Palestinian land must end immediately. The Gaza "withdrawal" was a sham that essentially allowed the Israelis to imprison over one million Palestinians. Haaretz journalist Amira Hass has written of the Israeli mentality towards these Palestinians: "They are behaving as expected at the end of the extended experiment called 'what happens when you imprison 1.3 million human beings in an enclosed space like battery hens.'" Even as Israeli leaders across the world talk of peace and compromise, the expansion of West Bank settlements continues apace, making a truly contiguous Palestinian state virtually impossible. Such demographic realities make a one-state solution almost the default position, despite the posturing of the Bush administration and its global spokespeople. Spending time in the occupied territories, especially in places like Hebron, one is struck by the immorality of allowing a tiny minority of extremist Jews to control the lives of millions of Palestinians. Is this what the Holocaust taught Jews? Every single settlement on occupied land must be removed, no questions asked. The difficulties of doing so - and the real possibility of civil war within Israel - should not be reason enough to avoid this necessity. The future of Israel depends on this happening. 
Finally, Israel must start to extricate itself from the incestuous embrace of successive American administrations. For a nation that claims to be independent in both word and deed, its actions indicate the exact opposite. The long-term viability of Israel is with the Arab world, not a superpower thousands of miles away. If the Jewish state wants to continue being a client of the US, that is its right, but a growing political awareness amongst Muslim Americans, coupled with the rise of India and China as global superpowers, makes Israel's current path unsustainable. 
There are many aspects of Israeli culture that are vibrant and enviable. Its policies toward the Palestinians are not among them. As a Jew who believes that both Israelis and Palestinians have the right to live in peace together, corrupt Israeli leadership, blindly supported by Zionist spokesman in the Western world, is endangering Jewish lives by refusing to recognize the rights of another people. The equation is simple. Israel has the right to exist, but so does Palestine. Whether that's in one-state, two-states or some other formulation, that's for both peoples to decide. 
Most importantly, however, as already stated by British-born historian Tony Judt, Israel, in its current form, "is truly an anachronism." It is not enough anymore for Zionists to merely deflect all criticism as anti-Semitic or anti-Zionist. In many countries around the world, including Australia, such rhetoric no longer has the power to shut down debate. A humane, responsible and moral Israel must not be allowed to shame its historical mandate. The soul of the Holocaust is not for Zionists to use and abuse. We all suffered in that cataclysmic event. Israel knows what it must do to be internationally accepted. 
best,
Antony
Dear Antony,
Your book is a harsh criticism of Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, but also of the American and Australian Jewish community. So let's start with this general question: What is it that bothers you about the support Jewish Diaspora gives to Israel - or maybe you think that no support is needed? 
Thank you,
Rosner
Thanks Shmuel,
Although it's not unique to the Jewish community, an unhealthy tendency has developed within many Jewish Diaspora communities since the birth of Israel. An ethno-centric and racially superior mentality has flourished that places the lives and concerns of Israel and Jews above all others. In this worldview, Israeli lives are always more precious than Palestinian ones. Israel's "security" is far more important than the existence or safety of a future Palestinian state. Such thinking, in my home country of Australia and elsewhere, has long troubled me. Is this what Zionism was destined to become?
When it relates to Israel, far too many Jews are able to defend, justify and explain the Jewish state's behavior, no matter how illegal or immoral. A recent letter published in the Australian Jewish News succinctly articulated the problem: "I have always believed that whatever Israel does is always right for the Jews." This uncritical and anti-intellectual stance completely contradicts the noble Judaic tradition of rigorous thought and dissent.
Since I started writing extensively on the Israel/Palestine conflict in the last years, I've been astounded by the reactionary response of some Jews to the idea of justice for all. Hate-mail and death-threats, by fellow Jews, has sadly become a fact of life. It is as if the overwhelming evidence of Israel's crimes in the occupied territories is always issued by "biased" media, NGOs or governments. Are only Israeli foreign ministry press releases worth respecting?
I have long thought that it is not the duty of all Jews to support Israel. If they want to engage with the Jewish state and improve its international standing, so be it. If Jews want nothing to do with a state that has no direct impact on their daily lives, this position should be respected. If they want to become unofficial spokespeople for the Israeli cause, good for them.
Personally speaking, I may be a harsh critic of Israel's policies (and Palestinian intransigence) but I still call myself a true friend of Israel, the kind the country needs to survive in the long-term, not "yes-men" only concerned with even-greater military reprisals against the Palestinians. After decades of these failed policies, why do many Jews still think that the Jewish state can thrive through force alone?
In my experience, Diaspora Jewish communities regularly prefer to ignore the true reality of the now 40-year occupation and the myriad of ways in which their beloved homeland has persecuted another people for generations. Is this something Jews should really be proud of?
These Diaspora communities need to ask themselves some tough questions, namely how their complicity in the current morass can be reversed. It's never too late to expect an Israeli government of any political stripe to behave morally and legally and rediscover the true Jewish soul.

<title>An unlikely advocate</title>
<date>Sat Sep 01 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Robin Shepherd is not the first person to try and define the world's oldest hatred, but he is perhaps one of the most unlikely. The senior research fellow of the Chatham House center in London, has no significant connection to the Jewish people and his visit to Israel last week was only his second, his first being in 1989 as a student. But still he believes that his decision to spend a year researching the new European anti-Semitism is perfectly relevant for any serious observer of international affairs.
When asked on his interest in the subject, he prefers to answer first on a philosophical level by quoting the polemicist Christopher Hitchens who has said that "only a moral cretin thinks that anti-Semitism is a threat only to Jews." He then answers from an academic position "that the Israel-Palestine conflict is one of the key issues in international relations and there are very few people in this field without a position on it." His previous study was on the wave of anti-Americanism sweeping Europe and this lead him to believe that a new form of anti-Semitism was also at the root of the increasingly critical attitude towards Israel on the continent. 
Shepherd is only at the start of what he expects to be a year of research in the subject, culminating probably in a book, but he already has a number of basic insights. The first is a clear differentiation between the old and new types of European anti-Semites, or as terms it, "subjective" and "objective" anti-Semitism. 
"Subjective anti-Semites, basically hate Jews and therefore usually hate the Jewish state," he says.
There are people in Europe who are hostile to Jews, but it's only on the fringes, in the far-right and far-left. Interestingly, Shepherd notes that the old-style anti-Semitism is still fairly prevalent in the post-communist central and eastern Europe countries, but at the same time, there's much less anti-Zionism there as in western Europe. What in his opinion is "a much bigger problem is the objective, anti-Semitism, the hatred of the state of Israel. Since Israel is a Jewish state and if you use false analogies between Israel and Apartheid South Africa and Nazi Germany, you are comparing them with Jews and you are therefore engaged in anti-Semitism." That doesn't mean that everyone who uses the comparison is an actual anti-Semite says Shepherd, "that depends on how central it is for you. When it becomes an obsession, and this is one of the things you find increasingly in Europe, then at this point it becomes a new form of anti-Semitism."
This obsession is Shepherd?s answer to the standard response given by Israel's detractors in the West that "not every criticism of Israel is anti-Semitism. Of course one can criticize Israel, but there is a litmus test and that is when the critics begin using constant key references to South Africa and the Nazis, using terms such as "bantustans". None of these people of course will admit to being racist, but this kind of anti-Semitisim is a much more sophisticated form of racism and the kind of hate-filled rhetoric and imagery are on the same moral level as racism, so gross and distorted that they are defaming an entire people, since Israel is an essentially Jewish project."
To explain this distinction, he brings an example from another continent. "A lot of people will defend themselves by saying that their motivation is the cause of the Palestinians. Well if you wanted to express your disapproval of Robert Mugabe?s regime by highlighting his violation of human rights and the way he's destroying the country, then you could say your motivation is human rights, but if you expressed your objection with a cartoon of Mugabe as a gorilla jumping up and down on blood-soaked bananas, that kind of imagery of black people is pure racist. But it?s the kid of imagery being used against Israel." 
Shepherd studied Russian and East European studies at the University of London and did an advanced degree in political philosophy at the London School of Economics. After that he worked as a reporter for Reuters in London, Prague and Bratislava and was the Moscow Bureau Chief for the Times of London for a year and a half. In 2003 he left full-time journalism and worked for a number of research centers think-tanks as he wanted "to focus more on the analytical side? though he still writes occasional commentary and op-ed pieces for various newspapers. He defines his politics as "center-right on international affairs with very liberal social views." He attributes the rise of the new anti-Semitism to the crisis of the "old ideological left" in Western Europe.
"The main thrust is coming from the left wing of the old European Labor and Social-Democratic parties and of course from the surviving Communist, Trotskyite and Marxist parties. These are groups that might have a marginal place in wider society but there influence is focused in the trade unions which are boycotting Israel and the opinion-forming classes such as the media. The ideological left has been comprehensively defeated, and it knows it. That's why it has no positive campaign as it had in the past, like nationalization of the economy. In the absence of a positive program, it is about what they hate, the US, the global capitalist economy and the state of Israel, because Israel is the frontline to the only force that is challenging all that, is the Arab world. That is why despite the horribly reactionary attitude of the Islamic radicals towards women and gays, there is common cause "my enemy's enemy is my friend."
This feeling is largely absent in the former Communist countries. ?These groups are weak in Eastern Europe because they've thoroughly discredited. In Poland, for example, politicians do occasionally come out with anti-Semitic sayings but it doesn?t translate into anti-Zionism. These feelings are concentrated more in countries like Britain, Spain, parts of Belgium, Norway and Sweden. France and Germany are interesting countries, because the political classes are different generally different in this from the opinion forming classes, but it might be feeding through."
Another excuse often made by Israel's poisonous critics who say they are not anti-Semites, is that there also prominent Jews among their ranks. Shepherd says that this is one of the most interesting points that he plans to research. "I know there is a tendency to call them self-hating Jews but the key point is much more subtle. This is where you have to understand people like Noam Chomsky who is American but an iconic figure for the European left. He is not a self-hating Jew but his political standing in the left is more important for him than his Jewish identity. That's why the extreme Jewish critics of Israel almost always come from the far left, for them politics is the most important of their identity. They are in thrall with a system of thought that happens to have as one of its main objects of belief an obsessive hatred of Israel. It might be personally painful for them but the ideological left is a secular religion, more than any other political group, and for them this religion comes before being Jewish."

<title>Arrow, THAAD or both?</title>
<date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Update: Israel wants to increase the likelihood of the U.S. deploying emergency missile defense systems within Israeli territory. The heads of the Homa anti-missile project in the Defense Ministry asked the U.S. Department of Defense about two months ago for information on two advanced defense systems being developed in the U.S.: The ground-based Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, and a new model of the Aegis naval defense system. According to a Defense Ministry source, the request for information was aimed at promoting the possibility of an "operational link" between the Israeli and U.S. defense systems, as a continuation of an ongoing project. The Defense Ministry source said that development and manufacture of Arrow missiles will continue over the coming years. 
This is the second story on this subject, following the one I wrote about yesterday (both with Aluf Benn, reporting from Tel Aviv). Read it in full here
Arrow
I have an interesting piece of information in the print edition today (Aluf Benn helped me to get some of it in Israel). In recent months Israel and the United States have discussed the possibility of an Israel acquiring the American-made missile defense system THAAD, instead of developing a new generation of the indigenous Arrow defense missile. Israeli decision-makers will have to make up their minds in the coming year whether to commit to acquiring the American weapon system or invest in the development of a more advanced Arrow.
According to the sources we used, The United States will be able to provide Israel with THAAD missiles by 2009, at which time the maker of the system, Lockheed Martin, will have completed development and testing. However, the American missile system still suffers from a number of technological bugs that have not yet been resolved. 
Israel's dilemma is of course not just financial and revolves around both the costs of continuing the development of the Arrow system and issues of technological and operational independence. When Ehud Barak was chief of staff, he opposed the development of the Arrow and the creation of the "Homa" anti-ballistic defense system, arguing that the cost of independent development was too high and that it would be wiser to acquire THAAD. Prime minister Yitzhak Rabin decided otherwise, explaining that the Americans would only agree to transfer to Israel the advanced technologies included in THAAD if they are convinced that it can develop its own independent capabilities and compete with the American industry. These are the more important details, but if you feel the need to read more, you can go to the full item in the print edition

Evangelicals? support for Israel is a big enough issue for a long seminar, and is hotly debated among American Jews. My Guest this week
The real reasons American Jews fear conservative Evangelicals are political and social, not theological? many Jews still see evangelicals as dumb southern rednecks. There is a fair amount of snobbery and even (dare I say it) bigotry, in this stereotype.
Evangelicals are human. They may love Israel but it doesn't mean they love being mocked, denounced and generally despised by the /intellectual/political elite? If the American Jewish leadership wants to make enemies out of 70 million fellow citizens, attacking them publicly on every issue is a good way to start.
Liberal American Jews by and large have nothing against assimilation or intermarriage. They aren't concerned that fundamentalist Christians will marry their daughters; they are worried that they will defeat their candidates or upset the present cultural and social equilibrium.

<title>Ashrawi: Palestinians face one of most difficult phases in their history</title>
<date>Tue Oct 30 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
ATLANTA - The Palestinian people have plunged into a deep depression with unemployment and poverty at record levels, and peace with Israel is the only answer, longtime Palestinian lawmaker Hanan Ashrawi said Monday.
"Palestinians are experiencing one of the most difficult phases in our history," said Ashrawi, an elected member of the Palestinian Legislative Council and an active voice in the Mideast peace process.
"Now we see not just a political and economic battle but a battle over the soul of Palestine," she told an audience of about 200 gathered at Emory University. "We find ourselves in the grip of ... the deconstruction of Palestine."
"Nearly 75 percent of Palestinians living in Gaza are dependent on welfare and the territory's unemployment rate has skyrocketed to 50 percent," she said. Conditions have worsened in Gaza since the militant Islamic group Hamas seized control in June.
Ashrawi's lecture was part of a series of speeches on the Emory campus focusing on peace building in wartorn regions. One of the more controversial lectures was by former President Jimmy Carter, who spoke there about his much-criticized book, Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid.
The book was condemned by critics and Jewish groups for comparing Israeli actions in Palestine to the oppression of blacks under South Africa's apartheid regime.
Ashrawi praised Carter as a prophet and a man of conscience, and one of a dwindling number of people who still believe peace is possible in the Mideast.
She noted that peace talks must move forward as opposed to waiting for the violence to subside.
"You cannot hold peace hostage and say, 'Until every single Palestinian becomes peaceful, I'm not going to have talks,'" Ashrawi said. "You have to talk in order to bring about peace."

<title>Bush, the divider</title>
<date>Sun Feb 04 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Among the hundreds of anecdotes about U.S. deliberation on whether to support the partition plan for Palestine, on the eve of the 1947 United Nations vote, there are some that reveal more about the president than about the supporters of the emerging state. Harry S Truman wavered during those days between his basic sympathy for the vision of the Jewish state and his anger at the incessant pressure exerted upon him. Even after he had announced his decision to support partition, it was actually a letter of appreciation that he received from Claude Pepper, then a U.S. senator from Florida, that managed to rankle him: "While this matter was pending, I received about 35,000 pieces of mail and propaganda from the Jews in this country," a vexed Truman wrote in response to Pepper. "I put it all in a pile and struck a match to it." 
Robert J. Donovan, in his 1977 book "Conflict and Crisis," on Truman's first term in office, doubts the veracity of this story. He interviewed several members of the president's staff and they all agreed that the bonfire was only in Truman's imagination. In the end, Truman contained his anger, and the following spring, after Israel declared its statehood, he agreed to recognize it. A somewhat anti-Semitic comment here and there, and Truman's refusal to more actively support Israel after its establishment, did not make much difference. Among "the Jews," he had already taken his place in the golden book of chronicles. 
Among the presidents who succeeded him, there were ups and downs - both in their support for Israel and in the fondness of American Jewry for them. Professor Kenneth W. Stein, who resigned from the Jimmy Carter Center after the recent publication of the former president's book, "Palestine: Peace not Apartheid," noted in an article in the current issue of the Middle East Quarterly that the meager support Carter received from Jews in the 1980 elections was a consequence of Carter's "increased pressure on Jerusalem." Since 1920, there had been no Democratic candidate who received so few of their votes, Stein notes in a section of the article entitled "The Roots of Carter's Anger." 
The roots of most of American Jewry's anger toward the current president, George W. Bush, cannot be traced to Israel. They did not vote for him in the first place. His ongoing support for Israel may be recognized and appreciated by the establishment, Israeli and Jewish, but it does not receive due credit among a wide Jewish-American public that is liberal, Democratic, dovish and very angry at Bush for significant and various reasons. 
Much has been written in recent weeks about the decline in interest in Israel among American Jews, but the writers made scant mention, if they mentioned it at all, of American politics. They should have - because Bush, strange as it may sound, is one of the factors behind the widening of the gap between Jews in America and Israel. 
This is one of those bizarre anomalies that characterize the period: The Jews of Israel comprise perhaps the most sympathetic group toward Bush in the entire world. They are certainly more supportive than the general American public and may very well be more sympathetic than any particular group of Americans. On the other hand, American Jews constitute one of the least sympathetic groups. A vast majority of them oppose Bush. Indeed, many really loathe him. 
In a survey conducted by Professor Camil Fuchs for Haaretz last November, it turned out that the overwhelming majority of Jewish Israelis do not agree with the statement that Bush is "dangerous for the world" - as the majority of people in Western countries hold (not to speak of public opinion toward Bush in the Middle East). In a Haaretz survey taken before the presidential election two years ago, Bush was clearly preferred by Jewish Israelis over his rival, John Kerry. But the Jews of America voted en masse for Kerry. 
Some American Jews have a hard time digesting a reality in which an Israeli prime minister can stand at Bush's side and describe the war in Iraq as an achievement. In fact, it could be said that the Israelis' fondness for Bush actually serves to alienate these American Jews from Israel. It is a sort of purist self-indulgence that does not tolerate contradictions: Jews from Israel. If this is the type of leader Israelis respect, and this is the type of leader who is a fan of Israel, how, these Jews wonder, can they identify with Israel? 
And here as well develops a line of revisionist denial of the reality that nearly every average Israeli accepts: Bush is actually "bad for Israel," and only its short-sighted citizenry and leaders fail to realize this. It is ostensibly a positive line, because those who choose it are looking for a way to continue to support Israel. Actually, however, it is patronizing and dangerous, as it is basically an arrogant attempt to deny Israel an independent assessment of the correct path for itself. 
Here's the catch. Bill Clinton, the friendliest president until Bush, and Lyndon Johnson, the friendliest until Clinton, did not put the Jews to this type of test. These two presidents received their votes and advocated policies vis-a-vis Israel that were acceptable to most American Jews. In any case, Bush is also the first president for whose support Israel is paying a price, even if it is a hidden price, among other important supporters, the Jews of America. He is making it difficult for a certain Jewish public to understand Israel and is making it easier for them to distance themselves from Israel. Of course, it's not he who is the guilty party. In this test, it is only the Jews who are failing.

<title>Carter defends 'apartheid' book, says attacks on character hurt</title>
<date>Wed Jan 24 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter defended on Tuesday defended his controversial book on Israel's treatment of Palestinians, telling students at Brandeis University that his goal was to revive Middle East peace talks.
Carter also told students that rge attacks on his character following the release of his book had hurt him and his family.
Jewish groups have expressed outrage at "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid," arguing that its comparison of Israel's treatment of Palestinians with South Africa's reviled apartheid system of racial segregation could undermine perceptions of Israel's legitimacy.
Brandeis, in the Boston suburb of Waltham, is a secular university founded by American Jewish leaders, and about half of its 5,300 students are Jewish. The school is named after Louis Brandeis, the first Jew on the Supreme Court and a robust defender of the right to free speech. 
The former United States president, in his first direct address to Jewish Americans on his book, said the title referred to human rights in the Palestinian territories, not in Israel.
He said the word "apartheid" was intended to provoke debate on the rights of Palestinians, who he said were being treated unfairly by Israel.
He said he never asserted that Jewish money was controlling the U.S. media, as some critics have charged, but only that the pro-Israel lobby was strong.
"I've been hurt and so has my family by some of the reaction," Carter, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, told about 1,700 students at the university.
"I've been through political campaigns for state senator, governor and president, and I've been stigmatized and condemned by my political opponents. But this is the first time that I have ever been called a liar. And a bigot and an anti-Semite and a coward, and a plagiarist. This is hurtful," he said.
"I can take it," he added, joking that he could handle the attacks because as a former U.S. president he still had Secret Service protection.
Carter, 82, has been dogged by protests during a promotional tour. In the book, Carter traces the history of the Middle East from the 19th century to the present via the Camp David Accords in 1978, a year into his presidency.
He apologized for a passage that can be interpreted as supporting suicide bombings as a negotiating tactic, saying it was a "mistake" and would be removed from future editions.
But he said a full Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian territories was crucial for lasting peace.
The university originally invited Carter on the condition that he debate lawyer and Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a critic of the book.
But Carter said he would only visit the campus without conditions. He later accepted an invitation from a committee of students and faculty to speak without taking part in a debate. 
The event was tightly controlled and closed to the public, preventing Dershowitz, one of Carter's more scathing critics, from openly questioning him.
Dershowitz wanted to ask Carter why he had accepted money from Saudi Arabia and why the Carter Center, an Atlanta-based humanitarian organization, had criticized Israel while not looking into human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia.
Instead, a student asked those questions.
Carter responded in part by saying all donations were audited with Arab nations contributing a tiny fraction with most of the money going to humanitarian programs.
About 60 protesters, detractors and supporters, gathered outside, some holding Israeli or Palestinian signs and flags.
"We support what Jimmy Carter is saying," said Alan Meyers, 56, a Jewish doctor from Boston. "We feel that there is not enough attention being paid to dissenting Jewish voices in the United States."
Nearby, Israeli-American Gilend Ini, 29, handed out fliers identifying five portions of Carter's book that he said contained falsehoods. "We're trying to let the public know that much of what he said in his book was factually incorrect information."
In preparation for Carter's appearance, metal barricades were erected along the road leading to the athletic center, where Carter was to speak, and people entering the place had to go through a metal detector. 
But a few hours before the appearance, only about two dozen demonstrators showed up, and most were carrying signs with a pro-Palestinian view. Among them: "Closing our eyes to injustice is not a Jewish value" and "Support Jimmy Carter. End the occupation now." 
Carter's book has been criticized by some Jewish leaders as riddled with inaccuracies and distortions. Some have complained that it appears to equate South Africa's former apartheid system of racial segregation with Israeli treatment of the Palestinians. 
Fifteen questions were selected ahead of time from a list of least 120 by the committee that invited Carter, according to the university. 
"The whole idea was that everyone would benefit if there is a more focused way of getting questions to the president, not having 1,700 people raise their hands to ask questions," said university spokesman Dennis Nealon.
Critics were particularly frustrated that Dershowitz was not allowed to debate Carter. "It's puzzling because he said that he wants to have a discussion of his book and then refused to appear with Professor Dershowitz," said retired Brandeis history professor Morton Keller. 
Gordon Fellman, a sociology professor and a member of the committee that arranged the visit, said Dershowitz is neither a student nor faculty member at Brandeis and therefore "he can't get in - and it's not anti-Dershowitz.

<title>Carter defends book against allegations of anti-Israel slant  </title>
<date>Thu Jan 25 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
WALTHAM, Mass. - Jimmy Carter, whose latest book has been attacked as slanted against Israel, received two standing ovations Tuesday as he answered critics during a much-anticipated talk at the historically Jewish Brandeis University.  
The uproar over "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid" recently prompted 14 members of an advisory board at Carter's international-affairs think tank, the Carter Center, to resign in protest.  
Carter briefly addressed an audicence of 1700 students and faculty members, and responded to 15 questions selected in advance. "I can certainly see now it would provoke some harsh feelings," he said, referring to criticism of the book's title, which he said was a reference to human rights in the Palestinian territories, not in Israel. But, he added, "in the long run, it has precipitated discussion."  
About 60 peaceful demonstrators gathered, many carrying signs with a pro-Palestinian message. Among them: "Closing our eyes to injustice is not a Jewish value" and "Support Jimmy Carter. End the occupation now."  
Carter's book has been criticized by some Jewish leaders as riddled with inaccuracies and distortions. Some have also argued that its comparison of Israel's treatment of Palestinians with South Africa's reviled apartheid system of racial segregation could undermine perceptions of Israel's legitimacy.

<title>Carter to talk at Brandeis about his book </title>
<date>Wed Jan 24 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
WALTHAM, Mass. - Venturing into the lion's den, Jimmy Carter headed yesterday to Brandeis University, known as a Jewish college, to confront the furor over his new book on the Middle East, which has been attacked as slanted against Israel.  
The uproar has been going on for several months and recently prompted 14 members of an advisory board at the former president's international-affairs think tank, the Carter Center, to resign in protest over the book, "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid."  
A tightly controlled discussion was planned, with 15 questions selected in advance. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz had also hoped to debate Carter but was told he would not be allowed inside.  
Metal barricades were erected along the road leading to the athletic center, where Carter was to speak, and people entering the place had to go through a metal detector.  
But a few hours before the appearance, only about two dozen demonstrators showed up, and most were carrying signs with a pro-Palestinian view. Among them: "Closing our eyes to injustice is not a Jewish value" and "Support Jimmy Carter. End the occupation now."  
A smaller number of demonstrators passed out leaflets pointing out five portions of Carter's book that they say contained falsehoods.  
Brandeis, in the Boston suburb of Waltham, is a secular university founded by American Jewish leaders, and about half of its 5,300 students are Jewish. The school is named after Louis Brandeis, the first Jew on the Supreme Court and a robust defender of the right to free speech.

Carter's book has been criticized by some Jewish leaders as riddled with inaccuracies and distortions. Some have complained that it appears to equate South Africa's former apartheid system of racial segregation with Israeli treatment of the Palestinians.  
'Apartheid' does not apply to Israel 
Carter, who brokered the 1978 Camp David peace accord between Israel and Egypt and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, has said his use of "apartheid" did not apply to circumstances within Israel. The 15 questions were selected from a list of least 120 by the committee that invited Carter, according to the university.  
"The whole idea was that everyone would benefit if there is a more focused way of getting questions to the president, not having 1,700 people raise their hands to ask questions," said university spokesman Dennis Nealon.

<title>Coalition launched to combat boycott </title>
<date>Sun Jun 17 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
LONDON - "Bad for Britain, bad for academic freedom, bad for Palestinians, bad for peace," ads in British newspapers declared last week. Two leading Jewish-British institutions are behind the ads, which were the first step in a well-financed campaign against the decision to promote an academic boycott of Israeli academic institutions. Along with Israeli academic institutions, the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Israel's embassy in London and a number of private individuals like Alan Dershowitz, they comprise a coalition combating academic blacklisting in particular and the boycotting of Israel in general.  
The University and College Union's explosive decision two weeks ago to promote the boycott is now at the center of the loaded debate over Israel's image in Britain. All the major papers quickly denonced the move in their editorials. The Financial Times said it was "stupid"; the Guardian called it "bad and one-sided." Even the left-wing Independent said it was "unhelpful" and called on the UCU to reverse itself. British Prime Minister Tony Blair slammed the decision and dispatched his education minister, Bill Rammell, to Israel to demonstrate his government's opposition to the boycott. Academic organizations like the Russell Group, representing leading universities, joined the censures. American pro-Israel organizations are now trying to leverage this criticism to boost Israel's image.  
"What we have here is an opportunity to decide the battle for Israel's image through this poor decision on an academic boycott," said Lorna Fitzsimons, head of the Britain Israel Communications and Research Center, a six-year-old pro-Israel Jewish group.  
"When was the last time all the broadsheets in Britain, hundreds of academics and the entire political system came together to denounce an anti-Israel decision? We believe there is a chance to isolate the initiators of boycotts and change once and for all the attitude among the British left toward Israel," she added.  
Along with the Jewish Leadership Council, also working under the aegis of the Jewish community, Fitzsimons is leading the campaign to stop the boycott.  
The campaign's major goal is presenting the UCU decision to its 120,000-strong rank-and-file. The decision was made at the end of May at a meeting of UCU representatives. As part of the campaign, hundreds of British academics - many of them UCU members - signed a petition calling on UCU director Sally Hunt to bring the decision to a vote. However, a spokesperson for Hunt, who had previously pledged to bring the decision to a general vote, argues that the decision calls only for "debate on a boycott" and therefore she "cannot at this time call a vote."  
"The consequences of losing are unthinkable," Ronnie Fraser, head of the Academic Friends of Israel, says. Fraser's group has been fighting lecturers' associations boycott initiatives for the past three years. The Academic Friends of Israel is a signatory to the petition against the boycott, but Fraser believes the campaign's target is wrong. "You do not insist on a ballot if you have no control over the question being asked, and if you are not sure you can win, you don't ask the question," he wrote last week. Fraser believes the battle must be waged outside the UCU, where he says the anti-Israeli organizations have the upper hand, and must be moved to the universities themselves.  
Bar-Ilan University's International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom (IAB), which has been working against the expected decision to boycott Israeli academic institutions, is now focusing on long-term future action. "We are working with the Israeli government. For example, we are trying to revive the Israel-British research foundation," IAB manager Ofir Frankel said. The IAB "works with others to expand scientific cooperation substantially between Britain and Israel, trying to allocate the required resources and prove in the coming year that the boycott decision will lead to the opposite outcome ... the strengthening of scientific cooperation between the two countries."  
Frankel said the IAB rejects staging a boycott of Britain in response, since this would go against the principles of academic freedom. American attorney Alan Dershowitz, along with American academics, has threatened such a boycott, including legal action and cutting ties with those who vote for the anti-Israel boycott. "They will end up being the objects of the boycott because we will get tens of thousands. We will isolate them from the rest of the world. If the union goes ahead with this immoral petition, it will destroy British academia," Dershowitz told the Guardian.  
As matters now stand, the UCU must decide how to present and discuss the promotion of the academic boycott in its approximately 500 branches throughout the U.K. Fitzsimons says pressure currently is focused on persuading UCU members to demand the leadership put the issue to a vote. "If we win this battle, the implications will be enormous," she said.  
Correction 
The list of organizations that appeared under the headline "Supporters" ("Fighting the apartheid state," Haaretz, June 15) represents a partial list of organizations affiliated with the "Enough!" coalition, which campaigns to end the Israeli occupation, and not as published.  
Haaretz regrets that Friends of the Earth and other organizations were mistakenly represented as supporting the academic boycott against Israel and a single-state solution, and viewing Israel as an apartheid state.

<title>Fighting 'the apartheid state' </title>

LONDON - Britain's University and College Union's decision to promote a boycott against Israel two weeks ago did not just materialize out of thin air. In recent years, the U.K. has seen a multitude of organizations devoted to protesting Israel's presence in the territories, and the mass anti-Israeli rally last weekend in the center of London attracted thousands of participants.  
One of these groups, Jews for Boycotting Israeli Goods, opened a stand at the rally, calling for protesters to disrupt Israel's soccer match against England scheduled for Wembley Stadium on September 8. Next week, pro-Palestinian activists plan to call for a boycott against Israeli produce at a conference held by UNISON, Britain's biggest trade union.  
Another organization, the Islamic Council for Human Rights, handed out flyers listing international corporations with branches in Israel, such as McDonald's and Calvin Klein.  
Activists from the Palestine Solidarity Campaign handed out flyers calling for the British government to cease its weapons deals with Israel, under the banner "Palestinian blood on British hands."  
The anti-Israeli front in Britain is made up of dozens of nongovernmental organizations including Islamic movements, radical left associations, workers unions, Israeli and Jewish panels, Christian organizations and human rights committees, operating various charity funds.  
The activists at these groups may differ on issues such as religion and gender equality, but they are united in their perception of Israel as an apartheid state. They all advocate boycotting Israel and believe in diverting funds from it.  
The organizations subscribe to the belief that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must be resolved in the form of a single-state solution, and granting the Palestinian refugees the right of return. In the past year, this group of organizations has boasted several important accomplishments, first and foremost the UCU resolution.  
"We're on a roll. We're now receiving increasing sympathy for the Palestinian cause," Sue Blackwell told Haaretz Tuesday. Blackwell is a veteran activist who has been promoting boycotts against Israel for years at Birmingham University, where she works as an English lecturer. During the UCU's meeting in Bournemouth, she wore a T-shirt reading "Caterkiller," in protest against the company Caterpillar, which sells bulldozers to the Israeli Defense Forces.  
In the meeting, Blackwell argued that the European Union must sever all its ties with Israeli academic institutions. Her motion was passed with a large majority.  
"In 2003, when we first called for the Association of University Teachers [the AUT, which merged with the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education to form the UCU] to boycott Israel, only one-third of the members voted in favor. Union regulations prevented us from readdressing the issue in 2004, but we did in 2005, and then the motion was accepted," she says.  
That motion was later overturned in a special AUT meeting, until the UCU voted in favor of it last month. It passed 158 to 99.  
Blackwell describes herself as a pro-Palestinian lobbyist. She attributes the campaign's recent success to her cross-country activities. "The Palestine Solidarity Campaign invites me to speak at its conferences. I also attend other conferences of workers unions," she says.  
Blackwell is also a member of the British Committee for Universities of Palestine (BRICUP), the lobby for cooperation to support Palestinian universities, staff and students. The organization is headed by Hillary and Steven Rose, who started the boycott initiative five years ago with a letter to the Guardian daily newspaper.  
Other organizations target Israelis and Jews. "We tried working with the Israeli public in the past, but we did not manage to make any headway there," says Jeff Halper, who heads the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions in the U.K.  
"The Israelis as a whole believe there is no partner on the Palestinian side, and are thereby making themselves politically irrelevant. This is why we've had to address the civil society, represented by human rights groups, churches, universities and other organizations to warn against the Israeli apartheid regime," he says.  
"The recent success we have experienced in the field is serving to unite different left-wing organizations. Our activity will culminate in May 2008, as Israel celebrates its 60th birthday."  
This article is the first of a series. On Sunday, Haaretz will examine the backlash of efforts to boycott Israel in the U.K.

<title>First violin / Prelude to dialogue </title>
<date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
"I was shocked to see these walls, it's a new apartheid, barbaric behavior: How can you impose such a collective punishment and separate people? After all, we are all living on the same planet. It seems to me the world should have already learned from what happened in South Africa. And a country that hasn't learned should be boycotted, so that's why I don't perform in your country."  
This was the response offered this summer in an interview with Haaretz by internationally renowned British violinist Nigel Kennedy when asked why Israeli impresarios had yet to bring him here despite repeated attempts. Kennedy's comment hit on a facet infrequently discussed when debating the Israel boycott: The cultural boycott and, in particular, the musical boycott.  
The automatic responses of boycott opponents weren't long in coming. As usual, they had a hint of insult and victimization. Prominent among them was the accusation of anti-Semitism, a charge immediately leveled against any boycotter, whomever he may be (a review of Kennedy's life and the cultural wealth in it, including the Jewish element, raises serious doubts about the possibility of his being an anti-Semite).  
Targeting  the wrong audience 
Also apparent is mockery of the British hypocrisy (who pick on Israel, while in China and Sudan, for example, far greater crimes are perpetrated), as if the injustices happening there, and also those that Britain itself is still perpetrating, justify or cancel out the tragedy that Israel is inflicting on the Palestinians. As if hypocrisy is a crime in and of itself.  
An argument was made that, specifically, musicians and music lovers are the least appropriate target for a boycott because among them are leftists who oppose the occupation. But who among this community protested the destruction of musical instruments in Ramallah during Operation Protective Shield? Or the siege of Nablus that prevented a music teacher there from going to supplementary classes and purchasing instruments? And the humiliation of musicians at checkpoints, the detention and eventual deportation of a piano tuner at Ben-Gurion Airport; the restrictions on movement that led to the dismantling of the children's choir in Bethlehem; the bus of music students on the way to a summer camp whose path was blocked? The willful refusal to see such injustices among the musical community in Israel makes it no less responsible than any other.  
Whether or not to involve music in the boycott was debated: After all, music is inherently based on dialogue, inner expression and listening to others simultaneously. The fact that is also an abstract art, lacking words, ostensibly endows it with the power to bridge both sides, leading to cooperation and understanding between the parties. An Israeli violinist and a Syrian violinist sitting together in front of the same sheet of Beethoven in the Diwan East West Orchestra are having a dialogue. But, by definition, dialogue takes place between equals; it is hard to say Israeli and Palestinian sides are in equals in this situation.  
Classical musicians have engrained in them a kind of conservatism. They are an oppressed minority; therefore, their voice is silent in boycott matters. An exception is the English singer Emma Kirkby who, despite her courageous contacts with the Israeli music scene and the mutual love between her and the audience and musical institutions here, in 2000 announced a boycott "until the occupation ends."  
Other visiting musicians expressed discomfort with appearing in Israel but are less well-known for their refusal to play in Israel. Consequently, their political reasons will be less significant. Who cares and how will their boycott contribute to the end of the occupation, if they are simply replaced by others and their protest is not heard?  
Therefore, these musicians, and primarily the famous among them, such as Kennedy and Kirkby, can seemingly use a more effective method: Instead of boycotting and then being forgotten, they can actually come and talk. They can make their visit contingent on a performing in the Palestinian areas as well: in concerts, master classes, workshops or lectures and thereby give voice, publicly and privately, to the issues. Awareness will trickle down to the Israeli public, that Palestinians, like us, love classical music and hold a Mozart festival and contemporary music workshops. That they, too, have conservatories and youth orchestras and chamber music series. And that they, too, can fill a concert hall with a festive audience for a symphony orchestra concert.  
Mandated parity 
Israelis are still shocked when they hear that musicians are playing the violin in Jenin or that Ramallah has a youth symphony orchestra. What better way to get it to sink in than by declaring that every musician visiting Israel will perform there also?  
This will create a dialogue between impresarios and institutions on both sides about exchanges of musicians among them. The increased number of performances is likely to reduce the funding burden on each institution.  
In this way, many musicians will also be exposed to the problems in the region and perhaps also develop an independent opinion on them. And Palestinians will develop new contacts, expand the international community's support for them and enjoy an increased number of international performers who come to Israel. Here is a situation in which grassroots organizers have a chance to influence the decision makers above them.  
"It is not in the Palestinians' interest to welcome pilgrimages by musicians to Israel just because we will perhaps benefit," a Palestinian artist, one of the leaders of the boycott against Israel, said in response. According to him, "this is local treatment of the problem, and that is not how it will be resolved. The cost the Israelis pay for the occupation must be raised by widening the boycott, and, at the same time, an original and independent relationship of our own with the international community must be created, not through or via Israel.  
"I'm not interested in Sting performing in Ramallah because it was a condition for performing in Israel, but because that is what he chose to do, of his own free will and out of an authentic and joint initiative with us. You will have to resolve via another means the distortion by which you see us as half-humans."

<title>FM to U.K. counterpart: Israel views boycott calls with severity</title>
<date>Fri Jun 01 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni on Friday conveyed to her British counterpart Margaret Beckett the severity with which Israel views the intentions of a British lecturers union to boycott Israel's academic institutions. 
In a telephone conversation between the two, Livni told her colleague that the British University and College Union's (UCU) boycott plans are in utter conflict with the good relations maintained by Israel and Britain. 
Early next week Livni plans to convene a special discussion of the union's boycott calls, which will include representatives from both the government and the academe. 
On Thursday, British Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education Bill Rammell criticized his country's lecturers union for boycotting Israeli academe, saying the decision "does nothing to promote the Middle East peace process."
"The U.K. government fully supports academic freedom and is firmly against any academic boycotts of Israel or Israeli academics," said. "Whilst I appreciate the independence of the UCU, I am very disappointed that the union has decided to pass a motion which encourages its members to consider boycotting Israeli academics and education institutions."
The vote was passed by 158 votes to 99 at UCU conference in Bournemouth on Wednesday.
Professor Uriel Reichman, President of the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, said Thursday night that the British boycott is "a modern reformulation of Judenreine" a German expression used by the Nazis meaning "Jew free," describing areas they had emptied of a Jewish presence.
The professor called on Anglo-Jewry to send their children to learn in Israel "instead of sending them to institutions where there exists one-sided preaching for the elimination of the Jewish State."
Reichman made these comments at a ceremony for graduates of the college.
Cabinet minister Yitzhak Herzog, responsible for the government's handling of issues related to anti-Semitism, denounced Thursday as "scandalous, discriminatory and one-sided" a British lecturers' union decision.
Herzog has spoken with British Ambassador to Israel Tom Phillips to convey Israel's condemnation of the move. 
It is especially troubling, Herzog told Israel Radio, that "the decision was taken in a nation which is considered friendly to Israel."
The decision "necessitates soul-searching on that part of all citizens of Britain," he said. 
The motion passed Wednesday says that the UCU will present the question of a boycott on Israel's academics for discussion by all its members. According to the motion, congress much send "the full text of the Palestinian boycott call to all branches for information and discussion."
Among the amendments added to the proposal and approved by the union was a clause pledging the group to campaign for "a moratorium on research and cultural collaborations with Israel via EU and European Science Foundation funding until Israel abides by UN resolutions."
The discussions are scheduled to take place over the next 12 months. The motion encouraged union members to "consider the moral implications of conducting ties with Israeli academic institutions." 
The vote was preceded by a heated discussion in which Israel was repeatedly referred to as an apartheid state, engaging in crimes against humanity in the Palestinian territories. The union representatives said the situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip did not allow spectators to stand idly by. 
As part of the motion, the congress will disseminate Palestinian trade unions' request for a boycott against Israel in all the union's offices. 
The congress also said it would arrange for academics from the Palestinian Authority to attend delegations to the U.K. The union's representatives also decided to establish direct contact with Palestinian workers' organizations. 
Ronnie Fraser, who heads the British group "Academic Friends of Israel," said that "the vote proved that nothing has changed within the ranks of the U.K.'s academic unions. This is another boycott." 
In 2005, Fraser acted to overturn another boycott against Israel, which had been approved by the Association of University Teachers (AUT.) That decision was overturned a month after it was passed. In 2006, the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) also moved to boycott Israel, but its decision became invalid shortly thereafter when NATFHE and AUT merged to form the UCU. 
After the vote, the head of the UCU, Sally Hunt, reiterated her opposition to the motion. 
'As I have made clear in the past, and as I reiterated on the floor of congress this morning, I do not believe a boycott is supported by the majority of UCU members, nor do I believe that members see it is a priority for the union," she said in a statement on the UCU Web site. 
She said, however, that the 120,000 members of the union would now have a chance to express their opinions on a boycott, a move that she said she supported. 
"Today's motion... means all branches now have a responsibility to consulate all of their members on the issue and I believe that every member should have the opportunity to have their say. The earlier motion means that any future calls for a boycott must pass key tests before a boycott can implemented."
Israeli Ambassador to the United Kingdon Zvi Hefetz called the resolution offensive to the British Jewish community, saying that, "Its slanted phrasing reeks of ignorance." 
Adrian Fronda, a senior mathematics lecturer who had joined the union solely to vote against the boycott, was less diplomatic. "I came here to oppose the prevalent anti-Semitism we see all around us here," he said. 
Education Minister Yuli Tamir condemned the union's decision, saying she would address British Education Secretary Alan Johnson on the matter.

<title>For art or money </title>

Israel will host its first ever Biennale for Contemporary Art in Herzliya this September. This will be one of the world's 348 biennales and triennales this year. While the Herzliya municipality will measure its success based on the number of visitors, the art world will look at the museum curators and directors, journalists, art critics, art dealers, collectors and gallery owners - all the professionals invited to the pre-opening event.  
Such a crowd came to the Documente in Kassel, Germany - one of the most important art events in the world - about two months ago. Every evening of the week before the official opening, a large party was held for these professionals. Everyone came, and almost everyone knew almost everyone - the renowned curator, the director of the prestigious museum, the famous collector. The art community comes together from the four corners of the globe for these pre-event events, and disperses immediately afterward. Far from a footnote to the main occasion, this is actually the real thing.  
"I came first of all to see what is going on, which new artists have joined the scene; to try to make connections and meet other professional viewers," says Nira Itzhaki of the Chelouche Gallery. "This is one of my job's important and decisive meeting places. I find out who has switched to which gallery and who is going to curate what. At the last Venice Biennale, I met the person who is directing the next Basel art fair, and he asked me a lot of questions about Israeli art."  
In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in the number of biennales, fairs and giant exhibitions - every city seems to have its own event. For example, this April, fairs were held in Brussels, Cologne and Dusseldorf. In June there was the Venice Biennale, the fair in Basel, the Documente in Kassel and the sculpture exhibition in Munster, Germany. In September there will be four new biennales - in Lyon, France and three cities in the Middle East: Istanbul, Athens and Herzliya. The Art Forum Berlin, the Freize Art Fair in London and Art Basel in Miami will also open that month.  
The success of Far Eastern artists in the western art market has increased the number of events in Asia. Last October there were four biennales there: two in South Korea, one in Shanghai and one in Japan. Next month, art fairs will open in Hong Kong and Tokyo, and a new one will be held in Shanghai. One can expect that each fair will be accompanied by smaller, similar fairs that initially present themselves as alternative events, but later become regulars in the club.  
A great many of these tagalong events take place in cities or countries near the main event. The timing is no accident; they are designed to offer art travelers an itinerary. If someone goes to the Venice Biennale, he will undoubtedly also visit Basel, and from there, it would be a shame to miss the Documente Kassel and the sculpture exhibition in Munster. Such itineraries were offered to guests at the Asian biennales, and will be drafted for two biennales in the Middle East. Herzliya apparently will not be included in the current round.  
Giant art malls 
At first glance, mega-exhibitions such as the Venice Biennale and the Documente seem to be in a different category from the giant fairs. In fact, they both serve the very rich, whether openly or under the surface.  
The fairs are commercial events held for a relatively short period of time, and they charge galleries registration fees. One could describe them as giant shopping malls accompanied by lots of parties and exclusive evenings, and opportunities to meet celebrities and see the latest fashions. They offer no intimacy, and certainly no time for close examination. The artwork is presented as nothing more than a commodity.  
Like the giant exhibitions, these fairs are an integral part of the art market's transformation into a global gallery.  
"Today it doesn't matter where you have your gallery," says Sergio Edelsztein, director of the Center for Contemporary Art in Tel Aviv. "You can sell anywhere in the world, from fair to fair. This is very important, particularly for us [in peripheral locations], as we used to be stuck on the sidelines. The fairs provide a venue for unmediated relations between dealers and collectors, gallery owners and museum directors. When you're at a fair, you're with everyone."  
Jerry Saltz, the Village Voice art critic, called art fairs "perfect storms of money, marketability, and instant gratification-tent-city casinos where art is shipped in and parked for five days-everybody plays: artists, dealers and buyers."  
Saltz wrote that even though the gallerists claim to hate art fairs, they keep returning just to maintain their standard of living, visibility and sales levels. He described how the fairs have created a new category of buyers:  
"Now, there are collectors and there are buyers. Collectors go to galleries and cultivate relationships with dealers and artists. They look, deliberate and buy in private, often acquiring works from various periods of an artist's career. Buyers are the opposite: They tend to buy only in public, acquire impulsively, and usually buy only one work by an artist. They rarely cultivate relationships with dealers or artists, and according to numerous gallerists, buyers never set foot in their galleries."  
The fairs try to gain some importance in terms of content, too. Many hold panel discussions or one-day seminars with the best lecturers and guests (no shortage of money there). First, however, the fairs are commercial events. Booths cost $10,000 to $50,000, depending on size and location.  
"The fair admissions committees are really tough," says Irit Zomer of the Zomer Gallery, "they accept participants based on specific projects. Sometimes they also review the offerings. Then I have to justify my selection. Even after you are admitted to the fair, they check whether your booth matches the original proposal and every night photograph the booths, to check if the artwork has been changed."  
The giant exhibitions, unlike the fairs, are supposed to offer an artistic and political agenda. Their preparation takes much longer and they are managed very selectively, based on the tastes of the curator or curators. Like the fairs, the have become part of the global market, and may be what made the market global.  
For example, Chinese art broke into the international market after curator Harold Szeemann displayed Chinese works at the Venice Biennale in 1999 and 2001. That biennale, says Itzhaki, is a prime example of a quality exhibition blurring into a commercial event.  
"A group of Chinese collectors exploited their economic power," says Itzhaki, "and used their money to gain entry for a group of Chinese artists. Ever since, Chinese art has been a hit. The commercial mechanism is more evident at the fairs; at the biennales, it is under the surface. Ultimately, everything is connected to power. Above all, those exhibitions are a game between curators, gallerists, collectors, art critics and museum owners. After them come the viewers, who do not participate in the game at all."  
Force of tourism 
To whom do the viewers matter? Mainly the tourism industry of the host city or country, which may invest 20 million euros in a giant exhibition. This is how much was spent on the Documente (partially provided by commercial bodies).  
"Tourism is one of the main driving forces behind the fairs and the big exhibitions," says Edelsztein. "Even though Venice has tourists year round, the biennale brings the more affluent. Right now Kassel is full of tourists from all of Germany and beyond. In another three months, the city will go back to being dull and gray."  
In addition to attracting tourists, however, the exhibitions are also a political tool. The Documente Kassel was inaugurated in 1955 in order to help West Germany regain its cultural status after World War Two. At that time, this event also served the United States, which invested in the exhibition in response to the KGB's support for culture in East Germany.  
"The bodies behind these events are the establishments, and sometimes they have interests beyond tourism," adds Edelsztein. "Take South Africa, for example. The first thing they did after the end of apartheid was the Johannesburg biennale. Some of the local biennales that have cropped up in Africa recently are funded by private individuals. The only problem is that a biennale requires long-term consistency and commitment. This is usually what also brings down these exhibitions."  
How does all this affect the art? The giant displays clearly have changed how we view art.  
"I always feel distressed before traveling to such events," says curator Sarit Shapira. "I know that I will have to see a ton of stuff, and that I will not be seeing it properly. The mega-events require snapshot viewing, like watching commercials. Even so, there is a good way to look at them. They offer a richer, more abundant expanse than ever before, and the viewer can wander and choose what to see and where he wants to interact."  
The giant exhibitions have helped develop products that were less commercial, such as photography and video installations, and have created a new way of life.  
"A large share of the exhibitions are based on works created specifically for them," says Edelsztein. "The artist comes, spends a while there, and then moves on. This has created a breed of artists with no studio or base, who drift between exhibitions, projects and grants."  
This roving group has a lesser presence at the fairs, which naturally have fewer video works and more marketable items. The desire to sell creates incessant pressure on artists to supply works, says Itzhaki.  
"It sends the whole system spinning. The galleries are afraid they will have nothing to display, the collectors put pressure on the galleries, and all this affects the artists, too."  
What does it do to them?  
"Some of them become production lines for fairs."  
Does this affect their work?  
"The importance of works created for fairs is purely commercial."  
Susan Landau, a senior curator at the Israel Museum (this year she curated the Israeli pavilion at the Venice Biennale), feels the era of the huge events must end. This prompted her to resign from the committee for the Israeli Biennale in Tel Aviv, which has been postponed from this year until next year. Her resignation was influenced by, among other things, the big discrepancy between the curators' statements and the works she saw at Documente.  
"This could not be the result of five years' work," she says. "This is an exhibition that came out against the commercialization of art, but the curators did not have any problem using a 20 million euro budget. They made no attempt to connect between works, everything seemed neutral, as if it had nothing to say, and I thought to myself, either there has to be some innovativeness here, or one has to stop, to understand what it means. In the end, I realized that maybe we don't need such exhibitions, that we essentially have come to the end of the era of big exhibitions, which have become an empty vessel, devoid of content. I believe there is a lot to say in art, but not via globe-spanning exhibitions.

<title>France is falling in love with Israel </title>
<date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
LONDON - Over a decade after the Israeli right in effect abandoned the vision of a Greater Israel, the radical left in both Israel and Britain has come to favor the idea - with a few essential changes.  
On Sunday, London saw the conclusion of a conference on the so-called one-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While pro-Israel groups accused the organizers of staging a provocation aimed at bashing Israel's image, academics from Israel and the Palestinian Authority discussed possible models for the formation of a single state ranging from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River - and maybe even further east.  
The conference, which attracted many academics as well as local activists from Palestinian solidarity groups, students and Arab activists, was perhaps the latest stage in a series of projects that have given London its image as one of Europe's most anti-Zionist capitals.  
Indeed, the British left's attitude toward Israel has been characterized by warrants for the arrest of Israel Defense Forces officers, boycotts of Israeli products on the part of various trade unions, condemnations of Israel as an apartheid state by churches, and the recent academic boycott initiative.  
The latest two-day event, at the University of London's School of Oriental And African Studies (SOAS), attracted no less than 300 people. The participants discussed establishing either a binational state or a "state of all its citizens" - i.e. a secular democracy - that would include the entire population of the Palestinian Authority plus all the Palestinian refugees. They also entertained the notion of an Israeli-Palestinian confederation and other creative solutions.  
Among the notable guests were Palestinian civil rights activist Omar Barghouti, Israeli historian Ilan Pappe and one of the instigators of the academic boycott, Professor Haim Bereshit. The panel members discussed the status of Palestinians and Israelis in the would-be unified state, relying on historic precedents like South Africa and Northern Ireland.  
The conference was organized by the London One State Group - an association of about a dozen Israeli, Palestinian and Jewish students who are studying or have studied in London. The funding, they say, came from ticket sales.  
Along with the lofty talk about political theory, visitors could hear radical views on Israel, which was regularly described as "a colonialist power" and "an apartheid state." In the small conference hall, Zionism was not only a dirty word, but an immoral, inexcusably cruel utterance. "I don't believe the Jewish lie," one Arab representative said.  
Yonni Eshpar, a young graphic designer from Tel Aviv who was among the conference's initiators, said that he put the event together because "Israel is a discriminatory and racist country and I am interested in seeing to my children's future." The group's main goal, Eshpar said, was to initiate a discussion of the one-state issue.  
Explaining why he wanted to include residents of the Palestinian Authority in his proposed "state of all its citizens," Eshpar said: "They are the citizens of this land. They were there before us. Besides, the nation-state system has concluded its historical role all over the world, from Singapore through Denmark to Israel."  
Pro-Israel groups say that this initiative should not be taken seriously. "Our internal polls have shown that the majority of British people support the Balfour Declaration and the existence of the Jewish state," said Lorna Fitzsimons, CEO of the pro-Israeli organization BICOM, the Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre.  
According to Fitzsimons, the one-state initiative - which has recently become somewhat trendy in academic circles - should not be associated with the academic boycott of Israeli educational institutions.  
"How do you propose to deal with the crimes the Israelis are perpetrating in the Occupied Territories?" a female Palestinian student asked panel members at the end of the conference's first day. "Should Israeli military commanders be put on trial for war crimes? Should truth and reconciliation committees be set up?"  
It was then that an Israeli student remarked: "Excuse me, but you sound just like the far right in Israel. Are the Israelis not entitled to self-determination? Do Israelis only understand force? This kind of discussion hampers progress, because it fails to recognize the other side."

<title>Germans worried over growing denial of Israel's right to exist </title>
<date>Mon Mar 12 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
BERLIN - The state of Israel is facing two strategic threats: an Iranian nuclear bomb and the denial of its right to exist. During a week in which German bishops compared Israel's actions in the territories with the deeds of the Nazis and an international survey determined that Germans have the lowest opinion of Israel in Europe, it is difficult to say which option is more frightening.  
That, at least, is the picture that emerged from the annual European-Israel Dialogue held in Berlin this weekend, whose participants included Chancellor Angela Merkel, leading academics and several Israeli diplomats and officials.  
The growing delegitimization of Israel in recent years was raised in every session of the conference, organized by the Axel Springer Foundation. This year in particular, Merkel said at the opening session, in light of the threats emanating from Iran, it is important to emphasize that Germany supports Israel and that protecting Israel's right to exist will continue to stand at the center of Germany's foreign policy. "I regret that I am forced to reiterate this repeatedly," the chancellor added.  
As a recent example of a statement undermining Israel's right to exist, speakers at the conference referred to the remarks made by German bishops during a visit to the Palestinian Authority, following a visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem.  
"In the morning, we see the photos of the inhuman Warsaw Ghetto, and this evening we travel to the ghetto in Ramallah; that makes you angry," Bishop Gregor Maria Hanke of Eichstatt told Sueddeutsche Zeitung.  
In a conversation with Haaretz, former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer called Hanke's remarks "scandalous," adding, "personally, I was angry that no denunciations were voiced from within Germany."  
The President of Tel Aviv University, Itamar Rabinovich, said at the conference that since according to the German Bishops, Israel's right to exist derives from the Holocaust, "the fact that the State of Israel is now behaving 'like the Nazi regime' undermines its right to exist."  
However, it appears that the parallel drawn by the bishops, which was repudiated in a letter sent by the leader of Germany's Catholic Church to the board of Yad Vashem, represents the view held by a significant portion of Germans. According to a poll carried out in January by the Bertelsmann Foundation, 30 percent of German residents agree that Israel is doing to the Palestinians "what the Nazis did to the Jews in the Third Reich." A recent poll carried out for the BBC World Service ranked Israel (together with Iran) as the country with the most negative influence on the world. The vast Germany ranked highest among all European countries polled for its negative views of Israel, with 77 percent of respondents reporting "mainly negative" views of Israel.  
Some conference attendees said these figures join articles in leading newspapers describing Israel as an "apartheid" state, economic boycotts against the country by churches and labor unions and the academic boycott by European universities in the trend toward questioning Israel's moral right to exist.  
"I am amazed anew each time at the fact that the question of Israel's right to exist is still a matter for discussion," the Jewish-German author and journalist Henryk Broder told Haaretz. "What more needs to happen for Israel to be accepted as a state, 60 years after its founding?"  
The former head of the Mossad, Ephraim Halevy, believes the legitimacy issue is rooted in Israeli academia. "The source of the problem lies in Israel," Halevy told Haaretz. "The central figures in the debate are in Israeli academia and the issue must be solved within Israel by means of academic confrontation with the 'deniers.'"

<title>Good Ackerman, bad Ackerman</title>
<date>Thu Nov 08 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
There are people in Jerusalem who have not yet forgotten the criticism leveled at Prime Minister Ehud Olmert by Gary Ackerman, a United States congressman from New York and head of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia. He "kissed President Bush's ass," said the representative, in language that was not quite diplomatic, commenting to The Forward about Olmert's criticism of the new Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, after her visit with Syrian President Bashar Assad in Damascus last April. Olmert managed to annoy senior members of the Democratic Party several times in the past year − not only in his confrontation with Pelosi, a Democrat, but also in his declarations of support for George W. Bush's Iraq policy.
Ackerman's slaps at Olmert might have led one to suspect that the 64-year-old, 12-term congressman misses Ariel Sharon, Olmert's predecessor. And perhaps he really does miss Sharon a little, but the criticism that he levels today against Sharon's most dramatic decision − the withdrawal from Gaza − is harsh. It was, he says, "a mistake."
But you supported this move
"True," admits Ackerman, but he reminds me that there he didn't have many alternatives. As an American legislator, nobody consulted with him. The decision was presented as a fait accompli, and it seemed better to support it and to hope that the move would succeed than to express meaningless and useless opposition. In general, though, Ackerman says he feels that unilateral moves are not wise. Israel left Gaza without having anyone to whom it could hand over the keys.
So is that the problem, that they didn't give Gaza to Abu Mazen? Would that have worked?
No, he says, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has to date not proven an ability to receive keys and to turn them in the lock as well. Therefore, this opposition was not available to Sharon.
So if there is nobody to give it to, and unilateral withdrawal is a mistake, what should have been done?
"Under those circumstances," states the legislator, "it would have been preferable to continue the status quo." In other words, a continued Israeli presence in Gaza. 
And Ackerman hastens to explain that this is not "stating a position regarding the settlements." He does not think that Israel should have remained in Gaza forever, only for the time being, until there was someone to whom it could "transfer responsibility."
Repeatedly, Ackerman refers to the need for a "dash of political realism," during a long conversation he had with Haaretz in his Capitol Hill office last week, shortly before he embarked on another lightning visit to the Middle East.
Ackerman, who represents New York's Fifth Congressional District, which takes in parts of Long Island and Queens, was a teacher in the New York City school system before entering politics (he served five years in the New York State Senate before being elected to the U.S. House for the first time, in 1983). 
Ackerman's keyboard has worked overtime in recent weeks. His new pen pal: Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. In an October 19 letter he sent her concerning the peace conference planned for Annapolis, Maryland, at the end of this month, Ackerman and a Republican colleague from Louisiana, Charles Boustany ?(who is of Lebanese heritage?), declared, "We believe the meeting in November could mark an important turning point" − and also recommended forceful steps to strengthen the Palestinian Authority and its leader. The letter was welcomed by dovish Jewish organizations like Peace Now and the Israel Policy Forum. We can "all learn from the example" of these legislators, said Debra DeLee, president and CEO of Americans for Peace Now ?(APN?). Afterwards the establishment AIPAC ?(the American Israel Public Affairs Committee?) also joined the supporters of the letter. Ackerman, with his typical political savvy, had managed to appeal to the tastes of many groups.
In reality, the U.S.-sponsored meeting in Annapolis, the one that "could mark an important turning point," is making Ackerman squirm in his seat. As in the case of the mistake of withdrawing from Gaza, here too he hastens to mention that "this was not my decision." The facts were determined by others. "The moment a meeting has been announced, I don't want it to fail."
But was the decision to convene a conference the right decision? 
Ackerman doesn't say it wasn't, but neither does he say it was. But what he is clear about is his belief that "there was not enough preparation." And also: "What if there's a party and nobody comes?" and furthermore: "The idea was too amorphous, very problematic in my opinion." And even: "You have to do homework before the exam."Ackerman fears for another failure. Like the failure of the withdrawal from Gaza, for which Israel is to blame; like the "tremendous failure" of the elections for the Palestinian parliament two years ago, for which he blames the United States. It was President Bush, he says, who "forced his supposedly best friend" − namely, Ariel Sharon − "to agree to Hamas participation in the elections." The consequences are well known.
Ackerman walks a thin line when he talks about the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. On the one hand, the Jewish Ackerman has an unreserved love for Israel and is wary of backing steps that could endanger its welfare; on the other, he has a political need to align himself with the party ethos that sees the attempt to achieve an agreement as a crucial need. Added to these are his reluctance as a Democrat to show support for a step, any step, taken by the Bush administration, along with the understanding that the administration is in fact now trying to accomplish something positive. He will closely monitor the limits of the discussion, when it is clear to everyone that there is a side that he supports in this story, or as he put it, "I have a dog in this fight."
In late October, Ackerman and several of his colleagues, also Jewish legislators, met with former president Jimmy Carter, who came to the Hill to try and find a common language with them, after the major uproar engendered by his book "Palestine: Peace, Not Apartheid." Ackerman says his presence at the meeting was intended, not to reconcile with Carter, but to explain to him what he thinks of his views and his book. Among other things, Carter was told during the discussion that he had "lost the ability to present himself as someone who cares about Israel." Participants describe the off-the-record dialogue as "tough," "unpleasant," "bitter."
Fears for the region"I now fear for the stability of the region more than ever in the past," says Ackerman. His conclusion: We have to exploit the opportunity that Rice is trying to create. "You can claim that we have to wait for a Palestinian messiah, and that this is not the ideal time − but time is not on our side because politics move fast. The longer we wait the worse the outlook." Therefore − we have to act, and now. "To close the best deal possible." That's the reason for urging Rice to support a program for the rehabilitation and building of the PA. "To [make the Palestinians] decide now between Fatah and Hamas." In other words − denying vital support to Fatah today will bring Hamas to the West Bank and perhaps even further tomorrow.
But there is also another side to the coin. Ackerman looks at Mahmoud Abbas and does not see a genuine leader who is capable of bringing about change. He says that he doesn't want to give money to the PA "without a specific goal" and without close supervision to insure that that goal has been achieved. Rice, he says, has to "insist" that the PA demonstrate that it is doing something "real" with the money that the American taxpayer transfers to it. "We'll give to you only if you provide the goods, sounds less supportive and more conditional."
So that the letter he co-signed is in effect an expression of his two personae: - the "good Ackerman" and the "bad Ackerman." Apparently those who supported him chose to read into it what suits them, no less than what the legislator intends to say.
The arrows of Ackerman's criticism are directed at the administration and at the PA, but most of all at the "Arab world," which he says caused Bill Clinton to fail when it did not give Yasser Arafat the necessary push at Camp David in 2000. That is what Rice says about the Arabs, and what Ackerman says as well. Therefore he doesn't understand how a conference that was intended to have Arab participation could have been announced without the host, the United States, knowing in advance what "the Arabs are willing to give." We must have "expectations of them," he says. Recently he himself met with the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., and complained that his country had stopped sending money to the PA since the collapse of the Mecca agreement of last February between Fatah and Hamas.
And as noted, Ackerman is trying to adhere to the line being promoted by his party − a line that calls for greater American involvement in the peace process − but occasionally he presents a relatively hawkish stance. For example, in a second letter to the secretary of state, from October 24, he discussed the crisis in Lebanon and recommended upgrading the economic and political sanctions against Syria. The same Syria that led him to criticize Olmert, after Jerusalem criticized the visit there by Speaker Nancy Pelosi last spring.
Ackerman looks at the ongoing unrest and instability in Lebanon, on the eve of the decision to appoint a new president, and finds no reasons for complacency. "I said to the administration, you think that losing Gaza is problematic? Try losing Lebanon!" Like most of his Democratic colleagues, he will call for "dialogue" with Syria, but when he says it, it sounds like a very tough dialogue indeed.
Lebanon, he says, has a chance of being a "reasonable player" in the Middle Eastern arena, but in order to make that possible there is need for an American and international effort, details of which he spells out in the letter to Rice. Apply strong pressure, impose sanctions, all in order to avoid having to choose between appeasement and war. He suggests the same recipe for dealing with Iran. The failure in Iraq, he accuses the Bush administration, is what caused this problem to grow to its present dimensions. "We did not succeed in teaching the region a lesson," he asserts.
Wherever Ackerman looks in the region he sees a problem, which he chooses to illustrate with the help of a horrifying example. We, he says, are like people on the top floors of the World Trade Center on 9/11. We have to decide quickly what to do: To stay? To try to go downstairs? To wait for the rescue forces? "Not deciding is also a decision," he reminds us.

Fears for the region
"I now fear for the stability of the region more than ever in the past," says Ackerman. His conclusion: We have to exploit the opportunity that Rice is trying to create. "You can claim that we have to wait for a Palestinian messiah, and that this is not the ideal time - but time is not on our side because politics move fast. The longer we wait the worse the outlook." 
Therefore - we have to act, and now. "To close the best deal possible." That's the reason for urging Rice to support a program for the rehabilitation and building of the PA. "To [make the Palestinians] decide now between Fatah and Hamas." In other words - denying vital support to Fatah today will bring Hamas to the West Bank and perhaps even further tomorrow. 
But there is also another side to the coin. Ackerman looks at Mahmoud Abbas and does not see a genuine leader who is capable of bringing about change. He says that he doesn't want to give money to the PA "without a specific goal" and without close supervision to insure that the goal has been achieved. Rice, he says, has to "insist" that the PA demonstrate that it is doing something "real" with American taxpayers' money. "We'll give to you only if you provide the goods, sounds less supportive and more conditional." 
The letter he co-signed is in effect an expression of his two personae - the "good Ackerman" and the "bad Ackerman." Apparently those who supported him chose to read into it what suits them, no less than what the legislator intends to say. 
Ackerman's criticism is directed at the administration and at the PA, but most of all at the "Arab world," which he says caused Bill Clinton to fail when it did not give Yasser Arafat the necessary push at Camp David in 2000. That is what Rice says about the Arabs, and what Ackerman says as well. Therefore he doesn't understand how a conference that was intended to have Arab participation could have been announced without the host, the United States, knowing in advance what "the Arabs are willing to give." Recently he himself met with the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., and complained that the diplomat's country had stopped sending money to the PA since the collapse of the Mecca agreement of last February between Fatah and Hamas. 
Though Ackerman is trying to adhere to the line being promoted by his party - which calls for greater American involvement in the peace process - occasionally he presents a relatively hawkish stance. For example, in a second letter to the secretary of state, from October 24, he discussed the crisis in Lebanon and recommended upgrading the economic and political sanctions against Syria. The same Syria that led him to criticize Olmert, after Jerusalem criticized the visit there by Speaker Nancy Pelosi last spring. 
Ackerman looks at the ongoing unrest and instability in Lebanon, and finds no reasons for complacency. "I said to the administration, you think that losing Gaza is problematic? Try losing Lebanon!" Like most of his Democratic colleagues, he will call for "dialogue" with Syria, but when he says it, it sounds like a very tough dialogue indeed. 
Wherever Ackerman looks in the region he sees a problem, which he chooses to illustrate with the help of a horrifying example. We, he says, are like people on the top floors of the World Trade Center on 9/11. We have to decide quickly what to do: To stay? To try to go downstairs? To wait for the rescue forces? "Not deciding is also a decision," he reminds us.

<title>Gov't defends decision to curb power supply to Gaza Strip</title>
<date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
In a letter to the High Court of Justice, State Prosecution on Friday defended the government's decision to curb the supply of fuel and electricity to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, claiming it is not a form of collective punishment.
State prosecution argued the measure was appropriate considering that the area is controlled by an organization that calls for the destruction of the State of Israel and is used as a base for militants who launch regular rocket attacks against its civilian population. 
"Any measure taken by one state that has negative consequences on the economy of another will also hurt the citizens of that state," State Prosecution wrote. "In such instances, one can claim that any measure made within the context of an armed conflict is a form of collective punishment of the civilians of that state; a mistaken and absurd argument that counters international law and common practice."
"According to such an incorrect argument, imposing a financial boycott or pressure on countries such as South Africa during the Apartheid, or Iran today, would not be possible because any such measure would hurt the populace of the said country," it added.
Human rights organizations petitioned the High Court demanding it prohibits Israel from carrying out its decision to cut power supplies to Gaza. Groups claimed such action would hurt innocent civilians.

<title>Guardian editor condemns U.K. journalists' boycott of Israel </title>
<date>Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
The editor of the London Guardian yesterday condemned as "misguided" a resolution passed by a British journalists' union last week that called for a boycott of Israeli goods.  
"The Guardian disapproves of these kinds of boycotts and does not think they serve a useful purpose. It was a misguided motion," editor of the British daily Alan Rusbridger told Haaretz by telephone last night.  
On Friday, at its annual meeting, the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) in the UK voted for a boycott of Israeli goods in protest of last year's Lebanon war and Israeli "aggression" in the territories.   
The vote, which carried 66 to 54, read: "This ADM [annual delegate meeting] calls for a boycott of Israeli goods similar to those boycotts in the struggles against apartheid South Africa led by trade unions and the TUC [Trades Union Congress] to demand sanctions to be imposed on Israel by the British government," according to reports in the British press. It followed an earlier motion, which was passed by a larger majority, condemning the "savage, pre-planned attack on Lebanon by Israel" last year and the "slaughter of civilians by Israeli troops in Gaza and the IDF's continued attacks inside Lebanon following the defeat of its army by Hezbollah."  
The union has a membership of nearly 40,000 British journalists, who work in all the leading media outlets in the UK.  
"My guess is that the majority of working journalists would feel very uneasy and hostile to the motion which was published in their names," one senior British journalist told Haaretz. "It's just an embarrassment for us all," said another.  
Members of the Foreign Press Association (FPA) in Israel discussed yesterday at their annual general meeting whether to submit a formal response to the NUJ, said the organization's chairman Simon McGregor-Wood, of ABC News, who is British. "The resolutions seem to go against some of the core ethics of journalism that we are here to protect, such as balance and objectivity. I don't think any representative body of journalists should be taking a side," he said.  
Much of yesterday's FPA meeting was devoted to discussing further demonstrations to protest the kidnapping of BBC correspondent Alan Johnston, thought to have been forced from his Gaza apartment by masked men on March 12.  
It is not the first time the NUJ has made political moves likely to be out of sync with its membership. In 1986 its delegate conference sent a "telegram of condolence" to Colonel Muammar Gadhafi after the U.S. bombing of Libya, a book about the 100-year-old union recalls.  
The British journalists' union boycott follows a short-lived academic boycott a year ago by Britain's university lecturers' union, which was overturned four days after it passed. The Church of England synod has also called for disinvestment from Israel.  
Zvi Heifetz, Israel's ambassador in London, commented on the NUJ motion to Haaretz: "It is a shame that an organization that represents journalists threatens to boycott goods from Israel only one day after worrying rumors surfaced about the fate of one of the union's own members. The timing of this move is also peculiar in light of the recent bi-weekly meetings between PM Olmert and President Abbas and the attempts made by the Arab world and Israel to revive the peace process, based on the Saudi initiative."  
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said: "We obviously view such activity negatively, but I wouldn't overstate the significance of this event."

<title>Guardian editor condemns U.K. journalists' call to boycott Israel</title>

The editor of the London Guardian on Tuesday condemned as "misguided" a resolution passed by a British journalists' union last week that called for a boycott of Israeli goods. 
"The Guardian disapproves of these kinds of boycotts and does not think they serve a useful purpose. It was a misguided motion," editor of the British daily Alan Rusbridger told Haaretz by telephone last night. 
U.K. Foreign Office Minister Kim Howells also criticized the decision. "I was disappointed to hear that on 13 April 2007 the National Union of Journalists (NJU) voted to boycott goods from Israel," he said. 
"The government believes that, as a friend of both Israel and the Palestinians, we can best exert influence by encouraging both sides to take the steps needed for progress toward peace through close engagement," he added.

<title>Hamas calls off Palestinian census in Gaza due to rivalry with Fatah</title>
<date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Gaza's Hamas rulers on Sunday ordered census workers to halt the first Palestinian population count in a decade, derailing a rare joint endeavor with the rival Fatah movement.
Hamas had agreed to cooperate with the census, which is being conducted by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' rival government in the West Bank. But Hamas officials on Sunday shut down the Gaza census office, saying the surveyors had violated an agreement to share their data with Hamas.
"Data can't just be given to one side and not the other, said Mohammed Madhoun," an official in Gaza's Hamas government. "The government wants to make use of it for its future projects."
Demographics play a central role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Many Israeli demographers believe the Palestinian population, combined with Israel's own Arab minority, could soon outnumber the Jewish population in the region.
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has argued that creation of a Palestinian state is necessary because of the demographic issue. Last week, he said Israel could one day face a struggle resembling apartheid-era South Africa
Palestinians had said they hoped the first census since 1997 would help them in future peace talks with Israel.
The census at first had escaped the rivalry between Hamas and Fatah because of their common interest in the count.
Two earlier phases, collecting data on institutions and residences, were completed without interruption on Nov. 15. The final stage, counting people, began Saturday in the West Bank, but not in Gaza, and is expected to take two weeks. Hamas radio and mosques even called for people to cooperate with the surveyors.
Hamas took control of Gaza by force in June, prompting Abbas to expel the Islamic group from the Palestinian government and install his own Cabinet in the West Bank. There has been little contact between them since then.
Loai Shabana, head of the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, accused Hamas of ruining what was meant to be an apolitical effort.
"This is blatant and unjustified interference that sabotages a professional endeavor, Shabana, who is appointed by the president," said from his West Bank office. He added that the data is off limits to all political factions until it is complete.
"No lawmaker or government official can get a peak at our records. This would...undermine our credibility," he said. "I wish they let national interest prevail, and not let temporary problems between Hamas and Fatah ruin a strategic project."
The census will cost $8.6 million, with the Palestinian Authority paying 20 percent. The rest comes from the United Nations, Saudi Arabia, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the Netherlands and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Some 5,000 Palestinians were working on the project, including 2,000 in Gaza.

<title>High Court delays ruling on JNF land sales to non-Jews</title>
<date>Mon Sep 24 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
The High Court of Justice on Monday delayed its ruling on whether the Jewish National Fund should be obligated to sell its land to non-Jews by at least four months, in order to give the JNF time to reach an agreement with the Attorney General. 
The JNF asked the court to delay the ruling, after JNF and Israel Lands Association representatives agreed last Thursday to temporarily implement a proposal by Attorney General Menachem Mazuz that JNF lands be marketed to any potential customer, without discrimination based on ethnicity.
In exchange, any time JNF land is sold to a non-Jew, the ILA will compensate it with other land, thereby ensuring that the overall amount of Jewish-owned land in Israel remains the same. 
According to the state's response to the High Court petition, which was signed by the head of the Justice Ministry's High Court department, Osnat Mandel, the new arrangement will be in effect for three months. 
The brief asked the court to postpone the hearing during this time, which the JNF and the ILA will use to discuss ways for the JNF to preserve its original goals while obeying the law.
The JNF has long insisted that its lands be sold only to Jews, due to the fact that the land was purchased with money from Jewish donors for the purpose of settling Jews in the Land of Israel.
This "tactical retreat" reportedly stems from the JNF's concern that the High Court will issue a precedent-setting ruling in response to a 2004 petition filed by Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel.
Adalah rejected the JNF's declaration on Monday, saying it would appeal it in court. 
Adalah Director Hassan Jabareen said the JNF has had enough time in the 3 years since his organization submitted the petition to reach a conclusive, long-term decision, rather than offer a temporary 3-month arrangement.
He called the JNF declaration a "manipulative move aimed at buying time." 
"JNF controls 13 percent of the land in Israel, and under this plan only Jewish communities could be built on it. This is a typical form of apartheid," Jabareen said.
Adalah petitioned the court on behalf of Arab citizens who were refused permission to bid on an Israel Lands Administration (ILA) tender for residential housing lots in Carmiel. The potential purchasers were told that the land belonged to the JNF, and was therefore intended only for Jewish use. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel and several Arab rights organizations supported the petition. 
The JNF's position was dealt a blow in 2005, when Mazuz ruled that the policy was discriminatory and he would not defend it in the High Court. Mazuz reiterated this stance to the High Court four months ago. 
Several public figures, including Nobel Prize laureate Robert (Israel) Aumann and former Israel Defense Forces chief of staff Moshe Ya'alon, were to join the petition Monday morning as respondents, arguing that the JNF has a responsibility to its contributors to reserve the lands it purchased with their money for Jews only. 
The brief filed by the state makes it clear that the JNF has not changed its original position, whereby "rights to the land it owns should not be awarded to those who are not Jewish," but the ILA, operating on the attorney general's instructions, recognizes its obligation to market lands, including those of the JNF, without discrimination. 
Nevertheless, the JNF has been persuaded to give in for the moment out of concern that the court might issue a ruling undermining the JNF's policy, similar to its precedent-setting ruling in 2000 in favor of Adel Kaadan, an Israeli Arab who successfully petitioned the court for the right to build a home in the Jewish community of Katzir. 
The JNF holds approximately 2.6 million dunams (some 650,000 acres) of land in Israel, which constitutes 13 percent of all state lands. 
The response to the High Court indicates that the JNF and the ILA view an exchange of lands as a long-term solution and are looking for a mutually acceptable way to apply it on a large scale. In the past, however, Arab organizations opposed this solution, arguing that it preserves a situation in which large amounts of land in Israel are not available for use by all of its citizens.

<title>IDF lifts ban on Israelis transporting Palestinians</title>
<date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Israel Defense Forces GOC Central Command Yair Naveh yesterday canceled a ban prohibiting Israelis from taking Palestinian passengers in their vehicles within the West Bank.  
Naveh issued the order a few months ago to prevent Israeli citizens from picking up illegal workers or potential suicide bombers from the occupied territories, and driving them to Israel.  
The order, which was due to take effect in January, was never put into practice and was finally withdrawn due to a petition filed by civil rights groups with the High Court of Justice.   
In their petition, the groups claimed the ban constituted an "apartheid measure" because it institutionalized racial separation.  
"Such was the situation in South Africa during the apartheid, and such it was in the American South until the 1960s. There are some things one does not do," they wrote.  
Shin Bet security service and military probes of suicide bombings in recent years show that in a not-insignificant number of these attacks, terrorists were transported with the help of Israeli Arabs, who had license plates allowing them to pass through West Bank checkpoints without thorough inspection.

A veteran of nearly 40 years of political activity at the state, local and national levels, Ira Forman has served since January 1996 as the Executive Director of the National Jewish Democratic Council
NJDC strives "to educate American Jews across the country about the differences between their political candidates on issues of concern to them - focusing on protecting reproductive rights, the separation of church and state and a strong US-Israel relationship". 
Forman also serves as the Research Director of The Solomon Project
In 2001 the Solomon Project released the book "Jews in American Politics: A Sourcebook"
We will discuss Jewish involvement in American politics. Readers can send questions to rosnersdomain@haaretz.co.il
Dear Mr. Forman,
Based on your experience, can you please tell me what in your opinionare the issues that Jewish voters will be most concerned about? Is itbasically the same as the rest of the population (and I'm not justtalking about Israel but about other issues as well).
Thank you for an insightful exchange.
Hannah
Dear Hannah,
This is a very good question. Jewish Americans care about the same set of issues as other Americans except - for where they differ.  Let me explain.
During a time of war Americans are concerned about the war.  During recessions Americans care about the economy and jobs.  The list of issues that voters say are most important will change depending on the country?s current circumstance,s and Jewish voters are no exception to this rule.
In 2004 a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that the top two issues for Americans were "the War in Iraq" and "Terrorism and Homeland Security."  In 2007 the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that the top two issues were "the War in Iraq" and "Health Care."  This increased interest in health care is almost certainly reflected in increased interest by Jewish Americans in health care.
Yet Jewish Americans are also very distinctive in their views. The average American voter is pro-Israel. Jews, however, are more supportive of Israel than the rest of the country. Though most Jewish voters don't pick Israel as one of their "top" issues, a very significant percentage of them will not vote for a candidate who is anti-Israel.  
In general Jewish voters look like other voters with high levels of education - though probably a bit more liberal. In 2005 the American Jewish Committee released a survey that highlighted the distinctiveness of Jewish Americans - demographically and attitudinally (See it here
In 2008 both the Democratic and the Republican nominee for president will state their support for Israel. Therefore, most Jewish Americans will vote for candidates based on a set of issues that mirror the concerns of other Americans. These Jewish voters, however, will approach many of these other issues from a more liberal perspective than the average non-Jewish voter. 
Mr. Forman,
You ignore some facts. Opinion polls highlight the widening chasm between the parties. A study by the Pew Research Center found that 68 percent of Republicans sympathize more with Israel than with the Palestinians, compared to just 45 percent of Democrats. Similarly, a Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll found that Republicans favored alignment with Israel over neutrality - 64 percent to 29 percent. By contrast, 39 percent of Democrats supported alignment with Israel, while 54 percent favored neutrality.
Are these two parties really supportive to the same extent?
Eli CorenTel Aviv
Dear Eli,
Thanks for your question.
I was not trying to "ignore" this polling data. Shmuel gives his guests a word limit and it's very difficult to fully cover all aspects of this topic within these limits.
There are many ways to measure support for a strong U.S.-Israel relationship.  Public opinion surveys are one measure.  
Polls over the last few years vary over the degree of support for Israel among Republicans, Independents and Democrats.  Most recent polls show Republican voters are more supportive than Independents and Democrats.  Most of this difference is accounted for by the overwhelming support given to Israel by Evangelical Christians - among Independents and Democrats there is a much larger percentage that are undecided/don't know. But even the polls that portray the Democrats in the worst light also show that Democrats support Israel over the Palestinians by a 4-1 or 5-1 margin.  This is hardly the profile of an anti-Israel party.
Another measure of support is how the parties vote in Congress.  The most important vote year after year is support for the foreign aid bill in Congress.  Israel and Egypt are the largest recipients of U.S. foreign aid.  This last month 164 (out of about 200) House Republicans voted against the foreign aid appropriations bill.  For the first time in recent memory the Republican leadership recommend a "no" vote on this bill - 161 Republicans actually voted to cut Israel?s aid by $24 million.  Almost no Democrats voted against this bill or for cuts in Israel's aid.
Another way to measure support for the U.S.-Israel relationship is to review which members of Congress support resolutions. Last year a resolution in the U.S. Senate called upon the European Union to declare Hezbollah a terrorist organization.  All but ten Senators signed onto this resolution.  Eight of the ten Senators who withheld their signatures were Republicans.
I can provide numerous example of where Democrats were more supportive of Israel.  But none of these examples prove that the GOP is anti-Israel -  or even less pro-Israel than the Democrats.  What it does show that sometimes one side makes a "mistake" and sometimes there are a handful of dissenters on both sides of the aisle.
This entire debate over which party is more supportive is unproductive.  In the United States both major parties are overwhelmingly supportive of Israel.  Democrats and Republicans fight like cats and dogs over a wide range of issues.  We should celebrate the bi-partisan consensus on Israel.
Dear Mr. Forman,
Don't you think all this talk of yours will invite more anti-Semitism? Why do we need so many Jewish legislators? It's too many for our own good.
Thank you for responding,
Debbie, New York
Dear Debbie,
I understand your concern.  I worry that a discussion of the honorable role American Jews play in public life will "provoke" the people who hate Jews.  Unfortunately, the anti-Semites of the world will decide to spread their poison whether we talk honestly about Jewish involvement in civic life or whether we remain silent.  
The best weapon we have against anti-Semitism is a healthy democracy. The best method we have to promote a healthy democracy is public involvement.  As President Jefferson said "the price of freedom is eternal vigilance." 
We should be proud of the large number of American Jews who are involved in politics and chose to serve their country through public service.  We should encourage our friends and neighbors to take an interest in public service. We should encourage other minority groups (including Muslim Americans) to become more involved in bettering our communities through public service.  
I don't believe it's a question of whether we have too many or too few Jewish legislators. The better question is over the quality of our legislators - whether they are Jews or non-Jews.
We can't stop extremists from concocting conspiracy theories about Jewish power. We can only tell the truth about how Jews, like other Americans, involve themselves in politics for many honorable reasons. We can only combat the haters by working to build a better America for all our citizens.
Dear Ira,
One thing you didn't address in your reply is the nature of Jewish influence with the Democratic Party. My previous guest, with which you said you do not agree, argued that they are taken for granted - meaning less influential.
How do you asses the "Jewish influence"?
Rosner
Dear Shmuel,
Jewish Americans play an influential role in both parties.  However, Democrats are much more dependent on Jewish votes and Jewish political activism than Republicans.  For example, there are 43 Jewish Americans who serve in the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate and all but three of them caucus with the Democratic party.  Jews are a necessary part of any majority coalition Democrats put together - in both congressional and presidential elections.
Jewish Americans participate in all aspects of American politics to a degree which may be unequaled by any other minority group in America.  Jews register and turn out to vote in very high numbers. Jews represent only about two percent of the population but they run for elected office in much higher numbers. A significant proportion of the most prominent political journalists are Jewish.  Jewish Americans provide both parties (especially Democrats) a disproportionate share of their campaign contributions. I can state from personal experience that Democratic party leaders deeply appreciate this level of Jewish activism on behalf of their candidates.
Anti-Semites may use the above description of Jewish political activism to paint a distorted picture of Jewish domination of U.S. politics - a picture that comes right out of the Protocols. The reality, of course, is very complex and very different
Prior to the last half of the twentieth century Jews were not particularly active in American politics. Even when Jews began to vote heavily Democratic in the early 1920s they remained underrepresented among the political elites of both parties.
At the same time that Jews began to participate in greater numbers in American politics they also began to organize for specific causes. In the 1960s Jewish individuals and organizations were disproportionately active in the civil rights movement. In the 1970s and 1980s parts of the community focused on the support for Israel. This ability to organize effectively and focus narrowly gave Jewish Americans greater influence on a few narrow areas of public policy.
Today, however, just because individual Jews have become politically active does not mean that these individuals are involved in the political process for the same reasons. The Jews among America?s opinion leaders are a diverse lot.  Relatively few of them could be considered part of the so-called Israel lobby. Only truly anti-Israel policies? the kind that characterize some European foreign policies?unite most of these diverse activists around a common agenda.
Within the Democratic Party individual Jewish Americans are active in a number of public policy agendas? health care reform, Darfur, separation of church and state, education policy, reproductive rights, civil rights, foreign policy, etc. The party's leadership does not see these agendas as particularly "Jewish" issues.  However, one of the reasons the party is engaged in an issue like Darfur is because there are so many Jewish political activists who are passionate about this issue.
Party leaders view Israel as a Jewish issue but because of the pro-Israel sentiment within the larger electorate they also view support for Israel as a popular issue. This is why Democrats are out front on issues as diverse as foreign aid, sanctions on Iran and opposition to Hamas and Hezbollah. Moreover, when Jimmy Carter strays from this pro-Israel consensus and compares Israeli policies to apartheid he is criticized by a diverse set of Democrats?from Bill Clinton to Nancy Pelosi to Congressman John Conyers. 
Jewish Americans wield significant influence within the Democratic Party. The pro-Israel policies of the party are partially due to this influence and partially due to the larger public opinion environment in the United States.
Dear Ira, 
I'll start with you where I started with my previous guest, Gabriel Schoenfeld of Commentary. Here's what he wrote last week: "Jewish influence inside the Democratic Party has always been large and remains large today. But by the logic of electoral politics, when any one voting segment is believed to be in the pocket of a given party, that party can to some degree afford to ignore the interests of that segment. This has increasingly been the case with Jewish voters and the Democratic Party. The trend is clearly discernible in the way in which the party has tolerated the emergence of a distinctly anti-Israel caucus within its ranks." 
My assumption is that you do not agree with him, but I want you to explain why. 
Best 
Rosner
Dear Shmuel, 
You are correct.  I strongly disagree with your previous guest's arguments. 
Because American Jews usually vote for the Democratic party it does not follow that Jews are "in the pocket" of the Democratic party.  This is a very simplistic model of American politics and it bears little relationship with today's reality.   
Some frustrated conservative political pundits have decried the stupidity of American Jewish voting - "the masses are asses" theory of American politics.  However, I agree with the late political scientist, V.O. Key, who argued that American voters are very skilled in recognizing which party supports their interests.  
In 2007 American Jews support the Democratic party and its candidates because on a range of issues Democrats reflect the positions of the vast majority of Jews.  Support for Israel is only one among many issues that are important for American Jews.  However, a Democratic candidate who is considered antagonistic towards Israel will lose a considerable percentage of the Jewish vote. 
The exit polls support this "rational voter" theory.  Between 1972 and 1988 Republican presidential candidates captured a sizeable percentage of the Jewish vote - between 30-39%. During this period the Democratic party was criticized for veering too far to the left.  After capturing nearly 70% of the Jewish vote in 1976, Jimmy Carter barely bested (45%-39%) Ronald Reagan in 1980.  Significant numbers of Jews turned against Carter over his criticism of Israel as well as his handling of Iran hostages and the economy. 
It is only since 1992 that the GOP share of the Jewish vote has decreased to between 11-22%. What happened in 1992?  President George W. Bush had opposed loan guarantees for Israel. In addition, the 1992 GOP primary season and convention highlighted the growing power of the religious right within the party.  Moreover, Jews, like other Americans, were concerned with the sluggish economy. In 2006, in the wake of Iraq and a host of other Bush Administration failures, the GOP Jewish vote for Congress plummeted to 12%.  
In recent years some individual Republicans candidates have captured a significant proportion of the Jewish vote. Almost always these candidates have been moderates. Given this history, Democrats understand they can't be complacent about Jewish political behavior. 
Another argument advanced by your previous guest is that the Democrats are tolerating "the emergence of a distinctly anti-Israel caucus" within their party and that the rise of Muslim American political power encourages this development.  However, by nearly any measure - votes on foreign aid, resolutions, public statements - both the Democratic and the Republican parties are equally supportive of a strong U.S.-Israel relationship.   
There are a few exceptions to this rule. Democrats have Jimmy Carter and Jim Moran. Republicans have their votes against foreign aid, Ron Paul and Darrell Issa. The Democratic leadership, Bill Clinton, Howard Dean, and Nancy Pelosi, far from tolerating an anti-Israel caucus, have criticized former President Carter for his statements on Israel.  Republicans with their 11th commandment (thou shall not criticize a fellow Republican) are more reluctant to go after their "bad apples." 
This bipartisan pro-Israel consensus is based partially on the power of Jewish American activism.  But the most important foundation for this consensus is the overwhelmingly pro-Israel attitudes among American voters.  This consensus supports Israel's right to exit as a Jewish state within secure borders and  supports a peace process based on a two-state solution (even if many Americans, Jewish and non-Jews, are doubtful that the Palestinians are ready for such a peace).  
The most significant difference between the two parties is that there is a minority faction within the GOP (which does not include the Bush Administration) which opposes a two-state solution and "land for peace."  Yet, conservative opinion leader Bill Kristol and one of the most senior Republicans on House Foreign Affairs, Dan Burton, have asserted there is no difference between the two parties when it comes to support for the U.S.-Israel relationship. 
The Muslim American population is growing.  However, it is still considerably smaller than the Jewish population.  No serious analyst has argued that the diverse Muslim American community, which is largely politically unorganized, poses a threat to the pro-Israel consensus anytime in the foreseeable future.

<title>Israeli Arab group proposes new 'multi-cultural' constitution</title>
<date>Wed Feb 28 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
A proposed constitution written by the Israeli Arab advocacy center, Adalah, states that Arab Knesset members will be able to bring about the disqualification of bills that impinge on the rights of Arabs, and classifies the State of Israel as a "bilingual and multicultural" country rather than a Jewish state.
The proposal, entitled "The Democratic Constitution," also calls for majority and minority groups to split control of the government in such a way that will strengthen the Arab minority on issues relating to the character of the state.
Adalah's version of the constitution essentially abolishes the Jewish elements of Israel, but allows the Jewish majority to maintain its character through educational and cultural institutions. The proposal invalidates the Law of Return, which grants automatic citizenship to people with at least one Jewish grandparent, and states that citizenship will be granted to those who come to Israel for humanitarian reasons, regardless of their religion. 
The document states that the "internal refugees" Arab residents and their descendants expelled in 1948 and whose number is estimated at about a quarter of today's Israeli Arab citizens will return to the area where they used to live and receive compensation. The introduction to the proposed constitution demands that Israel recognize its responsibility for the "historical injustices that it caused the Palestinian nation in its entirety," withdraw from the territories and recognize the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. The proposal sets the state's borders along the 1967 cease-fire lines.
The proposed constitution grants citizenship to all descendants of Israeli citizens, whether they were born here or abroad, as well as to all spouses of Israeli citizens thereby undermining Israeli efforts to limit marriages between Israeli Arabs and Palestinians living in the territories. 
Instead of dealing with the issue of who is a Jew, says Adalah, the proposal deals with the issue of who is a citizen.
Adalah's constitution is the first one proposed by an Arab institution, though there have been many proposed by various Jewish ones. Adalah chairman Prof. Marwan Dwairy said the other proposals are not based on democratic values.
"They relate to Arab citizens like foreigners in this homeland, in which history, memory and collective rights are the legacy of Jews alone," he wrote.
Adalah hopes that its proposal will spur public discourse on the legal and cultural standing of Israeli Arabs.
"If this 'Democratic Constitution' succeeds in highlighting the large gaps that exist between it and the other proposals, and generates dialogue and topical public discussion on the nature of the freedoms and rights in the this country, we will see it as an important step," wrote Dwairy.
According to the proposed constitution, all assets of the Waqf (the Muslim religious trust) that were expropriated after 1948 and all assets seized by the state from Arabs will be returned to their original owners, who will also receive compensation for the period of expropriation. The state must also immediately recognize all unrecognized Arab villages, the proposal states.
The document does not state what the symbols of the country should be, but says that they will be determined either by a Knesset committee, half of whose members will be Arab, or by agreement of 75 percent of Arab MKs. 
All official publications, court rulings and media reports will be in both Hebrew and Arabic, according to Adalah. The proposal states that every cultural group, whether religious or ethnic, will be able to run their own institutions, and that national minorities can choose their own representative body, at the state's expense.
The proposed constitution grants the judicial system the authority to overturn any laws that contradict the constitution.
Adalah says that many of its sections are based on international declarations of human rights, and has consulted with legal experts from around the world, including some who were involved in South Africa's changeover from an apartheid state to a democratic one.

<title>Israeli Arab human rights group unrolls 'Democratic Constitution' </title>

<title>KC Johnson</title>
<date>Sun Nov 18 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
KC Johnson is a professor of history at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Graduate Center. For the 2007-2008 academic year, he is Fulbright Distinguished Chair in the Humanities at Tel Aviv University. Educated at Harvard University, he has authored several books on Congress and U.S. foreign policy (More bio here
An early critic of the prosecution's conduct in the Duke Lacrosse case, Johnson published a highly regarded blog on the issue, Durham Wonderland
We will discuss issues related to academia, the U.S. and Israel. Readers can send questions to rosnersdomain@haaretz.co.il
Dear Prof.,
The last question will be about Congress and foreign policy. You wrote a book about Congress' role in the cold war, I want to ask you about the role of congress in Iraq today, and maybe Iran tomorrow. How big a role will it play / should it play / in devising American policy in the middle east? 
Best and happy thanksgiving,
Rosner
Broadly speaking, the Constitution gives three types of foreign policy powers to the Congress: the power to declare war; the Senate's power to approve treaties; and the appropriations power.
During the Cold War (1947-1989), the first two of these powers weakened. From the Korean War onwards, presidents argued that the commander-in-chief power gave them authority to send troops abroad without congressional approval. And executive agreements, unilaterally made by presidents, gradually replaced treaties.
So the power of the purse - spending bills - became the most significant way for Congress to influence foreign policy. Beginning in the 1960s, Congress started attaching policy riders first to foreign aid bills and then to defense spending measures. That's how Congress ultimately mandated the withdrawal from Cambodia in 1970; similar bills cut off funding for the U.S. covert operation in Angola (1975-1976) and restricted covert operations in Nicaragua in the 1980s.
So, it's not that surprising to see Congress, especially now that the Democrats have the majority, using defense spending bills to try to accelerate the withdrawal from Iraq.
That said, there are several practical obstacles to a congressionally mandated withdrawal.
First, the balance of power in the current Congress lies with moderate or conservative Democrats - people like Claire McCaskill (Missouri) in the Senate or Heath Shuler (North Carolina) in the House. They've made clear that they oppose immediate withdrawal from Iraq. Democrats seem likely to gain seats in the 2008 elections, but until then, the narrowness of the Democratic majority means that the party leadership needs the votes of people like McCaskill or Shuler to prevail.
Second, attaching policy riders to defense spending bills when troops are in the field exposes supporters to (unfair) charges that they're "playing politics" with the troops' well-being. And there's no guarantee of success even if such an amendment were passed, especially with a president like Bush, who has been very aggressive at bypassing congressional will.
Third, at least two of the leading Democratic candidates (Obama and Clinton) have implied they don't support an immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops. It's unlikely that congressional Democrats will want to adopt legislation that would put them at odds with the party's presidential nominee.
As a result, while Congress has the tools to force a pullout?and precedent exists for such an action - it's doubtful we'll see any move in this direction, at least until after the 2008 elections.
Dear Prof.,
Moving on to a totally different topic, I want to ask you about a US President with which you've been dealing a lot: Lyndon Johnson.
Way back, in a dialogue I had with the Israeli Prof. Abraham Ben-Tzvi
Best
Rosner
I'd agree with that assessment - in part because Johnson operated in a much different strategic, regional, and political environment than either Clinton or Bush.
In the 1950s, Dwight Eisenhower seemed to look upon Israel as (at best) an inconvenience in his efforts to construct an alliance of anti-communist Arab states. He consistently spurned Israeli requests for military assistance, was skimpy in the economic aid he provided, and resisted calls for a U.S. security guarantee of Israel's borders.
John Kennedy's administration authorized an important arms sale to Israel (of Hawk missiles, in 1962) - but Kennedy made clear that this was a one-time move. Nuclear non-proliferation was also a major issue of Kennedy's foreign policy, and U.S.-Israeli relations in the early 1960s were complicated by Prime Minister Ben Gurion's reluctance to allow U.S. inspectors into the Dimona facility.
The Dimona issue persisted throughout the 1960s, though LBJ didn't press the nonproliferation question to the extent that Kennedy had. And he proved much more sympathetic to Israel on the question of arms sales, even as his Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, urged a different course. In 1965, after West Germany backed out of a deal to supply Israel with tanks, the United States filled the order itself, selling 210 M-48 Patton tanks. The next year, Johnson authorized the sale to Israel of 48 A-4 planes - the first time the United States supplied Israel with combat aircraft. The move represented a clear statement of U.S. support for Israel's security.
Johnson also provided Israel with diplomatic backing in the aftermath of the 1967  war. The President resisted pressure from the Soviet Union for a UN resolution that would demand an Israeli withdrawal from all territory occupied in the conflict before the two sides addressed the political and diplomatic issues that had caused the war.
What explained Johnson's sympathy for Israel? 
Geopolitics played some role: throughout the late 1960s, the United States was intent on bolstering King Hussein's beleaguered Jordanian regime, and Israel's willingness to accept U.S. arms sales to Jordan was a precondition to U.S. backing for the Eshkol government. Politics also was a contributing factor: during his time as Senate majority leader in the 1950s, Johnson had worked closely with American Jewish leaders in raising money for Democratic Senate candidates. As President, he respected the power of the Israel lobby and was loath to cross it.
But Johnson also seems, on a personal level, to have considered the U.S.-Israeli alliance morally important.
Johnson's decisions laid the foundation for the U.S.-Israeli alliance on which future Presidents, including Clinton and Bush, would build.
Dear Prof. Johnson,
A couple of years ago you wrote this:
Two factors more strictly related to the academic world join anti-Semitism in explaining the growth of anti-Israel attitudes on contemporary campuses. The first...  is the increasing tendency of professors to use Israel (which is, after all, the most faithful American ally in the world) as a proxy for their criticizing U.S. foreign policy... The most significant such change centers on a movement that urges colleges and universities to redesign their courses to focus on teaching "democratic citizenship," a scheme... [that] has championed restructuring curricula to "provide students with the knowledge and commitments to be socially responsible citizens." 
Is this trend still growing, or is it declining? And do you see any new factors playing a role?
Best,
Shmuel Rosner
I fear that both patterns are becoming more pronounced.
A good example of the conflation of academic anti-Bush and anti-Israel activism came just last week, at Columbia University. On 12 November, around 70 professors calling themselves "Columbia University Faculty Action Committee" issued a public letter
The group's evidence for this extraordinarily serious charge revealed much more about the signatories that about Bollinger. The president, they asserted, had "allied the University with the Bush administration's war in Iraq, a position anathema to many in the University community" - because he had the temerity to rebuke President Ahmadinejad during the Iranian leader's recent visit to Columbia (It goes without saying that millions of Americans who oppose the war in Iraq nonetheless find Ahmadinejad's policies repulsive, a distinction that apparently evaded Bollinger's faculty critics).
The signatories then moved on to criticize Bollinger's conduct on issues relating to the Middle East. They faulted the president for not publicly saying that alumni and the media have no right to comment about Middle East Studies faculty, as the president of Barnard had done after an outcry when a rabidly anti-Israel professor, Nadia Abu El-Haj, received tenure. And, as the New York Sun noted
Similarly, the last few weeks featured an egregious example of how focusing on "democratic citizenship" functions as a code for ideologically one-sided instruction. The University of Delaware implemented a curriculum
Students were told "a racist is one who is both privileged and socialized on the basis of race by a white supremacist (racist) system. 'The term applies to all white people (i.e., people of European descent) living in the United States, regardless of class, gender, religion, culture, or sexuality. By this definition, people of color cannot be racists.'" In one-on-one meetings with resident advisors, white students were pressed to disclose how they had oppressed people in the past, or when they discovered their sexual orientation.
Incredibly, a senior administrator at the University described
Since I wrote the passage quoted in your question, the media (and some alumni groups) have become more aware of the pervasiveness of "groupthink" in the academy. Most important, there seems to be a growing recognition that the problem of groupthink is not a left-versus-right issue but one of protecting students' rights to free speech and to learn in an intellectually open campus atmosphere. The Delaware example cited above, for instance, was terminated after massive media criticism, from newspapers of all ideological persuasions. Similarly, the anti-Bollinger professors have received no substantial editorial support, even from newspapers (such as the New York Times) whose editorial boards are clearly left of center.
Dear Prof.,
The illuminating book you wrote about the famous Duke Lacrosse rape case contends that it was not just academia, but also the mainstream media and many other forces who bear responsibility to the group-thinking that made this case possible. However, if one is trying to apply the same method to the issue of Israel many will argue that the opposite is true: pro-Israel forces are generally so powerful and influential in America that only in academia one can hear dissenting voices. 
Would you accept such argument?
Best
It's clear in the Duke lacrosse case that a "groupthink" mentality initially seized institutions - the academy, the mainstream media, civil rights organizations - that we expect to uphold due process. All betrayed their ideals in gleefully rushing to judgment, perhaps none more so than the "Group of 88," the 88 arts and sciences faculty who signed an April 2006 statement declaring unequivocally that something had happened to the rape accuser and saying "thank you for not waiting" to protesters who had, among other things, carried "castrate" banners in front of the lacrosse players' house.
But in the end, nearly all of the media and (more reluctantly) most civil rights groups admitted their error, and conceded that this case was really about massive abuse of power by a local prosecutor. The Group of 88, on the other hand, remained defiant - this January, after the criminal case had collapsed, nearly all signed onto another statement affirming that they never would apologize for presuming guilt. Eschewing the dispassionate evaluation of evidence, they instead clung to their ideological prejudices and displayed an almost stunning closed-mindedness. In other words, whether theirs was a majority opinion or the perspectives of dissenters, the Group of 88?s quality of thought was unimpressive.
Like most elite universities, Duke has had its share of campus controversies on Middle Eastern issues: in 2004, it hosted the conference of the Palestine Solidarity Movement, perhaps the most extreme of the anti-Israel groups on American college campuses; some Duke faculty also agitated for the University to divest from companies that did business with the Israeli defense establishment.
Many of the same professors who took an extreme position on the lacrosse case had previously distinguished themselves for vehement anti-Israel beliefs. Dozens signed a 2005 pro-divestment petition comparing Israel to apartheid South Africa and claiming that "torture is endemic and systemic-part and parcel of the Israeli Occupation and Israel's security culture." Wahneema Lubiano, author of the Group of 88's ad, was one of three Duke professors to speak at the PSM conference. She was joined there by another Group of 88 member, Rebecca Stein, who in a 2005 interview
In short, the Group of 88 demonstrated no more intellectual acuity in their comments about issues relating to Israel than they did in their perspective on the lacrosse case. I'm dubious, therefore, about rationalizing academic anti-Israel polemics as a necessary dissenting balance to pro-Israel sentiments in the public, media, or political classes - without examining the quality of those dissenting arguments.
It's also worth remembering that we're less than two decades removed from the frosty relationship between George H.W. Bush and Yitzhak Shamir. Indeed, as recently as the late 1990s, a good portion of the media (and some politicians) blamed Israel for the failure to achieve peace.
The twin events of the second intifada (with the Palestinians launching a campaign that used murder of civilians as a deliberate strategy) and the 9/11 attacks (which made most Americans more sympathetic to the kinds of threats Israel long has faced) helped to create the overwhelmingly pro-Israel nature of contemporary U.S. public opinion. But as memories of both events fade, I suspect public opinion will return to the more varied perspective of the 1990s. The anti-Israel contingent of the academy, however, will remain very much entrenched.
Dear Prof.,
So here is what ought to be the most important question on this issue: to what degree those university scholars actually influence the thinking of their students. Do you suspect that a generation of anti-Israel elites is now planted around the US, and that the impact of such academia-bias will be felt in the coming years? 
Best
Rosner
This question, obviously, is key, but also is very difficult to measure. It's comparatively easy to determine what is being taught - you can look at course syllabi or descriptions (and sometimes course assignments) or read the scholarship of professors. In exceptional cases, such as the crisis in Columbia's Middle Eastern Studies Department, students will make public class notes. But it's very difficult to measure how students are receiving the instruction.
A two-part response. At non-elite institutions - a majority of colleges and universities in the United States, after all - the problem is severe. Most students enter such colleges after graduating from public high schools. In most cases, they don't have an in-depth familiarity with international affairs. And most students assume that what professors tell them is true.
For these students, their sole exposure to matters relating to the Middle East will come through heavily ideological, required "diversity" courses on foreign cultures, or through new curricular fads such as "global studies." The latter, which has been adopted at dozens of non-elite schools around the country, sounds banal but in fact almost always consists of a cluster of courses designed to criticize contemporary U.S. foreign policy.
The only other nation targeted through global studies classes is Israel. At St. Lawrence University's global studies program, for instance, the only class offered on Israel is called "Palestinian Identities," which introduces students to Palestinian identification "as a political and cultural community as they continue to struggle to free themselves from Israeli domination." The course concludes with a forced political activity: "using what we have learned," Professor John Collins notes, "we organize and produce a public activity of some sort; with the goal of educating the community about the importance of understanding what Edward Said has called 'the question of Palestine.'"
At elite institutions, the situation is somewhat more optimistic. The bias in classes on the Middle East is still present. Columbia's Rashid Khalidi, for instance, explained his approach in a 2005 interview with New York magazine: "Most kids who come to Columbia come from environments where almost everything they've ever thought [about the Middle East] was shared by everybody around them. And this is not true, incidentally, of Arab-Americans, who know that the ideas spouted by the major newspapers, television stations, and politicians are completely at odds with everything they know to be true." In other words, Arab-American and only Arab-American students know the "truth" about the Middle East. And Khalidi is widely, and correctly, perceived as among the more "moderate" members of the Middle East Studies establishment.
Khalidi's comment, however, also revealed the problem that faculty ideologues encounter at elite schools. Most students there are at least somewhat familiar with Middle Eastern affairs - whether through the media or through following political debates. Because they have some information to challenge the anti-Israel biases of their instructors, these students are far less subject to indoctrination.
That said, it's depressing to note that the best for which supporters of Israel can hope is that students at elite schools will get nothing out of the Middle East Studies classes that they take in college, because these classes tend to be so wildly biased.
Most universities have as part of their mission statements a claim to be training future democratic citizens. Because of the one-sided nature of Middle East instruction, and because of its excessive focus on the issue of Israel, quite beyond the question of possible indoctrination, America's colleges and universities are failing a generation of students - and future citizens - by not providing them comprehensive coverage of a region of the world that will be critical to U.S. security for the foreseeable future.

<title>Leftist asks court for jail time after convicted of protesting illegally</title>
<date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
A left-wing activist convicted of participation in an illegal protest against the separation fence on Sunday asked the Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court to sentence him to jail time, rather than community service or a suspended sentence. Despite his request, the court decided to issue him a three-month suspended sentence.
Jonathan Pollack, an central activist in the Anarchists Against the Fence movement, was convicted of participating in an illegal protest against the separation fence held in 2004 outside of the government compound in Tel Aviv. During the protest, the demonstrators blocked traffic on Kaplan Street.
Pollack said in his plea, "This trial - if it wasn't administered by a court of the occupation, in the only democracy in the world in which 3.5 million citizens are homeless - was supposed to be a trial of the [separation] wall, the same wall defined as a legal jail by the highest legal authority in the world, the same wall that serves as a political tool in the campaign of ethnic cleansing Israel is running in the occupied territories."
"It was not us who were supposed to stand here in the dock, but those who plan and carry into action the Israeli apartheid," he added.
Pollack said later that he was not surprised when the court found him guilty, but could not accept his punishment as legitimate and therefore will not cooperate with the probation board and does not plan to perform the community service duties imposed on him by the court. 
"I want to say that though this is my first conviction it certainly won't be my last. I still believe that what I did was necessary and right considering the situation, and that the resistance against oppression is every man's duty, even if it comes at a price," Pollack said. "I ask that the court punish me with a prison sentence and not a suspended one. In a country where any gathering in the territories is considered illegal because of its widespread anti-democratic policies of closed military zones, any suspended sentence given to me will quickly become a prison term," he added.
In conclusion, Pollack addressed the judge and said "If your honor thinks that a prison sentence is befitting the crime that I have committed, your honor will take the liberty and personally send me to prison right here and now."
The prosecution in the case asked for a suspended sentence and a fine to be paid by the defendant. Judge Landman who presided over the case decided to sentence Pollack to a three-month suspended sentence. In the case that Pollack should participate in an illegal gathering within the next two years, he will be put in prison for three months. The other defendants in the case were sentenced to 80 hours of community service without convictions. 
Landman said "it saddens me that a mature and articulate individual has come to the conclusion that the only way he can express his opinions is through the violation of the law, even if the law does not seem appropriate."

<title>Let the settlers stay where they are</title>
<date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
It's taken me all these years to finally realize that the settlers were right.
It came to me while checking the news schedule for this coming week. On Sunday, the IDF Chief of Staff is to award Medals of Valor and decorations, some of them posthumously,  for courage in combat during the Second Lebanon War. At the same time, a pro-settler group called the Headquarters for the Salvation of the Nation and the Land plans to hold a parallel ceremony, handing out alternative medals of bravery - and cash prizes donated by U.S. Jews - to Israeli soldiers who refused orders to take part in the eviction of two families squatting in the  Hebron souk. 
At last, it all fell into logical place - the hardships, stumbling blocks and failures of the peace process, the dismal consequences of the disengagement from Gaza, the commandment to settle all of the Land of Israel and the rabbinical prohibitions against giving back one grain of soil. 
The answer is simple. The settlers are right. They should stay right where they are. No matter what. Even if there is an eventual peace. Even if the land they live on is part of a Palestinian state.  
For decades, the leaders of the settlement movement have told us that they will not leave their homes for the sake of a decision of the sovereign government of the state of Israel. They vow to make any future substantial evacuation of settlers from the West Bank so gut-wrenchingly difficult as to be functionally impossible. 
It is time we took the settlers at their word. They are not out there holding out for monetary compensation. They are out there in the primacy of their faith that a Jewish presence on the land of the Old Testament is a commandment and a sacrament. The settlement movement is firm in its view that no elected government of Israel has the right to uproot the Jewish residents of Judea, Samaria, and the neighborhoods of Jerusalem captured in the 1967 Six Day War. 
It is true that the vast majority of settlers reject the idea of soldiers refusing military orders. But it is also true that over the Green Line, Israeli defiance of Israeli law is by no means limited to a radical settler fringe. From its inception, the governing operational principle of the settlement movement has been to take action which is either questionably legal or clearly illegal, and then to force, finesse, or sleaze the way to retroactive ratification. 
The ingenuous mantra of the settler movement "We're here because the government of Israel sent us here," is thus doubly dishonest. These people were not expelled to the West Bank, evacuated to the West Bank, ordered to the West Bank, banished to the West Bank.  
Every Jewish Israeli living beyond the Green Line is a settler by choice. Many of them went there in defiance of the government. Many went to make it impossible for the government to change the status of the land under a peace agreement with the Palestinians.  
Every single one of them went there knowing that there was a chance that they'd be uprooted one day under a government decision. 
They went there by choice. Not the government's choice. Their choice. Does anyone seriously think that if the government decided against their being there, they would just go ahead and move because the government sent them back? 
In fact, after several generations of Israelis have been born on the West Bank, it could be said that Israel has no right at this point to order them back. 
Let us, then, take the settlers at their word. If settling the land captured in 1967 is of paramount importance to the Jewish people, settling the land should also take precedence over making sure that land belongs to the Jewish state.  
And while we're at it, let us take the Palestinians at theirs. If they are so concerned about the evils of apartheid, then they must accept the idea of Jews living in their midst.   
On the scale of racist evils, surely a government - like Saudi Arabia for example, or a potential Palestine - which forbids religious or ethnic or national groups from entering or living within its borders, has much to answer for.   
Under a future peace agreement, it is reasonable to expect that settlers from across the West Bank will be invited to resettle in Green Line settlement blocs to be annexed to Israel in a territorial exchange with the Palestinians. 
But who could blame settlers in outlying enclaves for refusing to budge, given the government's abysmal track record in resettling less than 10,000 uprooted families since the 2005 disengagement? 
Let them stay. Let them stay right where they are. Let them have the courage of their beliefs. It's a test. For the settlers and, especially, for the Palestinians.  
And if the Palestinians counter that Israel must allow an equal number of Palestinian refugees into Israel proper, say 200,000 of them, so be it.  
We made this mess in the West Bank. We'll have to be creative about how we set it right.

<title>Livni meets with British ambassador over U.K. boycotts </title>
<date>Mon May 28 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni met with British Ambassador to Israel Tom Philips on Monday, following reports of a planned U.K. boycott of Israeli labor unions.
Britain has become in recent years the battlefield in Israel's fight for its existence as a Jewish state. 
The number of British organizations calling for the boycott of Israel, their public campaigns, and their constant comparisons between Israel and the apartheid regime of South Africa have made the battle for British public opinion particularly significant. 
On Wednesday, representatives of the new British University and College Union (UCU) are scheduled to meet in Bournemouth. On the agenda is another proposal to boycott Israel's academic institutions.
In her meeting with Philips, Livni expressed her dissatisfaction over the planned boycotts and noted that they stand in complete contradiction to the otherwise positive relationship between Israel and the U.K. 
Ambassador Philips stated that his government is opposed to the boycotts, and repeated the British position, according to which boycotts and sanctions are not helpful to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Philips also informed Livni of British Council activities, as well as those of other British cultural institutions, aimed at improving the connections between academic institutions in Britain and Israel.

Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni met with British Ambassador to Israel Tom Philips yesterday over reports of a planned United Kingdom boycott of Israeli labor unions.  
Britain has become a major battlefield in Israel's fight for its existence as a Jewish state in recent years. The number of British organizations calling for a boycott of Israel, their public campaigns and their constant comparisons between Israel and the apartheid regime of South Africa have made the battle for British public opinion particularly significant.  
Tomorrow, representatives of the British University and College Union (UCU) are scheduled to meet in Bournemouth. The agenda includes a proposal to boycott Israeli academic institutions.  
In her meeting with Philips, Livni expressed dissatisfaction over the proposed boycotts, noting that they stand in complete contradiction to the positive relationship between Israel and the UK.  
Philips replied that his government is opposed to the boycotts and repeated the British position that boycotts and sanctions are not helpful in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Philips also informed Livni of activities by the British Council and other British cultural institutions that are aimed at improving ties between academic institutions.

An open letter calling on the Rolling Stones not to appear in Israel was sent to the band by a Palestinian group yesterday. The organization, Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) "strongly urged" the group cancel to its September concert because of what it called Israel's "colonial and apartheid designs to further dispossess, oppress and ultimately ethnically cleanse Palestinians from their homeland," and to do so "until the time comes when [Israel] ends its illegal occupation of Palestinian territory and respects fundamental human rights." PACBI compared performing in Israel to performing in apartheid South Africa and noted that the Rolling Stones had supported the boycott of South Africa in the 1980s. The letter listed groups that have blacklisted Israel and then asked, "Is it too much, then, to expect conscientious artists like the Rolling Stones to similarly uphold the values of freedom, equality and justice for all by supporting the growing boycott against Israel?" The group's producer in Israel, Shuki Weiss, declined to comment on the report. (Tamar Sukenik)   
The Tel Aviv District Court yesterday sentenced a man convicted of sodomizing his 17-year-old daughter to nine years in jail and NIS 20,000 in compensation payments. The court said the father took advantage of the daughter's emotional dependence on him, as she had met him only a year before the attack. Afterward he threatened to kill her, her brother and her mother if she told anyone. Judges Shlomo Timen, Tchia Shapira and Sarah Brosh wrote that the man's act was one of the most "despicable on the books." However, the judges decided to impose a lesser sentence considering the man's difficult circumstances. (Nir Hasson)   
The Secondary School Teachers Association (SSTA) yesterday called off the strike planned for today for the central district, after progress was made in talks with the finance and education ministries. They also said they would not strike anywhere for the next six workdays. The sides moved ahead in talks on the three main issues: payment for work with pupils with learning disabilities, the determining of past wage erosion, and a quota for retiring teachers. SSTA head Ran Erez said the Education Ministry had shown a "positive attitude" and had come up with about NIS 45 million more for teaching the learning-disabled. (Or Kashti)   
The Jewish National Fund must allocate land without discriminating between Jews and Arabs, Attorney General Menachem Mazuz has decided. Mazuz informed the High Court of Justice of his decision a few days ago, in response to a 2004 petition by Arab citizens against the JNF's refusal to sell them land. Even before this decision, the Justice Ministry had ordered the Israel Lands Administration to cancel a sale of JNF lots in Carmiel in which the tender stipulated that only Jews could participate. However, plots purchased by non-Jews will be set aside until the court rules on the petition, instead of being handed over immediately. (Yuval Yoaz)   
The High Court of Justice rejected a petition by the parents of slain Katzrin teenager Tair Rada to reopen their daughter's murder case. Shmuel and Ilana Rada claim police failed to thoroughly investigate all leads. The justices wrote in their verdict that they "had not found that the petitioners have evidence of essential faults" in the investigation. They said the Radas' complaints seem to have been addressed in the response by the State Prosecutor's representative, and these issues should also be addressed during the trial of the murder suspect, Roman Zadorov. (Eli Ashkenazi)  
The National Fraud Squad has finished its investigation into suspected acts of bribery in the Lod Municipality and has transferred the file to the central district State Prosecutor's Office. The police believe the evidence shows suspicions of bribery, money laundering, fraud and breach of trust in the promotion of certain projects by former mayor Benny Regev, his relatives and his bureau chief, Maor Abergil. Police also suspect certain corporation heads who worked with the city of giving bribes, and believe there were financial improprieties in funds raised for an association supporting Hapoel Lod soccer team.

<title>New English-language station seeks  to air peace through radio waves </title>
<date>Wed Feb 21 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
An English-language radio station based in Ramallah and financed by a Jewish South African went on air live this morning with the aim of providing a platform for "peaceful dialogue" between Israelis and Palestinians.  
The station, 93.6 RAM FM, is based on the popular South African radio station, 702 Talk Radio, which its founders believe played a key role in the transition from the country's apartheid regime to democracy.  
The format will include adult contemporary music, as well as hourly news updates provided by the station's service, Middle East Eyewitness News.  
Call-in and talk show programs in English will be introduced within a year.  
The station has studios in both Ramallah and West Jerusalem, but will be transmitted from the West Bank, which means that certain parts of the country, including Jerusalem, may have difficulty picking up the signal.  
The project required an initial investment of $2 million, 25 percent of which was funded by Isaac (Issie) Kirsh, the Jewish South African who is the founder of 702 Talk Radio. It will operate independently of any governmental or NGO funding and is a purely commercial enterprise that aims to become self-sustaining through advertisements.  
"There is a need for a daily debate on the issues affecting both Israelis and Palestinians," said Kirsh, who was also involved in the establishment of Radio Tel Aviv. "This will be an opportunity for Israelis and Palestinians, in the comfort of their homes, to talk to each other, build bridges."  
Kirsch conceived of the idea for RAM some five years ago in the hopes of replicating 702 Talk Radio's success in the Middle East.  
"I am not doing this for the money," he told Haaretz. "I don't need the money."  
RAM, which bills itself as "in touch, in tune and independent," hires Israeli, Palestinian and international reporters. They have freelance journalists in Baghdad, Cairo and Damascus, with a plan to possibly expand coverage into Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Iran.  
John Berks, a popular South African radio personality who was a key member of the 702 radio staff during the country's transition to democracy, has been tapped to co-host RAM's morning broadcast.  
"We're committed to telling both sides of the story," Andrew Bolton, the station's news editor said at a press conference yesterday launching the station. "We are apolitical and will not toe any political line, other than peace."  
Bolton said the news program would therefore not include either terms like "martyr" or "terrorist," both of which he called "loaded."  
702 Talk Radio, which was founded over 25 years ago, is said to have contributed to South Africa's transition into a post apartheid society. Nelson Mandela has called the station "democracy in action."  
RAM received a license from the Palestinian Authority in December 2005 and has been in its test broadcast stage for about a year. They do not have a license to operate in Israel.

Court petitioned on W. Bank driving ban
Eight human rights groups petitioned the High Court of Justice yesterday against a military order prohibiting Israelis from driving Palestinians in private vehicles in the West Bank. Attorney Michael Sfard, who filed the motion for Yesh Din, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Gisha, the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel and others, criticized GOC Central Command Yair Naveh's order, slated to take effect January 19, saying it will "lead to a rift between Israelis and Palestinians who have legitimate social, political and commercial ties." The groups call the order reminiscent of apartheid, as it "implements an ideology of separation by creating criminal sanctions on different peoples." (Yuval Yoaz)  
Israel still occupying Gaza, group claims
A human rights advocacy group charges that Israel did not relinquish control of the Gaza Strip in the disengagement. Although Israel removed certain components of control, it tightened its hold on others, according to a report by Gisha: Center for the Legal Protection of Freedom of Movement, slated for release to diplomats and European Union delegates in Israel later this week. "Imposing a strict curfew on the movement of people and goods in and out of the Gaza Strip and halting funding for public services have contributed to an economic and humanitarian crisis in the Strip of a severity unknown in the 38 years of occupation," the report states.

<title>Palestinian group urges Rolling Stones to boycott Israel</title>
<date>Mon May 21 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>

A Palestinian group lobbying for boycotts against Israel has urged the Rolling Stones to cancel their scheduled September performance in Israel, comparing performing in Israel to performing in apartheid South Africa and noting that the legendary rock band had supported the boycott of South Africa in the 1980s.

<title>Palestinian news: Now in English </title>
<date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
RAMALLAH - "It's not that publishing a Palestinian newspaper in English was my idea," says Othman Al Haj Mohammed, the proprietor of the new Palestine Times, "but I was the only madman who decided to go for it."  
What makes you a madman? 
"Because everyone says I am. Everyone who wanted to put out a Palestinian newspaper in English wasn't prepared to take the economic gamble. But I say, 'No courage, no glory.' There is a vacuum that needs to be filled. The foreigners who live in the territories and Israel, the educated people in Israel - all these people are interested in reading news from a Palestinian point of view as well."  
Haj Mohammed, a 41-year-old resident of Beit Hanina, north of Jerusalem, says he dreamt of running a newspaper from an early age. By age 10 he had a subscription to Time magazine. He attended high school in Ramallah, later went to the United States, and returned to Ramallah in 1995.  
"Three years later, my fondness for magazines and journalism led me to try to put out a magazine called Zaman, in the hopes of creating an Arabic Newsweek. But after a year, I realized there weren't enough readers in the Arab world. We didn't have customers.  
"But the field continued to fascinate me. I understood that setting up a magazine or a newspaper isn't all that complicated, but that keeping it up over the years is the real challenge. I spent a number of years in England, and in 2003, when I returned to Ramallah, I started to think about why there wasn't an English-language newspaper that exposes people who don't read Arabic to the Palestinian-Arab angle.  
"By the end of 2003 and the beginning of 2004, the idea was already rolling. We had to get a publishing permit from the Palestinian Authority, and the permit arrived in February 2005. I met with journalists and businesspeople and came to a number of clear conclusions on criteria for success: The newspaper must be independent, it must provide news from a Palestinian angle but not be identified politically with any faction or organization, and it must give all opinions and approaches a platform.  
"I realized we have to take the best journalists Palestinian society has and offer the most interesting contents. It is impossible to pull anything over the reader. We have very difficult competition from Haaretz and The Jerusalem Post. Our customers will come from among these newspapers' readers. It wasn't easy to find the right people. We are an Arabic-speaking people, and many in the territories do not have a suitable education."  
The good, the bad and the ugly 
Will you be able to write freely about negative stories in the PA? 
"That's not a problem. I am a Palestinian and the writers are Palestinians. Beyond the fact that I'm biased in favor of the Palestinian cause, I don't see any problem with criticizing corruption or political phenomena in the territories. Our problem is that in this part of the world, they don't sue you for damaging someone, they simply shoot you. Therefore, I have to be careful.  
"I want to show the good, the bad and the ugly. My vision is for the newspaper to show the Western world that Palestinians aren't just Fatah, Hamas, terror and armed struggle, but also business, culture, medicine, education and art. Human beings. Most Palestinians would agree with me that we want to live in peace, and it's not easy to show this. My aim is that not only will the newspaper become one of the most important in the Middle East, but also that 50 years from now, it will still be widely distributed."  
In terms of economics, how do you overcome the fact that there aren't many potential buyers? 
"First of all, by means of advertising. Beyond that, we intend to expand sales in Israel too. We have received a permit to sell in Israel, and we are in touch with a number of the large Israeli distributing groups. The potential for subscriptions in Israel is larger than we had thought, and we are hoping that by next month, people will already be able to have the newspaper delivered to their homes in Israel. There are quite a lot of Israelis who are interested in reading news about Palestine from Palestinian sources. I spend hours at Steimatzky's bookstores, and am already waiting for the day when I see people buying the newspaper there."  
Do you believe the newspaper will also be sold at newsstands and small shops in Israel? 
"I am certain it isn't going to be easy in the beginning. I've already heard about an Israeli shopkeeper whose employee sold our paper without his knowledge. He was angry, and he refused to pay us for what was sold. It is clear to me that some people in Israel will refuse to sell the paper. But if you can find Haaretz and The Jerusalem Post in Ramallah, then maybe they'll also sell the Palestine Times in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Aside from Israel, there is interest in other countries. We have been contacted by a company in Dubai that is interested in distributing the paper there too. The Lebanese Daily Star is interested in an article-sharing arrangement."  
Big is good 
Haj Mohammed says he has been receiving positive reactions from Palestinian readers, even though the newspaper has chosen to use terminology that will not win it very much affection on the Palestinian street.  
What are you going to call a suicide terrorist? Or the Israel Defense Forces? 
"In English it's easier. I'll write 'suicide bomber' and not 'martyr.' In the case of the army, it's 'the Israeli army' and not 'the Israel Defense Forces,' but also not 'the occupation forces' or 'the Zionist occupation.' The wall is a wall, but not 'the racist apartheid wall.' I am against the use of the term 'militant' - it has too negative a connotation."  
And what about censorship? If you have received a distribution permit for Israel, presumably you will be under the supervision of the military censor. 
"The censorship laws in Israel apply to me. But thus far, no one from the censor has contacted me about an article that has been published. I certainly don't intend to contact them. If there is a problem, they can talk to me."  
Haj Mohammed refuses to specify how much money has been invested in the newspaper. "The employees here haven't come only for the money. They know I have a problem paying them full salaries. The first few times I met with them, it was important for me to understand that they are enthusiastic about the idea and not just about the pay. There are journalists and workers here from the United States, Britain, Holland, Australia, one Belgian and someone from France. They live in Ramallah and are committed to the newspaper's success."  
The newspaper has 45 employees, including 25 journalists. The rest are graphic artists, marketing staff and others. The main offices, where Haaretz met with Haj Mohammed, are located south of Ramallah, but the newspaper also employs a large team of correspondents in Gaza, Jerusalem and within the Green Line. The front pages are devoted to news, "with an emphasis on the headline being ours and not from the news agencies," he adds. The inside pages present articles the Israeli reader won't usually find in the Hebrew press: an article about the most popular form of entertainment in Gaza (the Turkish bath), a feature about the new generation of female Palestinian film directors, and a lot of sports. Alongside items about the bleak situation of the Gaza Strip soccer teams, on Wednesdays and Fridays there is a special column on English soccer.  
The newsstand price has been set at NIS 7 in Israel. The paper is printed in broadsheet format, and employs a team of eight workers to handle the design of the newspaper, in part to market it more efficiently.  
"Everyone is pressuring me to move over to a tabloid," says Haj Mohammed, "but I thought that in this part of the world, we would not be taken seriously if we produced a tabloid. In Palestine and the Middle East, we like to hold a big paper. It makes us feel good."

<title>Polish right-wing party accused of running anti-Semitic campaign ad</title>
<date>Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
WARSAW - A right-wing party ran a campaign ad Monday suggesting Polish lives have been put in danger in Iraq to serve Jewish and U.S. interests, and it immediately drew accusations of anti-Semitism.
The League of Polish Families' TV spot features footage of President Lech Kaczynski, first at a meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush, and then with Orthodox Jews at Israel's Western Wall, where he dons a yarmulke. The words Our allies, are flashed across the scene. "They put us in the line of attack."
A grim voiceover then warns: "It is our nation that is going to fall victim. Let the nation decide."
The advertisement - issued as part of campaigning for Sunday's general election - sparked a firestorm of criticism. Jacek Kurski, a lawmaker with the governing Law and Justice party, slammed it as a pathetic masquerade that was seasoned with some anti-Semitism.
League of Polish Families leader Roman Giertych defended the spot, saying it was not anti-Semitic but insisting there is a connection between the war in Iraq and Israel.
"One can be against the war in Iraq without being an anti-Semite," Giertych said at a news conference.
"This ad shows the cooperation between Poland and the U.S., and Poland and Israel - we have a right to criticize it. The war in Iraq threatens our country and this is why the Polish troops should be pulled out from Iraq as soon as possible."
But Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, noted that the sequence of images was laid out in such a way as to provoke a negative feeling about Kaczynski being at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest place.
"You see the tanks, you feel bad, you see people being blown up, you feel bad, you see President Kaczynski at the Wall, you feel bad," he told the AP.
"Now the question is why should someone feel bad about President Kaczynski being at the Western Wall? What is negative about the president of the country visiting a holy site?"
Poland's Stop War movement, which opposes Polish involvement in Iraq, immediately distanced itself from the ad, saying it has strong anti-Semitic connotations.
Poland contributed combat troops to the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, and still has 900 soldiers stationed there.
The League of Polish Families, which served as a coalition partner in the conservative government of Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski before being dismissed this summer, is fighting for its political survival.
Most opinion polls show it with between 2 and 4 percent support - below the 5 percent threshold needed to enter parliament.
It is not the first time the party has faced accusations of anti-Semitism.
Giertych's father and fellow party member Maciej Giertych, a European Union lawmaker, was reprimanded early this year by the European Parliament for publishing a brochure that described the Jewish people as a tragic community that tends to settle among the rich while still choosing to live in apartheid from the surrounding communities.
The party is also closely linked to a youth movement, the All-Polish Youth - founded by Giertych in 1989 - which has attacked gay rights activists and used Nazi slogans and gestures.
Maciej Giertych in November dismissed his assistant after a newspaper published a photo of her giving a straight-armed Nazi salute at an All-Polish Youth rally with a burning swastika in the background.
Giertych in December said his party had severed all ties with the radical youth wing after the swastika burning scandal.

<title>Pro-Palestinians in Canada to boycott bookshops owned by IDF donor</title>
<date>Mon May 14 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Pro-Palestinian Groups in Canada have launched a campaign to boycott a chain of bookstores owned by Jewish billionaire Gerry Schwartz, who donates money to lone IDF soldiers.
Schwartz and his wife Heather Reisman established the Heseg Foundation two years ago which supports hundred of lone soldiers serving in the IDF. The foundation donates roughly three million dollars a year.
The Coalition against Israeli Apartheid (CAIA) in Canada launched a campaign last week for a consumer boycott of Chapter and Indigo bookstores, which are owned by Schwartz and Reisman. 
The CAIA said that by giving donations to IDF soldiers, Schwartz and Reisman were aiding the oppression of Palestinians by Israeli security forces. 
Schwarz and Reisman refused to respond to the campaign launched against them, however associate Aviv Bushinsky said "these provocative actions due not lessen their commitment to Israel. In fact, the opposite is true. In the last dew months the amount of donations to Israel has only gone up".

<title>Protesters block Highway 443 to protest ban on Palestinian traffic</title>
<date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Israeli and Palestinian demonstrators blocked Highway 443 early Thursday morning to protest the ban on Palestinian vehicles from the road, which is a major artery connecting Jerusalem to Lod, Army Radio reported.
The protesters, a coalition of Jewish and Arab members of leftist organizations, carried signs which read, among other slogans, "Caution Apartheid Road" and "Paved Road on Pilfered Land," Army Radio said.
"Highway 443 is an example of what is taking place in the territories," one of the demonstrators told Army Radio. "[The authorities] are expropriating land from the Palestinians in order to build a highway which is then declared off limits to Palestinian traffic."
"There is a policy here of apartheid," Hadar Grievsky, another protester, told Army Radio. "Highways are built on roads that were seized from Palestinians and is only permitted to Jewish drivers."
Organizers of the protest said that 70 demonstrators participated, most of them Palestinian residents of nearby towns. Israel Defense Forces soldiers and police arrived at the scene to disperse the crowd approximately 10 minutes after the road was blocked. Seven people were taken into custody for questioning, according to Army Radio.
The commander of the Binyamin police station, Chief Superintendent Benny Har-Nes, told Army Radio that law enforcement received information on the demonstrators' plans to block the highway, enabling authorities to deploy the necessary amount of force.
"We knew of the plan to [block the road] and we prepared accordingly," Har-Nes said. "We arrived at the scene within five minutes from the start of the event, and after trying to persuade them to evacuate willingly, we declared the matter an unlawful gathering and we cleared them out."

<title>Punk rebel with a classical cause </title>
<date>Tue Jul 24 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
When the lights went down at the "Tombs of the Kings" archaeological site, on East Jerusalem's Salah a-Din Street last Sunday, the starry sky and a crescent moon briefly illuminated the vast crowd. Five musicians and a sound technician took to the enormous, equipment-packed stage of the Yabous Productions Jerusalem Festival. Violinist Nigel Kennedy introduced them as "Robert de Niro, Andre Agassi, Dracula, Sean Penn and my second wife," before announcing their distinctly Polish real names. After a short pronouncement of solidarity with a Palestinian audience that included many Israelis, he raised an electric violin. The first notes of jazz, which emerged from an instrument consisting of little more than a metal frame with strings, promised two hours of tremendous pleasure for the crowd.  
Eight hours earlier and a short distance away from the concert, on the balcony of his room at the American Colony Hotel, Kennedy described his Polish friends, "I went to clubs in Krakow, where I have lived for the past seven years. I listened to the musicians and chose the best. This is no easy feat because the jazz musicians there are wonderful. We started with traditional jazz: Kenny Burrell, Wayne Shorter, things like that, and finally we got to my pieces.   
"My life in Krakow is very rich when it comes to music," he continued. "I perform in the Polish Chamber Orchestra, which to me is a pleasure because it's not like in England where someone always looks at his fucking watch and says, 'Shit, there's a break now.' Here [in Krakow], they stop only when the music is finished. I also play with a Klezmer trio, Trio Kroke. Kroke is the Yiddish word for Krakow. We play everything, from Jewish music to Balkan music. In Krakow, you can find all kinds of music, from highland-techno to rap, a growing trend in Poland now, which is pretty understandable given the poverty and the hopelessness in certain parts of the country."  
Were you always into jazz?  
"Since I was 12," Kennedy answers, invoking two legendary classical and jazz violinists who influenced him. "I studied under Stephane Grappelli, with whom I met on a weekly basis at the time when I studied under Yehudi Menuhin. Menuhin's wife made sure his hair was combed and always offered me muesli. Grappelli and I wandered around the antiques market, and he always wanted to have a double pint. They were also good friends, despite all the differences between them, and they played a lot together."  
Didn't that confuse you?  
"On the contrary, it enriched me. Everyone always says, 'one teacher - one way.' When you study with one teacher whom you respect and admire, you are certain that his way is the only right way and you get stuck there. Two teachers open up endless possibilities.  
"Anyway, I grew up in South London. There were Christians and Muslims and Jews, people from all over the world: the Balkans, India. As a boy, when I had no idea about religion, I nevertheless understood that there were many types of people with different beliefs, that there are many religions and that you have to respect all of them because they are all valid. That's what made me have diverse interests, and not be single-minded."  
How did you get to Poland?  
"My wife brought me there. She's Polish. I met her in England, in Malvern, the most boring city in the world, at the most boring party they ever threw there. She took me to Krakow, seven years ago. When I saw that beautiful city, its culture, the incredible music you hear all the time, I said, 'Hey, man, that's where I want to make my home."  
Nigel Kennedy made his first appearance on the classical music scene in the early 1980s. Although he won the 1985 Gramophone award for a recording of the Elgar Violin Concerto, he was considered as eccentric by the classical world. Most of them rejected him because of his punk image and manners that contradict their norms.  
Many at New York's Juilliard School, where Kennedy was a student of acclaimed violin teacher Dorothy DeLay, predicted he would fail his studies because he ignored the institution's orders that he not play jazz with Stephane Grappelli in Carnegie Hall.   
"I stood backstage with a bottle of whiskey," he once said in an interview, "and I didn't know what to do. Then I said, 'Hell, I'm not willing to live my life regretting that I didn't play with Grappelli in Carnegie Hall.' So I went on stage and did it."  
The classical world attacked Kennedy for his 1989 release of a recording of Vivaldi's "Four Seasons," which became an all-time bestseller that made it to the hit parades in every musical category. He was also criticized for refusing to play with English orchestras because of what he called their lack of professionalism: Critics mocked him and slammed his performances.  
"It happened because I opened the doors to a private club. That was the problem," he says. "Proponents of classical music saw all kinds of undesirable types from the street entering their private club, commoners who are not part of the nobility. It's like English tennis. When they invented the game, they created bizarre rules, like points that jump from 15 to 30, and terms like 'love' for zero and 'deuce' when the score is tied, just so the servants won't understand the game and join in. Wimbledon, the aristocracy and all that phoniness - I really hate it. The realization of any capitalist's dream means the destruction of the lives of 10 anonymous people, somewhere in the world. Not that I am better than others: I'm sure that the vest I am wearing now was made in China - but I choose to fight this system."  
Since then, Kennedy recorded a CD inspired by Jimi Hendrix, a concerto to music by "The Doors," and jazz produced by the prestigious New York "Blue Note" label, in addition to classic violin repertoire: Beethoven's Concerto, Brahms, Sibelius and Tchaikovsky. He has also performed all over the world.  
Orchestras and festivals in Israel have attempted to book you for a long time, without success, and now you have come to perform in East Jerusalem.  
"It's no coincidence. I became aware of the Palestinian story while I was a student in New York. My girlfriend then was Palestinian, and, through her, I began to familiarize myself with and understand the problem even before the [separation] wall and the other atrocities. She had to return home every year or she would lose her citizenship, and, like it was for all of us students, that wasn't exactly her thing. Then I understood that it was simply a way to harass the Palestinians and prevent them from studying.  
"And today, I was really shocked when I saw the wall here. It's a new type of apartheid, barbaric behavior. How can you impose collective punishment and divide people from one another? We are all residents of the same planet. I would think that the world learned something from South Africa. And the world should boycott a nation that didn't learn. That's why I won't perform in your country.  
"The concert tonight is very emotional," he adds, "because I am performing for people who are imprisoned, to give them two hours of fun and show them that the world has not forgotten about them."  
The technique of classical music pervaded every note, musical phrase, embellishment and improvisation Kennedy produced on his violin throughout the concert, regardless of all the folklore and jazz he played, and all the technical effects.  
Do you still record classic repertoire?  
"Yes. I recently released two CDs with the Polish Chamber Orchestra: One of concertos by forgotten Polish composers of the Romantic era, and one with concertos by Mozart and Beethoven, with my own cadenza, on electric violin.  
"I had a mental block when it came to Mozart's music. Only now am I playing it for the first time since I was 17," he says. "Back then, I tried playing my own cadenza and ended on the wrong key. So I simply threw away the music and didn't play it anymore. I didn't like the authentic performances on ancient instruments, the New York-style with all its vibrato and enormity. In any case, Mozart's operas and works for piano are so much greater than his concertos for violin. It took me some time to understand what to do with it."  
At the end of two hours, the crowd rose to its feet, and Kennedy asked, "Want another one for the road, before we go drink something?" He finished with a folkloric piece and sent the joyous audience off into the chilly Jerusalem night.

<title>Ramallah radio station to debut, funded by South African Jew</title>
<date>Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
An English-radio station based in Ramallah and financed by a Jewish South African will go on air live beginning Wednesday morning.
The station, 93.6 RAM FM, aims to provide a platform for "peaceful dialogue" and is based on the popular South African radio station, 702 Talk Radio, which the station's founders believe played a key role in the transition from the country's apartheid regime to democracy.
The format will include adult contemporary music, as well as hourly news updates provided by the station's service, Middle East Eyewitness News. 
Call-in and talk show programs in English will be introduced within a year. 
Ram, which is short for Ramallah, also means high or lofty in Hebrew.  
The station has studios in both Ramallah and West Jerusalem, but will be transmitted from the West Bank, which means that certain parts of the country, including Jerusalem, may have difficulty picking it up. 
The project required an initial investment of $2 million dollars, 25 percent of which was funded by Isaac (Issie) Kirsh, the Jewish South African who is the founder of 702 Talk Radio. It will operate independently of any governmental or NGO funding and is a purely commercial enterprise that will collect revenue from advertisements.
"There is a need for a daily debate on the issues affecting both Israelis and Palestinians," said Kirsh, who was also involved in the establishment of Radio Tel Aviv. 
The station, which bills itself as "in touch, in tune and independent," hires Israeli, Palestinian, as well as international reporters. 
"We're committed to telling both sides of the story," Andrew Bolton, the station's news editor said. "We are apolitical and will not toe any political line, other than peace."
Bolton said the news program would therefore not include either terms like "martyr" or "terrorist," both of which he called "loaded."
The station's holding company, Middle East Broadcasting Holding Ltd., is based in South Africa.

<title>Rice consults Clinton, Carter in run-up to Annapolis summit</title>
<date>Sat Oct 27 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is looking to the past for lessons on how to make next month's Mideast peace conference a success.
As she prepares to host the international meeting in Annapolis, Maryland, Rice has delved into the history of U.S. attempts to mediate peace in the region, plunging into the diplomatic annals and seeking out the major players responsible for both successes and failures.
"She's trying to draw on the historical record and the experiences of others to see what she can glean and how that may be applicable to the current day," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said Friday, ahead of Rice's Nov. 4-6 trip to Israel and the Palestinian Authority, her second in three weeks to organize the Annapolis gathering.
Most recently, she met this week with Jimmy Carter, sitting down in her office on Wednesday for a talk with the former president who brokered the 1978 Camp David peace accord between Israel and Egypt, the first between Israel and an Arab nation.
Carter has been a vocal critic of the Bush administration's Middle East polices and wrote a recent book, Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, that some believe is anti-Israeli. McCormack said the differences in approach were not a subject of her conversation.
Rice has also spoken by phone with former President Bill Clinton about his work on the 1994 Israel-Jordan peace deal. She discussed with both Clinton and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright the unsuccessful 2000 attempt in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, to mediate an Israeli-Syrian agreement and their bid later that year at Camp David to forge an Israeli-Palestinian pact.
Others she has reached out to include former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and James Baker, and to one-time U.S. peace negotiators like Dennis Ross, who played a key role in the Clinton administration and the administration of former President George H.W. Bush.
In addition, Rice, whose background is in Soviet studies, asked the State Department historian's office to prepare a voluminous, and classified, compendium of its records on the U.S. role in Middle East peacemaking.
McCormack declined to offer details of her private readings and conversations or discuss any conclusions she may have drawn from them. But he noted that Rice, especially given her background as an academic, has intense interest in studying past diplomacy for clues about what might work as the Annapolis meeting approaches.
"We view the situation as qualitatively different than it has been, the history moves on, people change roles, situations," McCormack said.
"That said, you can take the lessons of history and apply them," he said. "She is a student of history and has a keen appreciation for how we can apply the lessons of history, what we can learn from those who have gone before us."
Rice faces serious obstacles in organizing Annapolis, with both Israel and the Palestinians far apart on a joint statement to be presented to the meeting that she and President George W. Bush hope will launch the start of formal peace talks.
The two sides have fundamental differences over how detailed the document must be and whether it should contain a timeline for progress in the eventual negotiations.
The Israelis want the statement to be as vague as possible while the Palestinians are pushing for deadlines and specific references to the key issues in the conflict, among them the borders of a Palestinian state, the status of disputed Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
Rice's last trip to the region, a furious four-day shuttle diplomacy mission earlier this month, produced little apparent progress on bringing the two sides together.
However, she did win at least public support for the Annapolis conference from Egypt and Jordan, two critical Arab allies of the United States that had both expressed skepticism about the utility of the meeting.

<title>Rosner's Guest: Gil Mann</title>
<date>Sun Sep 02 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Mann is the author of 2 books: Sex, God, Christmas & Jews, Intimate Emails About Faith and Life Challenges
Mann is also the author of Jewish E-Mail, a column syndicated to Jewish websites and newspapers in the U.S. and Canada and the producer of beingjewish.org
He speaks and writes about Jewish identity, continuity, intermarriage and assimilation. These will be our topics of discussion. Readers can send questions to rosnersdomain@haaretz.co.il
Gil, 
Here's a question I compiled following some readers' remarks:
Is it time for rabbis to accept reality and officiate ceremonies for mixed couples?
Best
Rosner
Shalom again Shmuel:
My answer is yes with an asterisk.  Marriage according to Jewish law is not possible.  A wedding with a rabbi that integrates Jewish traditions is possible. 
I believe we need to find every possible way to welcome intermarried couples and show them the beauty of  Judaism.  To increase the chances that this couple will want Judaism for themselves and especially for their children, rabbis and our institutions need to show warmth.  To do the opposite will not make the couple "fall out of love," but does run the risk of alienating them with the impression that Judaism is a non-loving intolerant religion.
I've heard from couples who told me their rabbi said "No, I won't perform the wedding, but I would be willing to come to the dinner afterwards."  I understand why a rabbi would have this position.  But the couple viewed this as a huge insult that made them want nothing to do with Judaism. I understand their position as well. 
Again, I acknowledge that asking a rabbi to marry a couple with the traditional Jewish vow that the couple is being married "according to the religion of Moses and the people Israel." is simply not accurate or appropriate.
What to do instead?  When a couple is "rabbi shopping," calling synagogues till they find a rabbi who says "Yes, I perform intermarriages."  I think the response should be: "Yes, the rabbi will 'officiate' but always needs to meet with the couple in advance."
Meeting the couple and discussing the issues and challenges of intermarriage is critical.  The rabbi should respectfully and gently pose questions about their individual faith, how they plan to reconcile differences and most importantly how they plan to religiously raise their children.  
(As an aside, many young couples think "love conquers all" and that they will just work things out when the time comes.  This plan is often naive.  I say this based on emails I've received from unhappy or confused children and parents of such marriages.  Hopefully  the conversation could lead to many more with the rabbi as well as connection to  resources available such as Interfaithfamily.com and JOI.org.)
Having said all that, in my mind "officiate" can be flexibly defined.  I think rabbis should find ways to be a part of the ceremony with a judge doing the legalities.  I'm not sure about co-officiating with a clergy of another religion ...that could be an especially difficult situation for a rabbi.  I also can see a problem if the couple flat out says they plan to raise the children in a religion other than Judaism.
Every case is unique, but In general, in addition to a rabbi participating, as far as I am concerned (and I know some would disagree), the ceremony could include many Jewish traditions from a chuppah to Jewish blessings/music and breaking the glass.  Personally I would be comfortable with the synagogue being the venue.
The bottom line for me is I love Judaism and intermarriage is a big reality today.  To reconcile both, I think we need to find every possible way to have intermarried couples embrace Judaism and Judaism embrace them...including having a rabbi somehow be a part of the actual wedding ceremony (and not just at the dinner afterwards.) 
Gil
Dear Gil
I understand all of your points about Freedom Judaism; it make a lot of sense. The only thing that I would disagree with you about is your overall sense of optimism. I am pretty pessimistic about the future of Judaism because I sort of imagine Freedom Judaism ending with a bunch of half-Jews who feel culturally Jewish to varying degrees. This wouldn't be too bad, because I think such people will lead moral and ethical lives, but it does sadden me that there will be very little distinctively Jewish about their lives. 
I agree that the next 50 years are pivotal, and in that regard, they will be exciting to live through. But I find myself getting more and more depressed with the state of Judaism every time the holidays come around.  Take last year for example. I live in a Jewish fraternity house which means I am surrounded by Jews who are OK identifying as Jews.   Yet, on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, my hall mates are opting out of shul in favor of watching football, doing homework, going out to dinner, etc.   
What I am trying to say is that  I don't see Freedom Judaism yielding particularly Jewish results. It may produce ethical people that get Bar Mitzvahed, but if that is all the Jewishness new age Jews possess, the future might not be so bright for Judaism. 
A
Dear A:
I share some of your fears.  I should clarify one point. I am not suggesting that Judaism be a free for all.  I am saying that  in this era of Freedom Judaism anyone can and does choose whatever they want.  If Judaism is to be chosen and continue,  we will need to reinvent ourselves in ways that make Judaism and our institutions relevant, compelling and sustainable.  We can not impose Halacha, Judaism or anything else on Jews in an era of freedom. 
I'll put things a different way:  I once gave a lecture and an 80 year old man stood up at the end of the lecture and asked:  "These issues of intermarriage and assimilation you describe did not exist when I was younger.  Don't you think anti-Semitism in a way was a blessing?" 
My reply was, "I would not call anti-Semitism a blessing.  It is true, that as a result, the Jewish people learned many positive things and  we were kept together....but I would not want to trade places Jewishly with my great grandfather!"
So yes, I am optimistic.  As I wrote earlier, I do not believe Judaism will end...Judaism as we know it will.  But we have always evolved.  Over thousands of years the Jews and Judaism have changed a lot.
Further as I noted in the first answer, Jewish woman today are perhaps the most educated women in the history of humanity.  They are at the fore front of some of most impactful and positive innovations in Jewish life from new Jewish Music and liturgy to Jewish Healing Centers and special needs inclusion efforts etc.  We are unleashing 50% of our people!   This potential is most exciting for our future.
So put on your seatbelt and keep your hands on the wheel, be prepared for forks in the road and new unusual destinations.  I am not sure where we are going, but I feel lucky to have the opportunity to be part of this journey, to play a tiny role and live in this era.
I embrace and love the uniqueness of Jewish spirituality, ethics and peoplehood.  But who knows?  Perhaps over time (decades or centuries from now)  Jews and gentile will believe similarly in such a way as described in the Aleinu prayer when all people will know a single God and the world will be perfected.
Gil
Dear Gil,A new study shows that young American Jews are more and more alienated from Israel. One quote: "Every measure indicates a decline of attachment"
Why? What should be done as to reverse this trend?
Rosner
Dear Shmuel
During the Yom Kippur war in 1973, I brought a transistor radio to my largely non-Jewish high school to hear the hourly newscasts. I quickly realized that I was one of the few people (Jewish or non-Jewish) who was this concerned about what was happening during the war.
Since that time I have always observed lesser concern for Israel all the way to alienation with sadness...but understanding.  
Unlike most American Jews especially younger Jews, I had a strong personal connection to Israel.  I had uncles and cousins who were fighting during this war. I had been to Israel many times.  In addition, I deeply valued the importance of Israel, as many members of both of my parents' families had perished in the Holocaust.
Most American Jews don't have these personal connections. And there are three additional reasons that many young Americans feelings for Israel are at best apathy at worst alienation.
One is that the average young American Jew has experienced little or no anti-Semitism.  Unlike their parents and grandparents (and me), the current generation of Jews did not feel the Holocaust, the establishment of the State of Israel, the Six Day War or the Yom Kippur War.  To those who lived through the events, these were serious survival threats that were tangible examples of the existence of anti-Semitism. 
In contrast, young Jews today have grown up seeing a strong and secure American Jewish community, a mighty Israel and loving and accepting non-Jewish neighbors.  For them the notion of Jewish peoplehood and the necessity of an Israel is not as compelling as it was for earlier generations "who knew Pharaoh."
A second reason many young Americans feel negatively or apathetic towards Israel is misconceptions or ignorance of Israel.  Most American Jews have never been to Israel.  Their understanding of the Middle East is largely a result of what they see in the media.   Israel is often portrayed as an oppressive occupier, an evil apartheid state.  
If you are young, see and hear awful things about what Israel does to the Palestinians, don't know the history of Israel, and you don't feel a strong gut feeling for the need for a Jewish homeland as a safe haven from anti-Semitism, the result can be alienation.
There is a third reason for alienation.  When famous Israeli authors, or the Israeli government, or say the former President of Israel (Katzav) insult American Jewry or the Conservative or Reform Movements, this can and does repel American Jews. 
What to do you ask?  Education.  American and Israeli Jews have many misconceptions about each other.  American Jews do not adequately understand the existential and anti-Semitic threats faced by Israel and other Jews.   Israelis don't adequately understand American Jewish life. 
Fortunately many fine educational efforts are happening.  Birthright Israel (getting Jews to Israel) and The Israel Project (getting accurate and fair media coverage) are two great example.  These efforts should grow.  Having Israelis participate and interface with American Jews in these efforts is a win-win.  Programs like Wexner that bring American and Jewish leaders together are part of the solution.  I'll throw out another idea, there should be a huge high school exchange program for American and Israeli youth to live in each others homes for a quarter or semester.
Understanding will result and rather than alienation, Jews in Israel and America will have the blessing of connection.
Gil
Dear Gil,
Do you see Halachic Judaism adjusting to the new circumstances the way people like Samson Raphael Hirsch adjusted to emancipation, or do you see 'Freedom Judaism' replacing Halachic Judaism? Halachic Judaism is doing well in terms of birth rate, while Freedom Judaism is suffering from assimilation, intermarriage and low birth rate.
Joe Feld
Dear Joe: 
I believe Freedom Judaism has already replaced Halachic Judaism for all but Orthodox Jews and a few others. As I noted in the earlier response, perhaps as much as 90% of the Jewish world today does not lead a life governed by Halacha. For that matter, most Jews today have very little knowledge of Halacha!
In the emails I've received over the years, I have found that many Jews are interested to hear what Jewish law has to say about an issue. However, when faced with a decision like:  Should I get a tattoo? Jewish law is but one of many "voices" they will consider as they ponder options. They might be influenced by Jewish law and tradition, but they certainly do feel or act bound by Halacha. A much more widespread example is not keeping kosher.
As for the issue of birth rate, I agree, those who observe Halacha have more babies and this is one reason there will always be a part of the Jewish world that observes Jewish law. I would not say however, that birth rate is a barometer of the health of Halachic Judaism. 
Only a few centuries ago, most Jews lived Halachic lives, yet most Jews today do not. How many times have you heard a non-Orthodox Jew say, "My grandparents, or great grand parents were Orthodox?" Birth rate is not able to sustain widespread observance of Halachic Judaism. I listed 7 (mostly wonderful) changes in our world in response to an earlier question that partially explain the decline in Halachic Judaism. In a word, I sum them up as: freedom. This is why I say we are now in the third Jewish era that I call Freedom Judaism.
The issues of assimilation, intermarriage, low birth rates etc are significant challenges for Judaism. Many Jews are upset that these phenomena will mean the end of Judaism. I believe they will end Judaism as we know it... but not end Judaism. They will change Judaism.
The evolution from Temple Judaism to Rabbinic / Halachic Judaism took several centuries as the oral Torah was codified and written and as new institutions replaced the Temple. I believe we will evolve much faster this time.  The next 50 years will be pivotal. Some consider these changes frightening and disturbing. Judaism is changing... as radically as when the Temple was destroyed. I do not know what we will look like, but I think this era of Freedom Judaism is perhaps the most exciting time in our people's history to be a Jew. 
Gil
Dear Gil,
The role a rabbi should play in the community occupies some space in your book. "So many Jews now have expectations of a rabbi that are virtually impossible for one person to achieve".
But was is the role of the rabbi in this age of post-Halachic Judaism you've described?
Best
Rosner
If you examine your life, you spend almost all of your waking hours engaged in:
1.  Work (broadly defined)  2.  Relationships,  3.  Health or 4.  Recreation.  
When is the last time you had a question in one of these realms where you thought:  "I think I will consult with a rabbi or Halacha to find an answer?" 
For example: How should I respond to a customer?  How much should I go into my credit card line to pay my bills at home?   How should I respond to my daughter's desire to drive the car with 3 other teens, Should I lose some weight? or I wonder what movie I'll watch this week?
These are pretty standard day to day questions.  Would you think to ask a rabbi or have your answer driven by Halacha? 
Most non-Orthodox Jews today would say no.  So what is the role of a rabbi today for non-Orthodox Jews?  I believe to become teachers of how Judaism is relevant for day to day modern life.  Said differently, to teach how Judaism's wisdom can help answer questions like those above and countless others.
The information must be relevant because in this era of Freedom Judaism and the sovereign self, Jews freely choose the answers that resonate and discard the others.   The reality is that Judaism is just one source of knowledge they consider.  Granted this is a challenge for rabbis, especially since Judaism is a tradition of commitment, seriousness and obligation.   But Judaism is also a tradition of great benefit to individuals, community and all humanity.  In their roles as teachers, rabbis must be marketers of these compelling benefits.  
And in spite of living in this post Halachic era of Freedom Judaism, I believe rabbis have many opportunities to teach.   Most Jews today will not bind themselves by Halacha but are interested to know what Judaism has to say about many issues. I say this based on the thousands of emails I have received (to see some go here
One other important role for the rabbi relates to major life events. Jews still look to the rabbi when a family member has a bris, a bar/bat mitzvah, wedding, a crisis, divorce or funeral.   However, as you can see from this chapter
Finally, rabbis continue to play a role as community representatives and leaders.
Dear Gil,
Here's a soft-ball: give us the shortened 500 words explanation of your concept of "Freedom Judaism".
BestRosner
When the temple was destroyed 2000 years ago, Judaism was forced to reinvent itself.  Over time, our leaders brilliantly came up with a way to perpetuate Judaism that was not centered on the temple.  They invented Rabbinic Judaism or what some call Halachic Judaism.
Today, perhaps as many as 90% of the Jews on the planet no longer lead a life governed by Halacha. (Orthodox Jews and a small number of others make up the remaining roughly 10%).  Yet Jews and Judaism still exist.  If we do not live in era of the Temple or Rabbinic Judaism, what is this era?  I believe we are reinventing ourselves as radically as when the temple was destroyed.
I call this third new era Freedom Judaism.   It began when Jews were first emancipated in Europe.  In the last 100 years or so, Freedom Judaism has become a radical new reality for Jews because of 7 phenomenon:
1. Mobility: Almost all Jews alive today live in a country other than the country of their great grandparents. This modern exodus is many times greater than the Biblical exodus from Egypt. In addition, the way people regularly move from city to city today is a smaller ongoing exodus. 
2. The Holocaust: The post-traumatic shock of losing a third of the Jewish people deeply affects Jewish and non-Jewish thinking, especially in matters of spirituality (attitudes toward God) and Jewish Peoplehood. 
3. Establishment of Israel: What should a free Jewish state be? This historic work in progress poses endless challenges, among them: Who is a Jew? How do democracy and theocracy coexist? How does a people that has been powerless for 2,000 years, ethically use its newfound power? What does a Jewish homeland mean to the Diaspora? How does realization of the dream of a Jewish state impact Jewish theology, messianic thinking, prayers, holidays, etc?
4. The shrinking of the globe: Today, knowledge and travel are quickly accessible to an unparalleled percentage of the Earth's population. 
5. The empowerment of women: Women in the West have unprecedented rights, education, and opportunities. As a subset, Jewish women are perhaps the most educated and influential women in the world today - for that matter, in all of human history! Today, Jewish women routinely are esteemed professors, doctors, lawyers, rabbis, judges, legislators, businesspeople, members of a myriad of other professions, and volunteer leaders. Some of the most successful innovations in the Jewish world today come from Jewish women: prolific writings, new and inspiring Jewish liturgy and music, new programs, and institutions such as the Jewish Healing Centers. Unleashing the talents of 50 percent of the Jewish people bodes well for a Jewish future. 
6. The liberation of the Jews: Jews today can more freely choose where to live, work, attend universities, participate in government, and join organizations than at any time in history, (though anti-Semitism, especially outside of North America, is active and dangerous.) Jews also have great freedom of choice in deciding how, or even whether, to practice Judaism, another religion, or no religion.  6a: Intermarriage: A significant aspect of Jewish freedom that deserves special mention is the loving embrace (literally) of non-Jews, such that intermarriage today is commonplace. The long-term effect of these marriages is not known, but there is little question that they will impact the future of Judaism.7.  The Western ideal of individual Freedom.  Jews live in societies today that embrace the idea that we each choose what we want in our lives.  Nobody has the right to impose anything upon on us (we protest when the government wants to tax us or even tell us to wear seatbelts.  This is the notion of the sovereign self.  Each of us is a king or queen in charge of our own lives.
I am not suggesting that Freedom Judaism is preferable or better than Halachic Judaism.  What I am saying is that this is reality today.  And we need to face this reality honestly, fearlessly and creatively.

<title>S. Africa defends invite to Palestinian PM </title>
<date>Tue May 08 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
JOHANNESBURG - South Africa yesterday defended its invitation to Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh to make his first visit outside the Muslim world, saying it was "myopic" to reject opportunities for dialogue.  
Intelligence Minister Ronnie Kasrils, who provoked controversy last week when he extended the invitation during a visit to the Palestinian territories, said South Africa's own experience showed the need to talk to all sides.  
"Those who myopically object to such invitations merely show that they have learned nothing from South Africa's transition," Kasrils said in a statement. "Such logic as they espouse would not have allowed [apartheid era president] PW Botha to have met with the imprisoned [Nelson] Mandela nor his release by [former president] FW De Klerk as a partner in negotiations."  
No date has been set for the trip, which Kasrils said had been endorsed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. South Africa's Jewish Board of Deputies has criticized the invitation, saying the "racist ideology" of Haniyeh's Hamas organization, which leads the Palestinian unity government, stood in contrast to South Africa's own post-apartheid ideals.  
"As Jews and South African citizens, we cannot but view these developments with the deepest unhappiness," board chairman Michael Bagraim said in a statement.  
Kasrils - who is himself Jewish but also an outspoken critic of Israel - used his visit to "reiterate the commitment of the South African government toward the achievement, through peaceful negotiations, of a two-state solution based on a viable Palestinian state on the 1967 borders," his statement said.  
Since becoming Palestinian prime minister in March 2006, Haniyeh has visited Arab states, some Gulf states and Iran, but he has not traveled beyond that.

<title>South African unions seek Israel boycott, severing ties </title>
<date>Thu May 31 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
South Africa's largest trade union federation will launch a campaign against "the Israeli occupation of Arab lands" this week, demanding that Pretoria impose a boycott on all Israeli goods and break diplomatic relations. South African Intelligence Minister Ronnie Kasrils, who is Jewish, told Haaretz that he actively supported the initiative - which contradicts the policy of his own cabinet.  
The president of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), Willy Madisha, announced the launching of the campaign last week in Johannesburg, calling on the government to cease all diplomatic relations with Israel after its attacks on Palestinian leaders.  
"The best way to have Israel comply with United Nations resolutions is to pressure it by a diplomatic boycott such as the one imposed on apartheid South Africa," Madisha said. Cosatu belongs to a recently-formed coalition of organizations operating under the banner "End The Occupation."  
Kasrils' anti-Israeli organization Not In My Name belongs to the coalition working toward an embargo on Israel. This runs contrary to South Africa's official stance, and to President Thabo Mbeki's decision to strengthen trade ties with Israel. Mbeki, who heads the ANC ruling party, even appeared as a guest at Israel's Independence Day celebrations in Durban last month.  
Kasrils, a member of the ANC, told Haaretz that his support for severing all ties with Israel was not in opposition to his cabinet's policy. "Cosatu is an ANC ally in the coalition against the Israeli occupation. Most elements of this coalition call for boycotting Israel, although the ANC does not," he said.  
"We respect their right to encourage people to boycott Israeli goods. As a South African consumer I personally will not purchase Israeli goods until Israel changes its present policy regarding the Palestinians."  
Cosatu's spokesman, Patrick Craven, said Kasrils was involved in directing the campaign for imposing a political and economic embargo on Israel. "This is intended to include the diamond trade," he added.  
Craven acknowledged that his organization's primary objectives did not pertain to the Middle East, noting that while Cosatu's main goal was improving the material conditions of its 1.8 million members, "it could not stand idly by as Israel perpetrated atrocities in Palestine." Adding that he anticipated "some short-term damage" to South Africa's economy following the boycott, Carven said the damage was "vastly outweighed by the importance of stopping injustice."  
The campaign that Cosatu has helped mount will begin Friday, with sermons in South Africa's mosques on "the plight of the Palestinian people". The Christian organizations of the coalition will begin addressing the issue in churches Sunday.  
The organizers intend to picket across South Africa next week, including a picket by members of parliament and a candlelight vigil outside the U.S. Consulate in Johannesburg. The ANC ruling party has called for a parliamentary debate on "Israeli occupation."  
Campaign activists will also hold pickets outside selected stores selling Israeli goods. The events will culminate in mass marches and rallies on Saturday, June 9, both in Cape Town and Johannesburg.

<date>Thu May 31 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
South Africa's largest trade union federation will launch a campaign against "the Israeli occupation of Arab lands" this week, demanding that Pretoria impose a boycott on all Israeli goods and break diplomatic relations. South African Intelligence Minister Ronnie Kasrils, who is Jewish, told Haaretz that he actively supported the initiative - which contradicts the policy of his own cabinet. 
The president of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), Willy Madisha, announced the launching of the campaign last week in Johannesburg, calling on the government to cease all diplomatic relations with Israel after its attacks on Palestinian leaders. 
"The best way to have Israel comply with United Nations resolutions is to pressure it by a diplomatic boycott such as the one imposed on apartheid South Africa," Madisha said. Cosatu belongs to a recently-formed coalition of organizations operating under the banner "End The Occupation." 
Kasrils' anti-Israeli organization Not In My Name belongs to the coalition working toward an embargo on Israel. This runs contrary to South Africa's official stance, and to President Thabo Mbeki's decision to strengthen trade ties with Israel. Mbeki, who heads the ANC ruling party, even appeared as a guest at Israel's Independence Day celebrations in Durban last month. 
Kasrils, a member of the ANC, told Haaretz that his support for severing all ties with Israel was not in opposition to his cabinet's policy. "Cosatu is an ANC ally in the coalition against the Israeli occupation. Most elements of this coalition call for boycotting Israel, although the ANC does not," he said. 
"We respect their right to encourage people to boycott Israeli goods. As a South African consumer I personally will not purchase Israeli goods until Israel changes its present policy regarding the Palestinians." 
Cosatu's spokesman, Patrick Craven, said Kasrils was involved in directing the campaign for imposing a political and economic embargo on Israel. "This is intended to include the diamond trade," he added. 
Craven acknowledged that his organization's primary objectives did not pertain to the Middle East, noting that while Cosatu's main goal was improving the material conditions of its 1.8 million members, "it could not stand idly by as Israel perpetrated atrocities in Palestine." Adding that he anticipated "some short-term damage" to South Africa's economy following the boycott, Carven said the damage was "vastly outweighed by the importance of stopping injustice." 
The campaign that Cosatu has helped mount will begin Friday, with sermons in South Africa's mosques on "the plight of the Palestinian people". The Christian organizations of the coalition will begin addressing the issue in churches Sunday. 
The organizers intend to picket across South Africa next week, including a picket by members of parliament and a candlelight vigil outside the U.S. Consulate in Johannesburg. The ANC ruling party has called for a parliamentary debate on "Israeli occupation." 
Campaign activists will also hold pickets outside selected stores selling Israeli goods. The events will culminate in mass marches and rallies on Saturday, June 9, both in Cape Town and Johannesburg.

<title>The Carter trap</title>
<date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
"If you ever have any questions or advice for me, just put Jimmy Carter, Plains, Georgia on the envelope," the then-presidential candidate told audiences in the 1970s. "I open every letter myself, and read them all." That claim, of course, was completely false, as the cover story of The Atlantic Monthly, which dealt with lies told by presidents, pointed out this week. 
It is impossible to know whether Carter personally opened the letter he received last Thursday. The Carter Center sent a measured, noncommittal response to its contents, but the authors gained the attention they had sought. The press quoted from the letter and television networks discussed it. Its 14 signatories, members of the Carter Center's Board of Councilors, informed Carter that they had decided to resign - publicly and with great fanfare, albeit "with sadness" - due to publication of his book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid." 
This book has featured for weeks on the bestseller lists, and has also provoked a huge outcry. It is no small matter when a former American president accuses Israel of an "apartheid" policy in the territories, and also holds it largely responsible for the ongoing bloodshed. "Your book," wrote the resigning board members, "has confused opinion with fact, subjectivity with objectivity." 
At almost the same time, a group of Reform rabbis announced that they had decided to cancel a planned visit to the Carter Center in March. In their announcement, they urged Carter to resume working to promote "peace, not prejudice." 
Accusations have been leveled at Carter's book since the day it was published. Those well-versed in the details of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, such as the Clinton administration's peace envoy, Dennis Ross, have found in it a plethora of falsehoods, fabrications and half-truths. "Mr. Carter's presentation badly misrepresents the Middle East proposals advanced by President Bill Clinton in 2000," Ross wrote. 
The resigning board members' letter cites several other lies Carter is trying to disseminate. For instance, his assertion in the book that UN Security Council Resolution 242 states that "Israel must withdraw from territories" - to which the letter responded: "But you know the word 'must' in fact is not in the resolution." Kenneth W. Stein, who was the Carter Center's first executive director, and resigned from his position as a fellow several weeks ago because of the book, told Haaretz that it contains "intentional falsehoods" and accused Carter of "irresponsible remarks." 
These "irresponsible remarks," to use Stein's term, were the straws that broke the backs of many people who had admired Carter, even if they did not always agree with him. Two of the most prominent such remarks were Carter's claim, in the book, that "Palestinian groups" had promised to stop suicide bombings the moment Israel accepted the principles of "international law" and the "ultimate goals of the road map for peace;" and various statements that appear to allege a Jewish conspiracy aimed at silencing critics of Israel, such as a sentence that appeared in an article he wrote for the Los Angeles Times: "Book reviews in the mainstream media have been written mostly by representatives of Jewish organizations." The 14 resigning board members said in their letter that they view the former statement as "condoning violence against Israelis." The latter statement elicited a harsh letter from Abe Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, who told Carter that such statements are "dangerous stuff." Martin Peretz, editor-in-chief of the weekly The New Republic, wrote that the former president "will go down in history as a Jew hater." 
It seems that the well-publicized resignation by the Carter Center board members and the Reform rabbis' letter, both developments of the past few days, have tipped the scales against Carter and his book. After all, neither the resigners nor the boycotters can be suspected of being enemies of the peace process. They are lily-white, proven doves for whom Carter simply went too far. A clear line has been drawn here, with Carter's help: a consensus that defines the boundaries of what cannot be said about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even in the eyes of fierce critics of Israeli policy. 
Nevertheless, one problem remains: The critics, as Carter justly claims, are almost all Jews. That is the only card left in his hand, but it is a strong one, which embodies a trap from which there is no escape. 
On one hand, this problem, too, could be solved: All it needs is one well-known, well-respected, non-Jewish critic to come out publicly against Carter. If such a person does emerge, it will be possible to completely undermine the legitimacy of this miserable book. But on the other hand, what lies behind the assumption that such a critic is needed? Is this not a disturbing admission that even in America, when it comes to Israel, the word of Jews is still not, and may never be, completely sufficient?

<title>U.K. minister slams British boycott of Israeli academic institutions</title>
<date>Thu May 31 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
A British minister slammed his country's lecturers union for boycotting Israeli academe on Thursday, saying the decision "does nothing to promote the Middle East peace process." 
"The U.K. government fully supports academic freedom and is firmly against any academic boycotts of Israel or Israeli academics," said Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education Bill Rammell. "Whilst I appreciate the independence of the UCU, I am very disappointed that the union has decided to pass a motion which encourages its members to consider boycotting Israeli academics and education institutions."
The vote was passed by 158 votes to 99 at the University and College Union (UCU) conference in Bournemouth on Wednesday.
Professor Uriel Reichman, President of the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, said Thursday night that the British boycott is "a modern reformulation of Judenreine" a German expression used by the Nazis meaning "Jew free," describing areas they had emptied of a Jewish presence.
The professor called on Anglo-Jewry to send their children to learn in Israel "instead of sending them to institutions where there exists one-sided preaching for the elimination of the Jewish State."
Reichman made these comments at a ceremony for graduates of the college.
Cabinet minister Yitzhak Herzog, responsible for the government's handling of issues related to anti-Semitism, denounced Thursday as "scandalous, discriminatory and one-sided" a British lecturers' union decision.
Herzog has spoken with British Ambassdor to Israel Tom Phillips to convey Israel's condemnation of the move. 
It is especially troubling, Herzog told Israel Radio, that "the decision was taken in a nation which is considered friendly to Israel."
The decision "necessates soul-searching on that part of all citizens of Britain," he said. 
The motion passed Wednesday says that the UCU will present the question of a boycott on Israel's academics for discussion by all its members. According to the motion, congress much send "the full text of the Palestinian boycott call to all branches for information and discussion."
Among the amendments added to the proposal and approved by the union was a clause pledging the group to campaign for "a moratorium on research and cultural collaborations with Israel via EU and European Science Foundation funding until Israel abides by UN resolutions."
The discussions are scheduled to take place over the next 12 months. The motion encouraged union members to "consider the moral implications of conducting ties with Israeli academic institutions." 
The vote was preceded by a heated discussion in which Israel was repeatedly referred to as an apartheid state, engaging in crimes against humanity in the Palestinian territories. The union representatives said the situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip did not allow spectators to stand idly by. 
As part of the motion, the congress will disseminate Palestinian trade unions' request for a boycott against Israel in all the union's offices. 
The congress also said it would arrange for academics from the Palestinian Authority to attend delegations to the U.K. The union's representatives also decided to establish direct contact with Palestinian workers' organizations. 
Ronnie Fraser, who heads the British group "Academic Friends of Israel," said that "the vote proved that nothing has changed within the ranks of the U.K.'s academic unions. This is another boycott." 
In 2005, Fraser acted to overturn another boycott against Israel, which had been approved by the Association of University Teachers (AUT.) That decision was overturned a month after it was passed. In 2006, the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) also moved to boycott Israel, but its decision became invalid shortly thereafter when NATFHE and AUT merged to form the UCU. 
After the vote, the head of the UCU, Sally Hunt, reiterated her opposition to the motion. 
'As I have made clear in the past, and as I reiterated on the floor of congress this morning, I do not believe a boycott is supported by the majority of UCU members, nor do I believe that members see it is a priority for the union," she said in a statement on the UCU Web site. 
She said, however, that the 120,000 members of the union would now have a chance to express their opinions on a boycott, a move that she said she supported. 
"Today's motion... means all branches now have a responsibility to consulate all of their members on the issue and I believe that every member should have the opportunity to have their say. The earlier motion means that any future calls for a boycott must pass key tests before a boycott can implemented."
Israeli Ambassador to the United Kingdon Zvi Hefetz called the resolution offensive to the British Jewish community, saying that, "Its slanted phrasing reeks of ignorance." 
Adrian Fronda, a senior mathematics lecturer who had joined the union solely to vote against the boycott, was less diplomatic. "I came here to oppose the prevalent anti-Semitism we see all around us here," he said. 
Education Minister Yuli Tamir condemned the union's decision, saying she would address British Education Secretary Alan Johnson on the matter.

<title>U.K.'s boycotters of Israel support a single-state solution</title>
<date>Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Britain's University and College Union's decision to promote a boycott against Israel two weeks ago did not just materialize out of thin air. In recent years, the U.K. has seen a multitude of organizations devoted to protesting Israel's occupation of the territories, who organized a mass rally last weekend in the center of London attracted thousands of participants. 
One of these groups, Jews for Boycotting Israeli Goods, opened a stand at the rally, calling for protesters to disrupt Israel's soccer match against England scheduled for Wembley Stadium on September 8. Next week, pro-Palestinian activists plan to call for a boycott against Israeli produce at a conference held by UNISON, Britain's biggest trade union. 
Another organization, the Islamic Council for Human Rights, handed out flyers listing international corporations with branches in Israel, such as McDonald's and Calvin Klein. 
Activists from the Palestine Solidarity Campaign handed out flyers calling for the British government to cease its weapons deals with Israel, under the banner "Palestinian blood on British hands." 
The British front against Israel's occupation of the territories captured in 1967 is made up of dozens of nongovernmental organizations including Islamic movements, radical left associations, workers unions, Israeli and Jewish panels, Christian organizations and human rights committees, operating various charity funds. 
The activists at these groups may differ on issues such as religion and gender equality, but they are united in their perception of Israel as an apartheid state. They all advocate boycotting Israel and believe in diverting funds from it. 
The organizations subscribe to the belief that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must be resolved in the form of a single-state solutions, and granting the Palestinian refugees the right of return. In the past year, this group of organizations has boasted several important accomplishments, first and foremost the UCU resolution. 
"We're on a roll. We're now receiving increasing sympathy for the Palestinian cause," Sue Blackwell told Haaretz Tuesday. Blackwell is a veteran activist who has been promoting boycotts against Israel for years at Birmingham University, where she works as an English lecturer. During the UCU's meeting in Bournemouth, she wore a T-shirt reading "Caterkiller," in protest against the company Caterpillar, which sells bulldozers to the Israel Defense Forces. 
In the meeting, Blackwell argued that the European Union must sever all its ties with Israeli academic institutions. Her motion was passed with a large majority. 
"In 2003, when we first called for the Association of University Teachers [the AUT, which merged with the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education to form the UCU] to boycott Israel, only one-third of the members voted in favor. Union regulations prevented us from readdressing the issue in 2004, but we did in 2005, and then the motion was accepted," she says. 
That motion was later overturned in a special AUT meeting, until the UCU voted in favor of it last month. It passed 158 to 99. 
Blackwell describes herself as a pro-Palestinian lobbyist. She attributes the campaign's recent success to her cross-country activities. "The Palestine Solidarity Campaign invites me to speak at its conferences. I also attend other conferences of workers unions," she says. 
Blackwell is also a member of the British Committee for Universities of Palestine (BRICUP), the lobby for cooperation to support Palestinian universities, staff and students. The organization is headed by Hillary and Steven Rose, who started the boycott initiative five years ago with a letter to the Guardian daily newspaper. 
"We tried working with the Israeli public in the past, but we did not manage to make any headway there," says Jeff Halper, who heads the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions in the U.K. 
"The Israelis as a whole believe there is no partner on the Palestinian side, and are thereby making themselves politically irrelevant. This is why we've had to address the civil society, represented by human rights groups, churches, universities and other organizations to warn against the Israeli apartheid regime," he says. 
"The recent success we have experienced in the field is serving to unite different left-wing organizations. Halper says that the 40-year anniversary of the six Day War created a unifying effect on the front against the occupation; the next milestone will occur in 2007 when Israel celebrates its 60th birthday." 
This article is the first of a series. On Sunday, Haaretz will examine the backlash of efforts to boycott Israel in the U.K.

<title>U.K. union backs calls for boycott of Israel academe </title>
<date>Wed May 30 00:00:00 IDT 2007</date>
<content>
Britain's University and College Union (UCU) voted on Wednesday to promote a boycott of Israeli academic institutions, protesting Israel's policy on the Palestinians. Jewish and Israeli officials in the U.K. and Israel reacted with outrage to the motion which, for the most part, is a rhetorical move. 
The motion was approved by a 158 to 99 vote, and called for freezing European funding for Israeli academic institutions, while condemning "Israeli academia's cooperation with the occupation." 
In addition, the UCU decided to bring the question of whether to boycott Israel up for discussion by all the union's members, numbering about 120,000. The discussions are scheduled to take place over the next 12 months. The motion encouraged union members to "consider the moral implications of conducting ties with Israeli academic institutions." 
The vote was preceded by a heated discussion in which Israel was repeatedly referred to as an apartheid state, engaging in crimes against humanity in the occupied territories. The union representatives adopted two separate resolutions promoting an academic boycott against Israel. They said the situation in the territories did not allow spectators to stand idly by. 
In addition, the union congress pledged to advertise the Palestinians' request for a boycott against Israel in all the union's offices, and to arrange for academics from the Palestinian Authority to attend delegations to the U.K. The union's representatives also decided to establish direct contact with Palestinian workers' organizations. 
The union will also act toward halting academic cooperation with Israel, which is currently conducted through the European Union. The motion called for freezing all EU funding for Israeli academic institutions until Israel will "comply with the United Nation's resolutions." 
Ronnie Fraser, who heads the British group Academic Friends of Israel, said that "the vote proved that nothing has changed within the ranks of the U.K.'s academic unions. This is another boycott." 
In 2005, Fraser acted to overturn another boycott against Israel, which had been approved by the Association of University Teachers (AUT.) That decision was overturned a month after it was passed.

UCU's general secretary, Sally Hunt, also opposes the motion. "I do not believe a boycott is supported by the majority of UCU members, nor do I believe that members see it is a priority for the union," she said. "Now, the union's branches will consult their members to form a stance on the boycott. Any decision to actually impose a boycott will have to overcome serious stipulations."

<title>U.K. union votes to promote Israeli academic boycott </title>

BOURNEMOUTH, U.K. - Britain's University and College Union (UCU) voted yesterday to promote a boycott of Israeli academic institutions, protesting Israel's policy on the Palestinians.

<title>UN: Almost half of Palestinians in Gaza, W. Bank are food insecure</title>
<date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
The United Nations said Thursday that the Palestinian economic crisis had left almost half the people in Gaza and the West Bank food insecure.
The crisis has made previously secure workers - fishermen, farmers, and small traders - increasingly desperate, the World Food Program and the Food and Agricultural Organization said in a report Thursday.
Poverty has risen since the international community cut off aid to the Palestinian Authority after Hamas militants won parliamentary elections last year.
Kirstie Campbell, spokeswoman for the WFP, said 46 percent of Palestinians are now food insecure or vulnerable. In 2004, 35 percent of Palestinians were food insecure, she said.
Many people, who cannot afford to buy food, have been forced to sell off valuable assets such as land or tools, the report said.
To tackle the growing need, the WFP increased its food assistance by 25 percent in the past year, feeding some 260,000 non-refugees in Gaza and 400,000 in the West Bank. Another UN agency, UNRWA, handles food distribution for refugees.
The poorest families are now living a meager existence totally reliant on assistance, with no electricity or heating and eating food prepared with water from bad sources. This is putting their long-term health at risk, said Arnold Vercken, WFP Country Director.
Campbell called the increased humanitarian assistance a Band-Aid solution.
In order to improve the situation, we need economic growth, progress, and restoring trade links between the West Bank and Gaza, she said. 
UN rights expert says Israeli actions in PA similar to apartheidAn independent report commissioned by the United Nations compares Israel's actions in the West Bank and Gaza to apartheid South Africa..
The charges that drew angry rebukes from Israel and were sure to revive charges that the United Nations Human Rights Council is biased against Israel.
The report by John Dugard, independent investigator on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for the council, is to be presented next month, but it has been posted on the body's Web site. In it, Dugard, a South African lawyer who campaigned against apartheid in the 1980s, says Israel's laws and practices in the Palestinian territories certainly resemble aspects of apartheid.
The 24-page report catalogues a number of accusations against the Jewish state ranging from restrictions on Palestinian movement, house demolitions and preferential treatment given to Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
"Can it seriously be denied that the purpose of such action is to establish and maintain domination by one racial group - Jews - over another racial group - Palestinians - and systematically oppress them?" he asks.
Israel says it aims mainly to prevent Palestinian suicide bombings and other attacks that have killed more than 1,000 Israelis in the past six years, and officials note that violence broke out in 2000 after Israel's proposal to pull out of the vast majority of the West Bank and Gaza in exchange for peace was rejected.
Its ambassador in Geneva criticized Dugard for directing attacks only at Israel. Any conclusions he may draw are therefore fundamentally flawed and purposely biased, said Yitzhak Levanon.
The report will be presented next month at the 47-nation rights council's first session of the year. The new body has been widely criticized - even by its founder, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan - for only censuring one government in the world, Israel's, over alleged abuses.
Dugard's report accuses Israel of terror by F16 fighter jets setting off sonic booms above residential areas. In the West Bank residents live in fear of settler terror.
He says it is grossly inaccurate to say Israel's 2005 removal of settlers and soldiers from Gaza constituted an end to its occupation of that territory, captured from Egypt in the 1967 Six Day War. "Israel retained control of Gaza's air space, sea space and external borders, and the border crossings," he writes. "Gaza became a sealed off, imprisoned and occupied territory."
War crimes have been committed by both sides, he says: "This applies to Palestinians who fire Qassam rockets into Israel; and more so to members of the Israel Defense Forces who have committed such crimes on a much greater scale.
Dugard was appointed in 2001 as an unpaid expert by the now-defunct UN Human Rights Commission to investigate only violations by the Israeli side, prompting Israel and the United States to dismiss his reports as one-sided. 
Israel refused to allow him to conduct a fact-finding mission on its Gaza offensive last summer.

<title>When Ingmar Bergman rang </title>
<date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 IST 2007</date>
<content>
Danish director Bille August is one of the few filmmakers whose works have won two Golden Palm awards at the Cannes Film Festival. The first was for "Pelle The Conqueror" in 1988. This film is about a father and son who immigrate to Denmark in the late 1800s to build a new life. Aided by the powerful performance of Swedish actor Max von Sydow as the father, "Pelle" also won the Oscar for best foreign film. August won his second Golden Palm in 1992 with "The Best Intentions," a film based on a screenplay by Ingmar Bergman that describes the legendary filmmaker's difficult relations with his parents. The actress playing Bergman's mother was Pernilla Wahlgren, whom August later married.  
August, 59, is heading the judges' panel at the Haifa Film Festival's Israeli Film Competition this year. He says he is yet to see an Israeli movie, and that he is excited to do so through the competition. In honor of his participation in the festival, his new film, "Goodbye Bafana," (which has been purchased for commercial distribution in Israel) will be screened there. This film is based on the memoirs of James Gregory (played by Joseph Fiennes), the white South African prison warden who guarded Nelson Mandela (Dennis Haysbert) for years - both when Mandela was first imprisoned in the Robben Island jail, and later when he was transferred to more comfortable conditions. The film begins in 1968, as Gregory arrives at Robben Island along with his wife Gloria (Diane Kruger) and their children, and ends with Mandela's release in the early 1990s. Gregory's memoirs convey how South Africa gradually loosened the bonds of apartheid.  
August says he received the screenplay for "Goodbye Bafana" before he had read Gregory's book (whose authenticity has been in question since its publication in 1995. Critics claim Gregory's position afforded him illegal access to Mandela's correspondence, and that Gregory fabricated the story of his close friendship with the future South African leader).  
"What interested me about the story," says August, "is that this is the tale of a relatively simple young man who, at the beginning of the film, staunchly believes in the apartheid laws, and all he wants is to lead a normal life and take care of his family. He changes, however, after meeting Mandela. [Gregory] is living proof that people can ideologically and morally rehabilitate themselves, that they can change."  
What led you to believe that in 2007, people would still be interested in the story of apartheid, which already belongs to the somewhat distant past? What makes the story relevant today?  
"All I believe is that if a story intrigues me and touches me, it will intrigue and touch others, too; that if it tells me something, it bears a message for other people, too. This is my guiding instinct, and I cannot do otherwise. In addition, I believe there are great similarities between what happened during that period in South Africa and what is happening today in Iraq. South Africa was on the brink of civil war prior to the 1994 elections, but Mandela's leadership, wisdom and vision managed to prevent it. We need men of vision today no less than we needed them in South Africa. I believe that if Iraq were to have its own Mandela - a man with a broad perspective - the situation there, and in other places around the world, would be different today."  
Here in Israel, too?  
"Yes. People have expressed their amazement at how the first issue Mandela addressed upon his release was the need for forgiveness; how, after 27 years in jail, he had not become a bitter and angry man. I think, however, that Mandela's long imprisonment was for him a long meditation, during which he prepared himself for the bloodless creation of a new South Africa."  
Your film is a confrontation between two figures: One has familiar human weaknesses, and the other, Nelson Mandela, is an icon, a legend, one of the most admired men in the world. How did you navigate between such different characters?  
"It was not easy, and this is the reason why, even though there have been many attempts to make a film about Mandela, most of them never made it. It is hard to make a movie about a larger-than-life person while maintaining the ability to depict him as flesh and blood. What helped me in making this film is that the story is presented through Gregory's eyes. In a certain way, my film follows the same pattern as the play and movie "Amadeus," which tells Mozart's story through Salieri's eyes. James Gregory is my Salieri."  
Have you met Mandela?  
"Unfortunately, no. Before filming began, I sent him a letter detailing my ideas for the film and how excited I was about making it, but I did not expect a response. I heard through his close associates only that he was very concerned that the film not distort what really happened. Indeed, all the scenes involving Mandela are based on historical fact. The movie has not yet been released in South African theaters, and I imagine that some viewers will claim it has not enough or too much Mandela, that it is too political or not political enough, but this is inevitable."  
August, a graduate of the Danish Film Institute, began his filmmaking career as a cameraman. He directed his first film in 1978, and his second one only five years later. He won international acclaim in 1985 with "Twist and Shout," a teen comedy. Since his two Golden Palm awards and his Oscar, August's career has taken several turns, not all of them successful. His subsequent films included "The House of Spirits" in 1993, a star-studded international production whose cast featured Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas. August says he learned much from that film and the difficulties in producing it. In 1996 he directed "Jerusalem," based on the novel by Selma Lagerlof. August visited Israel for the first time before filming began, but for economic reasons, the movie was ultimately shot in Morocco. His next film, produced in 1997, was "Smilla's Sense of Snow," which was not a success, even though it was based on a best-selling book. This was followed by another box-office failure, a 1998 remake of "Les Miserables."  
"After 'Pelle the Conqueror,' I received a slew of offers to make films about immigrants, but I decided I already had made my immigration film," says August. "I wanted to make different films gradually, and to portray what really interests me. I do not want to make political films. I believe politics belongs to the politicians. Still, I believe good films can infuse a political situation with a heart and soul. I think it is too easy to use the cinema for political declarations. To me, there is no magic in that."  
How important is it to you that your films have a unifying personal signature?  
"When you are making a movie, you cannot think about that. You can only try to make the film in the fairest possible way. Even so, I believe that in choosing the story and molding the characters, you make your personal mark on your films. Of course, some movies are more important to you, closer to your heart."  
How did your collaboration with Ingmar Bergman come about?  
"The phone rang, and the person on the other end identified himself as Ingmar Bergman. He told me he had written a screenplay he wanted me to read. At first I thought it was one of my friends, playing a prank on me, but slowly I realized that I really was speaking with Ingmar Bergman.  
"I set two conditions: that if I did not like the screenplay I would not make the film, and that if I directed the film I would not be Ingmar Bergman's assistant - I wanted to be the film's director. I read the screenplay, and of course I liked it very much. I traveled to Stockholm to meet with Ingmar, and the first thing he said to me was that I would be the director, he would be the screenwriter and he had no intentions of interfering with my work. And that's how it was. He did not interfere even once.  
"We spent a few months together, discussed his childhood, his life, filmmaking. I remember that for some reason Ingmar hated Christmas, and there was an occasion when he really did not want me to leave him to go celebrate the holiday with my family, because he hated Christmas. We kept in touch, and now he's dead. This has been a great loss for me."  
Do you still consider yourself a Danish director?  
"Not really. For example, I would not be able to direct a film about Denmark's young people today, because I no longer know them. I do not understand them. I live in London and Denmark, but most of my time is spent traveling the world. Every time I direct a film in a certain place, I feel I belong to it."

<title>Tutu: World doesn't criticize Israel because of the Holocaust</title>
<date>Thu Sep 18 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
South African Nobel Peace laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu on Thursday accused the West of complicity in Palestinian suffering by its silence, suggesting it did not want to criticize Israel because of the Holocaust.
Tutu spoke after delivering a report to the United Nations about Israel's deadly shelling of the town of Beit Hanun in Gaza in November 2006, which he said may constitute a war crime.
He criticized the international community for failing to speak out against the suffering in Gaza, home to 1.5 million Palestinians, under an Israeli blockade.
"This silence begets complicity," he told the UN Human Rights Council.
Tutu later told a news conference: "I think the West, quite rightly, is feeling contrite, penitent, for its awful connivance with the Holocaust."
"The penance is being paid by the Palestinians. I just hope again that ordinary citizens in the West will wake up and say 'we refuse to be part of this'," he said.
The Geneva-based Human Rights Council on Thursday debated the report on his fact-finding mission conducted last May, which called for an independent investigation into the Israeli strike that killed 19 Palestinians, all but one from the same family.
The Israeli military, after carrying out its own investigation, said in February that it had directed artillery fire against the Beit Hanun area on Nov. 8 2006, on the basis of intelligence that militants were planning rocket attacks.
Israeli ambassador Aharon Leshno Yaar told the Council on Thursday: "A thorough internal investigation was conducted and the results of this investigation shared with the United Nations. Nothing can be gained by rehashing this topic now."
But Tutu, who won the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent struggle against apartheid in his homeland, said his mission never had access to the internal Israeli report.
It was regrettable that Israel had not cooperated with his team, although it admitted responsibility for the strike.
"No verifiable explanation has been offered, no independent impartial and transparent investigation has been held, no one has been held to account," Tutu said.
In talks with senior Hamas officials, Tutu said he demanded an end to the firing of rockets into Israel, saying Hamas has an obligation to respect international humanitarian law.
"Families living in Sderot have the right to live without the fear of rockets, however crude, dropping from the sky," he said.
Israel and the West tightened restrictions last year on the Gaza Strip in an attempt to isolate Hamas after its fighters seized the territory. The Islamist group opposed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' peace talks with Israel.
Palestinian ambassador Mohammad Abu-Koash said Tutu's report should be brought to the attention of both the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court.
"The Israeli shelling of civilians in Beit Hanun while asleep in their homes and targeting of those fleeing is a war crime and its perpetrators must be brought before international justice," he said in a speech.

<title>ANALYSIS / Obama will find Bush has done the peacemaking for him</title>
<date>Thu Nov 06 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
While the greatest democracy in the world chose for the first time in its history a black, peace-loving man for president, tiny Israel is marking 13 years since the murder of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a home-grown zealot.  
Between us and the U.S.  
When the trumpets of victory fall silent, the galling voices of the extremists will be heard, those who will not accept the "evil decree" of the voter. America, too, has been "blessed" with messianic-racist movements whose people are prepared to die for "sacred" causes such as negating a woman's right to her own body and the right of people to purchase a deadly weapon in their corner grocery.  
America has also experienced the assassination of its leaders. Like the Shin Bet security services, the great Secret Service is not immune to a suicide-terrorist.  
The wellbeing of Barack Obama should be especially dear to Israel, not only because of its special relationship to the United States. It may be assumed that his advisers will see to it that he will not abandon Israel.  
I had the privilege of knowing two of the Middle East advisers the new president has chosen: former ambassador Dan Kurtzer and strategist Dan Shapiro. Both are Jews who support Israel and love peace. Both believe that the existence of the Jewish state depends on the existence of a Palestinian state. And naturally, a new president who was widely supported by Jews and will be thinking about his second term will not want to irritate this group.  
The shadow of the Muslim branch of Barack-Hussein's family tree will force him to be particularly careful when it comes to the United States-Israel-Arab triangle. In the past eight years Israel has become addicted to the heady fragrance of the White House and Congress, which have allowed it to do as it wanted in the territories.  
However, George W. Bush has done Obama's work for him. In the Oval Office Obama will find Bush's two-state vision: the Road Map that promised peace with all Arab countries by May 2005 and a complete freeze on settlements. He will also find a copy of the letter Bush sent to Ariel Sharon, in which he promised that the United States would support an agreement based on withdrawal from all territories except the main settlement blocs and the return of refugees to a Palestinian state.  
Obama will have to decide when he wants to redeem these debts. The outcome of the Israeli elections will doubtless impact his decision. If the Kadima-Labor coalition remains, the president will not have to work hard to get Israel going in a desirable direction for the United States. And since Obama's first year in office is PA President Mahmoud Abbas' last, the American president will not want to be blamed for the fall of the West Bank into Hammas hands.  
In March, the Arab League will reopen discussion of its peace initiative. If there is no change in the American attitude toward the Syrian-Israeli channel, Damascus will seek support for shelving this important document.  
If surveys predicting a victory for the right in Israel are borne out, the American president will obviously have some persuading to do to get the Israeli government to follow his liberal path of dialogue and compromise. The decision whether to risk re-enacting the confrontation between Bill Clinton and Benjamin Netahyahu, and shake up relations with Israel and the Jewish community, will depend on two factors: One is how important Obama thinks an Arab-Israeli peace treaty is in defusing the crisis in Iraq and isolating Iran. The second is Obama's willingness to force Israel into translating its songs of peace into action.  
The first sign the right was getting used to the American changeover could be seen in Channel 2's interview with former ambassador to Washington Danny Ayalon. The new acquisition of Yisrael Beiteinu said there was nothing to fear from Obama, and he believed Obama was good for Israel because "it would be easier for him to create a coalition against Iran." This is the same Ayalon who wrote in an op-ed in the Jerusalem Post in January that "we should look at the Obama candidacy with some degree of concern."  
It seems that Israelis who called Bush "the friendliest president to Israel" do have something to be concerned about. In contrast, those who are concerned about Israel becoming an apartheid state living forever by the sword have new hope since yesterday. In the meantime, it is only hope.

<title>Canada to skip UN racism conference due to expected 'anti-Semitism'</title>
<date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Canada will not take part in a major United Nations conference on racism next year because the event is likely to descend into "regrettable anti-Semitism", a top official said on Wednesday.
Officials said they believed Canada was the first nation to announce it will not attend the conference in Durban, South Africa.
A similar meeting at the same venue in 2001 was marred when Israel and the United States walked out in protest over draft conference texts branding Israel as a racist and apartheid state - language that was later dropped.
"(We) had hoped that the preparatory process for the 2009 ... conference would remedy the mistakes of the past. Despite our efforts, we have concluded that it will not. Canada will therefore not participate," Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier said in a statement.
Jason Kenney, the secretary of state for multiculturalism, said the Conservative government was sure the conference would "showcase the same regrettable anti-Semitism" as the 2001 meeting.
"Our government sees no value in allowing Canada's participation to continue to dignify or legitimate such hateful and un-Canadian propaganda," he told reporters.
The Canadian government is a strong supporter of Israel. Bernier apologized on Saturday for an internal Foreign Ministry training manual that listed both Israel and the United States on a torture watch list.
B'nai Brith Canada praised Ottawa for pulling out of "a farce of conference" that it said "pays lip service to anti-racism but in fact provides a platform for the promotion of hatred and bigotry".
The Canadian Jewish Congress also commended Ottawa for what it said was a principled stand.
The United Nations declined to comment directly on Canada pulling out of the conference but UN spokeswoman Marie Okabe said "racism is too important an issue for member states not to work out their differences. Next year will be a time of preparation for this conference; we hope that member states use this time constructively. The SG [secretary general] will continue to follow this issue very closely."

<title>Canadian PM cancels visit to Israel due to Olmert probe</title>
<date>Tue Jun 10 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has cancelled a June 16-20 trip to Israel due to the corruption scandal surrounding Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. 
Harper's staff never confirms a trip until shortly before the PM leaves, so the change is not characterized as a cancellation, but the trip had been talked about publicly. 
Norman Spector, former Canadian ambassador to Israel, said: "The domestic situation in Israel, quite frankly, is scandalous... Prime Minister Harper has no business being there when his counterpart is two steps away from the gallows."
Spector was referring to the corruption investigation surrounding Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, in which he is suspected of having illegally received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Jewish American businessman Morris Talansky. Talansky told a preliminary hearing at Jerusalem Magistrates Court that he gave Olmert $150,000 over a period of 15 years.
The Canadian government, however, is considered a strong supporter of Israel, and it recently announced that it will not take part in the United Nations conference on racism next year because the event is likely to descend into "regrettable anti-Semitism." 
Officials said they believed Canada was the first nation to announce it will not attend the meeting scheduled for April 2009 in Geneva, Switzerland. 
A similar meeting at the same venue in 2001 was marred when Israel and the United States walked out in protest over draft conference texts branding Israel as a racist and apartheid state - language that was later dropped. 
"(We) had hoped that the preparatory process for the 2009 ... conference would remedy the mistakes of the past. Despite our efforts, we have concluded that it will not. Canada will therefore not participate," Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier said in a statement.

<title>Carter discusses Mideast peace prospects with Assad in Syria</title>
<date>Fri Dec 12 23:20:43 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Syrian President Bashar Assad on Saturday discussed prospects for peace in the Middle east with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.
Syria and Israel this year held four rounds of indirect talks mediated by Turkey, but the talks made no significant headway.
In Syria Carter is also expected to meet with the exiled leadership of Hamas, Khaled Meshal. Carter's first meeting with Meshal in April drew sharp criticism from the Bush administration which labels Hamas as a terrorist group.
On Friday, Carter said that he would have been delighted to meet Hezbollah officials and that he regrets the meeting didn't take place during his current visit to Lebanon.
Carter spent five days talking to top Lebanese leaders and members of parliamentary blocs but didn't meet with lawmakers from the militant Hezbollah. The Iranian-backed Shiite group is on the U.S. State Department's terrorist list.
The former U.S. leader had said he was ready to meet Hezbollah but they refuse to meet current or former U.S. presidents.
Carter has offered that his Atlanta-based Carter Center monitor Lebanon's parliament elections next year. The vote will be fiercely contested between Western-backed anti-Syrian groups that hold majority seats in the current 128-member parliament and a Hezbollah-led coalition supported by Syria and Iran.
During a lecture at the American University of Beirut at the end of his visit Friday, Carter expressed disappointment that Hezbollah refused to see him.
"We came here with the hope that we can meet with all the political parties and factions in Lebanon," he said. "If the leaders of Hezbollah wanted to meet with me, I would have been delighted."
Carter also said on Friday he hoped U.S. President-elect Barack Obama would quickly engage in Middle East peace talks when he takes Office.
Carter, president from 1977 to 1981, said Obama had told him he would "begin this effort early in his term."
"The United States for the last eight years has been basically aloof from negotiations," Carter said in an address at the American University of Beirut. "My hope is we will see a new movement towards a comprehensive peace in this region."
Winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, Carter helped negotiate a 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
Critics say President George W. Bush largely ignored Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking until belatedly launching talks in November 2007.
Carter has been a tough critic of Israeli policies in the Palestinian territories, angering many with his 2006 book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid."
He also caused controversy earlier this year by meeting leaders of the Palestinian faction Hamas, which is listed as a terrorist group by the U.S. and the European Union.
Carter said he had no doubts about Obama's "political courage." "But I know the tremendous political pressure that exists in my nation among political office holders to comply almost without exception to the policies of the Israeli government," he said.
Obama's election was cheered by many Arabs glad to see an end to what they have seen as the Bush administration's ruinous Middle East policies. But the appointment of pro-Israeli figures in the new administration has tempered initial enthusiasm. 
Carter said that while Obama had picked Hillary Clinton as secretary of state and Rahm Emmanuel as White House chief of staff, there was hope in his choice of retired Marine Gen. James Jones as national security advisor.
"As far as Rahm Emmanuel is concerned, yes, he is closely affiliated with Israel... But I think that another hopeful sign is that General Jim Jones will be his national security advisor," Carter said.
Clinton had "been quite close to AIPAC's position in the past," Carter added, in reference to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobby group.
"But I think that Jim Jones is thoroughly familiar with the situation in Palestine," Carter said. Diplomats say Jones was critical of Israel in a confidential report this year on how Israelis and Palestinians had met security commitments.

<title>Carter offers to act as 'communicator' between Hamas, U.S., Israel</title>
<date>Mon Apr 14 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, defending a contentious plan to meet the leader of Hamas, said Monday he hoped to become a conduit between the militant group and Washington and even Israel.
"Isolating Hamas is counterproductive," Carter said. 
Hamas rules Gaza but is ostracized by Israel, the U.S. and Europe as a terror group.
"I think it is absolutely crucial that in the final and dreamed-about and prayed-for peace agreement for this region that Hamas be involved and Syria will be involved," Carter told a business conference outside Tel Aviv.
"I can't say that they will be amenable to any suggestions, but at least after I meet with them I can go back and relay what they say, as just a communicator, to the leaders of the United States," he said.
Earlier on Monday, Carter visited the southern town of Sderot, a frequent target of Qassam rocket fire from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, and met the city's mayor, Eli Moyal, and other municipal officials.
"I think it's a despicable crime for any deliberate effort to be made to kill innocent civilians, and my hope is there will be a cease-fire soon," Carter said during his visit.
Following the visit, Moyal said: "I don't believe that Carter can bring calm and peace and I think his meeting with Meshal is arbitrary and will do nothing to advance Israel's interests," Moyal said, referring to Carter's plans to meet with Hamas leader Khaled Meshal in Damascus this week.
Olmert's office had no immediate comment. 
Carter said Monday that a deal for the release of Israel Defense Forces soldier Gilad Shalit would top the agenda of his discussions with Meshal.
The Bush administration and close U.S. ally Israel oppose Carter's planned meeting with Meshal, whose Islamist group won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 but was boycotted by the West for refusing to renounce violence and recognize Israel.
Israel and the United States have sought to isolate Hamas, which seized control of the Gaza Strip in June from more secular Fatah forces loyal to Abbas. Abbas holds sway in the West Bank and has launched U.S.-backed peace talks with Olmert. 
Hamas leaders have offered a long-term truce with Israel in return for a viable Palestinian state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, but the group's 1988 founding charter calls for the destruction of Israel. 
The Nobel Peace Prize winner, who brokered Israel's first peace treaty with an Arab neighbor, Egypt, signed in 1979, met President Shimon Peres on Sunday but was shunned by most of the political leadership, including Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. 
In talks with MK Yossi Beilin in Jerusalem on Monday, Carter said he believed a release deal was possible and intended to make it a central aspect of his discussions with the Islamist leader. 
Carter also said he would raise the importance of a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and a halt to rocket fire on southern Israel during the meeting. 
The former U.S. leader told Beilin that in his efforts to solve international conflicts, he worked on a principle of talking with all possible sources. 
Carter told Haaretz Sunday in an exclusive interview that he intends to check Meshal's willingness to accept the Arab League peace initiative. Carter says that acceptance of this plan by Hamas would be a very positive step. 
Shin Bet security service declines request to assist in Carter security detailShin Bet security service has declined to assist Carter during his visit, U.S. sources close to the matter said on Monday. 
An American source described the snub as an "unprecedented" breach between the Shin Bet and the U.S. Secret Service, which protects all current and former U.S. presidents, as well as Israeli leaders when they visit the United States. 
Government sources on Monday described the lack of Shin Bet during Carter's visit to Sderot, an area often hit by rockets from the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, as particularly "problematic". 
Carter angered the Israeli government with plans to meet with Hamas leaders and for describing Israeli policy in the Palestinian territories as "a system of apartheid" in a 2006 book. 
Israel has also rejected Carter's request to meet jailed Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti, who is seen as a possible successor to President Mahmoud Abbas, a spokesman for Carter said. 
Barghouthi was convicted in 2004 of murder by an Israeli court over the killing of four Israelis and a Greek Orthodox monk in attacks by Palestinian militants. He is serving five life sentences. 
American sources close to the matter said the Shin Bet, which helps protect visiting dignitaries and is overseen by Olmert's office, declined to meet the head of Carter's Secret Service security detail or provide his team with assistance as is customary during such visits. 
"They're not getting support from local security," an American source said.

<title>Cool welcome for Carter in Jerusalem  </title>
<date>Mon Apr 14 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
President Shimon Peres accused former U.S. president Jimmy Carter of causing significant damage to Israel and the peace process in recent years, during a meeting between the two men yesterday at the President's Residence, officials at the residence said.  
Peres criticized Carter for comparing Israeli policies to apartheid in his hotly debated recent book, "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid," according to the officials. He also said it would be a mistake for Carter to carry through with his plans to meet with Hamas political leader Khaled Meshal in Damascus, saying Meshal is responsible for Hamas' violent takeover of the Gaza Strip.  
Members of the press were not invited to the meeting.  
Ahead of his Mideast trip, Carter defended his reasons for wanting to engage Hamas.  
"I think there's no doubt in anyone's mind that if Israel is ever going to find peace with justice concerning the relationship with their next-door neighbors, the Palestinians, that Hamas will have to be included in the process," Carter told ABC News "This Week" in a broadcast aired yesterday.  
The schedule released by the Atlanta-based Carter Center showed that the former president had no plans to meet Prime Minister Ehud Olmert Defense Minister Ehud Barak. Likud chairman Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to meet with Carter because of his planned meeting with Meshal and his views on Israel.  
A senior Israeli official said "scheduling problems" was the official reason given for the high-profile snub - even though Olmert recently took time to chat with "Prison Break" star Wentworth Miller. Olmert's bureau did not respond to a request for further clarification. But the real reason for the cold shoulder is Carter's plan to meet with Meshal, the official said, adding that Israel's leaders are not publicly criticizing Carter out of respect for his former position as U.S. president.  
Carter did meet yesterday with Noam Shalit, the father of captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Shalit described the meeting as positive, and told Haaretz he asked Carter to help advance the deal to release his son. However, Shalit provided no further details on the matter and would not say whether he asked the former president to pass on a message to Meshal.

<title>Gordimer Day </title>
<date>Tue May 13 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Day One. Yesterday was Nadine Gordimer day at the festival - at least for me, as I heard the 83-year-old South African writer in two hour-long sessions, the first in conversation with the woman who translates her work into Hebrew, Cilla Elazar, and the latter an intimate chat with Amos Oz - before an audience of probably 350, in a tent overlooking the the Old City. One Nobel Prize winner, one Nobel Prize hopeful.  
Gordimer and Oz are old friends, and they spoke with an easy familiarity that at times gave their conversation a spontaneity and intimacy that the festival's planners could only have hoped for, though sometimes Oz's metaphors used to explain "the conflict" to his friend smacked of glibness.  
But I'm getting a little ahead of myself. After an official opening on Sunday night, the festival really got down to work yesterday morning, with two sessions intended to explore the delicate work of literary translation. Gordimer and Elazar talked about the need for a title's translation to capture the spirit of a book, and whether translators should call the author when they run into trouble (absolutely not, said Gordimer).  
The two discussed the writer's 1987 novel "A Sport of Nature," which imagined a white South African woman who becomes involved in the fight for political independence of another unnamed African land, and ends up married to the black general who becomes its first president. Elazar wondered aloud if the novel's sunny ending may not have reflected an excessive optimism about the possibility for change in Africa on Gordimer's part. Gordimer insisted that a novelist isn't a prophet, and said she was proud of how her own country handled its revolution, with the leaders of the black majority having resisted any temptation to disenfranchise or even exile members of the minority that had oppressed them for hundreds of years.  
As Elazar began to respond, someone in the audience stood up and, in a style that one can only hope is unique to Israel, demanded that the translator shut up, as she and her fellow festival-goers had come to hear Nadine Gordimer, not her - though the session was in fact intended to be a conversation.  
Elazar clammed up, and Gordimer began taking questions from the audience. How, asked one woman, does she feel when she hears Israel described as an apartheid state? The writer responded judiciously: What she hears about "the methods" that Israel uses in the territories indeed "reminds me of South Africa," but "there is no historical comparison" between the situations. "Whites have no claim to even a single square inch of the whole African continent. In your country, you have two peoples with claims to the land." Gordimer also said quite clearly that it was "unacceptable prejudice" for Hamas and other Islamist groups to deny Israel its very right to existence.  
When another listener asked Gordimer to describe life in Johannesburg, she began, quite calmly, to discuss the pervasiveness of crime, of which she has been a victim. "I have been attacked in my own home, locked in a cupboard. Had my wedding band torn off my finger.  
"What can one do? The young man, who had his beautifully shaped arm wrapped around my neck - why wasn't he given job training, why wasn't he given more? When you think of what Franklin Delano Roosevelt did in the U.S. during the Great Depression, the tremendous government schemes to create jobs, to give people a living and to train them...."  
Later in the day, when Amos Oz asked her where she developed her political consciousness, Gordimer said it began when, as a child in the mining town of Springs, near Johannesburg, she passed the compound where the black laborers were housed. Even in their own shops, "they could only point" at what they wanted to buy. "They couldn't touch or feel items or try on clothing. When I went to town with my mama, we would go into the booth to try on dresses. This made me think about the way we were living."  
Gordimer believes in trying to understand the other, and she declared yesterday that cultural boycotts are "foolish." She urges Israelis to read the books of their enemies, and vice versa. In the meantime, quietly, with no publicity in Israel, and certainly no attempt to engage Israelis (the only mainstream press coverage I know of has been in The Guardian) the "Palestine Festival of Literature" also took place in the past few days, in Jerusalem, Ramallah and Bethlehem, attended by writers no less distinguished than those appearing this week at Mishkenot: Claire Messud, David Hare, Esther Freud, Roddy Doyle, Ahdaf Soueif. An impressive event, no doubt, but imagine how much more so if both sets of great writers, the people, after all, who cross borders with their words, and remind us of all that we have in common as humans, could have joined up in one big festival, spanning both sides of the Green Line.

<title>Gordimer may bow to pressure, skip Israel writers meet </title>
<date>Sun Apr 27 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
South African writer Nadine Gordimer may pull out of her appearance next month at Jerusalem's International Writers Festival in the face of a widespread campaign pressuring her to cancel.  
The 84-year-old Gordimer, winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature, is scheduled to make three appearances at the festival, which runs at Mishkenot Sha'ananim May 11-15.  
Other writers slated to attend include Americans Nathan Englander, Jonathan Safran Foer and Russell Banks, as well as Israelis David Grossman and Amos Oz, the latter of whom is scheduled to share the stage with Gordimer on May 12.  
"I am dealing with the issue now," Gordimer told Haaretz in a telephone conversation from her home in Johannesburg on Friday. She declined to comment further on the controversy, except to say she would soon make a public statement on her decision.  
Gordimer has received dozens of appeals, many of them posted online, calling on her to join a cultural boycott of Israel. Gordimer, who is Jewish, has long been identified with left-wing causes, including her backing of the African National Congress dating back to the apartheid period, when the black liberation movement was outlawed.  
In 2001, she publicly urged her friend Susan Sontag not to come to Jerusalem, where the American writer was to be honored with the Jerusalem Prize at the capital's biennial international book fair. Sontag, who died in 2004, did come in the end, and received the literary award in person.  
Now it is Gordimer who is being pressed to stay away from Israel. For example, an open letter earlier this month signed by British professors Hilary and Steven Rose implored her not to "give the Israeli establishment, the Israeli press, the whole Israeli PR machine, the prize they want - your apparent condoning of their policies."   
Yael Nahari, the director of the Jerusalem's International Writers Festival, told Haaretz that after a request from Gordimer, she is trying to arrange for the South African writer to "meet the other side [Palestinians]," including students at al-Quds University in Jerusalem. Nahari was optimistic that Gordimer will go ahead with her planned appearance at the five-day meeting. "I think she'll come," she said.

<title>Hamas: Shalit won't 'see light' until Palestinian prisoners freed</title>
<date>Fri Apr 18 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
A senior Hamas official on Friday said abducted Israel Defense Forces soldier Gilad Shalit "will not see the light" until Palestinian prisoners are released in a prisoner exchange.
"Gilad [Shalit] will not see the light, will not see his mother, will not see his father, God willing, as long as our heroic prisoners do not see their families, in their houses," Mushir al-Masri said in a speech Friday.
Shalit was kidnapped during a raid on an IDF army post near Gaza in the summer of 2006, and is being held in the coastal strip.  
Egyptian-led talks over a prisoner swap have been bogged down. Hamas has demanded the release of hundreds of prisoners. Israel has agreed to release some inmates, but has balked at some of those on Hamas' list.
Highlighting the importance of the prisoner issue to the Palestinian national agenda, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, a rival to Hamas, said in televised speech on Thursday that a release of all Palestinian prisoners
Yishai to Carter: Tell Hamas chief I want to discuss prisoner swapOn Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Eli Yishai asked  former U.S. President Jimmy Carter
Yishai relayed his message to Carter during a meeting on Monday. The meeting was held at the request of the former president, who wanted to meet with Israeli political leaders from across the political spectrum. The meeting was arranged through the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.  
Yishai's bureau said he did not ask Prime Minister Ehud Olmert for permission to hold the meeting, nor did he tell Olmert what he discussed.  
Yishai said other Israeli officials erred in boycotting Carter. During the meeting, he told Carter that he opposed the former president's use of the term "apartheid" in his book about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Yishai said Carter told him that the interpretation of his use of the word was fundamentally wrong.  
Yishai told Haaretz that in order to redeem prisoners, he was prepared to meet with anyone who could help move things ahead, including Hamas leaders. He said this did not contradict Israeli government policy, since he did not intend to discuss diplomatic issues or a cease-fire.  
After Carter visited Sderot this week, he pledged to help arrange a cease-fire. Carter also met with Shalit's parents, and said he would address Shalit's release when he spoke to Meshal.  
Shalit was kidnapped during a raid on an Israeli army post near Gaza in the summer of 2006, and is being held in the coastal strip.  
"I am ready to meet with all necessary Hamas members and with Shalit's captors, and I would be pleased if you can help," Yishai told Carter at their meeting on Monday. "I am volunteering myself for the task, and I ask you to convey a message: They also have prisoners and I am sure they want to see them released, and therefore it is proper to expedite the negotiations."  
Yishai thanked Carter for his willingness to assist in finding out the fate of missing soldiers Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser, whose kidnapping in 2006, days after Shalit's, sparked the Second Lebanon War.  
Carter promised to pass along the message and to meet with Yishai again when he returns to Israel next week, after visiting other countries in the region.  
Yishai opposes negotiating with the Palestinian leadership, led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, over a permanent-status arrangement, especially regarding Jerusalem.  
A source in Shas said Thursday that if talks with Hamas led to calm, especially around the Gaza Strip, this could lessen pressure to reach a final-status agreement, which could lead to a coalition crisis with Shas.  
Yishai placed his request as Israeli and American officials were protesting Carter's intention to meet with Meshal, the leader of an organization that Israel and the United States consider a terror group. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert did not make time to meet with Carter, and Haaretz has learned that after the press mentioned Carter's plan to meet Meshal, Defense Minister Ehud Barak cancelled a meeting that had been scheduled for Monday. Barak's bureau said the meeting had been cancelled due to scheduling conflicts.  
Carter told Haaretz this week that before he arrived in the region, his staff informed the U.S. government of all the meetings he had planned for his Middle East visit, including the meeting with Meshal. Carter said that until his plans became public knowledge, no U.S. officials objected to them.

<title>High Court closes off use of major highway to Palestinians</title>
<date>Wed Mar 19 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
The interim decision issued 10 days ago by the High Court of Justice on the use of Route 443 marks the first time the justices have issued a ruling to close a road traversing occupied territory to Palestinian use, for the convenience of Israeli travelers. 
The interim ruling on a petition by six Palestinian villages adjacent to the highway, which links the coastal plain to Jerusalem, gave the state six months to report progress on the construction of an alternative road for Palestinian use. 
The Association for Civil Rights in Israel, which submitted the petition on behalf of Palestinians who have been injured by the travel ban, noted that had the justices sincerely sought to consider opening the road to all, without regard to race or nationality, they would not have requested details on the building of an alternate route, which entails the destruction of additional land and costs tens of millions of shekels.  
The decision was issued after both parties argued their positions. According to ACRI, the ruling marks a High Court precedent in upholding a policy of separation and discrimination with regard to movement that has already earned the name "road apartheid." It violates international law, ACRI holds, permitting the expropriation of land from the local population for the protection of the occupying power.  
About 10 kilometers of Route 443 was paved on private Palestinian land in the early 1980s, on the grounds it was needed for the West Bank Palestinian population (and not for "security purposes"). A large part of the expropriated land had been earmarked for a housing development for local teachers. In response to a petition from a Palestinian whose land was expropriated for the road, the High Court ruled that the military government cannot plan and build a road system in an area held by its soldiers if the purpose is solely for the creation of a "service road" for the state. As a result, the state promised that the road was to be open to all.  
Shortly after the start of the second intifada, after attacks on Israeli vehicles, the army closed the road to Palestinians. MK Ephraim Sneh, deputy defense minister at the time, admitted in an interview that the closure was not approved by the political leadership. The closure cut off the villages on either side of the road from their main city, Ramallah, and the rest of the West Bank. In court, the Civil Administration offered to issue travel permits for 80 vehicles, for a population of about 30,000 villagers. The villagers refused to cooperate with Israeli authorities and continued their legal battle for right to use the road on their lands. ACRI claimed in court that the Israel Defense Forces had recently begun frequent raids on the six villages that included the use of illumination bombs, pressure grenades, rubber-tipped bullets and live rounds. The IDF Spokesman's Office said at the time that these were routine operations in response to the throwing or rocks on vehicles traveling on Route 443.  
ACRI officials say they fear the High Court stamp of approval for the illegal and immoral policy regarding Route 443 could be cited as a precedent for additional human rights violations. The petitioners protest what they call a lack of judicial process, noting that even though the decision was on an important principle, it was issued without any accompany explanation and with absolutely no reference to the points raised by the petitioners. In addition, they note, the alternative road will not provide for the needs of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in areas bordering Route 443.

<title>Human rights report: West Bank situation 'reminiscent of apartheid regime in South Africa'</title>
<date>Sun Dec 07 11:42:40 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Basic human rights, such as health, a life of dignity, education, housing, equality, freedom from racism, freedom of expression, privacy and democracy are increasingly being violated in Israel, a human rights watchdog group warned Sunday.
In its annual report, the Association of Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI)  pointed to "extremely worrisome trends at the center of which are violations of the most elementary human rights."
The report also noted that the situation in the occupied West Bank, between Israeli settlers and the local Palestinian population, was "reminiscent, in many and increasing ways, of the apartheid regime in South Africa."
The ACRI noted that since the foundation of Israel, the country's Arab citizens have been discriminated against though legislation and allocation of resources.
In addition, women were widely discriminated against in the workplace, earning less money than men in nearly every profession, with a higher rate of unemployment, and with representation in the Israeli academia 10 per cent lower than the average in any of the European Union nations.
While the discrimination between Jews of European origins and those of Oriental or Middle Eastern origin has now been virtually eradicated, the report said, the socioeconomic gap between the two groups has grown, which bolsters a feeling of discrimination.
As regards the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian areas, the ACRI said that Israeli settlements in the West Bank have resulted in institutionalized discrimination in which two separate populations live under two separate judicial systems.
Allocation of funds and services in the occupied area is also unequal and settler violence against local Palestinians has grown. 
Many of the 430 people killed and 1,150 wounded in the West Bank by Israeli security forcers in 2008 were innocent bystanders, the report said, without giving exact figures.
The report went on to note that despite progressive labour legislation in Israel, the rights of employees are still violated, or at least not enforced, and many services remain physically inaccessible to the handicapped, who also suffer from a high rate of unemployment compared to the rest of the population.
However, the ACRI did find that the rights of gays in Israel were relatively advanced compared to other Western countries, and gay couples enjoyed the same rights as common-law couples.
The report was published to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

<title>Internet site seeks former Swedish volunteers to act as goodwill ambassadors </title>
<date>Mon Mar 24 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Last year, Kiki Toledano, a member of Kibbutz Massada in the Jordan Valley and a lecturer of English, was invited to speak on a radio station in Sweden. "It was a program where the host raised issues close to his heart," said Toledano. "I spoke about Israel as an Israeli citizen, and I then understood how difficult our situation is."  
She also said that, in her discussions with the listeners, they described the country as a conqueror, and acting with cruelty toward Palestinians.  
"It hurt me to hear what they were saying about us," said Toledano, who arrived at Kibbutz Massada in 1982 as a volunteer and married a member of the kibbutz. "Israel's public relations in Sweden are in a sad state."  
The Web site recently launched by the Israeli embassy in Sweden is trying to change the situation Toledano described. The site (www.kibbutz.nu), was designed to attract Swedes who had spent time volunteering on kibbutzim in Israel, and spur them to act as "ambassadors" and spokesmen for the state overseas.  
The Web site, which includes content on Israel and on kibbutzim, invites former volunteers to join a social network to help Israel's public relations. The embassy estimates that about 40,000 Swedes have spent time as volunteers in Israel since 1967.  
"It is a waste not to take advantage of former volunteers," said Rina Keren, head of the volunteers department in the Kibbutz Movement. "These people are ambassadors of goodwill. About 400,000 volunteers have spent time on kibbutzim since 1967, and the vast majority have nothing but good things to say about Israel. Making good use of these people will give Israeli PR a decisive advantage."  
"We don't have an oversupply of support, and for the past two years we have been considering the best way to reach our target audience," explained Israel's Consul in Stockholm, Kobi Shoshani. "This is another common thread among 30-50 year olds, many of whom spent time on kibbutzim. Their eyes light up when they speak about this time. Anyone who has been a volunteer in Israel knows that it's not all war, it's also kibbutz, volunteers, and other things."  
"There is a community of people in Sweden who can do a lot for us," noted Keren. "Some have been appointed to powerful positions in government and embassies. When former Shin Bet chief Carmi Gillon was appointed Israel's ambassador there, he had a difficult start (criticism of the Shin Bet's activities toward Palestinians, etc.). He wrote that one thing that helped him was the fact that a third of the Parliament had been volunteers on kibbutzim."  
Toledano fondly recalls coming to Massada as a young woman of 19.  
"There was an ideological element to it," she said. "In the 1970s and 1980s, living on a collective, together, in cooperation, was a very strong motif. Life today has become very individualistic."  
But the most obvious change she sees is in the attitude toward Israel.  
"Now they compare us to South Africa, present us as an apartheid regime, and Arafat as a hero and freedom-fighter," she related. "A student of mine was killed in the terror attack on the Maxim restaurant in Haifa, and what do the Swedes see? A display of a pool of blood with an image of a terrorist. When the ambassador destroyed the display, the thing that is remembered in Sweden is the so-called crazy ambassador, and not the story about the terrorist attacks.  
"Anyone who knows the truth is someone who is very interested, and many of these are former volunteers, who see a different reality."

<title>Iran rejects tough atomic inspections, citing 'double standard'</title>
<date>Mon May 05 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Iran on Monday ruled out accepting intrusive nuclear inspections unless there was an end to "double standards" on global non-proliferation that it said benefited nuclear arms powers, which allegedly includes Israel.
Squaring off with Western nations at a global meeting on how to shore up the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran rejected allegations of covert Iranian atom bomb work, and blamed nuclear weapons powers for the treaty's problems.
Iranian Ambassador Ali Asghar Soltanieh asked why developing nations should accept intrusive International Atomic Energy Agency inspections as a condition for obtaining nuclear know-how when nuclear arms powers could unilaterally curb IAEA checks of their facilities.
Soltanieh accused industrialized powers of enshrining"nuclear apartheid" by imposing harsher export controls for developing states within the NPT while secretly helping non-NPT state Israel build a nuclear arsenal.
"This double standard cannot be sustained and no additional measure in strengthening (IAEA) safeguards can be accepted by non-nuclear weapons parties unless these serious constraints and discrimination are removed," he said.
Earlier Monday, Iran ruled out halting its disputed nuclear work, saying it would reject any incentive package offered by world powers that violated the Islamic Republic's nuclear rights.
Six world powers agreed at a meeting in London on Friday to offer a new incentives package to coax Iran to suspend uranium enrichment, a process which the West believes Tehran wants to master so that it can build nuclear weapons.
Iran, which insists its nuclear program is aimed at generating electricity, says enrichment is a national right that it will not give up.
"Those incentives that violate the Iranian nation's right in any form will not be reviewed by the Islamic state," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told a news conference Monday.
Iran's English-language Press TV earlier translated Hosseini as saying incentives violating Iran's rights would "not be supported by us". It said Iran had not officially received any package.
The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council - the United States, France, Britain, China and Russia - and Germany, known as the P5+1, offered a package to Iran in 2006 that demanded Iran halt enrichment. Tehran rejected it.
"Regarding the incentives package ... we believe the path adopted in the past should not be continued. They should act based on realities and international regulations. Talks should be held based on respecting nations' rights," Hosseini said.
Russia, which sent an envoy to Iran last week for discussions that covered the nuclear row, said on Saturday enrichment would have to be suspended during international talks aimed at resolving the dispute.
"In the past, we have expressed our view about the issue that some Russian officials talked about. There has been no change in our position," Hosseini said when asked about the comments by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
The UN Security Council has demanded that Iran stop enrichment, a process which can make both fuel for power plants and material for bombs. Tehran's refusal has led to three sets of limited sanctions since 2006.
Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday the Islamic Republic would not give up its right in the face of Western pressure, but did not explicitly mention nuclear work.

<title>Israel expels UN rights envoy who compared Israelis to Nazis</title>
<date>Mon Dec 15 13:31:09 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Professor Richard Falk, a United Nations envoy who once sparked controversy by comparing Israelis to Nazis, has been barred entry to Israel and was put on a plane bound out of the country early on Monday.
In March, the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council appointed Falk, a Jewish American and professor emeritus at Princeton University, to a six-year term monitoring the human rights situation as UN Special Rapporteur in the Palestinian territories. 
Israel's Foreign Ministry said in September that it would not allow Falk to enter the country, after the BBC quoted Falk as defending statements he made last year equating Israel's treatment of Palestinians with Nazi treatment of Jews during the Holocaust. Falk told BBC that Israel had  been unfairly shielded from international criticism.
Israel has also complained that Falk's mandate as an investigator was confined to human rights violations by Israel toward Palestinians and did not encompass violations by Palestinians toward Israelis.
Falk had been scheduled to hold meetings in Ramallah in the coming days with representatives of many human rights organizations. 
The Adalah rights organization Monday sent an urgent letter to Interior Minister Meir Sheetrit and Attorney General Menachem Mazuz, demanding that they lift the ban on Falk, which it called "a severe blow to the rights of the Palestinian civilian population living under Israeli occupation, a population which must be afforded protection by the occupier under international humanitarian law. 
The letter said it was "Israel's obligation as a member of the UN and a signatory to various international human rights conventions to respect the work of UN representatives, to enable their human rights missions and to assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities without fear ofrepercussions."
Prior to Falk's formal assumption of his duties, Israel had in the past allowed Falk to enter the country. This was the first time he had arrived in Israel in his role as Special Rapporteur.
The Foreign Ministry said that it has been made clear to Falk in advance that he would be denied entry into Israel, and that Israel would not cooperate with him.
"Falk was not invited by Israel, nor did he coordinate the visit, as UN regulations obligated him to do," said Simona Helprin, head of the Foreign Ministry's human rights department.
"It is indeed rare that Israel bars entry in this manner, but we cannot accept a situation in which an envoy arrives about whom it is known in advance that he will not carry out his role properly." 
According to Helprin, the UN is under an obligation to see that its envoys are objective and fair, while Falk has compared the situation in the territories with that of the Nazi Holocaust. "From Israel's standpoint, he is not objective," she said. 
The council's previous investigator, John Dugard from South Africa, compared Israeli treatment of Palestinians to apartheid, the discriminatory policy of the previous white regime in South Africa toward blacks.

<title>Israel likely to skip next UN racism conference</title>
<date>Wed Aug 06 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Israel will almost surely boycott the next UN racism conference in Geneva, its ambassador said Wednesday, warning that the meeting is likely to sink into the same anti-Semitism that prompted the U.S. and Israel to walk out of the last one seven years ago.
Itzhak Levanon, Israel's departing UN envoy in Geneva, said the event April 20-25, would need to be completely reworked for Israel to participate.
But with Libya chairing preparations and Iran and Cuba also involved, Levanon said the Geneva follow-up to the contentious 2001 conference in the South African city of Durban had the making of another international bashing of Israel.
"We want them to discuss human rights, and not only focus on Israel and turning this into an anti-Semitic event," he said in an interview with The Associated Press. We will attend the meeting only if there is a radical, substantive change.
The World Conference Against Racism ended three days before the Sept. 11, with a declaration and program of action that divided countries even as they agreed to it.
Dominated by clashes over the Middle East and the legacy of slavery, the U.S. and Israel walked out midway through the eight-day meeting over a draft resolution that singled out Israel for criticism and likened Zionism - the movement to establish and maintain a Jewish state - to racism.
Those references were removed from the final declaration, though it did cite the plight of the Palestinians as an issue without singling out Israel.
A parallel forum of non-governmental organizations, however, branded Israel as a racist apartheid state and called for an end to the "ongoing, Israeli systematic perpetration of racist crimes, including war crimes, acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing."
Levanon said the anti-Israel speeches at Durban were a shame and that Israel would not have any part in a repetition. But he said the nations that led the attacks on Israel have offered no encouraging signs that the next meeting will be different.
"Yes, the Europeans say it should not be anti-Semitic and the Israelis are demanding a focus on human rights around the world," he said. 
"But what about those that did the bashing? They've said nothing."
Canada is the only country that has explicitly said it will not take part in Durban II, arguing the meeting will promote racism and not combat it. In ads that appeared in April in newspapers such as the New York Sun and The Washington Times, 25 people including Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, law professor Alan Dershowitz and former CIA Director James Woolsey urged the U.S. to also skip the event, labeling it anti-Semitic.
"From what I've seen in the preparations, I'm afraid we're going to face the same scenario," Levanon said. Canada won't take part. 
"Israel most probably won't either. The United States and most of the Europeans will boycott 'Durban II' if this is going to be the case."
U.S. President George W. Bush's administration already has taken a symbolic position opposing the conference. In December, Washington cast the only no vote when the General Assembly passed a two-year UN budget because of objections to funding for the conference, which it considers anti-Israel. The U.S. State Department has said, however, that a decision whether to attend or boycott will be made closer to the time of the conference.
The Bush administration and the U.S. Senate also have taken a strong line against the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council, which like the Durban II preparations has been dominated by the same coalition of Muslim and African diplomats.
They have led the council to single out Israel for alleged abuses nearly a dozen times in its two-year existence. The body, meanwhile, has failed to criticize the Sudanese government over its conduct in Darfur and let Myanmar off lightly for its brutal crackdown last year on protesters.
The U.S. and Israel were among the four countries that rejected the 47-nation council's creation, and have both declined to run for seats. Last year, the U.S. Senate blocked the roughly U.S. $3 million Washington pays to finance it in protest.
Levanon, who has represented Israel at the council, said the body was a nice dream when it was designed to replace the Human Rights Commission, which was created after World War II under the leadership of former U.S. first lady Eleanor Roosevelt but later became bogged down in deep political fighting.
"The dream was to replace the commission with something more efficient, noble, objective and to protect human rights," said Levanon, who will return to Israel when his mandate ends later this month. "But if you see the results, it's not objective. It singles out only one country, Israel, and does nothing in Darfur or Myanmar."
"Things are happening there. People are killed," he added. 
"Where is the protection for human rights?"

<title>Israel to boycott 'Durban II' anti-racism conference</title>
<date>Wed Nov 19 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni announced Wednesday that Israel has made a final decision to boycott the United Nations "Durban II" conference on human rights this spring, fearing it would be used once again as a forum for anti-Israeli sentiment.
The World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, to be held in Geneva in April, is a follow-up to a 2001 summit in Durban, South Africa on the same issues.
"The documents prepared for the conference indicate that it is turning once again into an anti-Israeli tribunal, singling out and delegitimizing the State of Israel," Livni told Jewish-American leaders at the UJC General Assembly in Jerusalem. 
"The conference has nothing to do with fighting racism," she said. "In view of this situation, I decided that Israel will not participate and will not legitimize the Durban II conference."
The foreign minister also called on the international community "not to participate in a conference which seeks to legitimize hatred and extremism under the banner of a fight against racism."
Livni had said in February that Israel would botcott the meet, following assessment by the Foreign Ministry, and other Western governments, that it would be impossible to prevent the conference from turning into a festival of anti-Israeli attacks. 
South Africa hosted the first Durban conference in the summer of 2001 under the auspices of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. It was titled "The World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance," but most of the discussions revolved around Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. 
The United States and Israel responded by lowering the level of their diplomatic representation and eventually quit the conference, which culminated in a resolution equating Zionism and racism. 
The two country's issued over the draft texts branding Israel as a racist and apartheid state - language that was later dropped.
That conference had also provided a framework for a global convention of non-governmental organizations, which became a platform for delegitimizing Israel.
In August 2008, officials from 21 African countries held talks ahead of the Geneva conference and adopted a text which recommended it discuss, among other issues, "the plight of the Palestinian people under foreign occupations."
Canada has said it will not take part in the Geneva meeting. The United States, Britain, the Netherlands and France have said they may stay away if Israel's relations with Palestinians stands to eclipse all else.
In September, Navi Pillay, the UN's commissioner for human rights, urged all countries threatening to boycott the Geneva conference to reconsider their decision.

<title>Israel, U.S. to coordinate on Durban II boycott </title>
<date>Fri Apr 04 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Israel and the U.S. decided a few weeks ago to boycott the Durban II conference - scheduled for early 2009 and likely to harshly criticize Israel's human rights record - unless they receive firm guarantees that the event will not turn into anti-Israel festival.  
According to a senior government official, the joint decision was made after discussions among senior U.S. State Department and local Foreign Ministry officials, and after being raised in talks between Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Israel and the U.S. decided to make their participation in the conference conditional on guarantees the event would not become a rerun of the previous United Nations rights conference in Durban in 2001.  
"The burden of proof will be on the UN and the organizers," a Jerusalem source stated.  
The September 2001 conference in Durban, South Africa had been slated to deal with racism and xenophobia, sponsored by South Africa, the UN Human Rights Commission and the UN non-aligned states - a body dominated by Arab states. The conference was attended by official government delegations, as well as non-government organizations who dictated a hard anti-Israel and anti-Semitic line.  
The attacks on Israel included accusations of apartheid, that Zionism is racism, and that the Holocaust is not a unique event but similar to other events in history. Delegates also said Israel was "born in sin," the result of ethnic cleansing of Arabs and that in the present, it is committing genocide against Palestinians.  
U.S. and Israel's representatives walked out of the conference in protest at these attacks.  
Israel and world Jewish organizations have begun a campaign against the upcoming conference, although it still has no final date or location. In February, the Foreign Ministry held its first coordinating meeting and another will be held next month in Geneva, under the auspices of the UN Watch monitoring group, and will discuss strategies to prevent anti-Semitism and attacks on Israel at the follow-up conference.  
So far, Canada has announced plans to boycott the conference and Israel is trying to convince other countries to make their participation conditional on preventing a similar agenda.  
Jerusalem estimates that conference organizers will try to blur the real agenda until the last minute to draw in as many UN members as possible. "We are concerned this time too there will be criticism and an anti-Semitic attack," a Foreign Ministry official said. "What can you expect from a conference whose organizers include Cuba, Iran and North Korea."  
On Wednesday, many major U.S. newspapers ran an advertisement signed by 25 public figures including former politicians, religious leaders and intellectuals, calling on the government to boycott the conference. Signatories included Nobel Prize laureate Elie Wiesel, former CIA chief James Woolsey and law professor Alan Dershowitz. The signatories called on Rice to announce a boycott of the conference, denouncing it as a platform for anti-Semitism "slated to encourage hatred of Israel and the U.S."  
The U.S. decision to boycott the conference came in coordination with Israel. The two countries agreed to publish a joint statement similar to Livni's recent announcement that Israel plans to boycott the conference as long as it serves as a platform for anti-Semitism and anti-Israel sentiment.  
A Jerusalem official expressed regret that there appears to be no change in the conference's agenda. "Israel is sorry that the UN secretary general and the UN Human Rights Commission are not doing enough to change the content despite their dissatisfaction.  
"This is another example of how a UN-sponsored conference to fight racism and xenophobia is about to become an arena for extreme political Israel-bashing, while ignoring areas in the world where racism, religious persecution and intolerance of foreigners, are rampant."  
Israel plans to continue combating the planned conference content together with Jewish groups and the U.S. and Canadian governments.

<title>Jimmy Carter to visit Syria, Lebanon next week</title>
<date>Fri Dec 05 22:43:54 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Former President Jimmy Carter plans to meet with Syrian President Bashar Assad and other officials to discuss prospects for peace in the Middle East during visits to Lebanon and Syria next week.
The Carter Center said Friday that Carter will lead a pre-electoral assessment mission in Lebanon. The center is considering observing parliamentary elections scheduled for the spring.
Carter also will address students, faculty, and invited guests at the American University of Beirut on Dec. 12.
He will speak on 30 years after Camp David: A memo to the Arab World, Israel and the Quartet.
The Camp David Accords were a peace treaty brokered by Carter and signed by Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin on September 17, 1978.
Many Israel supporters slammed Carter for his 2006 book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid", in which Carter argues that the primary obstacle to Middle East peace is "Israel's continued control and colonization of Palestinian land."

<title>John McCain speech to AIPAC, June 2008</title>
<date>Wed Oct 29 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Thank you very much. Thank you for that kind welcome and thank you, Ron, for your generous remarks and the invitation to address you. I see that we have some students here, including a few from Arizona and I welcome you to Washington and your money and it's--it's a pleasure as always to be in the company of the men and women of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
And I know that all of us are proud to be in the company of my dear and beloved, distinguished Senator from the State of Connecticut, my dear friend, Joe Lieberman. Joe, thank you; a man of humility, a man of kindness, and a great and dear friend--not only of America--my family, State of Israel and the world.
My friends, all of you involved in the work of AIPAC have taken up a great and vital cause and a cause set firmly in the American heart. When President Truman recognized the new State of Israel 60 years ago he acted on the highest ideals and best instincts of our country. He was a man with courage and a sense of history; and he surely knew what great challenges the Jewish State would face in its early years. To his lasting credit, he resolved that the people of Israel would not face them alone because they would always have a friend and ally in the United States of America.
The cause of Israel and of our common security has also depended on men and women of courage, and I've been lucky enough to know quite a few of them. I think often of one in particular, the late Senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson. I got to know Senator Jackson when I was the Navy Liaison Officer to the United States Senate. In 1979, I traveled with him to Israel where I knew he was considered a hero. But I had no idea just how admired he was until we landed in the airport in Tel Aviv to find a crowd of 700 or 800 Israelis calling out his name, waving signs that read God Bless You Scoop and Senator Jackson, Thank You. Scoop Jackson had the special respect of the Jewish people, the kind of respect accorded to brave and faithful friends. He was and remains the model of what an American Statesman should be.
The people of Israel reserve a special respect for courage because so much courage has been required of them. In the record of history sheer survival in the face of Israel's many trials would have been impressive enough but Israel has achieved much more than that these past 60 years. Israel has endured and thrived and their people have built a nation that's an inspiration to free nations everywhere.
Yet no matter how successful a nation of Israel or how far removed from the Holocaust their experiences will never pass from memory. Not long ago I was in Jerusalem with Senator Lieberman and our colleague Lindsay Graham, and we went to the Holocaust Memorial, Yad Vashem. And for all the boundless examples of cruelty and inhumanity to be found there, for all the pain and grief remembered there, somehow I was especially moved by the story of the camp survivors who died from the very nourishment given to them by their liberators. They'd starved and suffered so much that their bodies were too weak even for food. They endured it all, only to die at the moment of their deliverance. These are the kinds of experiences that the Jewish people carry in memory and they are far from the worst experiences of the Holocaust. 
These are the kinds of grieves and afflictions from which the State of Israel offered escape, and today when we join in saying never again that is not a wish or request or a plea to the enemies of Israel; it is a promise that the United States and Israel will honor against any enemy, against enemy - any enemy  - against any enemy who cares to test us.
The threats to Israel's security are large and growing and America's commitment must grow as well. I strongly support the increase in military aid to Israel scheduled to begin in October. I am committed to making certain Israel maintains its qualitative military edge. Israel's enemies are too numerous - Israel's enemies are too numerous, its margin of error too small, and our shared interests and values too great for us to follow any other policy. Foremost - foremost in all our minds is the threat posed by the regime in Tehran. The Iranian President has called for Israel to be wiped off the map and suggested that Israel's Jewish population should return to Europe. He calls Israel a stinking corpse; that it's on its way to annihilation but the Iranian leadership does far more than issue vial insults. It acts in ways directly detrimental to the security of Israel and the United States. A sponsor of both Hamas and Hezbollah, the leadership of Iran has repeatedly used violence to undermine Israel in the Middle East peace process; it has trained, financed, and equipped extremists in Iraq who have killed American soldiers, fighting to bring freedom to that country. It remains the world's chief sponsor of terrorism and threatens to destabilize the entire Middle East from Basra to Beirut.
Tehran's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons poses an unacceptable risk, a danger we cannot allow. Emboldened by nuclear weapons, Iran would feel free to sponsor terrorist attacks--any--against any perceived enemy. It's flouting of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty would render that agreement obsolete and could induce Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and others to join a nuclear arms race. The world would have to live indefinitely with the possibility that Tehran might pass nuclear materials or weapons to one of its allied terrorist networks. Armed as well with its ballistic missile arsenal an Iranian nuclear bomb would pose an existential threat to the people of Israel.
European negotiators have proposed a peaceful end-game for Tehran should it abandon its nuclear ambitions and comply with the UN Security Council Resolutions. The plan offers far-reaching economic incentives, external support for a civilian nuclear energy and program, and integration into the international community. But Tehran has said no. The Iranians have spent years working toward a nuclear program and the idea that they now seek nuclear weapons because we refuse to engage in Presidential level talks is a serious misreading of history.
In reality - in reality a series of Administrations have tried to talk to Iran and none harder - none tried harder than the Clinton Administration. In 1998 the Secretary of State made a public overture to the Iranians, laid out a road map to normal relations and for two years tried to engage. The Clinton Administration even lifted some sanctions and Secretary Albright apologized for American actions going back to the 1950s. But even under President Khatami a man by all accounts less radical than the current President, Iran rejected these overtures. Even so we hear talk of a meeting with the Iranian leadership offered up as if it were some sudden inspiration, a bold new idea that somehow nobody has ever thought of before. 
Yet it's hard to see what such a Summit with President Ahmadinejad would actually gain except an earful of anti-Semitic rants and a worldwide audience for a man who denies one Holocaust and talks before frenzied crowds about starting another. 
Such a spectacle would harm Iranian moderates and dissidents as the radicals and hardliners strengthen their position and suddenly acquire the appearance of respectability. Rather than sitting down unconditionally with the Iranian President or Supreme Leader in the hope that we can talk sense into them, we must create the weary world pressures that will peacefully but decisively change the path that they are on. Essential to this strategy - essential to this strategy is the UN Security Council which should impose progressively tougher political and economic sanctions. Should the Security Council continue to delay in this responsibility, the United States must lead like-minded countries in imposing multi-lateral sanctions outside the UN framework. I'm proud to have been a leader on these issues for years having co-authored the 1992 Iran/Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act.
Over a year ago I proposed applying sanctions to restrict Iran's ability to import refined petroleum products on which it is highly dependent and the time has come for an international campaign to do just that. A severe limit on Iranian imports of gasoline would create immediate pressure on Khomeini and Ahmadinejad to change course and to cease in the pursuit of nuclear weapons. At the same time, we need the support of those in the region who are most concern about Iran and of our European partners as well. They can help by imposing targeted sanctions that will impose a heavy cost on the regime's leaders, including the denial of visas and freezing of assets; as a further measure to contain and deter Iran, the United States should impose financial sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran which aids in Iran's terrorism and weapons proliferation. We must--we must apply the full force of law to prevent business dealings with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps.
I was pleased - I was pleased to join Senators Lieberman and Kyle in backing an Amendment calling for the designation of the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization responsible for killing American troops in Iraq. Over three-quarters of the Senate supported this obvious step, but not Senator Obama. He opposed this Resolution because its support for countering Iranian influence in Iraq was he said quote a wrong message not only to the world but also to the region. But here too, he's mistaken; holding Iran's influence in check and holding a terrorist organization accountable sends exactly the right message to Iran, to the region, and to the world.
We should privatize the sanctions against Iran by launching a worldwide divestment campaign. As more people--businesses, pension funds, and financial institutions across the world divest from companies doing business with Iran the radical elite who run that country will become even more unpopular than they are already.
Years ago - years ago the moral clarity and conviction of civilized nations came together in a divestment campaign against South Africa helping to rid that nation of the evil of apartheid. In our day, we must use that same power and moral conviction against the regime in Iran and help - and help to safeguard the people of Israel and the peace of the world. In all of this, we will not only be defending our own safety and welfare, but also the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people. They are a great - they are a great and civilized people with little sympathy for the terrorists their leaders finance and no wish to threaten other nations with nuclear weapons. 
Iran's rulers would be very different if the people themselves had a choice in the matter and American policy should always reflect their hopes for a freer and more just society.
The same holds true - the same holds true for the Palestinian people most of whom ask only for a better life in a less violent world. They are badly served by the terrorist led group in charge of Gaza; this is a group that still refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist, refuses to denounce violence, and refuses to acknowledge prior peace commitments. They deliberately target Israeli civilians in an attempt to terrorize the Jewish population. They spread violence and hatred and with every new bombing they setback the cause of their own people.
During my last visit to Israel in March I saw for myself the work of Hamas in the town of Sderot just across the Border as you know from Gaza. I saw the houses that had been hit by Hamas rockets; in the face of injuries, death, and destruction thousands of Israelis have had to flee. Many others have stayed to carry on as best they can. I visited the home of a man named Pinhas Amar, who lives with his disabled wife, Aliza and their children. One day last year the sirens sounded again to alert the town to incoming rocket-fire. The rest of the family found cover. Aliza on the other side of the house was knocked out of her wheelchair and struck by shrapnel. This occurred on December 17th and from that day until the day of my visit just some three months later, more than 1,000 rockets had struck Sderot. Today, siren warnings are commonplace; the elementary schools are surrounded by concrete shelters and children walking the streets in costume for Purim celebrations did so in fear.
No nation in the world would allow its population to be attacked so incessantly, to be killed and intimidated so mercilessly without responding. And the nation of Israel is no exception. Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are engaged in talks that all of us hope will yield progress toward peace. Yet while we encourage this process we must also insure that Israel's people can live in safety until there is a Palestinian leadership willing and able to deliver peace. The peace process that places face in terrorists can never end in peace and we do no favors to the Palestinian people by conferring approval upon the terrorist syndicate that has seized power in Gaza.
Likewise, Israel's chance for enduring peace with Lebanon depends on a Lebanese government that has a monopoly on authority within its country's borders. That means no independent militias, no Hezbollah fighters, no weapons and equipment flowing to Hezbollah. Hezbollah fighters recently took up arms against their fellow Lebanese starting the worst internal fighting since the Civil War ended in 1990. In the process they extracted an agreement for a new political arrangement in which Hezbollah and its allies can veto any Cabinet decision. As a leader of Hezbollah often reminds us, this group's mission is the defeat of Israel. The international community needs to more fully empower our allies in Lebanon, not only with military aid but also with the resources to undermine Hezbollah's appeal - better schools, hospitals, roads and power generation and the like. We simply cannot afford to cede Lebanon's future to Syria and Iran.
And we have an additional task; in the summer of 2006 Hamas and Hezbollah kidnapped - kidnapped three young Israelis, Gilad Shalit, Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser. And they've held them ever since. I met with the families of two of these men in December 2006 and heard firsthand about their ordeal. I committed then to bring attention to their situation, to insist that the Geneva Conventions are observed and call for the swift release of these men.
These men are being unlawfully held and they must be set free and--and returned home to Israel. 
Another great - matter of great importance to the security of both America and Israel is Iraq. You would never know from listening to those who are still caught up in angry arguments over yesterday's options but our troops in Iraq have made hard-one progress under General Petraeus' new strategy. And Iraqi political leaders have moved ahead slowly and insufficiently but forward nonetheless. Sectarian violence declined dramatically; Sunnis in Anbar Province and throughout Iraq are cooperating in the fight against Al Qaeda and Shia extremist militias no longer control Basra. The Malaki government and its forces are in charge. Al Qaeda terrorists are on the run and our troops are going to make sure that they never - never come back.
It's worth recalling that America's progress in Iraq is the direct result of the new strategy that Senator Obama vehemently opposed. It was the strategy he predicted would fail when he voted to cut off funds for our forces in Iraq. He now says he intends to withdraw combat troops from Iraq one to two brigades per month until they're all removed. He will do so regardless of the conditions in Iraq, regardless of the consequences for our national security, regardless of Israel's security and in disregard of the best advice of our Commander's on the ground. This course will result in a catastrophe. If our troops are ordered to make a forced retreat we risk all out civil war genocide and a failed state in the heart of the Middle East. 
Al Qaeda terrorists would rejoice in the defeat of the United States; allowing a potential terrorist sanctuary would profoundly affect the security of the United States, Israel, and our other friends and would invite further intervention from Iraq's neighbors, including a very much emboldened Iran.
We must not let this happen. We must not leave the region to suffer chaos, terrorist violence, and a wider war. My friends, as the people of Israel know better than most, the safety of free people can never be taken for granted. And in a world full of dangers, Israel and the United States must always stand together.
The State of Israel stands as a singular achievement in many ways and not the least is its achievement as the great democracy of the Middle East. If there are ties between America and Israel that critics of our alliance have never understood perhaps that's because they do not fully understand the love of liberty and the pursuit of justice. But they should know--they should know those ties cannot be broken. We were brought together by shared ideals and by shared adversity; we have been comrades in struggle and trusted partners in the quest for peace. We are the most natural of allies and like Israel itself - that alliance is forever. Thank you.

<title>Leftist groups gather in Tel Aviv to protest 41 years of occupation</title>
<date>Sun Jun 08 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Assorted left-wing groups on Saturday gathered in Tel Aviv for a protest marking Israel's 41-year occupation of Palestinian land, which began when Israel conquered in the Six-Day War in June  1967.
Members of Gush Shalom, the Hadash political party, the Committee against House Demolition, Anarchists against the Wall concluded their march at Meir Park, which Friday was the starting point for Tel Aviv's 11th annual Gay Pride parade. The protesters were joined by representatives from the Coalition of Women for Peace, the Communist Youth League of Israel and the Socialist struggle movement.
"We demonstrate here against the occupation, against the war, against the unjustified reign over a foreign people - the people of Palestine," said Or Shay, a member of the Communist youth league.  
The march itself departed from a nearby meeting point and protesters of all ages marched under police escort to the park.
Gush Shalom spokesman Adam Keller, one of the event's organizers, drew a parallel with between the situation of Palestinians in the West Bank and that of Black South Africans under Apartheid.
"When I look at the [West Bank] roads which are only for Israelis, I would say this is a specific apartheid feature which did not exist actually in apartheid South Africa, but it could have been.  It is certainly fitting with the mindset of apartheid."
In an unusual step, the march was followed by small discussion groups. According to Keller, "We decided that it is better that we have circles where everybody could express his or her opinion rather than a rally where we have a few speakers who make speeches and then everybody claps and goes."
Despite the overall peaceful nature of the rally, marchers did face some opposition to their protest. According to one demonstrator, a woman told him "you're sick. Go do this march at the kibbutzim that are now being bombed in the south."

<title>Lieberman to Carter: Meeting Meshal will only heighten terror</title>
<date>Wed Apr 16 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Yisrael Beiteinu Chairman Avigdor Lieberman on Wednesday urged former U.S. president Jimmy Carter to cancel his plans to meet with Hamas' exiled leader Khaled Meshal, saying such talks would only heighten terror.
During their talks Wednesday, Lieberman presented Carter with his program for territorial exchange, which calls for the transfer of land and their local populations as the optimal solution for peace.
According to an associate of Lieberman, Carter seemed interested by the idea of realigning borders according to population. In response to Carter's question concerning the fate of Arabs not living by the border, Lieberman said: "Whoever declares their faith in the state can remain here and those that do not cannot."
Carter said that he was pleased to have had the opportunity to meet with Lieberman, adding that he had come to the region to hear all sides of the conflict. No further details were released on the meeting.
Aside from Lieberman, President Shimon Peres and Shas leader Eli Yishai are the only senior Israeli leaders to have met with Carter. Other Israeli officials have shunned the former U.S. president over his contacts with the Islamist group.
Meanwhile, Hamas said on Wednesday that Carter would meet two of its leaders from Gaza in Egypt, in further defiance of Israeli leaders.
Hamas official Ayman Taha told Reuters senior leaders Mahmoud al-Zahar and Saeed Seyam would travel to Cairo later in the day for talks with Carter, who began a Middle East visit on Sunday.
"Mr. Carter asked for the meeting. He wanted to hear the Hamas vision regarding the situation, and we are interested in clarifying our position and emphasising the rights of our people," Taha said.
Carter's delegation in Israel declined to comment.
Carter had wanted to visit the Gaza Strip, which is governed by Hamas, but Israel rejected his request.
All the border crossings between Israel and the Gaza Strip are controlled by Israel. Egyptian forces are stationed at Gaza's southern border, which is usually closed.
On Tuesday, in the occupied West Bank, Carter met Nasser Shaer, who served as deputy prime minister in the Hamas-led government that the United States and other Western powers boycotted.
Hamas, which took control of the Gaza Strip by force in June from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah faction, has rejected Western demands to recognize Israel, renounce violence and accept existing Israeli-Palestinian interim peace deals.
Carter has angered the Israeli government with plans to meet Hamas' top leader, Khaled Meshal, in Syria, and by describing Israeli policy in the occupied Palestinian territories as "a system of apartheid" in a 2006 book.
Carter, a broker of Israel's 1979 peace treaty with Egypt, met Israel's ceremonial president Shimon Peres on Sunday but was shunned by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and other policymakers.
Carter stressed he was not acting during his current regional visit as negotiator or mediator but that he hoped, "just as a communicator", to relay to leaders of the United States what Hamas and Syria have to say.
Shaer said he and Carter had discussed efforts to broker an unofficial truce between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.
He said Carter had also voiced a desire to help in trying to end the enmity between Hamas and Fatah.
Israel and Washington have sought to isolate Hamas and bolster Abbas, who has entered U.S.-backed peace talks with Olmert.
Like Israel, the Bush administration opposes Carter's planned meeting with Meshal.

Date: Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 IST 2008
Moishe Smith of Ottawa, Canada, is the first non-U.S. citizen elected president of B'nai B'rith International
Smith has long focused on B'nai B'rith's public policy arena and has developed expertise on a broad range of issues. He led B'nai B'rith Canada's first-ever mission to the Soviet Union; served as Chair of the International Council of B'nai B'rith; Vice Chair of the Center forHuman Rights and Public Policy; and for many years served as a member of the B'nai B'rith Delegation to the World Zionist Organization.
Before being named President of BBI, Smith completed two terms as Chairman of the Executive. He also served two consecutive two-year terms as a Senior International Vice President. Professionally, Smith is in the food and hospitality industry, with restaurants across Canada and headquarters in Ottawa.  Smith also sits on the board of the Ottawa Food Bank, the Ottawa Tourism & Convention Association, the Ottawa Restaurant Association, and the Canada Israel Committee.
Readers can send questions to: rosnersdomain@haaretz.co.il
Last one, also from a reader:
Please see that he gets it.
Dear Mr. Smith,
Do you see anti-Semitism in North America as a problem - or is it mostly something of the past (clearly, europe is another story).
Thank you,
Ravi Tal
Mr. Tal, thank you for raising this important issue.
We all see, on a regular basis, horrific examples of antisemitic inEurope, indeed, in many parts of the world.  North America is not immuneto this rising tide of hate.
We have seen a significant increase in anti-Israel rhetoric andactivities as of late.  And, anti-Israel activities often turnantisemitic.
College campuses are a case in point. Anti-Israel bias turned toantisemitism at Concordia University in Canada.  The recent speech byIranian President Ahmadinejad at Columbia University in New York alsofanned the flames of hate.
Did you know that February 3-9 is Israel Apartheid Week around theworld?  Again, it's only a short leap from anti-Israel sentiment toantisemitism.
In communities around North America, Jewish cemeteries have beendesecrated, synagogues have been defaced, and antisemitic graffiti hasshowered the streets.  All are more common than they have been indecades. These days, no part of the world is immune to antisemitism.
What are we doing about this? It is the goal of B'nai B'rithInternational to use education programs, like Diverse Minds YouthWriting Challenge and Enlighten America essay contests to teach tolerance to the next generation.
On college campuses, we are taking direct action through a joint programwith Alpha Epsilon Pi (AEPi), a historically Jewish fraternity; KappaAlpha Psi, a historically African-American fraternity; and B'nai B'rith.A Black-Jewish Relations series of programs will be coming to a numberof U.S. campuses this spring to forge understanding, foster ongoingrelationships, and build on similarities rather than differences.
B'nai B'rith International continues to identify and undermine acts ofintolerance and antisemitism in North America and around the world.  Ourwork in support of tolerance and human rights continues at theOrganization of American States (OAS), the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE), the United Nations, and before theCanadian and U.S. governments.  Unfortunately, our work is far fromdone.
Moishe
Another one, this time from a reader:
Dear Mr. Smith,
Excuse me for this question, but what exactly is the role of B'nai Brith today and why to we still need it? I have the impression that there are more Jewish organizations working for Jews than there are Jews. Aren't abolishing organizations a part of this "new definition" we need for the Jewish world?
I know this might be a provocative question to ask you, and do not expect that you agree with me. But please, help me understand your point of view.
Thank you,
Gabriel Goold
Thank you Gabriel, for asking a truly important question. It'll allow meto talk about an organization that I've been deeply involved in for morethan 25 years. And to address the very real issue of the relevancy ofB'nai B'rith, 165 years after it was founded.
First off, B'nai B'rith has been a ground breaking humanitarian, humanrights, and advocacy organization since 1843.  Jewish unity is just asimportant today as when a group of German immigrants established B'naiB'rith to help Jewish widows and orphans. Today, BBI's reach extends tomore than 50 countries around the world. That's no small feat. In someplaces, the small Jewish community of Uruguay comes to mind, B'naiB'rith serves as the link to the broader Jewish community, and alsoprovides an umbrella to shield and protect a small Jewish population.
Today, B'nai B'rith, as it has since its inception, fights againstantisemitism and anti-Israel bias. We do this on our own, througheducational programs, and within a broader coalition of Jewish groups.Sometimes, teaming up with other Jewish organizations gives us a biggervoice.
And that actually leads to your comment, "I have the impression that here are more Jewish organizations working for Jews than there are Jews."
That's an interesting way to see things. But what I see is a wonderful array of Jewish groups, each with its own unique and important mission. Sure we overlap on some topics, such as fighting antisemitism. But there are so many issues central not just to the Jewish community, but to the broader global community, that different Jewish groups specialize in.
Having a wide range of Jewish groups concentrating on a wide range of subjects ensures lots of Jewish voices get heard. There's a home for every opinion. And this ensures the Jewish community stays vital in the world. I don't think "abolishing" Jewish organizations, as you put it, would or should be a part of any plan that could help Jews the world over. We are a small community, constantly having to watch our backs. Yet thanks to the dedicated work of so many Jewish groups, we not only look after our most basic issue - our survival - but we can also focus on helping our own community and helping others.
So back to what we do and why it's important. Another critical role wefill is providing senior housing and advocacy on issues of concern toseniors and their families. BBI is the largest national Jewish sponsorof senior housing in the United States and operates nearly 50 fixed-income and market rate housing facilities worldwide. The United States government has even suggested our senior housing experts to foreign governments trying to deal with their own issues of senior housing.
We meet with law makers on a regular basis to ensure senior issues,especially pertaining to healthcare, are front and center. BBI bringsprograms and services to seniors and gives them the opportunity to takecontrol of their own futures.
Helping communities in crisis is an often overlooked, yet criticalresource we provide.  B'nai B'rith has been engaged in disaster reliefsince 1865.  Our Disaster Relief Fund has provided aid to populationsaffected by natural and man-made catastrophes around the world. Ourdisaster relief is on a different scale and with a different focus thanthat of organizations such as the Red Cross. Our focus is to help acommunity get back on its feet, after immediate disaster relief groupshave tended to immediate needs of food and shelter, and have left. B'naiB'rith continues to rebuild houses in New Orleans. We donated money tosynagogues and churches to help worshippers get back something importantto their spiritual needs. That's an ongoing commitment we make tocommunities. After the tsunami in Southeast Asia, we helped fundbusiness cooperatives so residents could learn a new trade, or have aplace to continue the line of work they already knew before the tsunamihit. After the fall 2007 earthquake in Peru, we sent medical teams tohelp people with ongoing medical issues.
In world affairs, B'nai B'rith has a big voice at the United Nations.BBI has served as an NGO (non governmental organization) at the UnitedNations since its inception. In fact, B'nai B'rith is the only Jewishorganization with an office dedicated exclusively to United Nationsaffairs. We meet with ambassadors and world leaders and give a voice toJewish communities and concerns.
Our World Center in Jerusalem serves as our eyes and ears in Israel.It's the voice of the B'nai B'rith community to the Israeli government.We provided books to Israel Defense Forces soldiers in 2006, so whenthey had a small break from the war in Lebanon, they had a positivedistraction. This is one way we are making a difference in Israel.
But of course, this organization is only as strong its members andsupporters. The only way a group as old and established as B'nai B'rithcan continue to grow and thrive, and can continue to further the Jewishcause, and pursue humanitarian issues and human rights, and stayrelevant, is to seek input and ideas from people - from both within andoutside our organization.
Gabriel, you demonstrated with your question how high the bar is forB'nai B'rith and how important it is to hear from the community atlarge. Thank you.
--Moishe
Dear Moishe,
And what will Israel have to do if it wants to play a role in this new partnership?
SR
Hi shmuel,
For such a partnership to work, Israel and the Diaspora both havecrucial roles to play.
The Diaspora must remain connected to Israel - the home for all Jews.One way B'nai B'rith keeps open the dialogue between young people fromthe U.S. and from Israel is through our Camp Passport program. Each ofthe past five summers, Israeli children have attended one of two B'naiB'rith summer camps, all expenses paid. The program allows Israelichildren between the ages of 10 and 16 who have been directly affectedby terrorism to recapture a bit of their childhood, while they learnabout American Jewish children, and in turn teach American kids aboutlife in Israel.  Summer camp, a rite of passage for many American kids,takes on an important context when Israeli children take part. Theprogram, heading into its sixth summer, enables American children andIsraeli children to learn about each other in a casual atmosphere.
Another wonderful partnership that we can talk about is the Birthrightprogram. Sending young Americans to Israel to see and feel first-handwhat Jews fight so hard for everyday is a brilliant program. But the twoweeks Americans spend there can't be the end of it. Many young Jews comeback feeling very connected to Israel, but that quickly wanes. We mustcapitalize on those feelings. We can encourage on-going discussiongroups with those who have visited Israel to keep their attachmentalive. And perhaps there can be a reverse Birthright -- where Israeliyoung people can visit other Jewish communities around the world tolearn how Jews outside of Israel celebrate their heritage and culture.
We can encourage modern-day pen-pals- through email, of course - whereyoung Israelis are paired with young Americans and they can learn aboutday-to-day life in each other's countries.
Of course the government of Israel must be engaged in the educationprocess as well for such a partnership to work. Perhaps some sectionscould be added to the school curriculum to really show Israeli youth howDiaspora Jews helped in the creation of Israel. Seeing that Jews aroundthe world marched to establish the Jewish state, raised money forIsrael's defence, and sent people to visit - many of whom ended upmaking aliyah, could be "news" to today's young Israelis. Israeli youthcan learn how American candidates for high office seek out the Jewishcommunity as a vital support network.
I am fortunate that in my position as B'nai B'rith Internationalpresident, I get to travel throughout Israel and meet a wide range ofIsraelis, from government leaders to victims of terror attacks. I havelearned from my trips that Israelis have a keen understanding of howdeeply American Jews are attached to the Holy Land. 
Moishe
Dear Moishe,
Let's expand this discussion by asking the following question: 
It appears that the Jewish Diaspora, especially the younger generation, is moving away from Israel. Do you think there's a need for a new definition of the relations between the communities - maybe a new covenant - and what should it be?
Best
Rosner
Shmuel, I'm glad you brought this issue up.
Attracting the next generation to all things Jewish is a problem for every Jewish organization and the Diaspora communities generally: Attachment to Holocaust remembrance, to synagogues, to Jewish philanthropy and indeed to Israel are all issues of concern.
I believe the next generation views Israel as a strong, vibrant country, yet they have no attachment to the pioneering enterprise that helped build Israel into the strong country that it is today. I also don?t think that young people have a good understanding of the obstacles Israelis face in their daily lives. That?s where the disconnect is.
The concepts of aliyah and Zionism are not as palatable for them as they were for my generation.
The Diaspora must remain connected to Israel ? the home for all Jews. 
I think a new partnership is in order. We can do this by assisting constantly and consistently with those who want to make aliyah. We must also undertake an educational process that encourages the next generation to forge strong Diaspora communities.
We should aim to introduce cross-cultural partnerships on a large scale. This would inspire younger people to advocate on behalf of Israel -- a concept that I would call modern Zionism.
Dear Moishe,
In a recent poll conducted by BBI
Do you agree with this position of the majority of Israelis? Do you see any role that Diaspora Jews should be playing in the discussion over the future of Jerusalem? What should it be?
Thank you,
Shmuel
Thank you for inviting me to participate in this conversation, Shmuel. I appreciate the opportunity.
The B'nai B'rith International poll that you are referring to yielded some very thought-provoking results on a variety of topics, and I found the poll results very interesting.
On the particular question that you ask, I believe that the Jewish community in the Diaspora has been committed to a united Jerusalem for decades. While I respect the views of the citizens of Israel, Jerusalem is central to the being of every Jew, wherever they live.
Israel isn't a country unlike any other. Israel as a country hasstakeholders, not only from within the country, but from outside the country - all over the world.
While the ultimate decision will be in the hands of the citizens ofIsrael, we in the Diaspora not only want to express our opinion, we have a right and indeed a duty to have an opinion.
Moishe
Moishe,
I need a follow up on this one: everybody has the right to an opinion on any matter. The question, though, is whether you expect your opinion to have some impact on decisions made by the Israeli government.
If you - what impact, and how do you expect this to happen?
SR
A good follow-up question, Shmuel.
We hope Diaspora Jews have some impact on decisions, or at least on the thought-processes that Israeli Jews are using to make decisions about Israel and Jerusalem. Though Diaspora Jews of course don't live in Israel, we support Israel, emotionally and financially. It's the homeland of all Jews.
How this impact could happen could be through talking with Israelis, sharing our ideas, meeting with officials to share our ideas. Also perhaps, by holding information forums in the Diaspora communities, where Israeli government officials, Israeli citizens, and Diaspora Jewry all have an opportunity to exchange ideas, so that we all could understand one another's opinions.
I am convinced that the citizens of Israel and the Jews of the Diaspora are on the same page when it comes to the future of Israel and Jerusalem.
The final decision is still in the hands of our brothers and sisters inIsrael. We just need to be part of the debate.
Moishe

<title>Nadine Gordimer defends decision to attend J'lem writers conference </title>
<date>Wed Apr 30 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
South African writer Nadine Gordimer on Tuesday defended her decision to attend a writers conference in Israel next month, saying that her "comrades" should have no doubts about her "solidarity with the struggle - our struggle - against apartheid."
Gordimer noted that her invitation came not from the Israeli government but from Mishkenot Sha'ananim. About 15 foreign and 40 Israeli writers are expected to attend the mid-May five-day gathering.  
The 1991 Nobel Prize for Literature laureate had been under enormous pressure at home and abroad to boycott the conference. Last weekend she said she decided to attend after arranging to meet with Palestinians as well as Israelis.  
Her remarks Tuesday came in a statement she released from her Johannesburg home. Gordimer, a longtime supporter of the African National Congress and an outspoken critic of Israeli policies, suggested that the purpose of the festival "is to assert vitally that whatever violent, terrible, bitter and urgent chasms of conflict lie between peoples, the only solutions for peace and justice exist and must begin with both sides talking to one another."  
Acknowledging that Hamas denies "the right of Israel to exist," Gordimer nonetheless said it must be part of the solution. She urged the Palestinian Islamist movement not to forget "that Nelson Mandela went, was escorted from and returned to Pollsmore Prison, for a face-to-face meeting with apartheid president P.W. Botha." 
She reminded those urging her to boycott the festival of her endorsements of Ronnie Kasrils' 'Not in our name'" statement. The December 2001 letter by the Jewish cabinet minister and former ANC rebel was signed by "South Africans of Jewish descent." It said "the root cause" of the second intifada was Israel's occupation of the territories and urged Israel to renew negotiations with the Palestinians.  
Gordimer's letter noted that she will visit Ramallah and meet in Jerusalem with students at the Palestinian Al-Quds University. She ended it by stating, "I shall do my utmost to uphold the principles and practice I have held, and still hold, at home in our country."

<title>New laws would revoke terrorists' citizenship </title>
<date>Wed Jul 09 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Israeli Arabs and their families could be deprived of citizenship if involved in terrorism, under legislation the Knesset approved in a preliminary reading yesterday.   
The six bills ban terrorists' families from setting up mourning tents and similar displays, and two also revoke former MK Azmi Bishara's pension benefits.  
The vote came hours after a Palestinian man went on a deadly rampage in downtown Jerusalem, ramming a bulldozer into a crowded bus and a string of vehicles, killing at least four people and wounding dozens.  
"Look what bills were approved today," said Balad faction whip Jamal Zahalka. "A racist fever is washing over the Knesset. It is hurtling down the slope toward open apartheid and racism is becoming the law."  
Hadash chairman Mohammad Barakeh said "the Knesset operates like a kangaroo court."   
The six bills were proposed by MKs Yuli Edelstein (Likud) and Nissan Slomiansky (National Union-National Religious Party), and were approved by an overwhelming majority in the Knesset.  
Slomiansky proposed granting the interior minister the authority to revoke the permanent residency of East Jerusalem residents involved in terror and those of their families.   
"There is a limit to how far democracy does. It is shocking that a person is given a blue [Israeli] ID card and he uses it to carry out terror attacks," he said.  
Edelstein's proposal suggests that the citizenship or permanent residency of any person participating in terrorist acts against Israel should be revoked. Edelstein said that this amendment must be made "once and for all."   
The legislative ministerial committee had originally planned not to approve this bill, however in the wake of yesterday's terror attack, the cabinet chose to refrain from taking a stance.  
The police said that yesterday's terror attack perpetrator was a resident of East Jerusalem and had a blue ID card. He also had a criminal record.  
The bills denying Bishara's pension were presented by MKs Zvi Hendel, Yitzhak Levy and Effi Eitam (National Union).

Gordimer confirms J'lem festival attendance 
Nadine Gordimer has confirmed she will participate in the International Writer's Festival in Jerusalem next month, allaying concerns that she would cancel due to political pressure. The 84-year-old South African Nobel laureate had warned festival organizers last week that she would cancel unless they arranged meetings for her with Palestinians. She reportedly said her attendance was perceived at home as support for apartheid in Israel. "She will meet with Sari Nusseibeh, with students from Al-Quds University, travel to Ramallah with [Meretz MK] Haim Oron, and meet with Robi Damelin of the Parents Circle organization of bereaved Palestinian and Israeli families," festival director Yael Nahari said.

F-16-Is cleared to fly after carcinogen scare 
The Israel Air Force renewed flights of its F-16-Is yesterday, after the entire fleet of the fighter jets had been grounded for the past five weeks. IAF commander Elyezer Shkedy ordered the grounding after carcinogenic formaldehyde was discovered leaking into cockpits - concentrations above allowed limits were found in seven planes. The IDF said these planes would remain grounded until the problem was solved. All F-16-I pilots were summoned for medical tests, and told the IAF said the risk-level is very low. (Yuval Azoulay)   
Undercover cop busts W. Bank drug ring 
An undercover police agent has broken up a drug ring operating in West Bank settlements. Fifteen suspects were arrested. The agent, a 26-year-old Jerusalem woman with a bachelor's degree in criminology, has been working with the police since August, gaining the trust of the suspects and eventually buying drugs from them for what she told them was personal use. The suspects were arrested yesterday in Ma'aleh Adumim, Ariel, and settlements in Gush Etzion and the Benyamin area. (Jonathan Lis)   
Knesset okays funds for reinforced rooms 
The Knesset Finance Committee approved a request by the Finance Ministry to transfer NIS 277 million from the state budget for the construction of reinforced rooms for homes in communities around the Gaza Strip. Among the three opposition members of the committee present at the meeting yesterday who approved the outlay, MK Stas Misezhnikov (Yisrael Beiteinu) said that with people's security and livelihood so adversely affected, "there are no considerations of coalition and opposition."

Chief of staff to join 'March of the Living' 
Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi is to fly to Poland tonight to visit Holocaust commemoration sites and meet with the heads of the Polish Jewish community. He will also meet with the Polish defense minister and Polish army's chief of staff. On Thursday, Holocaust Memorial Day, Ashkenazi will lead the 10,000-strong March of the Living. It is the first time an IDF chief of staff has taken part in the event. Yesterday, the General Staff attended a Holocaust seminar at Kibbutz Lohamei Hageta'ot, where Ashkenazi said the IDF was responsible for ensuring that the Holocaust never happens again.

MI chief: Terrorists trained in Syria, Iran infiltrate Gaza  
Military Intelligence chief Amos Yadlin said yesterday that terrorists trained in Syria and Iran infiltrated the Gaza Strip while the border between Gaza and Egypt was breached last month. Major General Yadlin said the militants had undergone workshops and intensive training in all military areas. Presenting the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee with a general security assessment, Yadlin said large amounts of money and ammunition also made their way into Gaza during the 12 days the border was breached. (Shahar Ilan)  
More than 1,200 refugees are expected to arrive in Israel over the next month, more than 12 times the number who entered last February, Population Registrar head Ya'akov Ganot told the Kneseet's Committee on Foreign Workers yesterday. Some 880 people illegally entered Israel from Egypt in January, about 11 times as many as in January 2007. Some 7,500 crossed over in the past year. "At the current rate, we will pass the 12,000 mark by the end of the year," Ganot said. (Shahar Ilan)  
Israel Defense Forces troops killed a Palestinian farmer near the Gaza Strip border yesterday, his relatives and hospital officials said. The IDF said the man was an armed militant. An IDF spokeswoman said a tank unit spotted a Palestinian planting a bomb at Gaza's periphery patrol road near the Kissufim border crossing, and shot him. The man was brought to a Palestinian hospital, where he died. Relatives said he had been working his land when he was shot. (Reuters)  
A report commissioned by the United Nations suggests that Palestinian terrorism is the inevitable consequence of Israeli occupation and laws that resemble South African apartheid - a claim Israel rejected yesterday. The report by South African lawyer John Dugard, for the UN Human Rights Council, says, "Common sense ... dictates that a distinction must be drawn between acts of mindless terror, such as acts committed by Al-Qaida, and acts committed in the course of a war of national liberation against colonialism, apartheid or military occupation."

<title>Noam Shalit: The fact that Carter isn't pro-Israel may be beneficial</title>
<date>Sun Apr 13 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Noam Shalit, the father of Israel Defense Forces soldier Gilad Shalit who was captured by Hamas in June 2006, said Sunday after meeting with former U.S. president Jimmy Carter that the fact that Carter is not considered pro-Israel could be beneficial in securing his son's release. 
"This could help him reach certain people and raise certain ideas that may be received with suspicion coming from someone more pro-Israel," Shalit said after the Jerusalem meeting, Army Radio reported.
Rumors had been circulating over recent weeks that Carter was planning to meet with Damascus-based Hamas political leader Khaled Meshal as he travels to Syria later in the week. 
Shalit met with the former president in hopes that the latter may be able to help secure the captive soldier's freedom, perhaps at his meeting with Hamas leaders. 
Shalit described the meeting as positive, and told Haaretz he asked Carter to help advance the deal to release his son. However, Shalit provided no further details on the matter and would not say whether he asked the former president to pass on a message to Meshal.
Carter, broker of the first Israeli-Arab peace treaty, arrived in Israel Sunday on a peace mission to the region only to receive a cool reception: Israeli leaders are shunning him for accusing Israel of apartheid and for planning to meet with the head of the violently anti-Israel Hamas group.
A schedule released by the U.S.-based Carter Center showed no plans for the former president to meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni or Defense Minister Ehud Barak during this week's visit in Israel.
"Scheduling problems" was the official reason given, a senior Israeli official said - even though Olmert recently took time from his busy schedule to chat with Wentworth Miller of the U.S. TV drama, Prison Break. Olmert's office declined comment.
What is really behind the cold shoulder is Carter's plan to meet with Khaled Meshal, the Israeli official said. "Israeli leaders are not publicly criticizing Carter out of respect for his former position as U.S. president," he added.
In remarks to air Sunday on ABC News' "This Week" Carter said that his upcoming visit to the Middle East will probably include a meeting in Syria with leaders of the militant group Hamas.
"I've not confirmed our itinerary yet for the Syrian visit, but it's likely that I will be meeting with the Hamas leaders," Carter said, bolstering the rumors that he was planning to meet Meshal. 
Ahead of his arrival in Israel, Carter said he feels quite at ease about meeting Hamas militants.
"I think there's no doubt in anyone's mind that if Israel is ever going to find peace with justice concerning the relationship with their next-door neighbors, the Palestinians, that Hamas will have to be included in the process," Carter said.
Hamas is sworn to Israel's destruction and has carried out dozens of suicide bombings that have killed more than 250 Israelis. Israel has no contacts with the Islamic militant group, whose violent takeover of the Gaza Strip in June has undercut newly revived efforts by Israel and the Palestinians to strike a final peace deal.
Peres tells Carter he has damaged peace process
The most prominent Israeli to meet with Carter during his visit was President Shimon Peres, Israel's ceremonial head of state, and a Nobel peace laureate for his role in the historic 1993 accord between Israel and the Palestinians. 
Sources at the President's residence reported that during their meeting, Peres sharply rebuked Carter over his last book, in which he called Israel an apartheid state. 
Peres told Carter that despite the former president's many achievements in advancing peace during the Camp David era, his activity in recent years has caused grave damage to Israel and to the peace process. 
The meeting between the two men was low-key and representatives from the media were not invited to document the event. 
Carter also met with the parents of abducted soldier Gilad Shalit, who were planning to give him a message to pass on to Hamas.
Carter was also scheduled to meet with several Israeli lawmakers, and was planning to visit Sderot, the southern Israeli town most frequently targeted by Gaza rocket squads.
Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work in mediating conflicts, while president and under the auspices of The Carter Center. In 1978, he brokered the landmark accord between Egypt and Israel, for which Egypt's Anwar Sadat and Israel's Menachem Begin were awarded that year's Nobel Peace Prize.
But the goodwill Carter earned here through that agreement was all but swept away two years ago with the publication of his controversial book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid" which equates the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories with the racial segregation and oppression that once reigned in South Africa.
Jewish groups and some fellow Democrats strongly objected to the book and more than a dozen members of the Carter Center's advisory board resigned in protest.
In a later afterword to his book, Carter criticized the lack of balanced debate in the United States about the Middle East and warned officials against being seen as knee-jerk supporters of every action or policy of the Israeli government.
"For the past two to three years, Carter has embarked upon a crusade of hate against Israel," Uzi Arad, an adviser to parliamentary opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu, told Israel Radio.
"There is no doubt that Jimmy Carter as a former president should be greeted as a matter of protocol, but it does not mean that the prime minister, the foreign minister and certainly the opposition leader have to meet him," Arad said.
In addition to Israel, Carter is scheduled to visit the West Bank, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Carter will not be visiting Hamas-ruled Gaza.
A Carter-Meshal meeting would be the first public contact between a prominent American figure and Hamas officials since The Rev. Jesse Jackson met with Mashaal in Syria in 2006.
The U.S. lists Hamas as a terrorist organization, and on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice criticized Carter
"I find it hard to understand what is going to be gained by having discussions with Hamas about peace when Hamas is, in fact, the impediment to peace," Rice said.
The State Department says it twice advised Carter against meeting any Hamas representative.

<title>Nobel Peace Prize winner urges Obama to focus on Middle East</title>
<date>Wed Dec 10 14:37:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari urged U.S. President-elect Barack Obama on Wednesday to start his term by giving high priority to the Middle East conflict, calling it the world's most challenging peace-building project.
In his acceptance speech in Oslo, the Finnish diplomat and mediator also warned that the global financial crisis would strike hard at the developing world, and called on governments to not cut back on foreign aid.
Insisting that all conflicts can be settled, Ahtisaari said he did not share the view that the decades-long violence between Israel and Palestinians would rage indefinitely.
"Many have come to believe that the Middle East knot can never be untied. I do not share this belief," Ahtisaari said in his acceptance speech. "All crises, including the one in the Middle East, can be resolved. The solution would require a contribution from all the parties involved as well as the international community as a whole."
The 71-year-old former Finnish president was awarded what many consider the world's most coveted prize for his three decades of work mediating conflicts from Namibia to Kosovo and Indonesia. So far he has not sought a role to mediate in the Middle East.
"I hope that the new president of the United States, who will be sworn in next month, will give high priority to the Middle East conflict during his first year in office," Ahtisaari said.
In an interview with The Associated Press before the award ceremony, he criticized world leaders for not doing enough to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
"The international community and those in power are sitting there letting them destroy each other and they are allowing both parties to make their lives in the future even more complicated and difficult than it is today," he said.
In Wednesday's prepared remarks, the skilled and dogged negotiator said he could not accept religious tensions as a reason for the intractability of the bloodshed in the Middle East. "Religions," he said, "are peace-loving and can be a constructive force in solving conflicts. That also applies to Mideast peace efforts, which he called the most challenging peace-building project ahead of us."
By selecting Ahtisaari for the prize, the Nobel committee returned its focus to traditional peace work after tapping climate campaigner Al Gore and the UN panel on climate change last year.
"His efforts have been untiring, and he has achieved good results," committee chairman Ole Danbolt Mjoes said of Ahtisaari in prepared remarks. Ahtisaari was a senior Finnish diplomat when in 1977 he was named the UN envoy for Namibia, where guerrillas were battling South African apartheid rule. He later rose to undersecretary-general, and in 1988 was dispatched to Namibia to lead 8,000 UN peacekeepers during its transition to independence.
He served as Finland's president from 1994 until declining re-election in 2000, when he left politics and founded his Crisis Management Initiative, a peace mediation institute. His peace efforts continued, in Kosovo and in Indonesia, where he negotiated a 2005 peace deal between the Indonesian government and rebels in Aceh province.
Ahtisaari warned that the effects of the financial crisis could prove another major setback for poor countries already hit hard by climate change, rising food prices and declining levels of foreign trade.
"A reduction in foreign assistance and investment would be disastrous for badly needed economic growth," he said. "At this difficult time I call on all governments to remain committed to their stated goals of eradicating poverty."
The Nobel prizes are always presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of their founder, Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel. The peace prize is presented in Oslo, and the prizes in medicine, physics, chemistry, economics and literature in Stockholm, Sweden.

<title>No voice for peace </title>
<date>Wed Apr 09 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>

On Monday, at 2 A.M., police detained eight employees of RAM FM, which broadcasts from Jerusalem and Ramallah, alleging that the station in Jerusalem was operating illegally. Transmitters and office equipment were confiscated from the Jerusalem bureau although the Ramallah station has continued broadcasting.  
The Communications Ministry stated that the station's staff were detained because of police assessments that they were operating without a license and had gone on the air without a tender.  
"The resource of [available] frequencies is currently classed as a depleted resource, and the quality of broadcasting is compromised, as there are too many [broadcast] 'suppliers' offering services. We lack the authority to decide whom to arrest," Yehiel Shalvi, the ministry's spokesman, said yesterday.   
Regarding the ongoing broadcasting from Ramallah, Shalvi said that licenses to operate radio stations there are issued by the Palestinian Authority.  
RAM FM staffers say the station operates legally, and that they are looking into the legal ramifications of the police's action.   
Jerusalem District Police spokesman Shmulik Ben-Ruby confirmed that eight of the station's personnel had been detained, among them station manager Maysoun Odeh-Gangat.  
"The Communications Ministry issued orders to shut down the station and confiscate the 'pirate' broadcasting equipment operating there.   
"We detained eight people for questioning, in accordance with new directives published by the State Prosecutor's Office and the attorney general, which state that we must deal with pirate radio stations with all the force of the law, after repeated cases of frequency interference, among other places, at Ben-Gurion Airport."   
The eight workers were released to house arrest yesterday afternoon, but the Jerusalem office remains closed and its equipment is still confiscated.   
Despite this, the station can be heard on 93.6 FM and on its Internet site, www.ramfm.net. Until Monday, everything at the Jerusalem station had seemed idyllic.   
At the entrance to the spotless building in the Malkha technology park in which the RAM FM studios are located, the strains of Keren Peles' latest hit were still playing. Eleven floors above, facing broad views of the Judean Hills, one could forget for the moment that this was Israel. As a rule, some 20 Anglo youths work in the spacious offices, established by South African millionaire Issy Kirsh in 2006.  
Kirsh is chairman of Primedia Broadcasting, and built RAM FM on the model of another station he owns, Radio 702, which operates in South Africa.   
During the apartheid era, this was the only station in which both whites and blacks were on the air.  
In its first year of operation, $2 million was invested in RAM FM, which began operating in February of last year.   
The station's declared goal is bringing people together through music.   
Recently the station mounted an outdoor advertising campaign in Israel and the Palestinian Authority with the catchphrase "music has no boundaries."   
The ads featured artists like Bob Marley and the Beatles as examples of musicians who transcended continents and cultures through their work.  
Brothers in arms - like South Africans 
 Station manager Odeh-Gangat, a 42-year old Palestinian, studied economics in France and political science in Washington. She said the station's promotional concept reflects its attempt to create a professional radio station, untainted by racism and prejudice, to forge a connection between the two peoples. The station employs local DJs, editors, and writers as well as South Africans, Australians, Brits, and Americans who, according to Odeh-Gangat, "want to be partners in what is happening in the Middle East."  
RAM FMs chief news editor Mark Klusener noted that South Africans particularly feel that in Israel "they can make use of the unique life experience they gained in South Africa."  
Odeh-Gangat met her husband Rafique Gangat, a South African of Indian descent, when he served as the South African consul-general in the Palestinian Authority. He is also an announcer on the station.  
Apart from his wife, the other staff members detained on Monday are also "under house arrest for seven days and cannot leave Jerusalem, talk to each other, anyone else or members of the media," Gangat said yesterday.  
"The reality is that if RAM FM was a pirate station, we wouldn't have invested $2 million in it, and we wouldn't have launched a massive advertising campaign. Pirate stations stay under the radar; they don't have advertising campaigns. But we know that we are legal. Both of our frequencies (93.6 and 87.7) are licensed by the Palestinian Authority and we pay for those licenses. "The Jerusalem studio and the Ramallah studio are linked by fiber optics. Everything that is produced in Jerusalem is sent back to Ramallah and broadcast from there. Nothing is actually broadcast from Jerusalem. "We feel very strongly about our mission and this has just made us more determined," he said. "The show must go on." Martin B., a blue-eyed, 33-year old Londoner, exemplifies the team of adventurous and highly-motivated young announcers who entered a fray that is foreign to them.  
B. wandered the world for a decade, appearing on radio stations in Dubai, the Canary Islands, Egypt, and other locations before arriving here.   
He now lives at the top of the hill he sees from the window of his office, and presents "The Breakfast Show," daily from 6-9 A.M. His is one of the most popular programs on the station.  
He discovered RAM FM in a want ad. "You know the feeling when you just want to be part of something? That's how I felt when I read about the station," he said. "I thought that a station like that, so unique in the region in which it operates, would leave ample room for creativity." Despite his identification with the station's agenda, B. prefers to distance himself from politics on his own program.  
"I believe that people prefer lighter content when they wake up in the morning. So I try to maintain an upbeat atmosphere on the program," he says. B. says he has hosted a variety of guests in the studio, including representatives of charitable organizations, Jewish and Arab students who attend a local high school together, and even Uri Geller.  
For now, he enjoys living in the Middle East. "I'm in a new place, meet new and interesting people, and sense enormous openness. There's also a positive feeling at the station that something exciting is happening."  
Although most programs on RAM FM refrain from direct involvement in political issues, its chief point of pride are its self-produced hourly news bulletins. "Media in Israel is commonly classified as pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian," Odeh- Gangat observed. "We try to find a balance between the two sides."  
Following the Jerusalem station's closure, B. said: "Listeners have been calling us and sending emails to express their support. This came as a surprise. There were no prior warnings." B. is now broadcasting from the station's Ramallah branch.  
A balanced viewpoint 
The station employs Israeli announcers and writers, like Mike Brand, alongside Palestinians like Arda Aghazarian, who presents a daily, lunch program with Brand. This attempt to maintain balance is also evident in the content of news bulletins.  
"We won't use a term like 'terrorist,' which is considered offensive in Palestinian eyes, nor will we use 'freedom fighter,'" said station director Odeh-Gangat, adding that the station attempts to provide in-depth coverage of issues ignored by Israeli media.  
"A few days ago, a settler killed a Palestinian near Ramallah, after he took out a knife," she said. "We immediately reported the event but later sent a reporter to Bir Zeit University, where the Palestinian was a student, to shed light on the story from a Palestinian perspective. We will always try to bring both versions of the story. We do not have a political agenda. We mainly try to present facts on the ground in the most objective way possible."  
The station concurrently strives to present a broader view of local, cultural issues. Odeh-Gangat calls such subjects, the Ramallah International Film Festival, the local water shortage, the organic food industry in Israel, and special events at Bir Zeit University, "the little things."  
The station broadcasts 24 hours a day, but plays Western hits from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s rather than Israeli or Palestinian music. Music director Kevin Lee says that the station opts for a variety of music from Madonna to Linkin Park, "but we don't play the same songs a thousand times."  
Although the station is aimed largely at Israelis and Palestinians, all broadcasts are in English. Odeh-Gangat said that the choice is part of the station's effort to be impartial. "First and foremost, market research we conducted indicated that there was a demand for an English-language station," she said.  
"Moreover, we consider English to be a neutral language. If it is the official language used to conduct peace talks between Israel and Palestine, it is good enough for us."

<title>Police close English radio aimed at Israeli-Palestinian coexistence</title>
<date>Mon Apr 07 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>

Police on Monday closed the Jerusalem studio of Ram FM, an English-language West Bank radio station that plays Western music in a stated mission to bring Israelis and Palestinians together. 
"We instructed the police to close the station in Jerusalem because they were broadcasting without a permit," said a Communications Ministry official. "They interfere with airwaves and endanger airport signals," he added.
The station replied in a statement that it had not broken the law.
Police shut down the transmitter and closed the studio, taking staff for questioning and hauling away equipment in Monday's raid, but the station remained on the air via its West Bank frequency 93.6.
Owned by a South African Jewish businessman, it is modeled after a South African station that provided a venue for reconciliation after apartheid. The station's tens of thousands of listeners include Palestinians, settlers and foreign diplomats, a portion of whom participate in its talkback segments.
There are numerous pirate radio stations broadcasting throughout Israel. They are often blamed for dangerous disruptions in airport air traffic communications and interference in regular radio broadcasts.

<title>Police shut J'lem studio of station promoting coexistence </title>
<date>Tue Apr 08 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Israeli police yesterday closed the Jerusalem studio and transmitter of an English-language West Bank radio station that plays Western music and tries to bring Israelis and Palestinians together through its broadcasts. The station, RAM-FM, is headquartered in Ramallah, where it broadcasts on 93.6 FM. It set up an office in Jerusalem and a local transmitter on another frequency to overcome airwave interference in the city.  
Yesterday, Israeli police shut down the transmitter and closed the studio, taking away staff for questioning and hauling away equipment. "We instructed the police to close the station in Jerusalem because they were broadcasting without a permit," said Yehiel Shalvi, a spokesman for the Israeli Communications Ministry. "They interfere with airwaves and endanger airport signals." After the raid, the station remained on the air from the West Bank as usual.  
RAM-FM is owned by Jewish businessman Issy Kirsh in South Africa and has been on the air for a year. Modeled after a South African station that provided a venue for reconciliation after apartheid, RAM-FM says it wants to create a safe place for Israelis and Palestinians to talk.

<title>Prof. Sternhell: Supporters of occupation are not Zionist</title>
<date>Mon Sep 29 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Professor Zeev Sternhell's house on Jerusalem's Agnon Street is easily located by the iron gate with the broken glass. Sternhell says the bombing could have ended with him having to have both legs amputated.  
Fortunately, last Thursday night he and his wife Ziva had returned from abroad and their suitcases, left in the narrow hallway, separated him and the pipe bomb that had been attached to the door.  
The living room is filled with flowers and the telephone doesn't stop ringing. The news is quoting ministers' statements from the cabinet meeting.  
Sternhell, while still in the hospital, drew a direct line between the state's surrender to the extreme right rampaging in the territories and the terrorist or organization that tried to kill him.  
"What are those ministers talking about," he asks, when Vice Premier Haim Ramon blasts the government on the television news for fearing "those hooligans," as Ramon called them.  
Sternhell: "Who has to deal with the outposts? Me? You? Who's to blame for the semi-autonomous state in the territories? Groups of settlers do whatever they feel like. Police officers and reserve soldiers go home with broken arms. How did they let things deteriorate to this lack of control in the West Bank? I told my students that not intervening for a weak child who needs help against a strong child is intervening for the strong child. Whoever fails to enforce the law and protect the Palestinians from the settlers who attack them is cooperating with the hooligans and lawbreakers."  
The settlers argue that they are the weak child. Especially since the evacuation of the Gaza Strip.  
"I understand exactly what it's like to be a refugee and I'm sorry the Gush Katif settlers were not allowed to build a new life within the Green Line. [But] every time the government takes a step in the right direction, like pulling out of Gaza, it hastens to console the settlers and promise them this will go no further.  
"I'm suggesting an alternative to exclusive ownership of the land that justifies occupation. It would be based on a rational view of universal rights, especially the right to liberty and dignity, including for the Palestinians. This is the social-democratic approach that shaped 20th century Europe. It would strengthen Zionism, unlike the insistence on exclusivity over all the Land of Israel which rejects the other's rights, undermines the Zionist ideal, and is a proven prescription for disaster."  
Are the extreme right wing and settlers anti-Zionists?  
"Certainly. The right wing advocating the greater Israel is the real post-Zionist body. Whoever supports the occupation, i.e. a binational state, is no Zionist. This could also be said of politicians who drag their feet in negotiations intended to bring about a two-state solution for two nations. They're putting off this solution to the unforeseeable future, endangering the Jewish state's future."  
Will you use the bombing to increase your influence?  
"My job is to criticize. I have no intention of returning to politics. I'm glad my injury shocked the cabinet and Knesset. But what remains of [prime minister Yitzhak] Rabin's murder, which caused a much greater shock? A one-day annual festival.  
The politicians must declare war on the extreme right and occupation - that's the swamp where those mosquitoes breed. Otherwise they won't even be a footnote in history."  
As a member of the Zionist left and a historian specializing in 20th century fascism, are you pleased with the role of the Israeli left in the confrontation with the right?  
"The Israeli left has made no political mark. It has good people, like [MK] Ophir Pines and [Education Minister] Yuli Tamir, but they have no impact on their party. No one is trying to shape the future of war and peace, or of social progress. Instead, the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker, even as the free market's mythology is crumbling around us and begging for state intervention to save it. This is the very moment when the left should rear up and proclaim its difference, remind us that the rightist ideology is a total failure and delivers only political, social and economic disaster. A left-wing party worthy of the name should be shouting from the rooftops by now."  
In an interview with Haaretz six months ago you said your children's and grandchildren's future did not seem secure.  
"I fear that unless an immediate change takes place, in 50 years my granddaughters will have no reason to live here. If we're doomed to be a minority in a multinational state, why live in Tel Aviv rather than California? For that I had to sacrifice so much? Our grandchildren will not understand the justification for the colonial reality here. That's the greatest danger to our society.  
"Despite the difficulties my generation has experienced, we were always accompanied by the hope of a better future. My students don't have the feeling that next year will be better, they feel that tomorrow is not safe. We believed we were going in the right way, that justice was on our side.  
"Today young people's conviction of that is crumbling. Occupation is rotting our society. The terrible violence in the territories is spilling over the Green Line. This is inevitable - different standards and laws for different people cannot exist without affecting all of society. I'm not seeking absolute justice, only an end to building a de facto apartheid, only to ensure the creation of a society that future generations will not be ashamed of."

<title>Pro-peace West Bank radio station closes down due to lack of funding</title>
<date>Mon Aug 11 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
A West Bank radio station that sought to bring Israelis and Palestinians together to the tune of easy-listening rock music has gone of the air because of a lack of funding.
RAM-FM had been broadcasting English-language talk shows and artists like Michael Bolton and Air Supply from a studio in the town of Ramallah since last year. An official from the station confirmed Monday it went off the air last week.
In a statement, the station said it was unable to generate sufficient advertising revenues to sustain its ongoing operation.
Owned by South African Jewish businessman Issy Kirsh, RAM-FM was modeled after a South African station that provided a venue for reconciliation after apartheid. It attracted fans in both Israel and the Palestinian territories. 
This is the second time the Ram FM studio has been closed this year. In April, police temporarily shut it down, citing a lack of broadcast permit.
"We instructed the police to close the station in Jerusalem because they were broadcasting without a permit," said a Communications Ministry official in April. "They interfere with airwaves and endanger airport signals," he added.

<title>Qatar's emir urges Israel to lift 'crippling' blockade on Gaza</title>
<date>Mon Apr 14 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
DOHA - Qatar's prime minister, Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabir al-Thani, on Monday urged Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni to end Israel's "crippling blockade of Gaza due to the difficult humanitarian situation."
Meeting Livni at the 8th annual Doha Forum on Democracy, Development and Free Trade, Sheikh al-Thani also called for the acceleration of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority on a final-status arrangement.
In her speech, Livni declared that Gaza militant groups' ongoing conflict with Israel is frustrating Palestinian ambitions for statehood.
"The situation in the Gaza Strip is not just Israel's problem - Gaza is becoming an obstacle to the establishment of a Palestinian state," Livni said in the keynote address.
Although Israel fully withdrew all its forces from the Gaza Strip, "dismantled all settlements and allowed for Palestinian self-rule in this territory, instead of coexistence, we have received terror in return," she said.
"We are extending our hands in peace. The way to peaceful relations goes through dialogue and mutual recognition," she said.
Livni also called on Arab states not to view the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as the cause of extremism. "We have to understand that our ability to reach peace is dependent on the ability of extremists to prevent us from doing so," she said.
Moments after delivering her address, Livni traded barbs over the nature of Israeli democracy with MK Ahmed Tibi, who attended the conference.
In a question and answer session following the speech, Tibi (United Arab List-Ta'al) asked for an opportunity to respond to Livni's comments, and told her, "Israel is an apartheid state. How can you speak about democracy when you speak about a Jewish state?"
Livni responded that, "If we return to '47, a Jewish state and an Arab Palestinian state [were on the agenda]. Do you also not agree to this? The fact is that you are an MK in Israel, and represent 20 percent of the public, and can say whatever you please. This is the proof that Israel is a democratic state."
Livni spoke of the abducted Israeli soldiers Gilad Shalit, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. "We witness another breach of democracy, while three abducted Israeli soldiers are still held in captivity, for no reason, denied access by the Red Cross or a sign of life. I would like to take this opportunity to call for their release. This is a matter of human rights, not politics," she said.
Livni also made a brief reference to the peace talks currently under way with the Palestinian Authority. "We recognize the fact that Palestinians have legitimate rights and aspirations," she said.
The foreign minister added: "We have no desire to run their lives, and we are committed to the establishment of a Palestinian state that will be the national state of the Palestinian people and a good neighbor of Israel's. We have no interest in wasting time or creating facts on the ground that will prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state."
Livni held separate talks with the leaders of Qatar and the foreign minister of Oman.
The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, hosted Livni for lunch at his palace after holding a formal meeting also attended by his prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem.
Omani Foreign Minister Yousef Bin Alawi Bin Abdulla and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan also attended the lunch.
Livni told the emir that Israel was interested in enlisting the Arab world, and especially the Gulf states, to help the Palestinian Authority advance in the peace process.
"The region is changing," Livni told the emir. "We must show it to the public ... by exchanging the incitement and hatred messages with messages of hope and mutual recognition."
Earlier on Monday, Livni kicked off the first full day of her visit with morning talks with her Omani counterpart, Bin Abdulla. That meeting, which was open to journalists, was the first of its kind between Israel and Oman since relations between the two states were cut off in 2000, after the start of the second Palestinian intifada. Since then, there have been only covert talks between the two countries' foreign ministers.

<title>Religion, geography remain key to Arab politics </title>
<date>Fri Dec 12 03:15:14 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Composng a list of candidates for the Knesset is no small matter and especially when it comes to an Arab list. For example, it is not considered politically correct to talk about this in public and certainly no one from the Arab parties is eager to reveal the matter to the media, but a piece of information of supreme importance in this delicate work is the candidate's religion. Even if he is secular or a Communist, he will be classified by his religion, or more precisely, the religion of the community in which he lives. No protest will avail.  
Even in Hadash they are very particular about this matter, although the movement came into being in order to expand the ranks of the Israel Communist Party, which has a known attitude towards religion. In the term that is now ending, the party had three Knesset members: chairman Mohammed Barakeh who is Muslim by religion, Dr. Hanna Swaid who is Christian and Dov Khenin who is Jewish. In Balad, too, they make a point of variety: The founder of the movement and former Knesset member on its behalf, Dr. Azmi Bishara, is a Christian, the faction chairman Dr. Jamal Zahalka is a Muslim and so is MK Wasal Taha, while MK Said Naffaa is Druze. In the third and largest of the lists, Ra'am-Ta'al, the religious variety is lacking. There all the candidates are Muslims.  
The second most important consideration in a candidate's placement on a list is where he lives: The preferred situation for a list is that it have representation from the three places where there are large concentrations of citizens living: the Galilee, the Triangle and the Negev, and if not from all three of them, then at least from the Galilee and the Triangle.  
At present, Hadash has two representatives from the Galilee (Barakeh is from Shfar'am and Sweid is from Eilaboun) and one from Tel Aviv (Khenin). On the assumption that this will be the opening troika, it is lacking representation from the Triangle. In about ten days there will probably be a competition for fourth place, which according to the polls could be realistic, between two leading candidates: Dr. Afo Ighbariyeh of Um al Fahm and Dr. Thabet Abu Ras, a geographer who lives in Jaffa and is considering submitting his candidacy. Both, incidentally, are Muslims.  
In a conversation with Dr. Abu Ras last week, he enumerated his advantages as a new face on the slate, if he is elected. The first advantage: He is a native of Kalansuwa in the southern Triangle, he lived in Beer Sheva for many years and he is now very active in Jaffa. "I represent three areas," he said, stressing that Hadash has never had a representative in the Knesset on behalf of the southern Triangle: "In my area there are five out of the 11 Arab cities. This region has weight and it should have a representative."  
Abu Ras' second advantage is also geographic: This is his academic field - he is a doctor of political geography. In his youth he worked as a laborer in his father's strawberry and flower fields near the village, but insisted on going on to academic studies. He says that he was expelled from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev for political activity at the start of the 1980s, and he later returned there as a lecturer.  
Abu Ras is planning to harness geographical matters to his parliamentary work as well. Recently he has been engaged in a comparison between the situation of the Arabs in Israel and the situation of other minorities in the world. He has visited South Africa and the Southern Tyrol, a province in Northern Italy that is home to a German-speaking minority that enjoys nearly full autonomy. "There is a lot to be learned from the situation of other minorities in the world," he said. "For example, Austria is just over the border but no one in Italy accuses the inhabitants of Southern Tyrol of not being Italians."  
At the meeting, which was held in the offices of the New Horizon non- profit organization in Jaffa, which he runs, Abu Ras was wearing a shirt from South Africa; a shirt of the sort that became identified with Nelson Mandela. "I get my inspiration for my activities and my thinking from the success stories of other peoples, especially South Africa and Northern Ireland. In Israel there isn't apartheid, but rather a far more sophisticated ethnocratic system. The Arabs are part of the political system and this did not exist there, but if the state doesn't come to its senses we are liable to get there."  
In Hadash, incidentally, there are those who are angry when the party is labeled as an Arab party. MK Dov Khenin is not an Arab, nor are several thousand of this party's voters. At the moment they are scratching their heads in the party over how to translate Khenin's success in the Tel Aviv municipal elections into an expansion of the circle of Hadash voters in the general elections. Abu Ras is also promising to contribute here in his circles of acquaintance and in his positions.  
He says that he can understand how the Jews feel: "There is too much fear of dividing the land. The Jews have a real fear and so do the Arabs. We, the Arabs, have not tried to deal with the Jewish fear. There is a Jewish majority here that has a siege mentality, and in this way the country could be destroyed. It is a job of the Arab population to deal with this and to declare that we don't have a plan to transform the Jews into a minority, but we are demanding full equality. Everything has to be done by agreement."

<title>Report: Ex-U.S. president Carter to meet with Hamas leader in Syria</title>
<date>Wed Apr 09 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
The U.S. news network Fox reported Wednesday that former U.S. president Jimmy Carter is planning to meet exiled Hamas political leader Khaled Meshal in Damascus in 10 days. 
Carter's press secretary Deanna Congileo confirmed the report that the former president is planning a trip to Damascus, first published by the London-based Arabic-language daily Al Hayat, and did not deny a possible meeting with the Hamas leader. 
"President Carter is planning a trip to the Mideast next week; however, we are still confirming details of the trip and will issue a press release by the end of this week," wrote Congileo. "I cannot confirm any specific meetings at this point in time."
The planned meeting between the former president and the leader of Hamas, a militant group classified by Israel and the U.S. as a terrorist organization, has drawn harsh criticism among American officials. Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton criticized Carter's judgment, calling the move "typical" and saying that "to go to Syria to visit Hamas at this point is just an ill-timed, ill-advised decision on his part."
U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack once said of the prospect of meeting with Meshal, "that's not something that we could possibly conceive of," Fox reported. 
In 2006, Carter sparked a heated debate with the release of his book "Palestine Peace Not Apartheid" published by Simon & Schuster. In this book Carter argues that "Israel's continued control and colonization of Palestinian land have been the primary obstacles to a comprehensive peace agreement in the Middle East."

<title>South African rights group says harassed by settlers in Hebron</title>
<date>Wed Jul 09 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
A delegation of South African human rights activists said settlers verbally abused them while the visited the West Bank city of Hebron on Wednesday.
The group is on a mission to Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Former anti-apartheid activists Zackie Achmat and Edwin Cameron are participating in the tour.
"Settlers yelled and cursed at the group," said Avner Inbar, an Israeli accompanying the activists.
Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the activists entered a restricted zone, and three Israelis were arrested for disturbing the peace.
Hebron is home to a holy site revered by both Jews and Muslims and is a frequent flash point for violence.
About 500 Jews live in heavily guarded enclaves in the city, among 160,000 Palestinians.

<title>Tel Aviv documentary film festival tackles tough issues </title>
<date>Fri Apr 04 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
From one soldier's account of the Lebanon war to the tale of an Israeli African prince, the annual DocAviv film festival in Tel Aviv is looking beyond political conflict to examine broader issues of strife and identity in Israel.  
"People associate Israel with hardcore news, with fighting and conflict," said Ilana Tzur, the event's director. "But it's important to see there's such a wide range of other facets to life."  
The films at DocAviv's 10th international documentary film festival, which opened on April 3, tackle meaty political themes such as Israel's conflict with the Palestinians and its 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. But they also examine private and cultural struggle in a young country.  
Tzur said that after years of dissecting Israel's fight with the Palestinians, young filmmakers were telling more personal stories, and turning their focus onto broader issues of identity within Israeli society.  
About one quarter of the 80 films in the festival are Israeli, and several have appeared at international festivals. 
The festival's opener, "My Beetle," traces the history of a young Jerusalemite's 40-year-old car as he fights to keep it in the face of oppposition from his heavily pregnant wife. 
Other films, despite their controversial topics, also offer an emotional connection with the subjects. 
"Brides of Allah" is a surprisingly sympathetic observation of Palestinian women serving jail sentences in Israel for helping plot suicide bombings. 
The Boys of Lebanon, meanwhile, is a touching portrayal of two young sons of a former member of the South Lebanese Army as they try to make new lives for themselves in northern Israel. They, along with their parents and other families of the SLA, fled across the border after the Israel Defense Forces pulled out of southern Lebanon in May 2000. 
Other films on the program include profiles of renowned photographer Annie Liebovitz, seen through her sister's camera, and former U.S. president Jimmy Carter as he promotes his book "Palestine: Peace not Apartheid."

<title>Top UN official: Israel's policies are like apartheid </title>
<date>Wed Nov 26 02:26:09 IST 2008</date>
<content>
NEW YORK - United Nations General Assembly President Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann yesterday likened Israel's policies toward the Palestinians to South Africa's treatment of blacks under apartheid.  
Israel's actions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were like "the apartheid of an earlier era," said D'Escoto, of Nicaragua, speaking at the annual debate marking the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.  
He added: "We must not be afraid to call something what it is."  
Israeli ambassador to the UN Gabriela Shalev in September called D'Escoto an "Israel hater" for having hugged Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a vocal enemy of Israel.  
Meanwhile, other diplomatic attacks against Israel were expected today on the second day of the annual debate.

<title>Top UN official: Israel's policies are like apartheid of bygone era</title>
<date>Tue Nov 25 01:56:46 IST 2008</date>
<content>
United Nations General Assembly President Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann on Monday likened Israel's policies toward the Palestinians to South Africa's treatment of blacks under apartheid.
Israel's actions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were like "the apartheid of an earlier era," said Brockmann, of Nicaragua, speaking at the annual debate marking the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.
He added: "We must not be afraid to call something what it is."
Brockmann stressed that it was important for the United Nations to use the heavily-charged term since it was the institution itself that had passed the International Convention against the crime of apartheid.
Israeli ambassador to the UN Gabriela Shalev in September called Brockmann an "Israel hater"
Meanwhile, other diplomatic attacks against Israel were expected Tuesday on the second day of the annual debate.
The event is usually observed on November 29, to coincide with the UN's resolution in 1947 to establish a Jewish and an Arab state in Palestine.
The Palestinians, along with a group of Arab states, intend to use Tuesday's debate, entitled "the Palestinian question and the situation in the Middle East," for a public campaign directed at the international community about the the suffering of the Palestinian people under Israeli occupation. They will also denounce Israel as responsible for the lack of a solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Speakers at the debate are expected to harshly criticize Israel for its policy in the territories, especially following UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's complaint that Israel refused his request to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.
In her address Tuesday, Shalev asked why the UN has turned November 29 into a day of mourning, but does not mention that on this day a resolution to establish two states was adopted with Israel's consent.
"The UN must adopt new content and no longer accept the agenda foisted on it by the automatic majority, which sabotages the peace process' progress in the region," she said.
The two-day event includes several events and ceremonies at the UN headquarters, including movies and photography exhibitions showing alleged Palestinian hardships under Israeli occupation.
The debate is expected to end with the adoption of some 20 anti-Israel resolutions. In the past, these included denouncing Israel for annexing East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in separate resolutions.

<title>Tough love </title>

Tamar Berger was on the way to another shift with the women of Machsom Watch, the Israeli women's organization that monitors activity at army checkpoints in the West Bank, when she accidentally discovered something in a pile of garbage. It was across the road from the Dahiat al-Barid checkpoint near Ramallah: a small toy car made of cardboard, wrapped in glossy, brown packing tape that had been painted in the colors of the Palestinian flag - black on the bottom, green on the sides, and red on top. Its appearance at that location seemed scripted, turning up right before the eyes of a radical leftist cultural researcher who employs X-ray vision to scrutinize the depths of Israeli space. Berger insists it was merely coincidence, but that the story is true. There is no sense in arguing with facts.  
A friend who accompanied her on that same journey to the checkpoint, artist Relli De Vries, was the first to notice the toy, Berger recalls. She placed it in a shoe box, "like a silkworm, like something very precious." Berger transformed the car into the star exhibit of her new book, "Birevach bein olam vetza'atzua: Al hamodel bitarbut hayisraelit" (In the Space between World and Toy: The Model in Israeli Culture), just published by Resling. A photograph of the toy car, one of the models "lifted from daily, Israeli life," is displayed on the book's cover in a faithful representation of the book's content: a penetrating discussion of the space that surrounds us. "In the Space between World and Toy" comes out a decade after Berger's first, meandering tome, "Dionysus at Dizengoff Center," a journey into the history of Tel Aviv's first mall. That book's exposure of repressed layers of cultural content in the palace of consumerism produced ripples. The Azrieli Mall, dedicated one year later, was the topic of its own recently published Hebrew novel, "The House of Dajani," by Alon Hilu. Hilu's book was undoubtedly inspired by "Dionysus."  
Berger's current book also flows wonderfully from description to narrative, and observation to insight, as it departs the boundaries of its center for the entirety of Israeli space. It employs the same keen vision, while leaving no stone unturned. Only a reading of the book's fine print reveals the glimmer of optimism that occasionally flickers in the edges of a model.  
Berger explains that the model is a special form of representation of an object or concept, but that it cannot be identical to either. It was designed to illustrate or exemplify, but, "the gap between world and toy is always preserved, to employ Rilke's terms." Berger wanders in the Israeli space within that gap, armed with a series of models, "which were not chosen with discrimination, but encountered along the way." They serve as the threshold for detailed descriptions, interpretation and free association. Under Berger's gaze, the toy-model-car at the checkpoint "was transformed into something else - not just another toy or representation of generic vehicles, but a symbol of being Palestinian. And in the context of its reality, that of the Israeli occupation, it becomes an expression and a symbol of the yearning for national liberation."  
The settlement ethos 
Another model in the book, a wall map of Israel from 1951, betrays the fact that "the settlement ethos is already found within it, and in fact has been since the earliest days of Zionism." Or, to paraphrase the right-wing bumper sticker that maintained that all of Israel resembles the political reality in the territories, Yesha really is here.  
For Berger, the Petah Tikva Zoo is another model of Israeliness that sanctifies nature "on Arab lands that were occupied and obliterated." The Mini-Israel park [an Israeli version of Madurodam] - which, had it not existed, Berger would have had to invent to support her critique - is a model that "perverts the picture of reality and realigns it according to accepted industrial standards of Israeliness." And so forth.  
You say that the models were encountered along the way. In other words, everything was tainted regardless of what you encountered?  
"I try to describe what I see, and I see difficult issues that are unresolved. My vision is unaffectionate. I believe one must be critical of everything, but not totally critical in a disingenuous manner that leaves destruction in its path. I am not interested in the Zionist Jewish state. But I am interested in Israeliness, in which I do not deny there is guilt, either as an experience or a culture. It is maddening, violent, outrageous and moving, and despite all my harsh expression, I do not harbor hate. I am crazy about this place. This is my place, and I can only live here."  
Berger was born in 1957 to an affluent family, and she conducts her life between Kfar Shmaryahu, the posh suburb in which she was raised, and Tel Aviv, where she now resides. "I was born into comfort," she says, "but not into a mentality of prosperity and joy." Her father, Ezra Berger, came from the family of industrialists ("right-wing, capitalist, and religious") who founded the Teth Beth Food Industries firm. Her mother, Elinoar Berger, is a translator whom the daughter associates with the "intellectual, socialist" wing of the family. "I was not raised in a place with a clear, unequivocal ideology, and that makes me fortunate."  
She is the oldest child in her family. "The eldest daughter is a model in and of itself," she says. "A bit damaged, because the eldest daughter is subject to the sons. The book is also a declaration that I liberated myself from this model and its inescapable role."  
Berger is married to filmmaker Avi Mugrabi, whose documentary films represent ongoing guerilla warfare against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Without a doubt, they constitute the exemplary radical leftist family. Mugrabi's only film that does not deal with the Palestinians is "August," the story of a director who makes a film about his most hated month of the year. Their oldest child, Shaul, refused to serve in the Israel Defense Forces, "and I am proud of that," says his mother. She explains that open refusal has been replaced by concealed "gray" refusal, "which I prefer because it is more radical." Shaul and his peers were the subjects of Mugrabi's chilling film "Avenge But One of My Eyes."  
The mother is an activist who regularly participates in demonstrations against the occupation and the separation fence, and protests house demolitions in the rundown Tel Aviv community of Kfar Shalem, as well as among the Arab community of Jaffa. Her great political love is the anarchist movement, which distances itself from the political or social Zionist Israeli left. "I am associated with the Yonatan Pollack group, which operates beyond any system," she says. "Not like the leaders of Peace Now, who are connected to cabinet ministers. Anarchists have a different democratic approach. It is a complete ideology. They may be just sons and daughters from 'good homes' who are playing around, but they may truly have a different proposal. They also inspire thought in me."  
Berger is among the pioneers who moved to Tel Aviv's mythological, ultra-hip Sheinkin Street in the 1980s. Her bookstore, The 20th Century, was ahead of its time in its presentation of commercially unpromising merchandise in the form of art, film, archaeology, design and theory and critique books. "No one talked about gentrification then," she explains. "But looking back, it is true that we drove the price of housing in Tel Aviv up with our own hands." Today, her neighborhood is the heart of bourgeois Tel Aviv. From the veranda of the cafe in which we spoke, she pointed to the luxury Akirov Towers, in North Tel Aviv, while castigating the "socioeconomic gaps" that the upscale, residential high-rises represent.  
Doesn't an apartment like your own in a three-story building in the heart of Tel Aviv represent a socioeconomic gap?  
"What can you do if you live in the center of the city? What can you do if you love this place, Israel? I'm guilty, I sinned, but I am also not guilty and I'm free of sin. At least I try to engage in sociopolitical activity. I don't come from a place of implementation and I didn't stand up to the test of action on the ground. I am not an architect, but I would like to believe that my activism will produce something."  
Does your criticism contain some nostalgia for a bygone place?  
"I am free of nostalgia. I have no interest in preservation, and my heart doesn't break when they demolish old buildings. The world was never free of injustice. Everything was always complicated. So I don't long for the past but, perhaps, for the future."  
The thesis for Berger's recently granted doctorate focused on Ben-Gurion Airport, written in a format that recalls her critique of Dizengoff Center. "My proposal was to investigate a place that is also a non-place, a transitional site that represents 'here' and 'there,' which is in fact an axis around which the Zionist project rotates and around which Israeli life now also rotates," she explains.  
After studying literature and philosophy, "My expertise developed in the direction of Israeli space, and it is my luxury to be able to adopt a multidisciplinary approach that permits me to examine space in a philosophical, cultural, and architectural fashion."  
Even Berger's treatment of Ackerstein Industries tiles transforms them from simple, innocently plain surfacing material to "the embodiment of the Zionist ethos, a thriving assembly lime of columns and pillboxes that exalts the apartheid wall, the perfection of derivative ability and a display window of all the unrestrained and undifferentiated filth, artificial Israeliness, flat, violent, and coarse," as she once wrote in an article for a book about Israeli cities.  
A place that remembers its past 
What, in your opinion, is an Israeli place?  
"A place that remembers its past, which must remember its past. And not just its Palestinian past, but our Jewish past, each of us according to his ethnicity. But, once again, not nostalgic. Not a return to what was once, but a processed memory, the ability to contain the past within the present, as in good psychological therapy. Otherwise, you'll always rediscover the deceit that underlies repression and denial. Like Ackerstein paving stones that imitate authentic stone floors, but their entire existence relies on a pressed-together framework, and the minute the framework falls apart, so does the entire sidewalk."

<title>Tough love </title>

Tamar Berger was on the way to another shift with the women of Machsom Watch, the Israeli women's organization that monitors activity at army checkpoints in the West Bank, when she accidentally discovered something in a pile of garbage. It was across the road from the Dahiat al-Barid checkpoint near Ramallah: a small toy car made of cardboard, wrapped in glossy, brown packing tape that had been painted in the colors of the Palestinian flag - black on the bottom, green on the sides, and red on top. Its appearance at that location seemed scripted, turning up right before the eyes of a radical leftist cultural researcher who employs X-ray vision to scrutinize the depths of Israeli space. Berger insists it was merely coincidence, but that the story is true. There is no sense in arguing with facts.  
A friend who accompanied her on that same journey to the checkpoint, artist Relli De Vries, was the first to notice the toy, Berger recalls. She placed it in a shoe box, "like a silkworm, like something very precious." Berger transformed the car into the star exhibit of her new book, "Birevach bein olam vetza'atzua: Al hamodel bitarbut hayisraelit" (In the Space between World and Toy: The Model in Israeli Culture), just published by Resling. A photograph of the toy car, one of the models "lifted from daily, Israeli life," is displayed on the book's cover in a faithful representation of the book's content: a penetrating discussion of the space that surrounds us. "In the Space between World and Toy" comes out a decade after Berger's first, meandering tome, "Dionysus at Dizengoff Center," a journey into the history of Tel Aviv's first mall. That book's exposure of repressed layers of cultural content in the palace of consumerism produced ripples. The Azrieli Mall, dedicated one year later, was the topic of its own recently published Hebrew novel, "The House of Dajani," by Alon Hilu. Hilu's book was undoubtedly inspired by "Dionysus."  
Berger's current book also flows wonderfully from description to narrative, and observation to insight, as it departs the boundaries of its center for the entirety of Israeli space. It employs the same keen vision, while leaving no stone unturned. Only a reading of the book's fine print reveals the glimmer of optimism that occasionally flickers in the edges of a model.  
Berger explains that the model is a special form of representation of an object or concept, but that it cannot be identical to either. It was designed to illustrate or exemplify, but, "the gap between world and toy is always preserved, to employ Rilke's terms." Berger wanders in the Israeli space within that gap, armed with a series of models, "which were not chosen with discrimination, but encountered along the way." They serve as the threshold for detailed descriptions, interpretation and free association. Under Berger's gaze, the toy-model-car at the checkpoint "was transformed into something else - not just another toy or representation of generic vehicles, but a symbol of being Palestinian. And in the context of its reality, that of the Israeli occupation, it becomes an expression and a symbol of the yearning for national liberation."  
The settlement ethos 
Another model in the book, a wall map of Israel from 1951, betrays the fact that "the settlement ethos is already found within it, and in fact has been since the earliest days of Zionism." Or, to paraphrase the right-wing bumper sticker that maintained that all of Israel resembles the political reality in the territories, Yesha really is here.  
For Berger, the Petah Tikva Zoo is another model of Israeliness that sanctifies nature "on Arab lands that were occupied and obliterated." The Mini-Israel park [an Israeli version of Madurodam] - which, had it not existed, Berger would have had to invent to support her critique - is a model that "perverts the picture of reality and realigns it according to accepted industrial standards of Israeliness." And so forth.  
You say that the models were encountered along the way. In other words, everything was tainted regardless of what you encountered?  
"I try to describe what I see, and I see difficult issues that are unresolved. My vision is unaffectionate. I believe one must be critical of everything, but not totally critical in a disingenuous manner that leaves destruction in its path. I am not interested in the Zionist Jewish state. But I am interested in Israeliness, in which I do not deny there is guilt, either as an experience or a culture. It is maddening, violent, outrageous and moving, and despite all my harsh expression, I do not harbor hate. I am crazy about this place. This is my place, and I can only live here."  
Berger was born in 1957 to an affluent family, and she conducts her life between Kfar Shmaryahu, the posh suburb in which she was raised, and Tel Aviv, where she now resides. "I was born into comfort," she says, "but not into a mentality of prosperity and joy." Her father, Ezra Berger, came from the family of industrialists ("right-wing, capitalist, and religious") who founded the Teth Beth Food Industries firm. Her mother, Elinoar Berger, is a translator whom the daughter associates with the "intellectual, socialist" wing of the family. "I was not raised in a place with a clear, unequivocal ideology, and that makes me fortunate."  
She is the oldest child in her family. "The eldest daughter is a model in and of itself," she says. "A bit damaged, because the eldest daughter is subject to the sons. The book is also a declaration that I liberated myself from this model and its inescapable role."  
Berger is married to filmmaker Avi Mugrabi, whose documentary films represent ongoing guerilla warfare against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Without a doubt, they constitute the exemplary radical leftist family. Mugrabi's only film that does not deal with the Palestinians is "August," the story of a director who makes a film about his most hated month of the year. Their oldest child, Shaul, refused to serve in the Israel Defense Forces, "and I am proud of that," says his mother. She explains that open refusal has been replaced by concealed "gray" refusal, "which I prefer because it is more radical." Shaul and his peers were the subjects of Mugrabi's chilling film "Avenge But One of My Eyes."  
The mother is an activist who regularly participates in demonstrations against the occupation and the separation fence, and protests house demolitions in the rundown Tel Aviv community of Kfar Shalem, as well as among the Arab community of Jaffa. Her great political love is the anarchist movement, which distances itself from the political or social Zionist Israeli left. "I am associated with the Yonatan Pollack group, which operates beyond any system," she says. "Not like the leaders of Peace Now, who are connected to cabinet ministers. Anarchists have a different democratic approach. It is a complete ideology. They may be just sons and daughters from 'good homes' who are playing around, but they may truly have a different proposal. They also inspire thought in me."  
Berger is among the pioneers who moved to Tel Aviv's mythological, ultra-hip Sheinkin Street in the 1980s. Her bookstore, The 20th Century, was ahead of its time in its presentation of commercially unpromising merchandise in the form of art, film, archaeology, design and theory and critique books.

<title>Tutu meets Hamas leader, raps Israel for barring entry </title>
<date>Thu May 29 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu criticized Israel's refusal to allow him entry to the country, in his role as head of the U.S. special committee to investigate the November 2006 incident in Beit Hanun where 19 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire.  
In a telephone interview with Haaretz after he met with Hamas prime minister Ismail Haniyeh in Gaza, Tutu said he was disappointed that he was not allowed to visit Sderot and meet the victims of the Qassam rocket attacks there.  
The former archbishop of Capetown, South Africa - who won the Nobel in 1984 for his struggle against apartheid - was appointed to head the special committee by the UN human Rights Council in Geneva.   
However, Israel has announced that it will not cooperate with the committee.  
Committee representatives have asked the Israeli delegation to the UN in Geneva a number of times to make arrangements for a visit, but have never received replies. Tutu then decided to settle for a visit in Beit Hanun. He arrived in Gaza on Tuesday after traveling through Egypt, and entered the Gaza Strip via the Rafah Crossing.  
Tutu, 77, expressed his astonishment at Israel's behavior, as he has been invited a number of times to speak in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on behalf of the Peres Center for Peace, where he is a member of the International Board of Governors, along with other Nobel Prize winners.  
Tutu told Haaretz that he made it clear to Haniyeh and other Hamas members he spoke to that there is no difference between firing Qassam rockets on Israeli citizens and Israeli attacks on Gazans.  
"We also say that the people of Sderot suffer from the Qassam rockets. We care about them too," said Tutu.  
He said he expects the Israelis, as those who remember the Holocaust, like the South Africans, to be sensitive to the suffering of the Palestinians. Tutu added that he did not remember the last time he was so deeply shocked as when he met with the families of the victims of the Israeli shelling of Beit Hanun.

<title>UN expert: Palestinian terror 'inevitable' result of occupation </title>
<date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
A report commissioned by the United Nations suggests that Palestinian terrorism is the inevitable consequence of Israeli occupation and laws that resemble South African apartheid - a claim Israel rejected Tuesday as enflaming hatred between Jews and Palestinians.
The report by John Dugard, independent investigator on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for the UN Human Rights Council, will be presented next month, but it has been posted on the body's Web site.
In it, Dugard, a South African lawyer who campaigned against apartheid in the 1980s, says "common sense ... dictates that a distinction must be drawn between acts of mindless terror, such as acts committed by Al-Qaida, and acts committed in the course of a war of national liberation against colonialism, apartheid or military occupation."
"While Palestinian terrorist acts are to be deplored, they must be understood as being a painful but inevitable consequence of colonialism, apartheid or occupation," writes Dugard, whose 25-page report accuses the Israel of acts and policies consistent with all three.
He cited checkpoints and roadblocks restricting Palestinian movement to house demolitions and what he terms the Judaization of Jerusalem.
"As long as there is occupation, there will be terrorism," he argues.
"Acts of terror against military occupation must be seen in historical context," Dugard says. "This is why every effort should be made to bring the occupation to a speedy end. Until this is done, peace cannot be expected, and violence will continue."
Israel's UN ambassador in Geneva slammed Dugard's analysis.
"The common link between Al-Qaida and the Palestinian terrorists is that both intentionally target civilians with the mere purpose to kill," Itzhak Levanon said. "The fact that Professor Dugard is ignoring this essential fact, demonstrates his inability to use objectivity in his assessment."
"Professor Dugard will better serve the cause of peace by ceasing to enflame the hatred between Israelis and Palestinians, who have embarked on serious talks to solve this contentious situation."
Dugard was appointed in 2001 as an unpaid expert by the now-defunct UN Human Rights Commission to investigate only violations by the Israeli side, prompting Israel and the U.S. to dismiss his reports as one-sided. Israel refused to allow him to conduct a UN-mandated fact-finding mission on its Gaza offensive in 2006.
The report will be presented next month at the 47-nation rights council's first regular session of the year. The new body has been widely criticized - even by its founder, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan - for spending most of its time criticizing one government, Israel's, over alleged abuses.

<title>VIDEO / Peres warns evacuation of settlers may lead to civil war</title>
<date>Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
LONDON - President Shimon Peres told members of the British Parliament Wednesday that Israel would have difficulty dismantling West Bank settlements without causing a civil war in Israel.  
On the second day of his state visit to Britain, Peres Wednesday became the first Israeli leader to address members of both houses of Parliament in the House of Lords' Robing room.  
"The State of Israel began to take shape as Great Britain, under the leadership of Winston Churchill, saved the world from the Nazi threat. It was a time when many countries closed their gates to Holocaust survivors," Peres said.  
"My family arrived in Israel when it was still under British mandate. In our pockets were British Palestinian passports. In our hearts was the Balfour declaration. Israel would not have a vibrant democracy if it hadn't been for the British legacy."  
While Peres spoke, some 20 pro-Palestinian protesters called on Britain not to maintain ties with the "apartheid state" Israel and the "war criminal" Peres.  
A larger demonstration was held outside Oxford University's theater on Tuesday, when Peres' speech on 'Peace and Globalization" was disrupted by some 150 anti-Israel protesters.  
Some of the demonstrating students entered the lecture hall, which was open to all students, and interrupted Peres' speech repeatedly, protesting Israel's conduct in the territories.  
The protesting students were removed, except for one who approached the president, but were silenced by a majority of the audience while the president carried on with his speech.  
In his address to the parliament members, Peres said he "responded positively" to the Arab peace initiative. "However, it should be clear that agreement can not be achieved by a simple 'take-it-or-leave it' offer. We couldn't accept all the articles of the Arab Initiative. The truth is that it's hard to answer all demands at a time when some parties in the region reject peace. Hamas violently rejects compromise. It continues to fire rockets at Israeli civilians. We can understand land for peace but will not accept land in return for rocket fire."  
Peres also said he believed an agreement could be reached with Saudi King Abdullah but was not sure Abdullah was ready to push for peace, at this time, with all the force of his kingdom.  
Peres is scheduled to visit Buckingham Palace Thursday and meet Queen Elizabeth II, who will bestow an honorary knighthood on him. He will also meet with Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

<title>Video / Prof. Avi Shlaim: Settlements turned Israel into apartheid state</title>
<date>Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
British-Israeli Professor Avi Shlaim joined a handful of academics in London earlier this month to debate the future of Zionism, in a panel entitled "Israel at 60: What happened to the Zionist dream?"
Shlaim, a historian of the Arab-Israeli conflict at Oxford University, made headlines last year when he decided to speak at an Oxford Union debate in favor of the motion, "This house believes that one state is the only solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict."
But Shlaim, an opponent of campaigns pursued by some of his British colleagues to boycott Israeli universities, has always been a fervent supporter of the two-state solution, a stance he repeated in this month's event, which was organized by the Institute of Ideas. 
He continues, he said, to believe in Israel's legitimacy to exist within its pre-1967 borders, but "rejects uncompromisingly the Zionist colonial project beyond the Green Line."
In his talk, entitled "Obsession with Territory Post-1967," Shlaim blasts the settlements, which he says have turned Israel into an apartheid state, as the primary source of failure for peace efforts with the Palestinians. 
Shlaim believes Zionism was derailed from its course after the Six-Day war, when its universalist principles were replaced with "religious messianism and secular nationalism." Israel must give up land, he says, not just as a concession to the Palestinians, but because "a people that oppresses another cannot itself remain free."

<title>VIEWPOINT / The Down with Israel Syndrome</title>
<date>Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Each year, in preparation for Israel's birthday, American newspaper editors feel an urge to invite Arab writers to tell us why Israel should not exist. Typical this year were the Los Angeles Times (Opinion, May 12 "Forget the two-state solution", by Saree Makdisi) and the Christian Science Monitor (Ghada Karmi "A One-state Solution for Palestinians and Israelis", May 30, 2008), where the elimination of Israel were advanced under the usual euphemism of a "one-state solution."
I presume this exercise gives editors some satisfaction, of the kind one would get in inviting officials of the Flat Earth Society to tell us why the earth should not be round, and do so precisely on Earth Day, lest the wisdom would escape anyone's attention.
Undoubtedly, the banalization of absurdity has its kicks. It is sporty, admirably "out-of-the-box-ish" and, if only it did not involve a dangerous experiment with the lives of millions of human beings, could be considered mighty cute.
But this practice is adult matter, and the result is a depressing Kafkaesque choreography, in which Israel is put on trial for its very existence, while less radical commentators, if they are invited, deal with Israel's future, difficulties and achievements, but leave the accusations unanswered.
There is some wisdom to ignoring insults and unfounded accusations. By answering one tacitly bestows credence, however minimal, upon the arguments that put you on the accused bench -- the last bench that a birthday celebration deserves.
So, perhaps it is wise to write chapter and verse about Israel's achievements (as Bill Kristol did May 12, and Tom Friedman did June 8) and let the "colonial" and "apartheid" accusations hang there, unanswered, as living testimonies of the Orwellian mentality of the accusers?
I am not totally convinced.
I am concerned about the possibility that a non-negligible percentage of American readers, especially the novice and the hasty, would interpret the publication of opinion articles calling for the dismantling of Israel as evidence that the arguments and conclusions presented are deemed worthy of consideration in the eyes of editors whose judgment the public has entrusted to protect us from Flat-Earth type deformities.
This concern becomes especially acute when news reporters too begin touting the "one-state" slogans, with unmistaken sympathy, under the cover of "World News."(e.g., Richard Boudreaux and Ashraf Khalil "For some Palestinians, one state with Israel is better than none," LA Times, World News, May 8 )
I am concerned because evil plans begin with evil images. Once the mind is jolted to envision deviant imagery it automatically consructs a belief structure that supports its feasibility and desirability. The first phase of Hitler's strategy was to get people to envision, just envision, a world without Jews -- the rest is history.
Today we are witnessing a concerted effort by enemies of co-existence to get people to envision, just envision, a world without Israel - the rest, they hope, will become history.
The American press seems to fall for it.
In fairness to the editors of some newspapers, articles calling forthe elimination of Israel are often balanced by articles discussingthe prospects for a peaceful settlement of the dispute. But, ironically, this "balance" is precisely where the imbalance cries out loudest, for it gives equal moral weight to a provocation that every Jew in Israel considers a genocidal death threat, most Jews view as an assault on their identity as people and most Palestinians view as an incentive to undermine or forestall peace negotiations. 
Balance has its norms, logic and responsibilities, mirrored and shaped by sound editorial judgment. We do not rush to "balance" each celebration of Martin Luther King Day with articles by white supremacists, and we do not "balance" a hate speech with a lecture on breathing technique; a hate speech is balanced with a lecture on the evils of hate.
A true, albeit grotesque, moral balance would be demonstrated only if for every "down with Israel" writer the newspaper were to invite a "down with Palestinian statehood" writer.
But editors seem to have strange takes on morality; for some, questioning the legitimacy of Israel's existence is a mark of impartiality, while questioning the legitimacy of Palestinian aspirations is a moral taboo. Decency should somehow inform these editors that both "down with" calls are morally reprehensible and insulting to readers' intelligence, hence, both should be purged from civil discourse and marginalized into the good company of white supremacy and Flat-Earth rhetoric.
But until decency reigns, we can be sure to see them again at Israel's birthdays, the predators of peace, paraded by the press, demanding their annual prey: once more to envision, just envision, a world without Israel.
Ironically, Arab commentaries published around Yom Haatzmaut can actually be of some service to Israel, for they provide a faithful mirror of the prevailing sentiments in the elite ranks of Palestinian society and thus gauge how ready this society is to accepting a peace agreement, whatever its shape, as permanent.
This year, the LA Times (May 11), The Nation (May 26)  the New York Times (May 18) the Washington Post (May 12) the Christian Science Monitor (May 30) and others lured an impressive group of Arab intellectuals into unveiling their worldview to American readers.
Highly educated, mostly secular, champions of modernity and masters of communication, these authors are keenly attuned to grass roots sentimentsand, enticed by the limelight, revealed the naked landscape of the Palestinian mindset.
Sadly, what they revealed in 2008 is not what Mahmoud Abbas and public opinion polsters would like us to believe. They revealed what we feared all along but were afraid to admit: the notion of a two-state solution never began to penetrate the surface of Palestinian consciousness.
In vain would one search these articles for a shred of an idea that morally justifies a two-state solution, or that acknowledges some historical ties of Jews to the land, or that makes an intellectual investment contrary to the Greater Palestine agenda.
One by one, the articles depict Israel as a temporary outpost of Western imperialism, a entity to oppose not to neighbor.
This does not mean that the two-state solution is dead - after all, it is the only proposal worthy of the word "solution" - but it means that the current efforts to reach a peaceful settlement should begin to address one key obstacle: the ideological landscape as revealed to us by our Arab brethren on Yom Haatzmaut.

<title>Web site seeks ex-Swedish volunteers to act as goodwill ambassadors  </title>
<date>Mon Mar 24 00:00:00 IST 2008</date>
<content>
Last year, Kiki Toledano, a member of Kibbutz Massada in the Jordan Valley and a lecturer of English, was invited to speak on a radio station in Sweden. "It was a program where the host raised issues close to his heart," said Toledano. "I spoke about Israel as an Israeli citizen, and I then understood how difficult our situation is." 
She also said that, in her discussions with the listeners, they described the country as a conqueror, and acting with cruelty toward Palestinians.  
"It hurt me to hear what they were saying about us," said Toledano, who arrived at Kibbutz Massada in 1982 as a volunteer and married a member of the kibbutz. "Israel's public relations in Sweden are in a sad state." 
The Web site recently launched by the Israeli embassy in Sweden is trying to change the situation Toledano described. The site (www.kibbutz.nu), was designed to attract Swedes who had spent time volunteering on kibbutzim in Israel, and spur them to act as "ambassadors" and spokesmen for the state overseas. 
The Web site, which includes content on Israel and on kibbutzim, invites former volunteers to join a social network to help Israel's public relations. The embassy estimates that about 40,000 Swedes have spent time as volunteers in Israel since 1967. 
"It is a waste not to take advantage of former volunteers," said Rina Keren, head of the volunteers department in the Kibbutz Movement. "These people are ambassadors of goodwill. About 400,000 volunteers have spent time on kibbutzim since 1967, and the vast majority have nothing but good things to say about Israel. Making good use of these people will give Israeli PR a decisive advantage." 
"We don't have an oversupply of support, and for the past two years we have been considering the best way to reach our target audience," explained Israel's Consul in Stockholm, Kobi Shoshani. "This is another common thread among 30-50 year olds, many of whom spent time on kibbutzim. Their eyes light up when they speak about this time. Anyone who has been a volunteer in Israel knows that it's not all war, it's also kibbutz, volunteers, and other things." 
"There is a community of people in Sweden who can do a lot for us," noted Keren. "Some have been appointed to powerful positions in government and embassies. When former Shin Bet chief Carmi Gillon was appointed Israel's ambassador there, he had a difficult start (criticism of the Shin Bet's activities toward Palestinians, etc.). He wrote that one thing that helped him was the fact that a third of the Parliament had been volunteers on kibbutzim." 
Toledano fondly recalls coming to Massada as a young woman of 19. 
"There was an ideological element to it," she said. "In the 1970s and 1980s, living on a collective, together, in cooperation, was a very strong motif. Life today has become very individualistic." 
But the most obvious change she sees is in the attitude toward Israel. 
"Now they compare us to South Africa, present us as an apartheid regime, and Arafat as a hero and freedom-fighter," she related. "A student of mine was killed in the terror attack on the Maxim restaurant in Haifa, and what do the Swedes see? A display of a pool of blood with an image of a terrorist. When the ambassador destroyed the display, the thing that is remembered in Sweden is the so-called crazy ambassador, and not the story about the terrorist attacks. 
"Anyone who knows the truth is someone who is very interested, and many of these are former volunteers, who see a different reality."

<title>Yishai to Carter: Tell Meshal that I want to discuss prisoner swap </title>
<date>Fri Apr 18 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Deputy Prime Minister Eli Yishai asked former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to tell Hamas leaders, including Khaled Meshal, that he would like to meet in order to expedite a prisoner exchange that would bring home kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit.  
Yishai relayed his message to Carter during a meeting on Monday. The meeting was held at the request of the former president, who wanted to meet with Israeli political leaders from across the political spectrum. The meeting was arranged through the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.  
Yishai's bureau said he did not ask Prime Minister Ehud Olmert for permission to hold the meeting, nor did he tell Olmert what he discussed.  
Yishai said other Israeli officials erred in boycotting Carter. During the meeting, he told Carter that he opposed the former president's use of the term "apartheid" in his book about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Yishai said Carter told him that the interpretation of his use of the word was fundamentally wrong.  
Yishai told Haaretz that in order to redeem prisoners, he was prepared to meet with anyone who could help move things ahead, including Hamas leaders. He said this did not contradict Israeli government policy, since he did not intend to discuss diplomatic issues or a cease-fire.  
After Carter visited Sderot this week, he pledged to help arrange a cease-fire. Carter also met with Shalit's parents, and said he would address Shalit's release when he spoke to Meshal.  
Shalit was kidnapped during a raid on an Israeli army post near Gaza in the summer of 2006, and is being held in the coastal strip.  
"I am ready to meet with all necessary Hamas members and with Shalit's captors, and I would be pleased if you can help," Yishai told Carter at their meeting on Monday. "I am volunteering myself for the task, and I ask you to convey a message: They also have prisoners and I am sure they want to see them released, and therefore it is proper to expedite the negotiations."  
Yishai thanked Carter for his willingness to assist in finding out the fate of missing soldiers Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser, whose kidnapping in 2006, days after Shalit's, sparked the Second Lebanon War.  
Carter promised to pass along the message and to meet with Yishai again when he returns to Israel next week, after visiting other countries in the region.  
Yishai opposes negotiating with the Palestinian leadership, led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, over a permanent-status arrangement, especially regarding Jerusalem.  
A source in Shas said Thursday that if talks with Hamas led to calm, especially around the Gaza Strip, this could lessen pressure to reach a final-status agreement, which could lead to a coalition crisis with Shas.  
Yishai placed his request as Israeli and American officials were protesting Carter's intention to meet with Meshal, the leader of an organization that Israel and the United States consider a terror group. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert did not make time to meet with Carter, and Haaretz has learned that after the press mentioned Carter's plan to meet Meshal, Defense Minister Ehud Barak cancelled a meeting that had been scheduled for Monday. Barak's bureau said the meeting had been cancelled due to scheduling conflicts.  
Carter told Haaretz this week that before he arrived in the region, his staff informed the U.S. government of all the meetings he had planned for his Middle East visit, including the meeting with Meshal. Carter said that until his plans became public knowledge, no U.S. officials objected to them.

<title>Zahar: Gazans can do 'no less' than rise up like Warsaw Ghetto Jews</title>
<date>Thu Apr 17 00:00:00 IDT 2008</date>
<content>
Senior Hamas official Mahmoud Zahar writing in an opinion piece published Thursday in the Washington Post stated that Gazans can do 'no less' than rise up against Israel like Jews in the Warsaw ghetto did against the Nazis.
"Sixty-five years ago, the courageous Jews of the Warsaw ghetto rose in defense of their people. We Gazans, living in the world's largest open-air prison, can do no less," Zahar wrote in the newspaper.
The Gaza-based Hamas leader later decried Judaism as having "corrupted itself in the detour into Zionism, nationalism and apartheid."
In the Washington Post opinion piece, Zahar also denounced Israel as waging a "total war" against the Palestinian people, which he cited as an explanation for last week's attack by Gaza militants on the Nahal Oz fuel depot, declaring that resistance was the only option left to the Palestinians.
Zahar further stated that United States policy in the Middle East had reached a dead end, while praising former U.S. president Jimmy Carter's "sensible plan to visit the Hamas leadership" as bringing honesty and pragmatism.

<title>Alex Sinclair / If you love Israel, then criticize its imperfections</title>
<date>Sun Mar 22 20:20:26 IST 2009</date>
<content>
If you believe, as I do, that loving Israel and criticizing Israel are two acts that can and must go together, then these are tough times. And they're going to get tougher.  
Look around the world today, and you see increasing evidence of bitter, vicious, and outrageous attacks on Israel: Israeli Apartheid week in Canada, Caryl Churchill's ten-minute diatribe-play in England.
In the words of a prominent American Jewish layleader with whom I spoke last week, the American college campus is going in the direction of Europe - it's not quite there yet, but it's on the way.
In environments such as these, how can we do anything other than defend Israel against those who hate it?  
If we express our qualms about certain policies, if we voice our dismay at the right-wing coalition that is in formation, if we "wash our dirty laundry in public," won't it just give further ammunition to the anti-Semites and anti-Zionists?  
I speak from painful personal experience here. Some of my previous pieces that originally appeared on this Web site have been cut and pasted onto sites run by Israel-haters.
I certainly understand those who would mute complexity at a time like this.  But we do ourselves a disservice, and ultimately we do Israel a disservice, if we allow ourselves to let external criticism dull our right - our obligation - to be critically loyal, to be thoughtful lovers of Israel.
In order to strengthen the position of critical loyalty, there is one key area we need to work on: soundbites.  
Complex, nuanced, balanced positions are traditionally thought of as difficult to convey in short, snappy, media-friendly statements.  However, as the following sentences demonstrate, we can convey the gist of the critical loyalty position in easy-to-digest terms, even in atmospheres of intimidation:
 You are right, the current government of Israel has some deeply mistaken policies.  But there are some really impressive figures on the Israeli left and they make me proud to be a Zionist and proud to be a Jew.  Let's talk about the different policies of the opposition parties and how we can strengthen them from abroad.  
I also think Israel should leave the territories and enable the establishment of a Palestinian state; so do thousands (probably millions) of Israelis.  There are some fantastic Israeli non-profit groups that are doing that advocacy work.  Let's talk about how to work with and support those Israelis to make it happen.
What these kinds of statements have in common is firstly, an acknowledgement of Israel's imperfection.  
In confrontational situations, this is a bold step, but it has the advantage of wrong-footing the Israel-hater.  
Secondly, after that acknowledgement comes a statement that destabilizes the monolithic picture of Israel that many non-Jews (and Jews) have. The message is that Israel contains a wide variety of voices and opinions, and while I disagree with some, perhaps even the majority, there are other deeply compelling voices in Israel that I strongly bond with.  
Thirdly, the statements end with another wrong-footing maneuver: A call to co-operate in the spirit of the two-state solution that guarantees statehood for the Palestinians and security for Israel as a Jewish state, based on international documents like the Roadmap, Annapolis, and the Geneva Accords.  
Implicit within the call for co-operation is the demand for recognition of Israel's right to exist, which in confrontational situations must be a basic and first requirement for continued debate.
We have no option but to generate soundbite responses like these.  Increasing numbers of Diaspora Jews are not able to defend the policies of the Israeli government with integrity.  
Unless we offer credible, thoughtful response mechanisms that defend Israel from its haters in a nuanced, complex way, but without muting genuine critique, we will lose an entire generation of left-leaning Diaspora Jews.
As well as saving the Jewish people, this mode of response is also our biggest weapon against Israel-haters.  
We can show them that we can be critical of Israel and still love it;  we can voice our frustration, our anger, and even our disgust with some of its policies, while supporting with unshakeable conviction its right to exist and flourish in peace; we can infuse and enrich our Jewish identities with its cultural and artistic delights even as we bridle at some of its religious extremism.  And we can do all that with soundbites, too.  
Israel: It's imperfect; I love it; help me improve it.

<title>Canada schools blasted for ban on anti-Israel 'apartheid' poster</title>
<date>Thu Feb 26 21:27:01 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Two Canadian universities came under criticism this week for banning a poster which is seen to be depicting Israelis as child-killers and accusing Israel of apartheid. Brazilian politicians and scholars, meanwhile, lambasted a recent student exchange accord between Tel Aviv University and a Catholic academy from Sao Paulo. 
The posters from Canada, which were banned from Ottawa University and Carleton University, are advertisements for an annual series of events labeled as "Israeli Apartheid Week," due to begin on Monday, March 1. The "Israeli Apartheid Week" tradition began in 2005 in Toronto, spreading since to other campuses and cities.
The poster, circulated by pro-Palestinian activists, depicts a gunship with the word "Israel" on it firing a missile at a boy wearing a kaffiyeh and holding a teddy bear. In explaining the ban, Ottawa University said: "All posters approved must promote a campus culture where all members of the community can play a part in a declaration of human rights." 
The poster has roused controversy in Canadian and international press and on campuses, where supporters of Israel said it was unacceptably portraying Israelis as child-killers - an old anti-Semitic theme. 
One student from the Ottawa university, who preferred their names be withheld from this article, told Haaretz that the decision to ban the posters was "a blatant violation of free expression for students speaking out on human rights." 
Activists also circulated letters and emails with phone numbers for the universities' directors, urging students to call and protest. Pro-Palestinian activist Jessica Carpinone argued that Carleton officials have given "no valid reason for banning the poster other than that it's a controversial issue."
B'nai Brith Canada executive vice-president Frank Dimant praised the universities' action but said the colleges should ban the week's entire "hate fest."
"Israel should be treated as an apartheid state"
Commenting on the student exchange agreement between the Brazilian university and Tel Aviv University, Valter Pomar, foreign relations secretary for Brazil's ruling party, the PT, told Haaretz that "now is not the time for such accords." 
The accord was the first signing of a cooperation initiative between a Brazilian and an Israeli university since Israel's operation in Gaza.
Pomar added: "It would be proper to apply to the Israeli government the same treatment that the apartheid government of South Africa had received," said Pomer, who stressed he was speaking in his private capacity and not for the party.
Last month, Pomar cosigned an official announcement by the party accusing Israel of "state terrorism" and comparing its actions in Gaza to Nazi blitzes.
Brazilian priest José Oscar Beozzo, a prominent theologian from Sao Paulo, also indicated his reservations about the exchange deal, citing "Israel's condemnable massacre in Gaza."

<title>Heavily Jewish Brooklyn food co-op mulls ban on Israel produce</title>
<date>Mon Feb 23 13:04:43 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Located in the heart of Brooklyn, near Prospect Park, the Park Slope Food Coop is at the nexus of the borough's many diverse Jewish populations. From the liberal Jews of Park Slope to the Hasidic Jews of Crown Heights, the coop is one of the few places in Brooklyn where Jews of all denominations converge in a shared mission: to buy natural foods at reasonable prices.
But the co-op's unusual Jewish character is being tested by a proposal to ban products bought from Israel, such as the persimmons and red peppers that are currently in the produce aisle.
Since the Gaza operation, there has been a rash of campaigns around the world to divest from Israel and to boycott its products. At Hampshire College this month, a spat ensued when a pro-Palestinian student group erroneously announced that the school was the first American college to divest from Israel. Israeli tennis star Shahar Peer was denied a visa to play at a major tournament in Dubai, and Britain has experienced ongoing efforts to boycott Israeli academic institutions.
The proposal at the co-op is not likely to be economically meaningful; perhaps a few shipments of vegetables are at stake. But the debate is taking place in a rare hotbed of diverse Jewish life.
"There are so many Jews who shop there, there are so many Israelis who shop there, there's a huge number of frum people from all over Brooklyn who shop there," said Rabbi Andy Bachman of Brooklyn's largest and most active reform congregation, Beth Elohim, "so my guess is that if it passes, and I want to emphasize that I don't think it will, they will lose a lot of members."
Bachman's congregation is known as a hub for Brooklyn's progressive Jews, and it has served as a home for the co-op's monthly meetings, including the one at which the boycott proposal was first raised.
Bachman said he received several e-mails on the subject, a few of which came from congregants asking if the synagogue was taking any action. Bachman said that his only plan is to attend the meeting when the ban is discussed, and place his name on a list of people who would like to speak. He said that if the ban does pass, it is likely that the synagogue will ask the co-op to find a different space to rent for its general meetings.
"It will remain an irrelevant gesture to 5 million Israelis and 2 million Palestinians, but it will make someone in Park Slope feel really good about themselves," he said. That's what this is about; it's about the political purity, which is part of Park Slope?s unique self-absorption."
Bachman does not, though, speak for all Brooklyn Jews, despite having founded an organization with that name. Carol Wald, a Jewish co-op member living in the area, was one of two people to send letters to the co-op's home-grown newspaper, the Linewaiters' Gazette, encouraging the boycott discussion.
"All points of view really need to be heard," she said. "If we start proposing things like boycotts, it'll prompt more discussion, and that'll help educate people."
Since it was founded in 1973, the co-op has grown into a neighborhood institution with a membership of nearly 15,000. All members are required to work monthly shifts. According to Allen Zimmerman, general coordinator and produce buyer at the co-op, that philosophy attracts people from all walks of life.
"A lot of people are here for the tofu, but a lot of people are here for the beef and pork," he said.
On the Jewish side, the co-op has its own kosher committee, which vets purchases of kosher meat and other products.
The push for an Israel boycott adds to the co-op's long history of political action. Nestle products were voted out by the membership, because of the company?s campaign to promote infant formula instead of breastfeeding, and members rallied around a ban of South African goods during the apartheid regime.
The proposal to boycott Israeli goods was first raised by a woman who gives her name as Hima B., a co-op member of South Asian decent, during the "open forum" at the general meeting in January. She faced no vocal opposition, according to people who were there, and was told to create an agenda item for a general meeting in the future.
"She spoke for less than 60 seconds, and nobody questioned it," said Zimmerman, who was in attendance that night, along with an estimated 275 others.
Hima said she has since recruited 10 other members and hopes to put the issue on the agenda for an upcoming general meeting.
"There have been other attempts in the past to call for a boycott of Israeli goods. I don't think it went anywhere," she said. A member for nearly five years, Hima was motivated to take action after learning more about the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians. "Economic sanctions worked in South Africa. Why shouldn't we ask for an end to practices that are violating human rights?" she said.
Though many members are unaware of the proposal - only the most active go to the general meeting, or read the Linewaiters' Gazette - Jewish groups and synagogues have been sending e-mails and making phone calls.
Many believe that such a boycott could never pass, given the co-op's diversity.
Michael Barrish, a 48-year-old Web developer who was shopping on February 17, said the ban is absurd. He believes it would be shouted down by Jews who support Israel, and laughed at by those who find a ban of this nature preposterous. But, Barrish said, "I like being a member of a place in which you can propose what you believe."

<title>Israel supporters protest anti-Israel book launch in London </title>
<date>Sun Jul 12 03:37:01 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
An anti-Israel literary event in London on Thursday drew a strong pro-Israel contingent, according to participants and organizers, who said that some 25 percent of attendees came there to defend Israel.
Despite this, the event's organizers refused to admit one of the top figures of Britain's Zionist Federation.
The event - held on the anniversary of the International Court of Justice's contested 2004 ruling that the West Bank separation fence is illegal - was hosted at Toynbee Hall by an organization called War on Want, a self-described charity that supports boycotting Israel.
A book there by journalist Ben White entitled Israeli Apartheid: A Beginner's Guide had its launch at the event, which was followed by a panel discussion.
According to participants and organizers, some 50 to 80 people attended, more than 15 of whom had come to protest the book and tell Israel's side of the story. Jonathan Hoffman, co-vice chair of Britain's Zionist Federation, was refused entry. 
Hoffman stood outside the venue handing out flyers, in which he accused the author and event organizers of promoting a "farrago of false quotations, inaccuracies and omissions which is aimed at young people."
Author Ben White has argued that Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad did not deny the Holocaust. In 2002, White published an article in which he wrote that he can "understand" why some people are anti-Semitic, though he himself was not.
War on Want praised his new book as an "information-packed, highly readable introduction to understanding the origins of the conflict and how apartheid applies to Palestine."
While standing outside the venue, Hoffman was questioned by police, who then allowed him to continue handing out flyers. Jonathan Sacerdoti, one of the Israel supporters who attended the event, said organizers called the police to complain about Hoffman, but the organizers deny this.
"We didn't call the police," said John Hilary, War on Want executive director. "Organizers of past events told us Mr. Hoffman would create a disturbance and we don't want such people to attend." But Sacerdoti says that "anyone who knows Jonathan Hoffman knows this claim is nonsense." 
Hilary said the discussion was "robust" featuring "strong debate" by people "from all sides, who spoke with passion." He added he welcomed the attendance of people who had come there to oppose the opinions expressed in the book and by War on Want, as they "encouraged and enriched the debate."

<title>JEWISH WORLD / A plea to Jews everywhere, unprepared to fight anti-Semitism</title>
<date>Mon Mar 16 16:43:23 IST 2009</date>
<content>
I have always felt that decency will prevail and that anti-Semitism, racism and hatred wherever they stand will ultimately be contained. 
This is the Jewish way. I have faith that evil will eventually scatter and run, and goodness and tolerance will prevail. I have not been shaken from these beliefs, but I am shaken.
Over the last little while, there has been an abundance of news showing anti-Semitism is on the rise in my country, Canada. 
A court ruling finding a Native 'elder' accused of spreading hatred against the Jewish people has been overturned. Hooliganism against Jews and Israel Apartheid Week is on our university campuses, and a resolution was passed by an Ontario public employees union barring Israeli academics from speaking and lecturing in our universities. 
There is cause for concern and this is Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I can only imagine how the Jews of France must feel. 
Of equal concern is the fact that Jewish communities everywhere are once again unprepared to fight anti-Semitism effectively and our leadership has failed, so far, in developing a community mobilization plan. 
There are no voices emanating from Israel, the Jewish federations, B'nai Briths or synagogue pulpits letting us know that someone somewhere is working on a collective long term strategy to fight anti-Semitism, protect Israel's reputation, and counter the virulent and aggressive language and activities of news bureaus, online bloggers and website authors.  
Simply put, after years of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on Holocaust education and buildings memorializing our 'kedoshim', the six million who died, we seemed to have learned very little. We are still far too comfortable and fooled by the success we have discovered; still too reliant on others to protect us, and still blind to the reality that the Jewish world has the ability to create a worldwide community mobilization plan that could stymie much of the anti-Semitic and anti-Israel filth emanating from dozens of corners and crannies around the globe, from the Vatican to Venezuela.  
So, I call on you, Jewish community members to demand of our leadership a community mobilization plan. Call up your Israel Consular General, Rabbis, leaders of the UJA/Federations, B'nai Briths and other such organizations and ask them where and when you can meet to determine your participation in a plan that will strengthen and protecting the Jewish people. 
Ask them what resources are required to make such a plan a reality. 
Ask them how we can all work together to create a force, composed of Jews of every denomination, together with our non-Jewish friends, to defend ourselves against the upside-down world that sees us as responsible for the economic downturn, the depression of the Muslim world and any other 'flavor of  the month' issue.
Tell them you have some ideas such as: launching a campaign to raise $100 million worldwide to finance this plan ? something we are good at; using the currently available Birthright and March of the Living participants to spearhead a team of young people to counter their anti-Israel and anti-Semitic counterparts; creating a local, national and international team of Jewish bloggers who can counter anti-Semitism online; befriending non-Jews who can aid and assist in our struggle; creating community workshops to meet those people in our community and around the world who are sitting on the anti-Semite fence, or even those who speak negatively about us but can be convinced.
Historically, the Diaspora Jewish communities have never been well prepared to fight anti-Semitism. Israel has been of little help. This is a sad reality and the results have been dismal. But we live in a different world now, one in which battles can be fought over the internet and education of the masses happens through a push of a few buttons. 
We have many friends in the Christian, Muslim, Bahia, Buddhist and Hindu world after years of defending them against human rights abuses. We have colleagues in Aboriginal communities and neighbors who respect us for our safe streets.  
Our friends are everywhere, from Hungary to New Haven. It is time we call on them for a favor, help and support.
It is time we tap into the available philanthropic funds and no-how that has been built up in every major metropolitan centre in the world, to create a fundraising campaign that will underwrite this plan. Despite recent financial woes and the fifty billion actions of a destructive member of our community, funds are still available and a Community Mobilization emergency campaign will prove that. 
If you think this is hyperbole than go to Israel Apartheid Week happening on 42 campuses around the world, and sit in on a lecture or film. Listen closely to the words the speakers will use. You will know the words because they have been spoken before. They are words that marginalize and syllables that when pieced together, stigmatize.  They are words that are not foreign to Holocaust survivors.
Call your Jewish leaders and demand a plan. I beg you to do so. Tell them that we need a responsible and aggressive strategy that includes every man, woman and child - one that will fend off fists that try to beat us, shut the mouths that try to break us, and transform hatred into goodness where we are able.  
Now is the time, to take action. Your children are expecting you to fight, and every Jew who ever suffered or died at the hands of an anti-Semite is calling out to us. 
We will not fail ourselves! We can not. We know too much and are far too talented and resourceful. I believe times have changed. So should you.
I have not been shaken from my beliefs that people are still good, but I am shaken.

<title>Mendel Kaplan, 1936-2009 / Jewish leader, philanthropist, family man</title>
<date>Sun Nov 22 00:56:10 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Mendel Kaplan once told me that the key to success was focus. I witnessed it in all his efforts. Details concerned him greatly, but he never lost sight of the big picture. Indeed, he created the big picture.  
Mendel, who passed away Thursday after suffering a stroke, initiated, led and funded numerous Jewish, Zionist and other projects in South Africa and throughout the Jewish world. He was honorary president of Keren Hayesod and a former chairman of the Jewish Agency's Board of Governors. I know little about Cape Gate, the family business Mendel's father Isaac founded 80 years ago. Tomorrow, we were meant to attend an anniversary gala celebrating eight decades. Instead we should celebrate Mendel's life.  
There is much to celebrate in his 73 years: Cape Gate has been transformed from a modest business selling products like wrought iron and garden benches into a vast conglomerate producing its own steel; it became one of the largest privately owned companies in South Africa. The expansion was largely orchestrated by Mendel and his brother Robert.  
Cape Gate is a family concern. Family was Mendel's passion. Contact was maintained across continents. Newsletters found their way to every relative. Mendel and his loving wife Jill loved reunions. Everyone's progress was followed and appreciated. Mendel encouraged their efforts.  
Board meetings at the Isaac and Jessie Kaplan Centre for Jewish Studies and Research at the University of Cape Town were always exciting. Mendel knew balance sheets were not my strongest suit. But he would leave that alone.  
Projects, conferences and research interested him. There were no formalities. It was down to business. Mendel laughed at the stuffiness of university mores. With uncanny business acumen and total recall, he was able to juggle myriad activities and projects with mesmerizing precision. He cut to the quick.  
Mendel's law degree from the University of Cape Town and his master's in business administration from Columbia University in New York no doubt stood him in great stead. But it was his creativity, vision and focus that set him apart. A working lunch on his lovely patio overlooking False Bay in Cape Town would always be interrupted by calls from abroad - the Jerusalem Zoo, an Israeli cabinet minister, or an old friend from school.  
Mendel was always three steps ahead. He provided direction and ideas. But he also appreciated contestation. Exchanges were often tense but always underpinned by loyalty. Mendel teased me for many years about a rather strong letter a colleague and I wrote to him on the vexed question of representing Jews and apartheid in the South African Jewish Museum, which he established.  
When Mendel set his mind to something, he was unstoppable. He had a passion for matters Jewish. A deeply spiritual man, he was always reading, learning and writing. His most recent book recorded his travels as a young man in East Africa. It was written for his grandchildren.  
Mendel was immersed in South African and international Jewish affairs. His was a household name in the Jewish world. Although he moved in hallowed circles, Mendel always had time for lesser mortals. More than that, he cared for them. On one occasion he was hugely embarrassed when a suburban tabloid innocently published a list of donations following a request for funds to repair the Church roof in St. James, a seaside suburb where Mendel enjoyed his southern summers. Mendel's contribution dwarfed the others. I'm sure this was always the case.  
But he preferred the Maimonidean way. The Kaplan Centre too has appreciated his generosity. I know the Centre meant much to him, although it was only one of many flourishing ventures he created in a life dedicated to the Jewish people, to Israel, to family and to the less fortunate.  
Prof. Milton Shain is director of the Isaac and Jessie Kaplan Centre for Jewish Studies and Research at the University of Cape Town.

<title>Report: Jewish Fatah member nominated for party's Revolutionary Council</title>
<date>Sat Aug 08 21:02:48 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
A Jewish member of Fatah was nominated for a spot on the party's Revolutionary Council on Saturday, the Palestinian news agency Ma'an reported. 
Dr. Uri Davis told Ma'an that one of Fatah's weakest attributes has been its failure to establish ties with international parties, movements and human rights organizations, and promised to step up efforts, if elected.
Born to Jewish parents in Jerusalem, Davis describes himself as a Palestinian Hebrew.
Davis has written a series of books and articles that classify the State of Israel as an apartheid state, alleging that Israel's policies towards Palestinians, including Palestinian citizens of Israel, are comparable to South Africa's apartheid policies.
According to Ma'an, Davis explained that every Fatah member can run for a post on the party's 120-member Revolutionary Council regardless of religion, race or color. 
While it is common for Palestinian Christians to support Fatah and hold positions within the organization, Davis would likely be the first Jewish member of its Revolutionary Council if elected, the news agency said. He already serves as a Fatah-affiliated observer member (non-Palestinian) of the Palestinian National Council, to which he was appointed by the late Yasser Arafat in 1984.
Davis was recruited to Fatah in the 1980s by Palestine Liberation Organization leader and founder Khalil Al-Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad, who was assassinated in 1988 by an Israeli commando unit led by current Defense Minister Ehud Barak in Tunisia, the Palestinian news agency reported. 
"I wasn't convinced that the Israeli left-wing parties were satisfactory because all of them are Zionist parties," Davis explained. "Thus, I examined Palestinian left-wing parties but discovered that most of them adopted Marxism," such as the secular Popular and Democratic Fronts for the Liberation of Palestine.
"However I was pro-socialism rather than Marxism, so I joined Fatah because it contained a liberal framework that encompasses contradictory yet harmonious ideologies," he added. "The movement has struggled to liberate land and people from occupation."

<title>South Africa Jews slam deputy FM's anti-Semitic comments</title>
<date>Wed Jan 28 16:26:18 IST 2009</date>
<content>
South Africa's Jewish community on Wednesday lodged a complaint of hate speech against the country's deputy foreign minister, who earlier this month said that "Jewish money controls America and most Western countries."
Stressing that the South African Jewish Board of Deputies "usually prefers dialogue," the Board's national director, Wendy Kahn, told Haaretz: "Deputy Minister Fatima Hajaig had crossed all limits."
Kahn, who is in Israel to attend the World Jewish Congress in Jerusalem, called Hajaig's comments "a demonstration of anti-Semitism of the oldest and most classical kind."  
The Board filed the complaint against Hajaig to the country's Human Rights Commission - a national institution with some investigative and executive powers, which derives its powers from the post-apartheid constitution. 
In the complaint, the Board quotes what Hajaig said at a pro-Palestinian rally in Lenasia on January 14. "They in fact control [America], no matter which government comes in to power, whether Republican or Democratic, whether Barack Obama or George Bush," Hajaig was heard saying.  
She also said: "The control of America, just like the control of most Western countries, is in the hands of Jewish money and if Jewish money controls their country then you cannot expect anything else." 
The minister, who is out of the country, has so far not commented on the complaint, nor has the government clarified its position on the controversial comments. However, Kahn noted the administration has been "overall more evenhanded toward Israel during the Gaza operation' than during the 2006 Lebanon War." Hajaig's comments, Kahn said, were the exception.  
In the Board's announcement about the complaint, chairman Zev Krengel said that although  the decision "had not been taken lightly," it was necessary because "not since the era of pro-Nazi Nationalist MPs more than half a century ago had such statements been made against Jews by a senior government official." 
The Democratic Alliance of the opposition has called for Hajaig to be sacked if she did not offer an immediate public apology. Party spokeswoman Lindiwe Mazibuko said: "It is incumbent upon Hajaig to immediately apologize to the people of South Africa in general, the Jewish community in particular, and to US President Barack Obama.? 
The Israeli Foreign Ministry also recently complained to the South African government about Hajaig, after she used harsh and "undiplomatic" language in speaking with Israel?s ambassador to South Africa, Dov Segev-Steinberg, during the Gaza operation. 
According to various sources, Hajaig accused the ambassador of bringing a diplomat of Ethiopian descent to the embassy "only because he was black," presumably in order to counter the often-heard accusation in South Africa alleging that Israel is an apartheid state.

<title>South Africa politician apologizes for saying 'Jewish money controls America' </title>
<date>Wed Feb 04 19:35:28 IST 2009</date>

Following increasing pressure from South Africa's Jewish community, the country's deputy foreign minister apologized on Wednesday to the republic's president for saying last month that "Jewish money controls America."
Meanwhile, the South African dock workers union said its workers would refuse servicing an Israeli ship.
"Deputy Minister [Fatima Hajaig] expressed her deep regret to President [Kgalema Motlanthe]," the government said. "She accepted that the comments were contrary to stated government policy. She subsequently apologized unreservedly and unequivocally for the comments and agreed to withdraw them unconditionally."
The cabinet also termed Haijaig's comment, which she made on January 14 at a pro-Palestinian rally in Lenasia, "anti-Semitic." 
Last week the South African Jewish Board of Deputies filed a complaint of "hate speech" against Haijaig with the Human Rights Commission - a government body with some judicial and executive powers.
"We are quite happy with this apology," the Board's national chairman, Zev Krengel, told Haaretz. "Without a doubt, it's the result of pressure that we've applied." Krengel added the Board has not yet decided on whether to withdraw the complaint against Hajaig. But the cabinet said that the president has accepted her apology "and trusts that the matter has been concluded satisfactorily."
On Tuesday, Hajaig offered an earlier apology over the radio, which the Board rejected, saying it only "served to compound the original insult." In the beginning of the earlier radio apology, Hajaig deplored "the attempts of Zionists to justify policies that have worsened the crisis in the Middle East" and "unmitigated state violence directed against unarmed civilians." She reserved the same criticism for "indiscriminate attacks against Israeli unarmed civilians."
After delivering 300-odd words about her regional vision, Hajaig arrived at the controversial statement and said: "I conflated Zionist pressure with Jewish influence. I regret the inference made by some that I am anti-Jewish."
She added: "To the extent that my statement may have caused hurt and pain, I offer an unequivocal apology for the pain it may have caused to the people of our country and the Jewish community in particular."
Just hours before Hajaig's apology to the president, South Africa's largest trade union federation announced its members intend to refuse to service a ship scheduled to come in from Israel to Durban Port on Sunday. The union  called this a "historic development." 
The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) - which has approximately 1.8 million members ? added that following Israel's military campaign in Gaza last month, it is resolved to "strengthen the campaign in South Africa for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Apartheid Israel."

<title>U.S. Jews blast plan for anti-Israel UN official to attend Holocaust prayer service</title>
<date>Fri Jan 23 19:54:42 IST 2009</date>
<content>
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon will take part Saturday in a prayer service at a Manhattan synagogue to mark "World Holocaust Day".
Local Jewish leaders criticized the fact that President of the United Nations General Assembly Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann plans to take part in the service. 
Brockmann has been criticized heavily for a number of anti-Israel statements he has made in the past, including calling Israel an Apartheid state, and saying that Israel is 'crucifying the Palestinians', a statement that was widely taken to be anti-Semitic and not just anti-Israel.
Brockmann also accused Israel of committing 'Genocide' during the recent IDF operations in Gaza. 
The UN has so far not responded to calls for Brockmann not to attend, saying only that Ban was expected to be present at the prayer service.

<title>Why are American Jews abandoning Israel?</title>
<date>Mon Oct 05 18:22:34 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Why are American Jews abandoning us? Why do American Jews hold Israel to a higher standard than they do any other country in the world - including the one they so proudly call home?
As an American professor on sabbatical in Israel, I field questions like these on a regular basis. The "waning American Jewish love affair with Israel" - as the subtitle of Steven Rosenthal's 2001 book "Irreconcilable Differences?" put it - is big news here.
Israelis, living as they do in a highly dangerous neighborhood, know that they can scarcely afford to lose friends. It is no secret that well-armed terrorists committed to Israel's total destruction lie just over the border in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel is also within Iran's missile range. The specter of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad fingering a nuclear trigger and calculating how many Israelis he can kill in a "first strike" reminds even the most stubbornly self-reliant of Israelis why friends abroad are so vital.
So when the Hebrew Union College sociologist Steven M. Cohen warns of "a growing distancing from Israel of American Jews... most pronounced among younger Jews," Israelis take notice. And well they should. When someone as passionate as Forward columnist Jay Michaelson, who speaks Hebrew and lived for a time in Jerusalem, writes, as he did in a recent essay, of his "waning love of Israel," they know that they face a problem.
To be sure, this is not an Orthodox problem. The young Jews whom Cohen surveyed were almost entirely non-Orthodox. Michaelson and his social circle (where "supporting Israel is like supporting segregation, apartheid or worse") are not Orthodox either. Young Jews who do identify as Orthodox - between 10% and 20% of their age cohort - generally support Israel ardently.
As for other young Jews, Brandeis University researcher Ted Sasson reminds us that young people have for years been more critical than their elders of Israel. Even decades ago, youthful organizations like the New Jewish Agenda and Breira dissented from Israel's policies. Support for Israel, he argues, generally increases with age and experience.
There is, nevertheless, a critical difference between support for Israel in the past and today. For much of the 20th century, the Israel of American Jews - the Zion that they imagined in their minds, wrote about and worked to realize - was a mythical Zion, a utopian extension of the American dream. Proponents conjured up a Zion that they described as a "social commonwealth." They conceived of it both as an "outpost of democracy," spreading America's ideals eastward, and as a Jewish refuge where freedom, liberty and social justice would someday reign supreme.
Louis Brandeis, the great lawyer and Supreme Court justice who for a pivotal time around World War I led the American Zionist movement, served as high priest and chief prophet for this vision of Zion. The Zionist "Declaration of Principles" known as the Pittsburgh Program, produced in 1918 under his direction, called, among other things, for "political and civil equality irrespective of race, sex, or faith"; public ownership of land and natural resources; "the cooperative principle" applied to industry, agriculture and commerce, and "free public instruction."
Brandeis's goal was to create not just a Jewish state, but a utopian Jewish state - one that drew on American experience; took advantage of the latest in social, economic and political thinking, and conformed to prophetic teachings. "Our aim is the Kingdom of Heaven," he once exclaimed, and the declaration reveals much about the kind of Zion that he and many Jews of an earlier era envisaged: nothing less than a heaven on earth.
This dream long outlasted Brandeis. My generation of American Jews was raised to view the Zionist project through similarly rose-colored glasses. Now, though, that dream, which had more to do with the lofty visions of American Jews than with the sordid realities of the Middle East, lies shattered beyond repair. In place of the utopia that we had hoped Israel might become, young Jews today often view Israel through the eyes of contemporary media: They fixate upon its unloveliest warts.
Israelis who question me about the waning American Jewish love affair with Israel nod comprehendingly when I offer them this explanation. After all, they have seen many of their own Zionist dreams ground down by years of war. In both countries, the ardor of young love, with all of its unrealistic hopes and passions and dreams, has given way to middle-aged realities.
When the bloom falls off of young love, there are always those who announce that their relationship is in trouble and prepare for divorce. So it is today with too many American Jews and their "waning love" for Israel. The deepest and most meaningful of relationships, however, survive disappointments. By focusing upon all that they nevertheless share in common, and all that they might yet accomplish together in the future, American Jews and Israelis can move past this crisis in their relationship and settle in, as partners, for the long haul ahead.

<title>Why aren't Jews outraged by Israeli occupation?</title>
<date>Wed Jun 17 16:41:44 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
During this year's AIPAC conference in Washington, Executive Director Howard Kohr warned the 7,000-plus crowd that the global movement to "delegitimize Israel" was gathering steam. 
"These voices are laying the predicate for an abandonment," he said. His sentiments were almost apocalyptic: "The stakes in that battle are nothing less than the survival of Israel, linked inexorably to the relationship between Israel and the United States. In this battle we are the firewall, the last rampart."
The age of Barack Obama has unleashed a global wave of Jewish unease over Israel's future and the Diaspora's relationship to the self-described Jewish state. It's a debate that is long overdue. 
Zionist organizations in Australia campaigned loudly in May against the allegedly "anti-Semitic" play Seven Jewish Children, a ten-minute think-piece written by an English playwright accusing Jews of complicity in violence against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. 
A Jewish columnist for The New York Times, Roger Cohen, argued in June that the key word among Palestinians now is "humiliation."
"It's not good for the Palestinians, the Israelis or the Jewish soul," he wrote. The Jewish Week editor chastised him for such views - for "the anger, blame and one-sidedness of his argument" - and wondered "whose heart?has grown brutal?" 
An upcoming academic conference at York University in Toronto exploring the "one-state, bi-national solution" to the conflict was slammed last week by Gerald M. Steinberg, chair of the Department of Political Science at Bar Ilan University, for  fueling "the vicious warfare and mass terror" against Israelis and Palestinians. 
The decades-old ability of Zionist groups to manage the public narrative of Israeli victimhood is breaking down. Damning critics has therefore become a key method of control. 
But, writes Salon.com's Glenn Greenwald, a leading Jewish-American blogger, "whereas these smear tactics once inspired fear in many people, now they just inspire pity. They no longer work." 
He may be overly optimistic, but alternative Jewish voices are rising who are less concerned with being accused of "self-hatred" or treachery. They see it as their duty to damn what is wrong and not simply support Israeli government policies. 
A thinking, more enlightened Judaism is emerging, a necessity in the face of apartheid realities. The cause is human rights, not Zionist exclusion. 
Obama's recent speech in Cairo reflected the new Jewish consciousness. American Jews were certainly an intended audience because if it this group that must challenge their conservative spokespeople to undo years of following Likudnik thinking. As a candidate in 2008, the then Illinois senator said that, "there is a strain within the pro-Israel community that says unless you adopt an unwavering pro-Likud approach to Israel that you're anti-Israel and that can't be the measure of our friendship with Israel."
Many Jews in the Diaspora have never imagined anything else; it's been an imagined Israel in their minds for decades. Lawless behavior in the occupied territories is ignored through willful ignorance. Tellingly, the most reliable information about these truths in the West is found online, through blogs and activist Web sites, and not generally in the mainstream media. The gate-keepers are clinging on to the Exodus myths for dear life. 
Defining a humane Judaism in the 21st century means condemning the brutal military occupation in the West Bank and resisting the ongoing siege of Gaza. 
Jewish-American blogger Phil Weiss, who recently returned from the Strip, quoted a young Gazan saying in dismay: "We are being experimented on." 
The Palestinian narrative is routinely ignored or dismissed in the U.S. and beyond. This must change quickly for any chance of peace to break out in the Middle East. However, peace without justice is guaranteed to fail. 
After Obama?s speech in Cairo, where which he almost acknowledged the Palestinian "Nakba" without mentioning it by name, most major Jewish-American groups reacted with caution. 
The Anti-Defamation League said it was "disappointed that the President found the need to balance the suffering of the Jewish people in a genocide to the suffering of the Palestinian people resulting from Arab wars." 
This was code for "Nakba"-denial, as pernicious as Holocaust revisionism. 
But the liberal J Street lobby, still clinging to the delusion of a viable two-state solution and a "democratic, Jewish homeland," praised Obama?s "active diplomacy" and claimed that the "overwhelming majority of American Jews" supported an end to the West Bank colonies. 
Consistent polls suggest they are right, but the devil is in the detail. Is there real will to back the necessary steps, namely the removal of hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers in the West Bank? 
Co-Author of The Israel Lobby, Stephen Walt, said recently that he couldn't understand why more American Jews didn't realize the cliff Israel was running toward. Did they not see that repression in the occupied territories had defined Israel in the eyes of the world? Perhaps apartheid didn't bother them. Out of sight and out of mind. Benjamin Netanyahu's recent speech at Bar-Ilan University suggested he wasn't too fussed, either. 
I recently attended the Salute to Israel parade in New York ? picture 100,000 American Jews marching to celebrate the state, waving flags in praise of the IDF. It was a thoroughly depressing affair. Palestinians didn't exist; they were invisible. The world's biggest public display of pro-Israel feeling had no room for 20 percent of the Israeli population (let alone the millions in the West Bank and Gaza.) 
These events are actually a sign of desperate projection, not strength. Mainstream Zionism wants to completely shield Jews from the uncomfortable facts of the Israeli occupation and Palestinian self-determination. Jews were a proud people, a clever people and a victimized people. There was no time to indulge in frivolous Arab trivialities. 
But facts have an uncomfortable way of seeping back into view. Colonel Itai Virob, an IDF brigade commander in the West Bank, recently told an Israeli court that, "a slap, sometimes a punch to the scruff of the neck or the chest, sometimes a knee jab or strangulation to calm somebody [a Palestinian] down is reasonable."
Where is the Jewish outrage over this?

<title>Abbas: Isolate Netanyahu gov't like Hamas </title>
<date>Thu Feb 12 02:07:09 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas has conducted an international campaign in recent weeks aimed at the diplomatic isolation of a right-wing government headed by Likud chairman Benjamin Netanyahu. Abbas has been trying to convince the international community that such an Israeli government must face conditions similar to those faced by the Hamas government.  
A senior political source in Jerusalem said yesterday that the leaders of France, Britain and Italy have promised Abbas that they would not allow any new Israeli government delay or freeze the peace process. The same source said that Netanyahu's statements on continuing the peace process and on "economic peace" are perceived by Abbas and his aides as "empty promises."  
As such the Palestinian Authority prepared a plan for "diplomatic resistance" to Israel. The purpose of the plan is to offer an alternative to the "military resistance" of Hamas and preserve Fatah as a relevant force, even in the absence of a peace process.  
Making the rounds 
Abbas met last week with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and discussed with them his deep concerns about the establishment in Israel of a right-wing government headed by Netanyahu. Abbas stressed that such a development means a death blow to the peace process. He also expressed concern that Netanyahu's leadership would result in renewed expansion of settlements in the West Bank.  
During all his meetings, Abbas compared a right-wing government in Israel to the Palestinian unity government of Fatah and Hamas, which followed the Mecca Accords in 2007. "You refused to fully cooperate with such a government because Hamas did not meet the Quartet's conditions on ending terrorism and recognizing Israel," Abbas told the European leaders. "You will have to adopt a similar stance toward an Israeli government that will oppose the creation of a Palestinian state and genuine negotiations over the core issues of a permanent settlement," he added.  
Abbas demanded that the three leaders adopt the Quartet's clear conditions for a right-wing government in Israel, including the agreement on a vision for two states, the Annapolis process which was backed by UN Security Council resolution 1850, and a freezing of construction in the settlements.  
Seeking sanctions 
The Palestinian leader added that if the new government in Israel does not meet these conditions it should be isolated, and sanctions should be imposed on it similar to those imposed on the Hamas government or the apartheid regime of South Africa.  
Sarkozy, Brown and Berlusconi told Abbas that they will not accept a freeze in the peace process and an abandonment of the vision for the establishment of a Palestinian state.  
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner and his British counterpart David Miliband stressed that "we will not allow Israel to perpetuate the occupation in the West Bank under the guise of economic gestures of good will."

<title>A few words of advice for Israel's new diplomatic face in the U.S.</title>
<date>Sun Jul 12 13:06:57 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
When's the last time the Government of Israel made a decision that really and truly made you proud?   This week's This Hyphenated Life column is dedicated to just such a moment. 
While Bibi's speech to the Arab world in Cairo last month might have done it for some, in most cases, this bloated government is not a source of inspiration.
Yet, I had such a 'wow, that's terrific' reaction after hearing that Michael Oren was appointed as Israel's next ambassador to the United States.  Rather than just echo the initial reactions, let's both provide perspective and look forward.
Not only is it the best thing Bibi's done so far during his current term - in one masterful stroke he helped make up for the off-putting pick of Lieberman as foreign minister - he laid the groundwork for a very different kind of diplomat. 
Let's face it: the usual suspects are either a political appointee who is a friend of the prime minister or a foreign ministry careerist living the good life abroad before being sent back to unlivable wages in Jerusalem.  Dressing in bad suits, speaking bad English, repeating bad policy and too often, making bad impressions.
I know.  I worked for, and with, too many that fit this description. While there are many exceptions including impressive members of the Foreign Ministry, from Israel's Ambassador to Australia, Yuval Rotem, to the Ambassador to France, Danny Scheck - too many official representatives of the state of Israel serving abroad are in need of a makeover. 
That's why Oren's selection has the precision and unexpectedness of a successful pre-emptive strike by the IDF.
It's not just the fact that he's a skilled communicator, but like that other famous American who now lives on Pennsylvania Avenue, he's of similar age, with an Ivy League degree, a professor at a respected university (Georgetown no less), and a fellow author of best selling books.  
If you haven't yet read his Six Days of War, you should. It's a powerful reminder that Oren is an Israeli diplomat who possesses abundant expertise in, imagine that, the real requirement for the job, American and Middle East foreign policy.   
He also has the Israeli cred of fighting in the first Lebanon war, helping to establish the influential think tank the Shalem Center and having a personal demeanor, I'm told, that reflects the best of Israel i.e. unaffected, unpretentious, down to earth.  
I'm standing on the sidelines and rooting for him to meet and surpass expectations. Other than exchanging e-mails a few years back, I've never met Oren, but have to admit that I'd like to and hear his plans and ideas.With Oren's dynamic profile (a paragon for the American-Israeli, Israeli-American) it would be 'chutzpah-like' of me then to lecture Oren on do's and don'ts upon arriving to the nation's capital.
I'll be more 'diplomatic' and ask how Ambassador Oren can take his 'game' to the next level: 
How can he reshape the embassy from a fortress known for political infighting to an inviting center of Israeli creativity and culture?How can he move beyond the established 'leaders of the American Jewish community' to form close relations with others, Jew and non-Jew, who 'think different'? 
How can he transform the embassy into a laboratory for new media that offers real substance and also be a credible go to person for traditional media? 
How can he persuade academic circles in North America to drop the noxious apartheid South Africa analogy before it turns into a cancer?
How can he inspire other men and women of the arts, sciences, business and technology to outsmart the political operatives and be the face of Israel abroad?  
Finally, how can he be a case study for a new type of ambassador for not just Israel but other countries too? 
Contemplating all of those audacious, and very 2009 challenges, the more things change the more they stay the same.  
Oren is a return, in certain ways, to Abba Eban, and the feeling of respect and awe he engendered among us Diaspora Jews.  Unlike Eban, however, who he has studied and written about, Oren projects an intellectual aura without being haughty and above it all that understandably drove the native Israelis nuts.
Plus, Oren enters the stage when 'posting' generally has a far different meaning.   
It's hardly a secret that the status of being an ambassador has been severely diminished ever since world leaders could pick up the phone and speak directly to one another, and it?s already been more than twenty years since the diplomatic cable was made passe by the Cable News Network.  In today's Web 2.0 world, traditional diplomacy has been upended by people to people diplomacy - as we're seeing in the courageous protests in Iran, real people can use new technology to be heard and challenge the status quo.
I asked a friend, Lyon Roth, never at a loss for astute observations, how Oren would be measured.   His response was quick and to the point. 
"Oren's success will depend significantly on whether the Obama administration perceives him as both having Bibi's ear and truly speaking on Bibi's behalf.  If it does, he'll be a rock star. If not, his voice is less likely to have the impact it otherwise might."
My little advice to Oren would be similarly short and summarized in three words: go for it.  
Michael Oren has the opportunity to not just write about history, but to make history and in doing so restore needed relevance to this diplomatic post.

<title>An oud to Nablus </title>
<date>Tue Nov 17 02:40:28 IST 2009</date>
<content>
NABLUS - Anyone can make this Saturday outing to Nablus. You take the Ayalon Highway north and five minutes after the Derech Hashalom exit you turn right, toward Ramat Hasharon and Ra'anana, and keep going straight.  
Before you know it, you're on the best road between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean - Route 505, well-lit and with the highest-quality asphalt, wide shoulders and clear signage. This road cuts east through the West Bank and reaches the Jordan Valley. The fences on either side, separating it from the lands of the Palestinian villages in the area, make it an exemplary apartheid road - for Jews only. And you can fly along at 140 kilometers per hour, from one Jewish settlement to the next.  
The settlements are identified by signs along the road but cannot be seen from it. They are hidden behind hills. Only the fenced roads leading to them from the main road are visible, and they do not slow you down. After less than half an hour you turn north and within 10 minutes you're in the center of Nablus, just 45 minutes from central Tel Aviv.  
And the army checkpoints? On weekdays no one goes in or out of the encircled city, but on weekends the noose is slackened a bit and there is only one roadblock worthy of the name at the entrance to Nablus, and even that is informal: At the same spot where until a few months ago the intimidating Hawara checkpoint, an armed bunker, had blocked the entrance to the city, permitting passage on foot only, on the weekends now there are only two nervous soldiers, unaided even by barbed wire or road spikes. They signal the cars to stop. A short argument, a bit of flattery, fawning and some joking, and they give in and let us through.  
At the end of the day, the final, impassable barrier that prevents Israelis from going to Nablus is psychological. It is reflected in a new sign, as tall as a two-story building, painted bright red with huge letters that warn: "Area A ahead, Entrance to Israelis prohibited, your lives are in danger: You have been warned! Entrance by Israelis into territories of the Palestinian Authority constitutes a criminal offense." Threat and intimidation are the most effective separation walls.  
At the Zafer al-Masri Cultural Center, nothing was perceptibly life-threatening. Mostly there was swelling excitement in anticipation of the concert, part of the Arab music festival that began on Friday and will continue throughout the month in West Bank towns, sponsored and produced by the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music.  
In this encircled city, the most isolated of Palestinian towns, there are very few performances, plays or concerts, and every such event is exciting - especially when it involves a great international name: instrumentalist-composer Simon Shaheen, with an expanded ensemble of 12 musicians playing classical Arab instruments (including oud; qanoun; nai, Arab  flute; and traditional percussion instruments); Western instruments (violins, cello, double bass and flute); as well as two singers, one woman and one man.  
The program for the concert was taken entirely from Egyptian movies of the 1930s and '40s in which Farid al-Atrash, Umm Kulthum and Asmahan sang songs written by the greatest Arab composers of the early 20th century, among them Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Riyad al-Sunbati.  
Their music is performed today, and treated by the audience like Western classical music: As complex, high-art music, meant only to be listened to. The audience involvement is greater than with a Brahms or Beethoven symphony, but there is no clapping along as with music that has a dance beat. Its secrets are revealed only through focused listening; they lie in the melodic relationships rather than in harmonies, as in Western music, but are equally rich. And like classical Western music this music too is an endangered species, with fewer and fewer listeners and students throughout the Arab world, eroded by pop. It too is based on a nonrenewing canon of "great composers" and "masterpieces" that is fading with time.  
The audience that filled the Al-Masri Auditorium was elegant and festive. In a city where the average monthly wage is about NIS 1,000, only those in the upper middle class could afford the NIS 20 ticket price. There were children and teenagers, too, which worried the organizers at first but they settled down to listen as soon as the first notes were played. The friendly charm of Shaheen, who smiled and addressed them directly, asking if they enjoyed themselves.  
From the Galilee to Nablus 
Shaheen was born in 1955 in the Western Galilee village of Tarshiha, and embarked on his musical path early: He began playing oud at the age of five under the tutelage of his father, Hikmat Shaheen, a performer and teacher and a key figure in the world of Israeli-Arab music from the mid-20th century.  
In 1978 Simon Shaheen earned a bachelor's degree studies at Jerusalem's Academy of Music. He studied Western music, like all the students, and the violin. In 1979 he moved to New York, where he studied performance at the Manhattan School of Music and completed studies in music education at Columbia University. He devotes a considerable part of his time to teaching, including giving master classes, some of them at leading American universities.  
Shaheen's multicultural studies are reflected in his musical world; alongside classical Arabic music he performs and composes East-West fusion. In this area he is best known for his 2001 album, "Blue Flame," which mixes jazz and rock with classical and Latin music and was nominated for 11 Grammy Awards. The members of his ensemble, Qantara, which performed on the album, have varied musical backgrounds. Shaheen performs with Qantara at fixtures that include the Newport and Montreal jazz festivals.  
Shaheen remained in New York, where he composes music for films, founded an annual Arab music festival and established an ensemble for classical Arabic music, The Near Eastern Music Ensemble. He has won many awards, including the National Heritage Award, presented to him at the White House in 1994.  
It was only natural, then, that for Saturday's concert he invited a singer with a similar sensibility. Dalal Abu Amna, 26, began singing as a child. Like Shaheen she focused on in classical Arab music while developing a multicultural and "postmodern Arab" style, as she puts it, avoiding Arab pop. She is also studying for her master's degree in brain research at the Haifa Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, and intends to combine being a scientist and performer.  
And thus, in a city with no open movie theater (one is in ruins, the other is closed), there was music from films, reminding older audience members of forgotten pleasures and giving the children - some of them undoubtedly for the first time - an opportunity to hear live music, to see a double bass and a flute being played onstage and to meet an respected international musician like Shaheen, who has opened a Palestinian cultural window to the world.  
The concert ended at 9 P.M. The audience was invited to a reception afterward, with refreshments - bottled water and a slice of knafeh, a sweet concoction of shredded phyllo dough, goat cheese and sugar syrup, the pride of Nablus - served on plastic plates. We get into the car and immediately pass a new pair of tired soldiers, who barely take an interest in our identity. By 10:30 we are back in the middle of Tel Aviv, after a swift, difficult-to-digest segue between two planets.

<title>Anti-Israel poster causes uproar on Canadian campuses </title>
<date>Sun Mar 01 01:13:18 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Hundreds of protesters demonstrated on Thursday at two Canadian universities that recently banned a poster advertising "Israeli Apartheid Week," a series of anti-Israel events due to begin today in over 25 cities and campuses worldwide, including Johannesburg, New York, Caracas, London and Copenhagen.  
About 300 student protesters at Carleton University and Ottawa University accused the two institutions of stifling free speech ahead of the annual event, which began in 2005 in Toronto.  
The banned poster depicts a gunship labeled "Israel" firing a missile at a boy wearing a kaffiyeh and holding a teddy bear. The poster has aroused controversy in Canadian and international press and on campuses, where supporters of Israel said it portrays Israelis as child-killers - an old anti-Semitic theme.  
Tensions have been reported at the University of Toronto, York University and McMaster University, which all permitted displaying the poster.  
In explaining the ban, officials at Carleton and Ottawa universities cited their human rights code, saying the material did not fit that framework. Pro-Palestinian and human rights activists say this does not constitute sufficient grounds. "The link between anti-Semitism and being against Israeli government policies is ludicrous," said Jessica Carpinone, of Students Against Israeli Apartheid, adding that the group includes Jewish students.  
Canadian Jewish organizations warn that the anti-Israeli protests could lead to violence against Jews, adding that levels of on-campus anti-Semitism have increased.

<title>Arab families scuffle with rightist lawmakers during East Jerusalem tour </title>
<date>Mon Aug 10 01:35:02 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Scuffles broke out yesterday between two rightist Knesset members and Palestinian residents of the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah.  
At one point, stones were thrown at MKs Yaakov Katz and Uri Ariel, both from the National Union party, as they toured the contested neighborhood. In addition, the MKs' bodyguards traded blows with protesters.  
"You learned the apartheid laws from South Africa," a member of the Gawi family yelled at the visiting MKs. "East Jerusalem will be free, this is our land. We didn't expel you, why are you expelling us?"  
The Gawis are one of two Palestinian families who were evicted from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah last week, after a court ruled that they had violated the terms of their rental contracts.  
Katz replied that "this whole area belonged to Jews 70 or 80 years ago, and we are returning to it."  
When asked if the same principle would apply to Arab families who fled or were driven from homes in Israel during the 1948 War of Independence, Katz replied: "Any Arab can come forward and make a claim to a house that he thinks belongs to him and his family inside the State of Israel. The claim will be handled by the courts."  
Aryeh King, the right-wing activist who escorted the MKs through the neighborhood, pointed out several houses that had been acquired by the Nahalat Shimon organization or for which documentation existed showing that they belonged to Jews. King vowed that within the next year, the number of Jewish families in the area would increase from 28 to 40.  
Tonight, left-wing activists from Israel and abroad plan to demonstrate in the neighborhood to show solidarity with the evicted families.

<title>Barak to Haaretz: Netanyahu's government will surprise people yet  </title>
<date>Wed Jun 10 01:56:14 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
What is nice about the community centers funded by the National Lottery (Mifal Hapayis) is that they all look the same. The same ugly potted plants in the lobby, the same colorful tiles in the men's bathrooms. 

There are those who are willing to swear that the same is true of speeches by Israeli politicians, except that instead of potted plants and tiles, there are other staples: a little peace, an open hand extended to our neighbors, an existential threat or two. A bit of nuclear weaponry, a bit of demography.  
This particular community center is located in Ramat Gan's Ohel Shem school, and the daily political speech was delivered by Defense Minister Ehud Barak. It is not even a speech - Barak defined it as a "cautious conversation between two speeches." The two speeches are of course U.S. President Barack Obama's Cairo address and the one Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will deliver on Sunday.  
Barak spoke Tuesday night to the Council for Peace and Security, in an auditorium full of veterans of the Israel Defense Forces, the Shin Bet security service and the Mossad - or as one journalist described it, "generations of defense officials. These people led us from disaster to disaster."  
Barak told the audience what he certainly managed to tell Netanyahu: It would be a mistake for Israel to be the one preventing Obama from trying to bring a peace agreement to the Middle East. Whether Netanyahu listened to him and was convinced, we will know only on Sunday.  
Barak spoke of the need for a real solution. If we do not accept the two-state solution, he said, we will find ourselves with an apartheid policy or a state in which we are the minority. But he immediately added that for years, we have tried to reach just such an agreement, but always failed because of the other side.  
The deal that must be signed is a final-status agreement, he said, the kind that cannot be reopened again in the future. But he immediately added that with our neighbors, nothing is truly final, and change could come suddenly and swiftly, through the ballot or the bullet.  
The speech was erudite and precise. The text was pragmatic. But the subtext was depressing: We cannot survive without a treaty, but we have no one to sign one with. We must try, but just between the two of us, it won't work. The word "opportunity" was mentioned repeatedly, but every time, it was accompanied by a sigh. Pessimism is part and parcel of being a rightist leader, but to be a pessimistic leftist leader is unpleasant.  
After the speech, I was given a few minutes to conduct a brief interview with the defense minister. I met him in the school's music room. Barak was unhappy that there were only two chairs in the room. Twice he asked for more chairs be brought in, so that more people could be seated. But there were no chairs available, so the others remained standing.  
I tried to tell Barak that I used to go to this school. But he was busy examining the piano in the corner of the room and paid no attention to my anecdote. The interview began.  
Do you know what Netanyahu is going to say on Sunday?  
"I don't know. I have guesses, but nothing more. The prime minister's discussions are real discussions. This government will surprise people yet."  
Is he pushing for a two-state solution?  
"Today's entire argument over two states for two peoples began during the election campaign. Kadima demanded that Likud say this, but Likud didn't want to, and I think it was blown out of proportion. The minute a government commits itself to its predecessors' agreements - and those include the road map, and the road map talks about two states - what else can it do? And it's not a bad thing that that's included.  
"The road map should be changed now that Hamas is in power. But its foundation [the two-state solution] remains. So I think part of the reluctance to say this is not a matter of principle. Our nation lives in the State of Israel. Where does the other people live? In a cage? A jail? A swimming pool? I don't think there's a real disagreement here."  
So the problem is only the argument with Kadima?  
"Look, Kadima's real place, and I regret saying this ... [is that] decisions are made without them. Therefore, I think Kadima should reconsider whether it was a mistake to stay out [of the coalition]."  
You know there is a never-ending debate over the question of whether Netanyahu has really changed. What is your opinion?  
Barak gave vent to a morose sigh, like those he attached in his speech to the word "opportunity," and then continued with a warm smile, almost heartwarming.  
"Tell me," he said, "have you changed?"  
I left the Ohel Shem school. Twenty-four years ago, when I played ball here, Ehud Barak galloped through Lebanon as the deputy commander of the eastern corps. Since then, he has withdrawn from Lebanon, seen Hezbollah sitting on the border fence and seen us attacking Lebanon once again.  
A few days ago, he saw the moderate left win the Lebanese elections and Obama congratulate them warmly. With a little luck, this same left will win in Iran, too. And only here will a right-wing extremist government remain in power, since in addition to making correct decisions, it also makes sure not to look like a sucker compared to Tzipi Livni.  
And Barak is nothing less than this government's defense minister. So it is no wonder that every time after he says the word "opportunity," he utters a small sigh.

<title>Bringing Baroque to Bethlehem </title>
<date>Mon Dec 21 01:53:21 IST 2009</date>
<content>
It has been nine years since British conductor Tim Brown led a traditional orchestra, with modern instruments, in a performance of a Baroque work. This week and next (at the Tel Aviv Museum, Friday through Sunday; and at venues in Haifa, Jerusalem and Carmiel, Monday through Wednesday) he'll rise to the challenge again, when the Jerusalem Camerata Orchestra performs Bach's "Christmas Oratorio."  
Before their first rehearsal Brown admits that he had serious doubts. "Modern instruments don't weave naturally into the sound of Baroque music," he says. "The contemporary trumpets are too loud, it's hard to play this music on today's French horns. And the traditional instrumentalists on the strings - they have been trained since early childhood to play with vibrato, which blurs the unique outline for every voice in polyphonic music and damages its texture. How could my chorus - the Choir of Clare College, Cambridge - integrate into that sort of orchestra? I was very worried. But after the first rehearsal I realized I had been given a wonderful orchestra and there weren't going to be problems. It's astonishing how an orchestra like this [exists] here."  
With such praise from an international conductor who specializes in the performance of Baroque music on authentic instruments and reproductions of period instruments, the Camerata can and should pat itself on the back. "The musicians in this orchestra play lightly, precisely and with style, without vibrato. The work I had planned to invest in just practicing playing Baroque with them has already been done," Brown says in amazement. "And the fact that they aren't burnt out, and they are eager to perform - for someone who comes from England that's a pleasant surprise."  
Timothy Brown, 63, began his musical path as a choirboy in the Westminster Abbey School - the Gothic cathedral adjacent to the Houses of Parliament in London, where coronations of British monarchs have been held for a thousand years now and where people like Isaac Newton, George Frideric Handel and Charles Darwin are buried.  
"During my lifetime, I have been witness to the development of the early music movement and the playing of authentic instruments," he says. "As a boy, I remember how Otto Klemperer conducted the St. Matthew Passion - slowly and heavily, with great dignity and a huge sound, as though it were a Bruckner symphony. This was beautiful but counter to the way the music was performed in its time and to its character. In 1957, I remember the first time a harpsichord was brought into a performance of a work by Bach. The revolution took place before my eyes. This was a voyage to the discovery of a new music and a new attitude towards it."  
Painting with sound 
Of the "Christmas Oratorio," a cantata cycle Bach composed in Leipzig for each day of the holiday, Brown describes it as a piece of theatrical music. "There are pictures in it that Bach paints with sound, and performed correctly it's possible to present that airy and light simplicity and eliminate the grandiose image it had been accorded. For example in the passage 'Let us go to Bethlehem,'" he continues, "there are a number of voices separated from the choir as though the people are chattering and egging one another on - but at the same time the flute and violins are playing a single melodic line, as though two angels were hovering above the chatter. This is very picturesque."  
His choir's journey to Bethlehem this week, however, has painful aspects to it as well. "Three years ago," says Brown, "I participated in the midnight Mass on Christmas at St. George's Church in Bethlehem and I offered to come and do that this year too, with my choir. Clare College is primarily a church choir and the concerts are the icing on the pie. We sing three times a week at church services. At St. George's they were very happy and all of us were excited, until we encountered the boycott."  
Three years ago, Brown performed in the territories with the Choir of London, an ensemble which worked then in both the territories and Israel. However the choir later joined the cultural boycott declared by many Palestinian organizations against Israel. Members of the Choir of London sent Brown a letter signed by 200 people demanding he cancel his performances in Israel.  
"We discussed this at the college and since there is no international boycott of Israel we agreed unanimously not to boycott and [that we would] sing in Israel just as we had committed ourselves. Three weeks ago a letter came from the Palestinian Authority informing us that if we come to sing on Christmas, our entry into the city will be blocked. Thus the concert was canceled."  
Tim Brown has a great deal of sympathy for both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "And in any case, as a musician I can't judge," he says. "I don't think the Israeli government is more criminal than the English government, for example. What we did in Iraq was shocking, simply a disgrace, ad we have also ignored what is happening in Zimbabwe. Why focus in particular on Israel?"  
"And in the meantime, people are living their lives," Brown continues. "It was important to me that my students go through the roadblocks in the West Bank and come up against the separation wall and become aware of the Palestinians' difficulties - and sing with them. And it was also important to me that they meet the Russian immigrants of the Camerata Orchestra, some of whom may have immigrated to Israel because they had no alternative. The encounter with forms of displacement and immigration, with the tragic side of the world, is important - and altogether I believe in connection between people, not boycott. I believe in music's ability to make the world more beautiful, and that with its help we can love one another. This is what makes people human. And if we were to have boycotted - would anything have changed? Would the walls really have tumbled down?"  
No chance for a love affair 
Prof. Gabi Baramki, the president of the Palestinian Council for Justice and Peace, former acting president of Birzeit University and a steering committee member of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI), spoke with Haaretz about the Choir of Clare College's upcoming appearances in Israel.  
"Communication is important," Baramki says, in explaining why he is not welcoming the choir, "but it can turn into a form of complicity in violations of human rights, if not based on the principle of opposing injustice and advocating equal human rights for all. Performing in Israel, despite its fresh war crimes in Gaza, its ongoing occupation and colonization of Palestinian and Arab land, and its system of racial discriminations against its 'non-Jewish' citizens, in fact contributes to whitewashing Israel's grave violations of international law, particularly in light of the Goldstone report."  
"Mr. Brown's attempt to distinguish between Israeli civil society and government is ill conceived," he continues. "Israeli civil society is, with few exceptions, deeply implicated in Israel's system of oppression against the Palestinian people - since it has largely supported all aspects of occupation, including the slow ethnic cleansing we suffer."  
Why not let the choir members experience the situation on the ground - on both sides?  
Baramki: "There is a difference between the choir coming on a fact-finding mission to experience both sides, and coming basically to Israel to give a series of concerts and then on the side giving a concert to the hapless 'natives.' There was no objection to the members of the choir coming as individuals and participating in the Bethlehem mass within the congregation, not as a performing group."  
Why not let music do what it can: bridge, unite, bring love?  
"We have a situation of occupier and occupied, oppressor and oppressed. Both sides are not equal. It is not a matter of misunderstanding that music needs to clarify and bridge. When we have two equal parties, then this bridge can work. As long as you have an apartheid system, and denial of Palestinian basic rights including the right of return of the refugees, this 'love affair' has no chance to even start."  
Why single out Israel while Britain itself commits terrible deeds throughout the world?  
"It is Israel that is occupying Palestinian land and denying our rights, not Britain," says Baramki. "Yes, the United Kingdom has a lot to account for - we support condemnation of its terrible deeds and action to alleviate the suffering - but it needs the people concerned directly to start first. We have started: This is a specific case where the oppressed are calling for support through boycott - a minimal, non-violent form of resistance. And the Western establishment is singling out Israel indeed: it gives it red-carpet treatment and endless support."  
"Our boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) campaign," Baramki explains, "is primarily focused on ending Israel's impunity and holding it to account before international law; to draw the attention of the world to the grave injustice being committed against the Palestinians, to bring pressure on Israel to make it abide by international law and act according to the resolutions of the United Nations. We are deeply inspired by the South African anti-apartheid struggle, despite the obvious differences." (Noam Ben-Zeev)

<title>Carter: Fighting in Gaza could renew peace talks</title>
<date>Fri Jan 09 03:42:02 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Former President Jimmy Carter said Thursday that Israel's assault on Gaza has been destructive and disproportionate to rocket attacks on Israel but could result in new efforts for a long-term Middle East peace plan.
Carter, in a telephone interview with The Associated Press, said although animosity toward Israel in the Arab world has probably increased dramatically, there may be renewed interest among European leaders in trying to find a lasting resolution.

The former president, who brokered peace between Israel and Egypt 30 years ago, also expressed hope the incoming Obama administration would take a more active role in negotiations. Carter said he discussed the Middle East with President-elect Barack Obama in a meeting this week, but he would not disclose what Obama said.
Publicly, Obama has deferred to President George W. Bush on the Gaza conflict, insisting there can only be one administration at a time. The Bush administration has blamed Hamas for the conflict, citing the continued rocket attacks and smuggling of arms.
Carter, speaking from his hometown of Plains, said the rockets and arms smuggling must be stopped, but the Israelis have destroyed a thousand other sites in addition to tunnels used for smuggling under the Egyptian border.
Almost 750 Palestinians and 12 Israelis, including nine soldiers, have died since Israel's assault began Dec. 27.
"Whether that's an appropriate response, I'll let you make the judgment on that. I don't think it is," said Carter, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.
He said he was hopeful Egypt and France can broker a cease-fire, and that diplomats can resume efforts for a long-term peace plan with a two-state solution.
Later Thursday, Arab and Western leaders drafted a cease-fire resolution that would allow for opening of border crossings to Gaza and called for the UN Security Council to vote on it. Although Israel and Gaza were not parties to the agreement, it was supported by the United States, Israel's closest ally, and Arab nations which have close ties to Hamas.
In talks with Hamas leaders last spring, Carter helped engineer a six-month cease-fire that began June 19. It dramatically reduced the number of Hamas rockets, and Israel allowed resumed shipments of food, fuel and other supplies to ease the plight of the 1.5 million people in Gaza.
The rocket attacks resumed last month.
Carter, whose latest book We Can Have Peace in the Holy Land will be released Jan. 20, will travel to China on Saturday for the 30th anniversary of the U.S. resuming relations with Beijing. He was in Lebanon and Syria last month but has no immediate plans to return to the Middle East.
Carter's last book on the region, Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, drew criticism two years ago from some Jewish groups in the U.S. because of comparisons to Israeli treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza to racial oppression in 20th century South Africa.

<title>Carter: Israel won't need to give up Gush Etzion settlements</title>
<date>Sun Jun 14 17:12:56 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter said on Sunday following a meeting with settler leaders that he did not believe Israel would withdraw from the Gush Etzion settlement bloc.
Carter said that as the West Bank bloc is situated beside the borders set following the 1967 Six-Day War, he imagines it will stay under Israeli control forever.
"This particular settlement is not one that I envision ever being abandoned, or changed over into a Palestinian territory," Carter said. "This is part of the close settlements to the 1967 line that I think will be here forever."
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under pressure from U.S. President Barack Obama to halt settlement construction throughout the West Bank, but has so far refused to do so.
Carter told Haaretz in an exclusive interview on Saturday that Obama would not change his position on the two-state solution and Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Carter added that Israel and the United States are on a collision course if Israel refuses to comply on these two issues.

The former U.S. president, an outspoken critic on Israel's policy regarding Palestinians, said on Sunday that his visit to the settlements has given him a fresh perspective on the issue.
During his visit, Carter reiterated that he remains committed to Israel, adding that enabling the state to exist in peace and security has been the most important project he has taken on in the last 30 years. 
Nevertheless, Carter said, Israel's neighboring countries also deserve peace and security, and should be guaranteed that right as well.
Gush Etzion council leader Shaul Goldstein, who hosted Carter at his home, called the visit significant and said he believed it indeed contributed to a change in the former president's views. 
Carter embarked on the visit to Gush Etzion on Sunday in what he described as a chance to listen and make his views known. There he met with Goldstein and others at the Neve Daniel settlement, south of Jerusalem. 
The former president said he was there to "listen to the settlers," and that he "hoped to make sure they understand my own attitude toward Israel and the Jewish population in the world and toward the Jewish settlers."
Later, Carter sat in Goldstein's living room, positioned under five books of the Hebrew Bible on a bookshelf.
"This is our homeland, but we recognize there are other people living next to us," Goldstein told him, referring to the Palestinians, who view the West Bank as part of a future state.
Israeli settlement in the West Bank is a key point of dispute between Israel and the Palestinians. Much of the international community views settlements as an obstacle to a peace deal and has called for a total freeze to construction there.
Many Israelis view the West Bank as the biblical heartland of the Jewish people and say Israel should not cede it. 
Carter, 85, brokered the historic peace deal between Israel and Egypt in 1979. In a controversial 2007 book, 'Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid', Carter argued that Israel has to choose between ceding the West Bank to the Palestinians in a peace deal or maintaining a system of ethnic inequality similar to that of the apartheid regime in South Africa.
Views like that have made Carter unpopular among settlers and their supporters. A group of local settlers circulated an open letter titled, "Jimmy Carter go home," saying the former president was an "anti-Semite and not welcome here."
"Mr. Carter is an advocate for those seeking to destroy Israel, and the fact that he contributes to that agenda under the guise of a man of good will seeking peace only makes him more dangerous and his efforts more dishonest," the letter said.

<title>'Clown costumes encapsulated absurdity of Durban II' </title>
<date>Fri May 01 01:24:09 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
They say they weren't involved in disrupting the peace at Durban II, but the two coaches of the Geneva response team for the student organization StandWithUs don't sound too upset in describing pro-Israel heckling at the event.  
The founder of the Israel advocacy student group, Roz Rothstein from Los Angeles, even brought back a small but relevant memento from the Swiss city: a red clown nose.  
The nose, she says, has come to signify resistance to the highly controversial UN meeting on human rights, which ended in Geneva last week with organizers singling Israel out as a racist state.  
Sitting at a Jerusalem cafe, Rothstein explains that the nose rose to fame after three French Jewish students, dressed as clowns, heckled Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad when he spoke at the event.  
The clown image caught on because it illustrated the "absurdity" of having human-rights violators such as Libya, Cuba and Iran heading a human-rights event, says Rothstein. "The Jewish protests at Durban II showed we won't remain silent and signified the attitude of 'never again,'" she says.  
StandWithUs, which trains students from campuses around the world in Israel advocacy, sent 15 delegates to the conference. A total of 150 Jewish student onlookers attended.  
Those students had prepared for months to launch a vocal, even vociferous, PR onslaught to delegitimize the event. They feared the meeting would be a repeat of the original 2001 Durban conference, which Arab states and pro-Palestinian groups hijacked to call Israel an apartheid state.  
Unlike the 2001 event, the response to the Geneva follow-up was a well-orchestrated affair. In preparing for the Durban II conference, StandWithUs focused on peoples whose human rights grievances were being "sidelined" because of "the Israel obsession," as Rothstein puts it.  
Michael Dickson, the U.K.-born director of StandWithUs' Israel office, said the organization focused on the plight of people from Darfur, where Sudan is accused of perpetrating genocide.  
This was the reason, he said, for the slogan they used at the event, "The UN remains silent." Rothstein, 58, brought a bag full of posters bearing the slogan to Geneva.  
Some protesters courted news agencies' cameras by duct-taping their mouths while holding the posters. And to counter the apartheid analogy in the media, Dickson and Rothstein relied on people like Lior Meir from Hebrew University, who grew up in apartheid South Africa before moving to Israel.  
One of the group's biggest moments of victory at Durban was when most European delegates walked out on Ahmadinejad's tirade against Israel.  
Rothstein - who cheered on the abandoning delegates - thinks that by attending and then leaving, Europe sent out a stronger message against the conference than it would have by boycotting the meeting in the first place. "It shows a degree of open-mindedness, while at the same time drawing a distinct line in the sand," she says.  
While in Geneva, StandWithUs delegates from Israel, Italy, Finland, Luxembourg and Norway prepared a scathing, English-language protest letter for MK Jamal Zahalka of the Balad party, the "National Democratic Alliance," who participated in anti-Israel protests at Durban II.  
The group protested what they called Zahalka's "use of democratic institutions to undermine the very democracy which he is supposed to represent," and circulated the letter to supporters around the world via social networks.  
MK Zahalka could not be reached for comment.

<title>Durban 2 draft: Israel's Palestinian policy is crime against humanity</title>
<date>Mon Mar 02 19:12:42 IST 2009</date>
<content>
A draft of the closing statement prepared for the upcoming United Nations-sponsored conference against racism, dubbed Durban 2, states that Israel's policy in the Palestinian territories constitutes a "violation of international human rights, a crime against humanity and a contemporary form of apartheid." 
The conference, to be held in Geneva next month, is a follow-up to the contentious 2001 conference in the South African city of Durban which was dominated by clashes over the Middle East and the legacy of slavery. The U.S. and Israel walked out midway through that eight-day meeting over a draft resolution that singled out Israel for criticism and likened Zionism - the movement to establish and maintain a Jewish state - to racism. 
Israel, Canada and the U.S. have already announced that they will boycott the upcoming summit.
The draft statement, obtained by Haaretz, goes on to say that Israel's policy poses "a serious threat to international peace and security and violates the basic principles of international human rights law." 
In the draft, the organizers of the UN summit express "deep concern" over Israel's practices of "racial discrimination against the Palestinian people as well as Syrian nationals of the occupied Syrian Golan and other inhabitants of the Arab occupied territories."
The draft accuses Israel of implementing collective punishment against the Palestinian people, as well as "torture, economic blockade, severe restriction of movement and arbitrary closure of their territories." 
Furthermore, Israel is charged with perpetrating "a foreign occupation founded on settlements, laws based on racial discrimination with the aim of continuing domination of the occupied territories," and is termed a "threat to international peace and security." 
Finally, the draft calls on the international community to protect the Palestinian people against Israel's "racist" policies.

<title>Durban II / Israel's boycott gives its critics the upper hand</title>
<date>Mon Apr 20 11:02:55 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Click here for more about the Durban II conference
To mark the Durban II conference, Haaretz.com asked two of its editors to contribute an opinion piece. The other piece, by Benjamin Hartman, can be found here
Last week, the Syrian ambassador to the United States appeared on Fareed Zakaria's "GPS" show on CNN for an interview as part of a segment entitled "Syria Speaks Out." 
To get things started, Zakaria asked his guest for his take on the election of Barack Obama and how it resonated in his country. A fair, nice, light issue to kick things off before delving into the meatier topics.
Predictably, the ambassador, Imad Moustapha, spoke of the "powerful message" and the "symbolism" in Obama's victory, how America has redeemed itself after eight years of George Bush, how he was encouraged by the conciliatory overtones of the new administration and the turning of a new page with the Islamic world and blah, blah, blah.
Then, something appeared that gave me pause. As the ambassador was speaking, the network flashed a caveat at the very bottom of the screen that was all too telling: "Israeli Ambassador was not available to appear on GPS today." 
His absence left the playing field wide open for Moustapha to tear into Israel for its "atrocities" in Gaza and the West Bank while denouncing the "omnipotent power of the pro-Israel interest groups in Washington." Like a sniper picking off his prey as if it were target practice, Moustapha's broadside went unanswered.
Of course, there are plenty of mitigating circumstances that could account for Israel's latest bit of public relations negligence. True, it was during the Passover holiday period. And yes, this came in the midst of a transition to a new government, so perhaps the ambassador or anyone on his staff were either unable or unwilling to speak on behalf of a regime that did not sanction their posting in the first place. 
Still, neglecting to send a spokesperson to present Israel's position speaks volumes about the importance which this country places in public relations. For years now, Israel's diplomatic corps has been hopelessly outmaneuvered by their Arab opponents. Now it is repeating the same mistake in Geneva, the site of the UN's "Durban II" anti-racism conference.
Whether GPS or Geneva, the needle on Israel's compass seems eternally stuck on the wrong direction. Instead of showing courage and a determination not to allow one voice to drown out the proceedings in Geneva, Israel recoiled, as if it had no worthy response to the venom of the see-no-Palestinian-evil, hear-no-Palestinian-evil crowd. 
Israel is an economic and military power, with an air force that is second to none, a prolific high-tech industry, bustling night-life, world class academics, and a Middle Eastern joie de vivre that transmits a pulsating energy unequalled in the European and American societies that so many in Israel try their darndest to emulate. 
With all these qualities to flaunt, with so much that our robust society can offer the rest of the world, it is mystifying that our government is so frightened of a few shrill lemmings who seek to hijack the agenda of an anti-racism conference. 
In a country that takes pride in relying on its shrewdness and creativity to overcome the most difficult of odds, it boggles the mind as to why we choose to play hapless victim whenever a diminutive bigot - who does not even have final say-so on matters in his country, despite his job title - opens his mouth. Or meets the president of Switzerland. (Think fast: you have five seconds to name the Swiss president) 
Durban II could very well descend into an anti-Israel hate fest. The images of bloodied Palestinian children in Gaza will likely be a fixture in demonstrations by those who "champion the Palestinian cause." Yet, the torch-and-pitchfork mob should not be our target audience. Their minds are made up, and we will simply have to agree to disagree. 
Israel's focus should be on the massive bloc of undecided and uninitiated, those who have yet to be introduced to the catchwords that dominate our lexicons - "occupation", "terrorism", "apartheid", "settlements", "deterrence" - those who will soon have the right to vote in elections for European parliaments and American state assemblies, those who for the first time will open up a newspaper and read the letters to the editor, or click into a blog.
These are the voices that will ultimately determine the texture of Israel's relations with the rest of the world. These are the footsoldiers who comprise the ranks of the "silent majority," people who have yet to be given a reason to take the streets and don a keffiyeh while waving placards that blare "ZIONISM = RACISM." 
And how does our Foreign Ministry plan on reaching the hearts and minds of these folks? Simple. Don't show up. Let the yahoos have the stage all to themselves. We'll just cozy up in our psychological bunker, because, hey, righteous indignation has always been our path of least resistance.
And when we are called upon to explain our actions, we can just whipsaw them with our standard rejoinders - "We suffered through the Holocaust" and "If you criticize Israel, you're anti-Semitic." Hasbara 101. 
Israel ought to send a delegation to Geneva not to dignify the smears, but to introduce the hidden dimensions of our vast (and flawed) society. If a European who has never taken an active interest in the Middle East comes away from Geneva with a negative view of our "racist" and "apartheid" country, how can we blame that person if we had preemptively surrendered the platform to the loudmouths? 
Instead, we ought to tell that person, "Yes, we have an outstanding disagreement with the Palestinians, and the reasons for this are complex and varied, but did you know that Palestinians are permitted to petition the Supreme Court against the government's actions in the territories? And that the same Court has often struck down Israeli decisions to the humanitarian benefit of injured Palestinians?" 
All of sudden, the entire complexion of the argument changes, and the topic shifts from "apartheid" and "occupation" to the Supreme Court and the Israeli legal system, which is considered one of the most advanced and sophisticated in the Western world. There, a whole new world can be opened up in just two sentences. As simple as it is effective. And all that can be done without shouting, or screaming. 
If this country had approached public relations with the ferocity in which it bulldozes Palestinian homes to the ground; if our diplomats could reframe their arguments with the precision that our air force drones home in on "ticking bombs," perhaps we would not be in this mess. Durban II would be a walk in the park, and Ahmadinejad would be cut down to his natural size, that of nothing more than an irritant.

<title>Education Minister slams Israeli lecturer's 'apartheid' op-ed</title>
<date>Sun Aug 23 18:14:26 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Education Minister Gideon Sa'ar on Sunday denounced an Israeli academic who published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times in which he called for an boycott of Israel for being an "apartheid" state
Sa'ar deemed the article by Dr. Neve Gordon, a political science lecturer from Ben-Gurion University, is "repugnant and deplorable."
Veteran left-wing activist Gordon wrote in the op-ed published on Friday that Israel today could most accurately be described as an "apartheid state."
"3.5 million Palestinians and almost half a million Jews live in the areas Israel occupied in 1967," Gordon wrote, "and yet while these two groups live in the same area, they are subjected to totally different legal systems. The Palestinians are stateless and lack many of the most basic human rights. By sharp contrast, all Jews - whether they live in the occupied territories or in Israel - are citizens of the state of Israel." 
"It is indeed not a simple matter for me as an Israeli citizen to call to suspend cooperation with Israel," he further wrote.  "The words and condemnations from the Obama administration and the European Union have yielded no results, not even a settlement freeze, let alone a decision to withdraw from the occupied territories." 
Gordon came to the public spotlight in 2002, during Israel's assault on the Palestinian Authority, as one of the Israelis who stayed with Yasser Arafat in his compound. In 2003, he was a vocal critic of Paratroopers Brigadier Col. Aviv Kochavi. 
Israel's Consul-General in Los Angeles, Yaakov Dayan sent a letter of response to the president of Ben-Gurion University, Prof. Rivka Carmi, in which he said the statements made by Gordon could be potentially damaging to the university. 
"Since the article was published, I've been contacted by people who care for Israel; some of them are benefactors of Ben-Gurion University," Dayan wrote.  "They were unanimous in threatening to withhold their donations to your institution. My attempt to explain that one bad apple would affect hundreds of researchers turned out to be futile."
"I believe that the definitive answer to anti-Zionist lecturers like Gordon is to set up a center for Zionist studies, which unfortunately does not exist in Israeli academia," he continued. "This center would help dispel the lies disseminated by Gordon in the name of your university."
The Ben-Gurion University management in turn denounced Gordon's views. 
"We are appalled by Dr. Neve Gordon's irresponsible remarks, that morally deserve to be completely and utterly condemned," Prof. Carmi said. "We disapprove of Gordon's disastrous views and reject his cynical exploitation of the freedom of speech in Israel and the university."
"This vile and audacious criticism of the state of Israel damages the excellent academic work being done in Israel and its universities," she also said. "Academics with such feelings about their country are welcome to look for another home, whether personal or professional."

<title>European states consider boycotting Durban 2 summit </title>
<date>Sat Feb 28 20:55:36 IST 2009</date>
<content>
European Union member states may follow in the footsteps of the United States which announced Friday it would not be participating in the Durban anti-racism conference set to take place in April.
While several states mull canceling their participation in the conference, senior UN diplomats say the chances for the entire EU body to boycott the summit are slim. 
The U.S. State Department announced on Friday it would not attend a United Nations conference on racism that critics say will be a forum to criticize Israel, and will no longer participate in planning sessions for it.
The U.S. made the decision after its delegation's attempts to change the content of the summit's draft resolutions failed.
A top Western diplomat stated on Friday that several EU member stated may feel uncomfortable remaining indifferent to the U.S.'s decision. 
Israel and Canada have already announced that they will boycott the upcoming World Conference Against Racism in Geneva from April 20-25.
Sources in the UN indicate that Iran and Syria lead uncompromising negotiations with the U.S. delegation in preparing the drafts for the summit. The U.S. envoy to the UN Susan Rice played an important roll in the discussions that took part in Geneva. 
New York diplomats say Israel was careful not to get actively involved or affect the U.S. stance.    
U.S. to boycott Durban 2 conference on racism
The United States will not attend a United Nations conference on racism that critics say will be a forum to criticize Israel, and will no longer participate in planning sessions for it, the State Department announced on Friday. 
The conference is a follow-up to the contentious 2001 conference in the South African city of Durban which was dominated by clashes over the Middle East and the legacy of slavery. The U.S. and Israel walked out midway through that eight-day meeting over a draft resolution that singled out Israel for criticism and likened Zionism - the movement to establish and maintain a Jewish state - to racism. 
President Barack Obama's administration decided to assess the negotiations before making a decision on U.S. participation. 
The decision to drop U.S. involvement comes one day before U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leaves on her first trip to the Middle East in her new capacity, including stops in Israel. 
A U.S. delegation took part in negotiations this month on summit. Referring to the content of draft resolutions formulated during the preparations, the source said that during negotiations "a bad document became worse," prompting the U.S. to end its affiliation with the conference. 
The U.S. decided the final document that will be produced by the conference is "not salvageable," another official said. 
"The document being negotiated has gone from bad to worse, and the current text of the draft outcome document is not salvageable," State Department spokesperson Robert Wood said. "As a result, the United States will not engage in further negotiations on this text, nor will we participate in a conference based on this text. A conference based on this text would be a missed opportunity to speak clearly about the persistent problem of racism." 
"The United States remains open to a positive result in Geneva based on a document that takes a constructive approach to tackling the challenges of racism and discrimination," Wood said. 
Critics of the April conference, say Arab nations will use it as a forum to bash Israel and charge that the draft document will limit freedom of religion and speech. 
Last week, Haaretz learned that the draft resolutions for the conference branded Israel as an occupying state that carries out racist policies. They refer to "the plight of Palestinian refugees and other inhabitants of the Arab occupied territories," apparently meaning Israel itself. 
The senior UN source told Haaretz that the U.S. ended its contact with the nations that drafted the resolutions, which will be voted on during the summit. The Americans did not want a draft resolution reiterating the decisions of the first Durban summit, held in 2001, to be brought to a vote, the source said. 
They also insisted that no country would be specifically mentioned by name in any resolution and even objected to an initiative by Muslim countries to ratify a law banning criticism of any religion in the media, the source added. 
The 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in Durban was meant to lay down a blueprint for nations to address sensitive issues. 
Israel and the United States walked out in protest over a draft text branding Israel as a racist and apartheid state, language that was later dropped. 
The State Department did say though that the U.S. plans to participate in this month's UN Human Rights Council in an observer status though it expressed its reservations over the body's frequent opprobrium of Israel. 
"Our participation as an observer is a sign of the commitment of the Administration to advancing the cause of human rights in the multilateral arena," the State Department said. "We look forward to the help and cooperation of our friends and allies to ensure the Human Rights Council focuses on the pressing human rights concerns of our time." 
Besides the Durban controvery, supporters of Israel will have their hands full. Pro-Palestinian activists plan on staging "Israel Apartheid Week" beginning Monday in New York. Among the prominent participants is Nir Harel, an Israeli member of Anarchists Against the Wall. Events will include "forums, films, cultural events and street protests."

<title>For Israel, a New Year, and a new left</title>
<date>Mon Sep 07 17:08:56 IDT 2009</date>

_____________________
Outside of outright wartime, seldom have the vital signs of Arab-Israeli diplomacy read more bleak. Israel's ruling coalition hinges on a foreign minister so incendiary that his recent prediction that Mideast peace is at least 16 years distant, is as close to moderation as he has yet managed. The Palestinians are rent, geographically, politically, governmentally and religiously, between the West Bank and Gaza. The Israelis are likewise torn, with a minority clinging to the settlement flag, and the majority having opted for an exhausted resignation.
Washington, meanwhile, has precious little to show for efforts to spur Arab diplomatic openness to Israel in return for self-imposed Israeli curbs on West Bank settlement expansion. 
A decade of diplomatic paralysis and brutal military confrontations, coupled with a parallel degeneration of the structures and ideology of Israel's peace camp, have been accompanied by mounting calls by leftists abroad - and to a lesser degree, by leftists in Israel - to mount anti-Israel boycotts as a desperate resort amid stalled domestic Israeli efforts to combat occupation.
Is a permanently broken peace process, then, a foregone conclusion? 
The fact is, there are signs that the Jewish New Year now dawning could signal the beginning of a new alignment of pro-peace forces, one that could spell fundamental progress toward an eventual two-state solution.
1.A new realism on the Israeli left
For the left in Israel to function as more than an insulated elite of the supremely self-admiring, it must take into account the realities of Israeli society, in particular those strengths which can translate into a consensus for a future peace deal. One of the more striking recent examples, one which prompted surprise and even consternation among many of Avneri's followers, is a response by veteran leftist activist Uri Avneri
While maintaining his strong opposition to occupation, Avneri takes issue with condemnations of Israel as an apartheid state, and with the anti-Israel boycotts as a political weapon.     
2. Mounting restiveness in Labor and Meretz.
Another positive sign is an intensive search for new leadership to replace the bullying and the bipolar politics of Labor leader Ehud Barak, and to transfuse and transform the halting and marginal Meretz. Paradoxically, the dismal showing of the two parties in recent elections is likely to be the most effective leverage for new blood in key positions.
3. J Street and the political realignment of U.S. Jewry
For the first time in decades - in sharp contrast to a reality in which many left-oriented Jewish groups were little more than vestigial burial societies or conduits for Israeli fund-raising - a new coalition of groups which are both explicitly pro-peace and pro-Israel is beginning to coalesce, its current centerpiece the national conference of J Street in Washington DC 
The gathering is being held jointly with an unprecedented number of like-minded groups, including Ameinu, Brit Tzedek V'Shalom, and the Israel Policy Forum.
J Street, which has both aided and ridden the Obama wave, is also taking steps to expand its reach and organizational clout
Significantly, the nascent coalition also coincides with:
4. The graying of the Zionist Right
The settler revolution, and its client movements in world Orthodoxy and Israeli politics, has been falling victim to a loss of vigor at a critical time. The watershed 2005 disengagement from Gaza, which pro-settler forces point to as the best proof of their ideology, nonetheless did tremendous damage to the settlement movement's aura of invincibility. Despite the apparent one-off success of Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu [which, despite its anti-Arab rhetoric, has long flirted with out-of-the-box territorial compromise], pro-Greater Israel factions fared poorly in the 2009, with the Jewish Home winning only three votes, and the National Union only four.  
Hamas' curtailing of rocket attacks  [see 6., below] has, for the present at any rate, robbed the settlers of the most effective of their selling points in  fending off calls for a future withdrawal in the West Bank.
One of the most telling indications of the declining vitality of the right are the shopworn, impotent mantras of the pro-settler right ["Settlements are not an obstacle to peace - there were no settlements before 1967 and there was no peace then, either"; "There is no Palestinian people"; "Jews should be able to settle anywhere in the Land of Israel (though Arabs should not)"].  
This phenomenon is, in turn, a result in no small part of:
5. The new centrism in the Israeli consensus
Polls have shown that, with security guaranteed in a satisfactory manner, a majority of Israelis would accept, and in fact, support, a future two-state solution close to that proposed by the Clinton administration: A withdrawal from most of the West Bank, with exchanges of territory bringing the area of a future Palestine equal to that of the pre-1967 war West Bank and Gaza; a Palestinian capital in part of East Jerusalem; equitable administration of holy shrines; and return of refugees to Palestinian territory, with an Israeli declaration of an element of responsibility for the creation of the refugee problem.   
6. A new realism among Palestinians
As Fatah has assumed greater independence and security responsibilities in the West Bank, with a commensurate resurgence of the economy in cities such as Ramallah and Jenin, it has recently signaled that some of the thorniest Israeli-Palestinian issues, including the right of return, could be worked out in the context of formulas like the Geneva Initiative.
Hamas, meanwhile, is under mounting pressure, with its polling numbers down and its problems of governance on the rise. While enforcing a near-complete and self-imposed ban on Qassam rocket attacks against Israel, with beleaguered Gazans loath to see a repeat of the war barely eight months past.
Hamas has had to contend with pressure from a new source: Islamic fundamentalists who view the Hamas government as selling out.  Last month, Hamas forces attacked a mosque stronghold 
7. The Lieberman window.
Prosecutors have said that an indictment against Lieberman on graft charges is now more a matter of when than if. But the "when" could be of paramount importance. If, as some sources suggest, the charges could be filed in a matter of six months, the result could be a major redraw of the Israeli political map. Lieberman's presence in the cabinet is the main stumbling block to a coalition between Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud and Tzipi Livni's even larger Kadima party, which is on record as pushing for a two-state solution.
Even if some Likud MKs made good on implied threats to bolt the coalition if territorial compromise were on the table, a Likud-Kadima-Labor alliance is Barack Obama's best hope for concrete progress toward an Israeli-Palestinian peace.

<title>Galilee communities: We're not racist, we just don't want Arabs </title>
<date>Fri Jun 05 02:16:19 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Residents of the Misgav bloc of communities in the Galilee consider themselves to be liberal, peace-loving people who support coexistence with their Arab neighbors and even root for Bnei Sakhnin, the soccer club based in a nearby Arab town considered a prominent symbol of that community. Which is why they were shocked this week when proposals raised at local council meetings to accept only applicants who shared their Zionist principles drew negative headlines and criticism for alleged racism.  
"The label upsets me," South Africa-born lawyer Michael Zetler, who founded the Misgav community of Manof in 1980 with other immigrants from what was then an apartheid state, said Thursday. "It hurt me. I am not a racist."  
Although few people will say so, the panic that spurred the submission of the controversial proposals are related to the High Court of Justice's ruling two years ago that upheld the right of Ahmed and Fahina Zubeidat, an Israeli Arab couple, to buy a house in the exclusively Jewish community of Rakefet notwithstanding the local admissions committee's objection.  
Since then, some residents of Jewish communal settlements in the Galilee fear that the region's substantial Arab population might seek to buy property in their communities, where the standard of living is far higher, causing Jews to move out. In some areas of the Galilee this has already taken place: Portions of the once-exclusively Jewish town of Upper Nazareth are now populated by newcomers from the nearby Arab city of Nazareth.  
"I agree that there is a problem, but whether this is the right way to deal with it, I am not sure," Zetler said yesterday. "Experience will tell. But there is a problem in the Galilee and people are challenging the political right of [Jewish] communities."  
Unpleasant to be called Lieberman 
Residents of the Misgav bloc are not used to being accused of racism, and dismay at being compared to Jewish settlers in the West Bank. "It's unpleasant and even offensive to wake up one morning and find that you've turned into [Avigdor] Lieberman when in fact it's the other way around," Alon Mayer, another resident of Manof, said, referring to the hawkish Yisrael Beiteinu chairman who proposed that Israeli Arabs be required to take an oath of loyalty to the state.  
Mayer pointed out that the right-wing party headed by Lieberman garnered only 2.5 percent of the town's vote in the last Knesset elections - far below the national average. Despite feeling on the defensive, Mayer will not apologize for supporting the demand that applicants who seek to buy property in the communal settlement should adhere to the locals' basic cultural and political beliefs.  
"When we decided to move to Manof, we sought a community that chose similar basic principles to our own, such as good education for children, culture, celebrating a Jewish communal lifestyle and protecting the environment," a woman from Manof said. "We joined this community knowing it is founded on these values."  
Some Misgav bloc residents accuse Arab rights groups such as Adalah, which would rather Israel be defined as a binational state than a Jewish one and championed the Zubeidats' cause in the courts, of intentionally causing provocations. "An Arab narrative exists that proclaims 'we were not conquered, we did not desert,'" said Danny Ivri, a resident of the Misgav bloc community Yodfat. "They say 'we were manipulated in various ways, such as through military rule and suppressing our development by placing Jewish communities between our own communities."  
Misgav bloc residents also fear increased tensions that could result from Arabs and Jews living in close proximity, and point at the occasional spurts of sectarian violence that break out in nearby non-Jewish towns between Muslims, Druze and Christians. "You can't impose a demographic mix on us that will recreate the sort of friction between Muslims, Christians and Druze that exists in Maghar, Peki'in and Rameh," Mayer said, referring to cities prone to periodic unrest. "High Court justices don't understand what it's like to live in a small community which was founded with great hardships, a community which is trying to hold on to a certain way of life."  
Zionism's bond  of blood 
A few weeks ago a ceremony was held in Yuvalim, the largest town in the Misgav bloc, which exemplified its inveterate ties to the state of Israel. The regional council unveiled a promenade in memory of slain Israel Defense Forces soldier Arbel Reich, whose father was among Yuvalim's founders.  
"It was an emotional ceremony," recalled regional council head Ron Shani. "This event was part of the community's narrative, part of its spirit, just like the fact that we educate our children to serve in combat units. That's what it's like here and we're proud of that.   
"A resident who wishes to join Yuvalim will have to feel comfortable at such a ceremony, and if not he can go elsewhere, where he wouldn't be offended," he said.

<title>Goldstone to Haaretz: U.S. does not have to protect Israel blindly</title>
<date>Fri Nov 13 02:10:37 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Judge Richard Goldstone told Haaretz Thursday that President Shimon Peres' remarks criticizing him were "specious and ill-befitting the head of State of Israel." 
Peres was quoted Wednesday as calling Goldstone "a small man, devoid of any sense of justice, a technocrat with no real understanding of jurisprudence," who was "on a one-sided mission to hurt Israel." 
In Thursday's interview by e-mail with Haaretz, Goldstone said: "I am content to be judged by my actions over the course of my career both in terms of my professional judicial career and my voluntary service." 
Goldstone also said he had anticipated that the report would engender considerable criticism. "After all, no one likes to be accused of committing serious war crimes. However, I was surprised at the many nasty attacks made against me personally. In my view, it was a classic case of attacking the messenger rather than addressing the message." 
Goldstone also rejected the claim that the fact that he is Jewish was exploited to make it more difficult for Israelis to challenge his conclusions. "I was approached because of my experience with regard to the investigation of serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law." 
The Goldstone report is expected to be raised for discussion in the United Nations Security Council in the near future, and Goldstone Thursday discussed the possibility that the United States would veto any resolution that would hurt Israel when it comes to the implementation of the report's findings. "I do not believe that any nation should protect another nation blindly. I would prefer to see the United States furnish reasons for criticizing the report. The United States has supported our call for credible investigations by Israel and by the Gaza authorities, whether the PA or Hamas," he said. 
Goldstone reiterated statements he has made, as well as those made by a number of Israeli human rights groups, inviting an open, public investigation and categorically rejecting a probe by the Israel Defense Forces of the Gaza campaign. "It does not suffice for the military to investigate itself. That will satisfy very few people and certainly not the victims." 
However Goldstone stressed that "in any public inquiry, it would be open to the Israeli government and the IDF to have sensitive security information protected from public disclosure." 
When asked how far up the chain of command he felt such a criminal investigation should go, and whether decision-makers in government be its subject, he replied: "A criminal investigation should go as high up the chain of command, both military and civilian, as the evidence justifies." 
Goldstone, who is widely considered one of the fathers of transitional justice and has extolled its virtues in achieving peace and reconciliation in post-conflict societies, was asked what role he thought a truth and reconciliation commission - which received international recognition as a tool for probing the South African government's actions during apartheid - could play in contributing to a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by establishing accountability in a more constructive fashion than criminal proceedings. Goldstone said he believed it would, "on condition that it is set up to look at allegations on all sides and is established by a democratic process."  
Goldstone was asked how he reconciled his finding that kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit should be accorded the privileges of a prisoner of war, and calling for his immediate release as a humanitarian gesture, with the fact that Hamas is a non-state actor not bound by the Third Geneva Convention, which defines the concept of prisoner of war status. Should not Shalit be defined as an illegal abductee, the victim of a war crime, and his release not subject to the goodwill of Hamas?  
Goldstone replied: "In no way did we regard Hamas as a state party. We decided that it was in the interests of giving greater protection to people in the position of Gilad Shalit to extend prisoner-of-war status to them. We extended existing norms in order to do that. We based this decision on the military operations being controlled by the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention, i.e., that it was an international armed conflict." 
In response to the Israeli allegation that Goldstone's mandate was one-sided, he replied: "This incorrect allegation continues to be made in the attempt to discredit the report despite the fact that it is demonstrably false. The claim is based on a United Nations Human Rights Council resolution that I specifically and explicitly rejected." 
Goldstone also said that he had "demanded and received a balanced mandate to enable me to investigate allegations of war crimes by all sides. The government of Israel clearly knows this, as it is all a matter of public record that I discussed at the press conference announcing the inquiry and its mandate. I believe that the continued reference to the mission's mandate is yet another attempt to avoid addressing the substance of the report." 
Goldstone said he believed that for Israel, "this is unfortunate because the report contains the clearest finding that Hamas and other militant Palestinian groups committed serious war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity. The acceptance of those findings by the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly has been ignored completely by Israel. 
"I suggest that Israel has not acknowledged that because it would confer credibility on the report," Goldstone also said. 
Goldstone called the allegation that the report encourages terror and negates Israel's right to self-defense "quite untrue and a fallacious attempt to win opposition to what is contained in the report. 
"The report is based on the assumption that Israel was entitled to act in self-defense. The investigation was concerned with whether the exercise of the right to self-defense was lawful or unlawful. The condemnation in the report of the rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza is the clearest possible statement against terror, and the endorsement of the report by the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly is probably the first time that the United Nations has recognized Israel's right to act in self-defense against such terror." 
Goldstone also said: "Many Israelis are right to feel that the United Nations and its member bodies such as the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly have devoted inordinate and disproportionate attention to scrutinizing and criticizing Israel. This has come at the price of ignoring violations of human rights in other countries, some of them members of those very same bodies. The time has come for the investigation of all violations of international human rights law and international law whenever they are committed, in any state. 
"However, this disproportionate focus on Israel does not exempt Israel from respecting international law," Goldstone also said. 
"I would suggest that time has come for Israel to look at the allegations not only of the killing and injuring of so many civilians but also the collective punishment meted out to the people of Gaza by the substantial destruction of the infrastructure, and particularly the food infrastructure of Gaza. The debate should continue, not attempt to be silenced."

<title>Group to protest Israel troupe's N.Y. show with dance of its own</title>
<date>Thu Mar 05 23:33:37 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Protesters in New York were set on Thursday evening to demonstrate against an upcoming performance by the Israeli Bat Sheva dance company with a dance of their own.
The dance protest, titled Freedom Dabke vs. Batsheva Dance Company (after the traditional Eastern Mediterranean folk dance), will also feature anti-Apartheid songs, and a performance by the hip-hop artist Invincible. It was to be staged as part of a bid by pro-Palestinian groups to rally support for a boycott of the Israeli dance troupe's show at Brooklyn's Howard Gilman Opera House.
Far-left organizations this week plan to mark the "Israeli Apartheid Week" in 42 cities worldwide, and some groups have called for the protest against the performance, despite artistic director Ohad Naharin's identification with Israel's left and criticism of Israeli policy regarding Palestinians.
Protest organizers explained that Bat Sheva is highly regarded in Israel and receives state funding, serving as an ambassador of goodwill for Israel abroad, and some dancers even serve in reserve military duty.
"New York residents should know the money they pay for tickets will go indirectly to support war crimes and to whitewash Israel's image," one organizer said.

<title>Hamas rejects Carter plea to recognize Israel</title>
<date>Wed Jun 17 21:16:38 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
A senior Hamas official praised former U.S. President Jimmy Carter on Wednesday, a day after he met with the group, but said he failed to persuade the Islamic rulers of Gaza to accept international demands, including recognizing Israel.
Carter visited Gaza on Tuesday and urged Hamas leaders to accept the demands to end an international boycott, which was imposed when the militant group overran Gaza two years ago.
Carter's meeting was itself unusual because of the boycott. The United States, European Union and Israel consider Hamas a terror group and refuse to deal with it directly.
Ahmed Youssef, the deputy Hamas foreign minister, said Gaza's Palestinians were pleased to receive Carter.
"The people think this is a historic visit," Youssef told The Associated Press on Wednesday, describing Carter as somebody very knowledgeable about the conflict and very sincere in the way he understands the conflict.
But Youssef said Hamas turned down Carter's policy requests.
"The visit has not led to a significant change. Hamas finds the conditions unacceptable, he said. Recognizing Israel is completely unacceptable."
According to Hamas ideology, there is no room for a Jewish state in an Islamic Middle East. The militant group has sent dozens of suicide bombers into Israel, killing hundreds.
Even so, some Hamas officials have indicated they could support creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, implying a form of tacit acceptance of Israel.
Youssef said the other two international conditions - renouncing violence and accepting past agreements between Israel and the Palestinians - are irrelevant. He said Israel broke a cease-fire, killing many Palestinians, and the state outlined in the partial peace accords would have no substance, no borders and nothing that a real state is.
Carter has said that despite the world boycott, Mideast peacemaking efforts must include Hamas, which took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007, expelling forces loyal to Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose government now effectively rules only the West Bank.
Although then-president Carter brokered the 1979 peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, the first between Israel and an Arab country, he is perceived by many Israelis as anti-Israel, siding with the Palestinians in their conflict.
He antagonized many Israelis with his 2007 book, Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, in which he argued that Israel must choose between ceding the West Bank to the Palestinians or maintaining a system of ethnic inequality similar to that of the apartheid regime in South Africa. Most Israelis strongly reject the comparison.

<title>Host of UN Holocaust memorial skips event after U.S. Jews threaten walk-out</title>
<date>Tue Jan 27 12:13:39 IST 2009</date>
<content>
UN General Assembly President Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann on Tuesday skipped the world body's ceremony marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day, after American Jewish leaders threatened to demonstratively exit Tuesday's if he used the podium to attack Israel.
D'Escoto, who has repeatedly made virulently anti-Israel statements, was to be the event's host by virtue of his official position and was scheduled give the opening speech.
Last year, the General Assembly president likened Israel's actions in the West Bank and Gaza to "the apartheid of an earlier era," and tried to ban Israel's envoy to the UN from speaking at a ceremony to mark 60 years since the institution adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
D'Escoto did send a message to the assembly via the Rwandan envoy to the UN, whom he had asked to serve as his representative. "All genocides, all holocausts start with alienation, denominization and marginalization of others," D'Escoto was quoted as saying in his absence.
AJC Executive Director David A. Harris told Haaretz that d'Escoto had chosen not to attend the event because he knew "he did not belong" there. Harris said D'Escoto also mostly likely understood that "his presence would have insulted the event because of his viscious attacks on Israel."
Professor Gabriela Shalev, Israel's ambassador to the UN, had also threatened to quit the ceremony should d'Escoto lash out at Israel.
Several American Jewish groups, including the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, had earlier sought to have D'Escoto excluded from the ceremony, but to no avail.
In her speech to the assembly, Shalev said the world has the "responsibility not to remain silent" to the genocide perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II. 
"We have the responsibility not to allow genocide of the Jewish people, nor of any other peoplem," she said. "We have the responsibility to learn and to teach the lessons of the Holocaust, to prevent it from ever reoccurring."
"We have the responsibility not to remain silent. For, to remain silent and indifferent to the horrors of the Holocaust is probably the greatest sin of all, let alone denying it," she said, adding: We have the responsibility to act against the forces of anti-Semitism, bigotry, and racism in any form."
UN Chief Ban Ki-Moon, who was unable to attend the ceremony due to an engagement in Madrid, urged the international community to examine why the Holocaust was not stopped in order to prevent future genocides.
"We must continue to examine why the world failed to prevent the Holocaust and other atrocities since," Ban said in a statement. "That way we will be better armed to defeat anti-Semitism and other forms of intolerance."
Some 1,600 guests were expected to attend the event, ranging from Holocaust survivors to UN ambassadors.

<title>In West Bank, Carter speaks of his love for the Palestinians</title>
<date>Sat Jun 13 22:37:54 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was honored by the Palestinian government Saturday and pledged to support the Palestinians' campaign for independence to the end of his days.
In his acceptance speech, Carter urged the Palestinians to end their internal divisions and stop persecuting their rivals.
He was referring to the growing rift between the Islamic militant Hamas group, which controls Gaza, and Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, in charge of the West Bank. Each side has been cracking down on the other's supporters, particularly since Hamas violently overran Gaza two years ago.
Carter met with Hamas' exiled leadership in Syria on Thursday and is to head to Gaza on Sunday, after meeting with Israeli officials. Carter has said peace between Israel and the Palestinians is impossible without involving Hamas, but reiterated in Syria that he was not representing the Obama administration.
Hamas is being shunned by most of the international community, including the U.S., for refusing to recognize Israel or renounce violence, though Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal has said repeatedly in recent weeks that his group wants to be part of a Mideast solution.
In the West Bank, Carter was awarded the Palestine International Award for Excellence and Creativity. Previous recipients included two former international envoys, James Wolfensohn and Peter Hansen.
Carter brokered the Israeli-Egypt peace accord of 1979 and several years ago wrote a book, Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, that is sharply critical of Israeli policies in the occupied territories.
"I have been in love with the Palestinian people for many years," he said Saturday, adding that this is a feeling shared by members of his family.
"I have two great-grandsons that are rapidly learning about the people here and the anguish and suffering and deprivation of human rights that you have experienced ever since 1948," he said.
Referring to President Barack Obama's call for an Israeli settlement freeze, Carter said that "in the future, I am sure, he will call for the dismantling of the settlements that exist."
But he noted that Obama also called for an end to violence against Israelis and for Arab acceptance of Israelis' right to their own nation. Carter said such acceptance is painful for displaced Palestinians, but that there has to be an accommodation in the political world.
Carter, 85, pledged his assistance, "as long as I live, to win your freedom, your independence, your sovereignty and a good life."

<title>Israel: EU official's 'occupation' remark casts pall on ties</title>
<date>Thu Dec 17 12:24:06 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Government officials in Jerusalem harshly criticized the new European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, for her scathing remarks about the "Israeli occupation" in her maiden speech. 
Ashton on Tuesday leveled scathing criticism at Israeli policy in her first speech as the European Union's first high representative for foreign affairs and security policy.
The government officials in Jerusalem said they were surprised, dissatisfied and concerned that such a senior figure had expressed criticism before visiting Israel and learning the facts. 
They said the remarks cast a pall over relations with the European Union, and that they were particularly angry that she had not welcomed the settlement construction freeze, as had her European colleagues. 
The British stateswoman, who has also served as the Commissioner for Trade in the European Commission, said that in the EU's view, "East Jerusalem is occupied territory, together with the West Bank."
Ashton demanded that Israel immediately lift its blockade on the Gaza Strip, and reiterated that the union opposes the existence of the West Bank separation fence, as it opposes evictions of Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem.
The stateswoman, whose full title is Baroness Ashton of Upholland, also only defined Israel's partial freeze of West Bank settlement construction as a "first step," as opposed to the warmer description of the move by EU foreign ministers, who last week took "positive note" of it. 
In her address to MEPs in Strasbourg, Ashton, who was only recently appointed to the new position, said she had spoken with Israelis, Palestinians and the U.S. Secretary of State about the role the Quartet of international mediators, and that of its special envoy to the region, Tony Blair.
Ashton said she had told Blair personally that, "The Quartet [a special group set up by the U.S., EU, UN and Russia] must demonstrate that it is worth the money, that it is capable of being reinvigorated."
Following her comments, a number of MEPs from the Liberal side of the house called for punitive measures against Israel, including the suspension of the EU's Association Agreement. Irish centre-left member Proinsias De Rossa, who visited the West Bank last week, called Israel's treatment of Palestinians a form of "apartheid."
This time it was neither the "infamous" Swedish president who pulled the EU toward an anti-Israel resolution, nor a "daydreaming judge" in Britain who issued an arrest warrant against an Israeli foreign minister. Criticism of Israel has become the language of choice in European discourse.
When the Israeli government offers new benefits to settlers, and peace talks with the Palestinians are deadlocked, even the superpower's long arm is helpless. Even former U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk, a devout Jew who serves as an external advisor to U.S. President Barack Obama, does not hide his chagrin with the settlements policy.
Indyk has recently told Haaretz in an interview that statements by figures like Minister without Portfolio Benny Begin, according to which settlement construction will continue despite the moratorium, are damaging to Israel's interests. He said these comments, as well as the decision to pump funds into isolated settlements, strengthen the impression that the declaration of the freeze is not worth the paper it is written on. He warned that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will pay a political price for the move, without gaining the benefits which it was intended to grant Israel in the international arena.
The interview with Indyk will be published in Haaretz's Sunday edition.

<title>Israelis fight fire with fire over Apartheid Week</title>
<date>Fri Mar 06 03:07:36 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Inspired by a controversial "Israeli Apartheid Week" poster, two local artists released a spoof they dubbed "Hypocrisy Week." 
The poster created by David Guy and Guy Gurfinkel
The original Canadian poster was an advertisement for an annual series of anti-Israel events held on campuses around the world. 
It shows a gunship bearing the word "Israel" firing at a kaffiyeh-clad boy holding a teddy bear. 
The poster was banned from two Ottawa universities over complaints that it displayed Israelis as child-killers. 
The spoof shows the same boy being used as a shield by militants launching rockets at Israel, while journalists film the boy. 
It was created by Australia-born David Guy, 54, from Rehovot, and his son's best friend, 23-year-old Guy Gurfinkel from Shoham, who will begin studies at the Bezalel Academy of Arts next year. 
"I've arranged the pieces, but Gurfinkel's the real artist," David Guy told Haaretz.

<title>Israelis must stand with Ethiopian students over school ban</title>
<date>Sun Aug 30 03:36:54 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
There is only one subject that doesn't have to be studied, that is best lived, experienced. Math, English, even Bible study cannot be traded for life experience, and doesn't need to be. Civics is the only subject that can and should be put to the test of daily life.  
The new school year starts on Tuesday, and we are already being tested. This year we cannot respond as we did last year. There is no rest for the wicked, and the wicked are those who schemed to leave children of Ethiopian descent outside the fence, looking in, longing to be on the other side. Tell it not in Stockholm, publish it not in the streets of Oslo, lest the newspapers of the uncircumcised rejoice.  
In two days' time Israeli society may be facing a badly timed window of opportunity, one we never imagined in our worst nightmares but which, to our shame, is before is. It is an opportunity for the entire educational system to practice what it preaches in civics classes.  
It is an opportunity for the education system to teach a chapter of immeasurable value in good citizenship, a lesson so important that it could replace an entire year of civics lessons and thereby save valuable classroom hours.  
If religious schools in Petah Tikva or anywhere else insist on refusing to admit Ethiopian students, if all of the pleading and threats of the education minister don't help, then every Israeli will have no choice but to identify with the Ethiopian children in whose faces the gate of apartheid has been slammed. No one will be able to make do any longer with admonishments and reproofs.  
The entire education system will go on strike in solidarity with the little girl who stands and asks why. There is no value in education for values if one black boy remains shunned and shamed.  
A thousand outstanding teachers and ten thousand outstanding lessons would not erase this black mark if we discharge our duty with lip service. The education minister's most recent sermon, in which he said "the most important thing is to strengthen education of Jewish, Zionist, democratic and social values," will ring hollow, worthless and embarrassing.  
And so, with public opinion firmly behind us - including including students, parents and teachers - we shall lock the gates of every school. If the Ethiopian children are not allowed in, then we too, all of us, will remain outside with them, until a gate of hope ("Petah Tikva") opens to an Israeli society that is before our eyes becoming ugly to the point that it is unrecognizable, and which we must change.  
If a general strike is too much for some parents who are already preparing their children ready for school, I have an alternative: All the celebrities that Education Minister Gideon Sa'ar invited to teach at schools on Tuesday should devote their remarks to those same children who don't have a classroom, or a teacher, or classmates.

<title>Israeli tennis star Shahar Peer faces Gaza protest while playing in New Zealand</title>
<date>Thu Jan 08 07:21:16 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Israeli tennis player Shahar Peer, 22, was subject to a small but noisy protest over her country's invasion of Gaza when she played a quarter-final match at the ASB Classic tournament in Auckland on Thursday.
About 20 protestors waving anti-Israel placards yelled slogans outside the stadium's main entrance opposed by a lone Israeli demonstrator with a sign saying, "Hamas murders hope."
Security was tight and the demonstrators moved on before the start of Peer's match, which she lost to number one seed Elena Dementieva of Russia in 63 minutes.
Peer, who earlier rejected calls to withdraw from the tournament, said later, "I am not the government of Israel and I not representing Israel in politics. I am a tennis player and that's what I represent now."
Protest organizer John Minto, who led a campaign against New Zealand's sporting contacts with apartheid South Africa in the 1970s, said the demonstration would make New Zealanders think more deeply about what their country could do to support the Palestinian struggle.
Minto called Wednesday for a shoe-waving protest against Peer's participation in the tournament but this did not happen.
Peer, who was making her third appearance at the Auckland tournament, said she had never been targeted by protestors anywhere before.

<title>Israel rejects revised draft of Durban II statement</title>
<date>Wed Mar 18 20:10:38 IST 2009</date>
<content>
A senior Foreign Ministry source said Wednesday thay Israel rejects the latest draft of the closing statement for the "Durban 2" anti-racism conference, despite revisions aimed at dropping direct criticism of Israek.
While all direct references to Israel and the Israel-Palestinianconflict have been removed in an attempt to keep the European Unionfrom boycotting, it still implicitly singles out Israel.
"The first clause in the new document reaffirms the declaration of'Durban 1,' which calls Israel a racist state, and the change iscosmetic only. The essence remains the same," the official said. "Thisis a diplomatic ruse intended to blur matters and introduce criticismof Israel by the back door."
The statement will be issued at the end of the second United Nationssponsored World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination,Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, to be held in Geneva on April 20.
The previous version of the "Durban 2" closing statement led theUnited States, Canada and Italy to announce they would be boycottingthe conference. Other EU countries, as well as Australia and NewZealand, also threatened to boycott.
The edited version was crafted by a committee headed by Russia, withthe goal of preventing the boycott.
While all direct references to Israel and the Middle East have beeneliminated, the Foreign Ministry says it references the closingstatement from Durban 1, which was held in 2001 in Durban, SouthAfrica. That document presented Israel as an "apartheid state," andsingled out Israel as racist.
Israel and the United States walked out of the 2001 Durban conferenceto protest draft conference texts branding Israel as a racist andapartheid state language that was later dropped. The Foreign Ministryon Tuesday instructed its envoys to continue asking their hostcountries to boycott the conference.

<title>Israel tells El Al: Call it a separation fence, not a wall</title>
<date>Tue Jun 09 01:56:08 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
El Al passengers have received maps of Israel marking out a "separation wall" along the West Bank, but the Foreign Ministry has asked the airline to change the classification to "security fence," Haaretz has learned. New maps are to be distributed soon.  
The ministry learned of the maps from the consul general in Los Angeles, Yeki Dayan, who visited Israel several weeks ago.   
When he boarded a flight, he received a map of Israel with his newspaper and found that the line along the West Bank had been termed "separation wall."  
When he returned to the United States, Dayan approached El Al's offices in Los Angeles and told them the government preferred "security fence." In Israel, the Foreign Ministry had a similar discussion with the company's headquarters.  
The naming of the barrier has been a bone of contention between Israel and its critics; the barrier is sometimes a fence, sometimes a wall.  
Israel officially uses the term "security fence," saying it aims to prevent terror attacks in Israel. The Palestinian Authority, many European and Arab governments, and many left-wing organizations around the world use the term "separation wall." Some of them use the term "apartheid wall."  
El Al said in a statement yesterday that the maps were prepared by a company under contract. "As soon as the Foreign Ministry approached us we withdrew those maps and ordered new ones," the company said.

<title>Israel to face 'catastrophe' without Palestinian state, says Jimmy Carter</title>
<date>Tue Jan 27 08:48:48 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Former President Jimmy Carter said Monday that Israel will face a "catastrophe" unless it revives the Mideast peace process and establishes an independent Palestinian state.
In an interview with The Associated Press, he said Arabs will outnumber Jews in the Holy Land in the foreseeable future.
"If we look toward a one-state solution, which seems to be the trend - I hope not inexorable - it would be a catastrophe for Israel, because there would be only three options in that case," Carter said.
One would be to expel large numbers of Palestinians, which he said would amount to "ethnic cleansing."
The second would be to deprive the Palestinians of equal voting rights, which he said would amount to "apartheid."
The third would be to give the Palestinians equal voting rights, and therefore the majority, he said.
"And you would no longer have a Jewish state," Carter said. "The basic decisions would be made by the Palestinians, who would almost very likely vote in a bloc, whereas you would have some sharp divisions among the Israelis, because the Israelis always have different points of view."
Carter spoke to The Associated Press as his new book, "We Can Have Peace in the Holy Land," was released.
His wording on Israel's options was not new. His 2006 book, "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid," provoked a hail of criticism, particularly from Jewish-Americans who felt it unfairly compared Israeli treatment of Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza to the legalized racial oppression that once existed in South Africa.
Carter still believes a two-state solution is the best option, with all of Israel's Arab neighbors recognizing its right to exist in peace, and Israel withdrawing from most of the land it captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War to create an independent Palestine.
Carter brokered the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt 30 years ago, and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.

<title>Jerusalem & Babylon / The story that got away </title>
<date>Fri Dec 18 01:11:18 IST 2009</date>
<content>
I met this week a senior IDF general who had been intimately involved with the planning and execution of last year's Operation Cast Lead. I asked whether he was planning a trip to London any time soon. "I never went on vacation in Britain, even before the arrest warrants began," he answered half jokingly. "My parents were in the [pre-state underground militia] Etzel - MI5 still has a file on my family."  
While I was busy chatting with the general, the biggest story of the week was staring me in the face and I missed it. It could have been mine days earlier; but instead, Al Jazeera was first.  
A week earlier I had learned that Tzipi Livni would be speaking at a Jewish National Fund event in London, and then heard she had apparently canceled. It should have been obvious to me that some pro-Palestinian lawyer was going to try and slap her with an arrest warrant, and I probably could have confirmed this in a couple of phone calls to London. But somehow I missed it, my usually keen journalistic instincts somehow dulled by a backlog of work and other pressing tasks.  
Another story that got away, only to scream its obviousness at me once it came out elsewhere. Obvious to me, that is.  
What I still find very surprising about the Livni-war crimes-arrest warrant story is the number of Israelis, normally very aware and in touch with life outside the bubble, who were themselves surprised by the entire episode. They seemed to feel that the former foreign minister being threatened with arrest somehow moved the whole issue up a notch.  
Why? Because she is a woman? Because according to Israeli politics, Kadima lead by Livni is pegged as a centrist, even centrist-left party? Does that make her any different from all the ex-generals who have so far been threatened with international jurisdiction and surprise arrests for war crimes? For god's sake, she was part of the innermost forum that decided on the exact dates and stages of Cast Lead, along with Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert (and according to some reports, of the three, she was most in favor of extending and prolonging the operation).  
Ultimately, Livni is responsible for what at least one highly regarded international jurist claims was a series of war crimes. Why did anyone expect her to get preferential treatment? Why does anyone think she should somehow be exempt from responsibility, while for the last four years just about every senior Israel Defense Forces officer - in active service or the reserves - has been forced to give up shopping on Oxford Street and Knightsbridge? And Britain is just one country - the same is true of visits to many other western European nations. Scandinavia, Spain and Belgium are all off-limits to the entire senior class of IDF officers as well as a select group of politicians.  
There is a much wider issue at stake here, beyond former ministers' and generals' lecture engagements and holiday plans. Those who say that this is Israel's battle for international legitimacy are only telling us part of the story. The reality is that in many countries, that battle is over, that battle has been lost. In some of the most "enlightened" nations of the Western world, identifying Israel as a racist, warmongering apartheid state is no longer a radical view, shared mainly by anti-Semites and "Arab lovers" - it has become the mainstream opinion.  
Three years ago, then prime minister Tony Blair promised his Israeli counterparts that the legislation allowing private citizens in Britain to obtain arrest warrants for foreigners suspected of carrying out war crimes would be amended. And he meant it. No one had to point out to Mr. Blair that with the wars taking place in Iraq and Afghanistan, he, his colleagues and the officers of the British Army and their American allies could also find themselves in the dock. Blair's successor Gordon Brown has also made similar promises.  
So why was this amendment never put into effect? Not because the Labour government could not find the necessary majority in parliament. And the leaders of the Conservative Party have also privately assured the Israeli embassy in London that it would support such a motion. No, the British government hesitated and prevaricated because they knew full well just how downright unpopular such a move would be. They would have been eviscerated by the local press, by every single human-rights movement, by the Archbishops, the professors and by the great majority of their own grassroots memberships.  
For a weak and deeply unpopular government, this was too much to contemplate. In other words, while Israel may be able to comfort itself with a degree of sympathy from Britain's political leadership, it has lost the understanding of the rest of the country's opinion makers.  
Some of you may be asking, So what? Britian's days as a superpower are long over. True, but in the arena of international media and public opinion, Britain still punches way above its natural weight. The maiden speech given by Catherine Ashton - who is from Britain and the European Union's new high representative for foreign affairs and security policy - in which she roundly criticized Israeli policies is just the latest striking example. The response from Israeli politicians, a proposal to boycott British products, already signed by a third of the Knesset, is risible. Just as the connection Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman made between global anti-Semitism and the arrest warrants in his speech on Wednesday is pointless, neither is another round of moaning about Israel's "hasbara failure" going to get us anywhere. The point at which a change in PR tactics might have remedied Israel's international situation has long passed.  
No amount of explanation as to why there is no room for comparison will help any more. As far as much of the world is concerned, Israel today is the South Africa of yesteryear. And as it was with the end of apartheid, the only remedy here is relinquishing control of the West Bank and part of Jerusalem and establishing a viable Palestinian state. The alternative is accepting our status as a pariah state.  
I happened to be in Britain both during the opening week of the Second Lebanon War and the first days of Operation Cast Lead, and naturally I followed the media coverage closely. My unscientific observation was that in the second case, Israel's official spokesmen were actually given wider opportunity to explain its position than they had been two and a half years earlier, and on the whole, while still generally critical, the tone in the media seemed to be less anti-Israel during the Gaza operation.  
Belatedly, I realized this wasn't a greater acceptance of Israel's actions, it was simply acceptance by the British reporters and broadcasters that Israel, as far as they are concerned, is a rogue nation - perpetually engaged in bloodshed, certainly no better than its Hamas adversary. We can continue to huff and puff as much as we like, but for the rest of the world, an arrest warrant against an Israeli politician isn't a shocking news story, it is simply a fact of life.

<title>Jerusalem-born Jew elected to Fatah Revolutionary Council</title>
<date>Sat Aug 15 20:37:17 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
The official list published Saturday of winners in elections to the Revolutionary Council of the Palestinian Fatah movement included 67-year-old Dr. Uri Davis, a Jerusalem-born Jew.
He was the first Jew to become a member of the Revolutionary Council since it was established in 1958.
Davis, who in the 1980s abandoned his Israeli citizenship in protest over Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and later received Palestinian citizenship, was the only non-Arab to run for a seat in the Revolutionary Council, Fatah's legislative body.
When his name was announced as number 31 on the list of winners, members in the auditorium of the Bethlehem school where the conference held its meetings applauded long and loud.
Davis, who considers himself anti-Zionist and who after renouncing his Israeli citizenship joined Fatah because he says he saw it as a socialist movement, was among more than 600 Fatah activists who competed for 80 seats of the council.
Author of the books "Israel: An Apartheid State," published in 1987 and "Apartheid Israel: Possibilities for the Struggle Within," published in 2004, Davis prefers to identify himself as a Palestinian Hebrew.
Speaking perfect Arabic, he teaches Jewish studies at the Palestinian al-Quds University in Abu Dis, located just outside an eight-meter high concrete wall Israel has built around occupied East Jerusalem to separate it from its West Bank environs.
Davis said in Bethlehem last week as he was campaigning for a seat in the Revolutionary Council that he wants to see more anti-Zionist Israelis and internationals take up leading posts in Fatah.
Fatah opened its sixth congress, the first in 20 years, in the West Bank city of Bethlehem on August 4.
After a week of deliberations, over 2,000 delegates voted for 18 seats on the 23-seat Central Council, whose official results were announced on Wednesday, and for 81 seats of the 128-seat Revolutionary Council.
The results showed at least 70 new members entering the Revolutionary Council, with members from the Gaza Strip winning 20 seats and women winning 11.
The highest number of votes went to a woman who spent many years in Israeli jails for her role in the resistance. Christian members won four seats.
New members include a number of Fatah activists from the diaspora, including Samir Rifai, Fatah's secretary in Syria, and Khaled Abu Usba, who participated in a terror attack in the 1980s in which at least 30 Israelis were killed.
They also include Fadwa Barghouti, wife of jailed Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, who is serving five life sentences in Israel for his role in the second Intifada, and who has been elected to the Fatah Central Committee.
Addressing the winners, Abbas declared Fatah's sixth congress "a new launch for Fatah," saying: "We have great work ahead of us."
He urged the members to work toward "reviving Fatah, which today more than any previous time needs the efforts of its young members to lead the movement into the future."
Abbas said he will convene the PLO's parliament-in-exile, the Palestinian National Council, for an "extraordinary meeting" in the next few days in an effort to start work on reforming the Palestinian umbrella organization.

<title>Jerusalem: EU foreign policy chief's remarks 'cast a pall' over relations </title>

The interview with Indyk is to be published on Sunday.

<title>Jimmy Carter to U.S. Jews: Forgive me for stigmatizing Israel</title>
<date>Tue Dec 22 09:52:28 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter has apologized to the American Jewish community for 'stigmatizing Israel' and asked for forgiveness for his actions, the JTA reported on Monday.
"We must recognize Israel's achievements under difficult circumstances, even as we strive in a positive way to help Israel continue to improve its relations with its Arab populations, but we must not permit criticisms for improvement to stigmatize Israel," Carter wrote in a letter to the JTA.
"As I would have noted at Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, but which is appropriate at any time of the year, I offer an Al Het for any words or deeds of mine that may have done so," Carter wrote, referring to the prayer said on Yom Kippur in which Jews ask God for forgiveness for any sins. 
Carter has angered American Jews in the past by likening Israeli policy in the West Bank to apartheid South Africa in his book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid".
According to the JTA, Anti-Defamation League national director Abraham Foxman, who in the past claimed Carter's comments bordered on anti-Semitism, welcomed the former president's statement. 
"We welcome any statement from a significant individual such as a former president who asks for Al Het," Foxman said. "To what extent it is an epiphany, time will tell. There certainly is hurt which needs to be repaired."

<title>Ken Loach slams Lev Cinemas over profit gesture </title>
<date>Mon Oct 19 01:21:10 IST 2009</date>
<content>
British film director Ken Loach responded sharply last week to a statement by Lev Cinemas CEO Nurit Shani, who said that profits from Loach's films in Israel would be dedicated to promoting Israeli films at home and abroad.  
Loach is a strong advocate of boycotting Israeli films to protest Israel's policies in the territories.  
In his response, published in "Screen Daily," he criticized Shani for political and cultural reasons, and said profits from his films should support artists who back the cultural boycott, "those brave free spirits" who refuse to accept money from the Israeli government.  
Shani made her comments before Loach's latest film, "Looking for Eric," was aired at the Haifa Film Festival over Sukkot this month, while describing Loach's energetic efforts to impose a comprehensive boycott on films made in cooperation with Israel or with Israeli government funding.  
Loach responded: "Who knows, perhaps some time in the future Shani's vision will help kick-start projects about those courageous Israeli soldiers who formed the group Breaking the Silence and spoke out against the 'reckless and gratuitous use of white phosphorous' in civilian areas in Gaza, and were appalled by the use of Palestinians as human shields?"  
His response was also credited to the film's producer Rebecca O'Brien and screenwriter Paul Laverty.  
"Perhaps too we will be fortunate to watch films about those young men and women in Israeli prisons who refuse to join the Israeli army because of the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands. And why not include Palestinian film makers or is Israel really an apartheid state?"  
Loach also complained that Shani did not have the good manners to inform him that his film would be screened at the Haifa festival, as is accepted practice.  
In conclusion, he quoted the Israeli poet, Aharon Shabtai, who said: "I do not believe that a state that maintains an occupation, committing on a daily basis crimes against civilians, deserves to be invited to any kind of cultural (event)."  
Loach's other recent actions against Israeli cinema have included his call for a boycott of the Edinburgh international film festival in May, because the Israeli government had paid the travel expenses of Israeli director Tali Shalom Ezer, whose film, "Surrogate," was being shown there.

<title>L.A. Jews mull boycott of Israel university over 'apartheid' op-ed</title>
<date>Sat Aug 22 22:43:56 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Members of the Los Angeles Jewish community have threatened to withhold donations to an Israeli university in protest of an op-ed published by a prominent Israeli academic in the Los Angeles Times on Friday, in which he called to boycott Israel economically, culturally and politically.
Dr. Neve Gordon of Ben-Gurion University in Be'er Sheva, a veteran peace activist, branded Israel as an apartheid state and said that a boycott was "the only way to save it from itself."
Gordon, a political scientist, said that "apartheid state" is the most accurate way to describe Israel today. 
"3.5 million Palestinians and almost half a million Jews live in the areas Israel occupied in 1967," Gordon wrote, "and yet while these two groups live in the same area, they are subjected to totally different legal systems. The Palestinians are stateless and lack many of the most basic human rights. By sharp contrast, all Jews - whether they live in the occupied territories or in Israel - are citizens of the state of Israel." 
"It is indeed not a simple matter for me as an Israeli citizen to call to suspend cooperation with Israel," he further wrote.  "The words and condemnations from the Obama administration and the European Union have yielded no results, not even a settlement freeze, let alone a decision to withdraw from the occupied territories." 
Gordon was in the public spotlight in 2002, during Israel's assault on the Palestinian Authority, as one of the Israelis who stayed with Yasser Arafat in his compound. In 2003, he was a vocal critic of Paratroopers Brigadier Col. Aviv Kochavi. 
In the wake of the publication of the article, Israel's Consul-General in Los Angeles, Yaakov (Yaki) Dayan sent a letter to the president of Ben-Gurion University, Prof. Rivka Carmi, in which he said that such statements may be detrimental to the university. 
"Since the article was published I've been contacted by people who care for Israel; some of them are benefactors of Ben-Gurion University," Dayan wrote.  "They were unanimous in threatening to withhold their donations to your institution. My attempt to explain that one bad apple would affect hundreds of researchers turned out to be futile."
"I believe that the definitive answer to anti-Zionist lecturers like Gordon is to set up a center for Zionist studies, which unfortunately does not exist in Israeli academia," he continued. "This center would help dispel the lies disseminated by Gordon in the name of your university."

<title>Meretz leader to Haaretz: Two-state solution on last legs </title>
<date>Fri Feb 06 01:45:52 IST 2009</date>
<content>
You gotta love Jumes. You can disagree with him and you can get mad him, but in the end, you have to have great warmth for him. In the age of Lieberman's nationalism and Eyal Arad's spin, Meretz chair Haim Oron is like an antibody. Even when he goofs, he goofs with his heart in the right place.  
If any two numbers reveal just how awful this election is, it's these: Lieberman 20, Meretz five. The Lieberman-Meretz gap raises serious questions about the future and the present of the state of Israel. From his Tel Aviv campaign headquarters, Jumes is still fighting to change both.  
Why Meretz? For half their lives, half of Haaretz's readers have been voting Meretz and nothing good has come of it.  
Meretz is a kind of start-up. It tosses out ideas that catch on later and other people implement them. But I don't accept that division of labor any more. It's not okay with me that there is an incubator for ideas in one place and they sprout somewhere else. There should be one political entity that represents the social-democratic and peace positions. And that entity is Meretz.  
But Meretz isn't having an easy time in this election. Barak and Livni are gnawing at your position from one side, Hadash is chewing on the other. Let's start with Labor chair Ehud Barak. Why not Barak?  
Barak is running in 2009 as a successful defense minister who rehabilitated the army and conducted an operation in Gaza. He is not running as the leader of the peace camp.  
So maybe Kadima chair Tzipi Livni is the leader of the peace camp. She promises a dove with an olive branch. Just open the window and let her in.  
Livni saved herself the question of right and left by not going where she has to decide if she is right or left. She hasn't gotten to dividing Jerusalem and hasn't gotten to resolving the refugee problem. She might have a clearer picture in her own mind. Livni talks about the courage to tell the public the truth. And I say: 'Tzipi, with all due respect to your courage, the question is what you tell Palestinians behind closed doors about Jerusalem.' I don't know what she says. She isn't where Bibi is but she hasn't even gotten to the places that Olmert has. I think both she and Barak make comments from the hazy center that blur the truth. That haze harms the foundations of democracy. It makes political parties into unions of interested parties. It makes the public fed-up with politics because people figure politicians don't say what they really think.  
Then Hadash. Dov Khenin says what he really thinks. He is clearer and sharper than Meretz. He has a kind of charisma.  
Black-and-white positions look sharp, but reality is not black-and-white. I oppose the injustices that took place in Gaza but I do not accept that Israel doesn't have the right to self-defense. But the underlying conflict between Meretz and Hadash is more substantial. I am a Zionist. I see Israel as a Jewish state that must be democratic and must be for all its citizens. Anyone who says there is tension here is right. It is the tension we live with here. Khenin releases himself from that tension by defining himself as the non-Zionist left. I believe that dealing with the complexities of life in Israel is more moral than disengaging.  
Let's admit the truth, Jumes. The warfare in Gaza hurt Meretz twice. On the one hand it brought Labor back into the game and on the other it boosted Hadash. You guys look hesitant.  
There is no way a left-wing party like ours doesn't come out of war bruised. There was an option of calling the war right and just, and anything done in it was good. There was an option to say that Israel doesn't have the right of response even after 60, 80, 100 rocket strikes. I think both options are oversimplified. So Meretz took the position that a focused military action against Hamas was justified, but it is not okay to cross lines in the sand. And in this war there were lines in the sand.  
Your sons fought in an operation that some of your voters believe was a war crime.  
I told you, I live in the tension between poles. One the one hand is the need to remove the threat, but on the other there were tractors that demolished Gaza neighborhoods in the last days of the ground operation. I do not accept that. I believe there is a line that we cannot cross if we want to remain who we are.  
Do you still believe in peace? Has the word "peace" been erased from your campaign?  
Neither the word nor belief in peace have been erased. The lack of peace and the continued occupation are the greatest dangers to the future of Israel.  
Is the two-state solution viable? Can it still be implemented?  
The two-state solution is on its last legs. That is why this election is so important. If we do not quickly implement the partition into two states, that solution will evaporate and Zionism will be stuck its worst crisis ever. This could turn into a bad cross between Rhodesian apartheid and Somalian bloodshed.  
That bad?  
Let me tell you a story. A few days after Sari Nusseibeh retracted his position on two states, I went into Ehud Olmert's office and told him that he should take the report of Nusseibeh's comment like he would take the news that an Arab state has a nuclear bomb.  
For decades I have fought for peace. In Peace Now, in Mapai and in Meretz. The two-state solution is the only solution. And I live in fear today. I see the light fading. Why did my parents come here? To what have I devoted my life? For what am I here? For a Jewish and democratic state. And if there is no Jewish and democratic state, what am I left with?  
If the situation is so dramatic, maybe it's better not to vote for a small party like Meretz.  
Not true. There is no one else like Meretz now. We are the only leftist Zionist alternative that believes in peace, human rights and social democracy.  
Some say Amos Oz has become your guru. You are the Eli Yishai of Meretz and Oz is your Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.  
Amos and I have a very close relationship. We do and our families do. But there is no spiritual leader here. There is no authority. We are attentive, not authoritative.  
Would you join a unity government with Netanyahu?  
We won't sit in a government with Netanyahu as prime minister.  
And a unity government with Livni?  
If it is possible to create a center-left government we would be a substantial factor. If it is a unity government of mutual paralysis, we would rather serve the public from the opposition bench. Against the rise of the right and the Israeli racism of Lieberman, Meretz will provide an ideological and political platform that will become an alternative.

<title>New Durban 2 statement still singles out Israel </title>
<date>Thu Mar 19 01:09:50 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Israel rejects the latest draft of the "Durban 2" anti-racism conference closing statement, a senior Foreign Ministry source said.  
While all direct references to Israel and the Israel-Palestinian conflict have been removed - in an attempt to keep the European Union from boycotting - it still implicitly singles out Israel.  
"The first clause in the new document reaffirms the declaration of 'Durban 1,' which calls Israel a racist state, and the change is cosmetic only. The essence remains the same," the official said. "This is a diplomatic ruse intended to blur matters and introduce criticism of Israel by the back door."  
The statement will be issued at the end of the second United Nations-sponsored World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, to be held in Geneva on April 20.  
The previous version of the "Durban 2" closing statement led the United States, Canada and Italy to announce they would be boycotting the conference. Other EU countries, as well as Australia and New Zealand, also threatened to boycott.  
The edited version was crafted by a committee headed by Russia, with the goal of preventing the boycott.  
While all direct references to Israel and the Middle East have been eliminated, the Foreign Ministry says it references the closing statement from Durban 1, which was held in 2001 in Durban, South Africa. That document presented Israel as an "apartheid state," and singled out Israel as racist.  
The Foreign Ministry yesterday instructed its envoys to continue asking their host countries to boycott the conference.

The renowned Portuguese author Jose Saramago and dozens of leading opinion-shapers were listed as cosignatories in an "urgent" petition for removing Hamas and all Palestinian "liberation organizations" from the European list of terrorist groups. The initiative's organizer, Nadine Rosa-Rosso, signed on other notables such as Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Maguire and author Danny Morrison from Ireland and South Africa's former intelligence minister, Ronnie Kasrils. The petition was circulated as pro-Palestinian activists around the world launch the fifth "Israeli Apartheid Week." (Cnaan Liphshiz)  
The largest Jewish body in the United States yesterday lauded the Obama administration's decision not to participate in a United Nations anti-racism summit known as Durban II, which it fears will be used as a forum to criticize Israel. Alan Solow, Chairman, and Malcolm Hoenlein, Executive Vice Chairman, of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, said they greatly appreciate the decision of the Obama administration not to participate and urged the European Union to follow its lead.

<title>New Yorkers call for boycott of Motorola over dealings with IDF</title>
<date>Thu Jul 23 22:35:52 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Protesters in the New York borough of Queens held a rally last week to call for a boycott of Motorola over the firm's business dealings with the Israel Defense Forces.
At the demonstration, which was organized by the New York Campaign for the Boycott of Israel, protestors waved Palestinian flags and signs saying: "Goodbye Moto, Goodbye Apartheid," and "Boycott Motorola, Free Palestine."
The group also wrote songs and conducted street theater to draw the attention of passersby.
The organization's spokesperson, Aaron Levitt, told Haaretz this week that over 300 people have signed a petition for a boycott of Motorola after just four events in New York City.
"Every time we go out to flyer, we meet many people who express support for the campaign and even sign our pledge to boycott Motorola," said Levitt. His organization has more events planned for the coming month.
In June 2007, the New England United Methodist Church named Motorola as one of a number of firms that supported Israel's occupation of the West Bank. Who Profits, a project of the Coalition of Women for Peace, also lists the company as profiting from Israel's activities in the Palestinian territories.
Motorola has been active in Israel since 1964; it currently provides the IDF with a cellular network through a subsidiary, MIRS.
MIRS provided the IDF with a military-encrypted cellular communication system, nicknamed "Mountain Rose," which is worth $100 million and was especially constructed for field conditions.
The company's radar detectors' and surveillance systems have been reportedly installed in West Bank settlements. Both of these systems had a price tag of more than $90 million.
The department responsible for installing these systems was sold in April 2009 to an Israeli company, Aeronautics Defense Systems, after Motorola had come under fire from several groups in the U.S. over its activities in Israel. 
Motorola spokesman Rusty Brashear said the sale of the unit was not triggered by the protests, but because "it primarily doesn't fit in our portfolio."
The groups the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, the Palestinian National Committee and other organizations worldwide also support a boycott of the phone company.
Motorola was previously boycotted due to its support for the apartheid regime in South Africa. The company supplied South African police with mobile radio transmitters used to suppress demonstrations against the government.

<title>Obama leaves settlers with stark choice - apartheid or a bi-national state</title>
<date>Tue Jun 09 02:30:46 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
American pressure is penetrating the hearts of mainstream settlers. People like Uri Elitzur - who saw from a government office what many settlers do not see from the West Bank - understand that Barack Obama has changed the rules of the game between the United States and Israel, and that despite the right's victory in the elections, the Palestinians are not planning to go anywhere. What this means is that after 42 years of occupation, the time has come for the settlers to choose between Jewish land and a Jewish state. 
A hint of this could be found in remarks made by Elitzur last Friday, the day following Obama's Cairo speech. Elitzur, who headed Benjamin Netanyahu's bureau during the latter's first term as prime minister, was once one of the leaders of the Gush Emunim settlement movement; today, he is deputy editor of the newspaper Makor Rishon. On Friday, he debated Gadi Baltiansky, director general of the Geneva Initiative, at a seminar for parliamentary assistants organized by the Geneva Initiative at Ma'aleh Hahamisha, outside Jerusalem. 
Elitzur rejected Obama's notion of a two-state solution, saying a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders would be a hotbed of terror. However, the status quo - which, he said, means an apartheid state - is also unacceptable to him. So what does that leave? A binational state. 
Elitzur proclaimed that the Land of Israel is more important than the State of Israel, and a Jew's right to live any place in his land is more important to him than the desire for sovereignty. In order to make this concept more concrete, he compared the Land of Israel to his wife and the state to a cleaning woman. "I married my wife, not the cleaning woman," he said. 
Elitzur is not the only veteran settler who would choose the Greater Land of Israel even at the price of the state losing its Jewish majority. Former MK Hanan Porat and other settler leaders have recently prophesied in a similar vein. If you like, this is nothing but a post-modern version of post-Zionism. 
Multiple obstacles 
Natural increase appears to be unique to Jewish settlers. Otherwise, how can we explain the Israeli occupation authorities' refusal to expand the living space of Palestinians? Most Palestinians are crowded into what the Oslo Accords termed Areas A and B; they are not permitted to build in Area C, which constitutes about 60 percent of the West Bank. And as if that were not enough, the expansion of the settlements and the illegal outposts comes at the expense of our Palestinian neighbors' freedom of movement. 
A new report by the United Nations' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, covering September 2008 through the end of March 2009, states that the settlements are the most important factor in determining movement restrictions in the West Bank. The report demonstrates a high correlation between the location of impediments to movement, including the separation fence, and the location of settlements and settlers' roads. Paving alternative roads requires expropriating lands, and in this way, the area available to Palestinians for development is reduced. 
OCHA field workers mapped and documented 634 physical barriers, 93 of which were manned. And contrary to Defense Minister Ehud Barak's claim that the Israel Defense Forces recently evacuated several outposts, the workers reported that activity to expand settlements had actually intensified along the western side of the fence. 
In addition, the report noted, stepped-up violence by settlers has reduced Palestinian farmers' ability to work their lands near certain settlements. And in parts of the Jordan Valley and the eastern slopes of the Bethlehem and Hebron districts, Palestinian farmers and shepherds have seen their access to their lands restricted even further over the past few months, because these areas have been declared closed military zones or nature preserves. Some 28 percent of the West Bank is defined as either a closed military zone or a nature reserve. 
An old-school lawyer
Although he is quite a young man, Yosef Havilio, the Jerusalem municipality's legal advisor, belongs to the old school of lawyers for whom honesty and justice were paramount, no matter what. He, too, has presumably noticed that leaders of right-wing organizations are constantly in and out of the office of Mayor Nir Barkat, their new partner in the vision of Judaizing the Old City and its surroundings. But this did not prevent him from issuing a professional opinion, in response to an inquiry from Meretz city councilman Pepe Alalo, that sealed the fate of the Elad organization's plans for new construction in the City of David. 
At last week's meeting of the local planning and building committee, Havilio's representative, attorney Shirin Barghouti-Milham, told the committee it had no authority to approve the plan over the legal adviser's objections. Before voting with the majority in favor of the plan, Likud councilman Elisha Peleg vented his anger at Barghouti-Milham. 
But Havilio was not deterred by this outburst. In an unusual step, he told the city engineer, Shlomo Eshkol, that the committee's decision was illegal and forbade him to issue a building permit. He also sent a letter to Barkat stating that Peleg may have committed a criminal offense - either insulting a civil servant and/or inciting to racism - when he shouted at Barghouti-Milham: "Get out of here ... You're a low-level clerk, you systematically object to building in the eastern part of the city ... You want to help the Palestinians all the time." 
A municipal spokesman said Barkat has demanded that Peleg apologize to the attorney and will decide on further steps depending on how Peleg responds. Peleg wrote back to the mayor saying he never referred in any way to Barghouti-Milham's origins, and his words were distorted by Havilio, who was not present at the time. He also denied that the mayor asked him to apologize and said he has no intention of doing so. Six city councilmen have complained to Barkat about Havilio's letter.

<title>Obama officials meet U.S. Jews to explain their Durban II policy</title>
<date>Tue Feb 17 14:52:51 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Officials from the Obama administration met with U.S. Jewish leaders on Monday to explain why the government has decided to participate in planning the controversial World Conference Against Racism, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported.
Jerusalem fears that the "Durban II" summit, set to be held in Geneva this April, will be used by Arab nations and others as a forum to criticize Israel as was its predecessor in 2001.
The closed-door talks were led by the White House and the State Department, according to the JTA, and the content of the meeting was off-the-record.
The meeting was held after the State Department sent a high-level team to an informal preparatory session in Geneva this week, but declared that a "change in direction" was required before it could commit to full participation in the April meeting.
"If you are not engaged, you don't have a voice," State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said on Tuesday.
"We wanted to put forward our view and see if there is some way we can make the document a better document than it appears it is going to be," he said. "That does not mean, however, that we will take part in future meetings or indeed in the conference itself."
Delegates to the talks on Monday told the JTA they were organized to give the Jewish leaders a chance to voice their concerns and for the Obama administration to explain its policy about the controversial event.
The decision to attend the planning sessions sparked some criticism from Jewish groups but drew praise from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who urged all member states "to engage constructively on all the outstanding issues" at the conference.
Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said the Durban process was biased against Israel.
"While we understand the pressure on the U.S. to go to Geneva, we urge America not to participate in a fatally flawed UN racism conference that demonizes Israel by singling it out for condemnation," he said. 
U.S. human rights organizations have been urging the Obama administration to engage in the conference in order to tackle the issues that will be discussed during the meeting.
Human Rights First, the leading human rights organization in the U.S., on Tuesday issued a statement welcoming Obama's intention of participating in the summit.
"We urge the administration to work to ensure that the conference advances rather than undermines the protection of fundamental rights, and to engage with others to press for that outcome," the statement reads.  
"This session provides an opportunity for the United States to lead efforts to address problems with language proposed for the current draft of the outcome document," said the statement. "The United States should also encourage states to review the implementation of their international commitments to combat racism. Although this is the stated purpose of the conference, states have put in very little effort so far to engage in any meaningful review."
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni on Monday appealed to the U.S. not to participate in the UN-sponsored conference. Speaking before a delegation of visiting American Jewish leaders, Livni said that "Israel expects the free world not to participate in Durban II."  
Israel and Canada have announced they are boycotting the April 20-24 conference in Geneva, a follow-up to an acrimonious meeting in 2001. Canada said the conference was likely to descend into anti-Semitism while Israel said it would be an "anti-Israel tribunal".
European Union (EU) countries including Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands are under pressure from Jewish lobbies to follow suit. But they have stayed engaged while struggling to tone down a final UN text to be issued by the conference, diplomats say.
The 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in Durban was meant to lay down a blueprint for nations to address sensitive issues.
Israel and the United States walked out in protest over a draft text branding Israel as a racist and apartheid state, language that was later dropped.

<title>Obama's Cairo speech signals end of the 9/11 era</title>
<date>Fri Jun 05 02:16:30 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
If Barack Obama fulfills even some of the promises he made during his important address in Cairo Thursday, June 4, 2009 will be remembered in world history as the last day of the 9/11 era. Instead of a clash of civilizations, we will have a dialogue of cultures. Instead of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict being pushed to the sidelines of the struggle against Islamic terrorism, we will get a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders, with agreed territorial adjustments, and normalized relations between Israel and the Arab states. Instead of a balance of nuclear terror between Iran and Israel, both of them will be signatories in good standing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  
Obama's speech was not a collection of empty rhetoric. Before the entire world, he put his signature to a bunch of checks that have deadlines for being cashed. In his talks with his aides in recent weeks, a consensus has emerged that November 2010 - the date of the next congressional elections - should be the target date for realizing the two-state solution. By then, we will know how much of an impression Obama's speech made on Iran's president. Who knows: Perhaps Iranian voters will be convinced that they have before them a U.S. president who is genuinely interested in reconciliation with Islam, and will use their upcoming election to replace their current president with a more conciliatory one. By then, we will also know whom Benjamin Netanyahu is more afraid of - the U.S. president or the chairman of the Yesha Council of settlements, Benny Begin or Tzipi Livni.  
Alongside many questions, the address provided many exclamation marks. Thursday, the era of formal imbalance in the trilateral relationship between the U.S., Israel and the Arab world gave way to an equilateral triangle. Obama left Egypt with two tablets of the commandments - one for Jews and the other for Muslims. He left no room for doubt: An Israel that continues to discriminate against Palestinians and prevent them from exercising their rights to self-determination and freedom of movement cannot expect affirmative action from the U.S. It is hard to believe that Obama simply forgot to mention the words "Jewish state." The president believes that the nature of the State of Israel is something only the State of Israel can decide.  
Obama placed violence against Israel on a par with the settlements and the humiliation of Palestinians in the territories. He spoke in the same breath about the struggle of Palestinians who lost their homes more than 60 years ago and the struggle of African slaves in the U.S. The Israelis could see themselves in the sentence that mentioned the apartheid state of South Africa.  
Having granted Israel several weeks to formulate its policy, Obama could not present a detailed program for realizing the two-state solution. However, the two documents that he did mention - the road map and the Arab Peace Initiative - suggest a framework from which there can be no deviation: No more formulas like Resolution 242, whose interpretations vary, or loopholes for continuing the settlement building. Nor is it an accident that he failed to mention "natural growth": He was hinting that if Israel adopts a two-state solution, most of the settlements will become history anyway.  
Obama gave Israel the following choices Thursday: Either the conservative Israeli government will adjust itself to the American people's choice in electing a liberal president, or the speech will be the lightning that precedes the thunder.

<title>Palestinian activists plan massive graffiti protest on West Bank fence</title>
<date>Thu Apr 16 01:19:05 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
The separation barrier will receive its largest piece of graffiti yet when Dutch and Palestinian activists scrawl on it a 2,000-word letter by a South African scholar arguing that "Israeli apartheid" is "far more brutal" than Pretoria's was.  
The letter by Farid Esack will be put on the eastern face of the wall this week by activists belonging to Sendamessage - a Dutch group that collects money over the Internet for painting messages to protest against the barrier Israel is building along the West Bank.  
According to Israel, the barrier is designed to keep Palestinian suicide bombers out, but Palestinians say it juts into their land. The letter, to be sprayed in a single line against a white-paint background, is expected to take up over 2,500 meters of concrete beginning near Ramallah.  
"Have our Jewish sisters and brothers forgotten their humiliation?" Esack writes to Palestinian readers. "In your land, we are seeing something far more brutal, relentless and inhuman than what we have ever seen under apartheid."  
In another segment, he writes: "The apartheid police never used kids as shields ... nor did the apartheid army ever use gunships and bombs against largely civilian targets."  
Esack is a Muslim writer and political activist appointed by Nelson Mandela to preside as gender equity commissioner. His text, which deplores Israel's "targeted killings of those who dare to resist," does not mention Hamas' anti-Semitic ideology, the Palestinians' firing of rockets on Israeli civilians or suicide bombings.  
"We chose this letter because it holds no provocation, but is a balanced and academic text, not cheap propaganda," the Dutch site's operator and concept designer, Justus van Oel, told Haaretz.  
"We do not contest that the wall is protecting Israelis from attacks. But it's a short-term solution. Apartheid can never be a long-term solution," said van Oel, who works in part as a communications consultant.  
He added that the cost of the letter project is estimated at 12,500 euros and that advertisers and private individuals sponsor 1.5-meter segments. The sponsors' signatures will be sprayed at the bottom of Esack's text.  
The spraying, which begins Thursday, will be the work of Sendamessage's three Palestinian partners, led by Faris Arouri. "We think that we can get it done within eight full days," van Oel said. "It's impossible, but it's no reason not to do it." A documentary on the project will be filmed by Federico Campanale and Iona Hoogendoorn.  
The open letter will be sprayed along with Sendamessage's other works, in which the spraying team puts up messages they receive from clients through the Internet for 30 euros. Since the group came into being in December 2007, it has put some 850 messages on the wall for around $33,500, according to van Oel.  
Part of the money Sendamessage receives stays in Holland "to cover the minimal costs," van Oel says, with the bulk of the profits going to Palestinian non-governmental charities. "All recipients are linked to the network of ICCO, a large Dutch-Christian nonprofit, which only accepts legal organizations," he said.  
Asked whether the money could go to educational projects that could be seen as hateful to Israelis and Jews, van Oel said: "I don't have an intelligence service there. It's about trust, and I do trust the people involved in this project."

<title>Palestinian anger with Barenboim prompts him to cancel Ramallah visit </title>
<date>Thu Jan 01 00:03:43 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Unlike the cancellation of Leonard Cohen's concert in Ramallah, which got a lot of press, the cancellation of conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim's visit to the West Bank city has been kept almost secret. 
Both cancellations were spurred by different Palestinian groups which warned against what they described as the normalization with the occupation and with Israel.
Barenboim, who has performed in Ramallah several times in violation of military orders banning Israelis from entering, was not going to give a concert this time. He was going to Ramallah to attend an opera in Arabic, written to the music of the Basque composer Juan Crisostomo de Arriaga who died at age 20 in 1826.
The performers, most of them children, are members of the Children & Youth Choir of the Barenboim-Said Foundation, the Choir of the Arab Evangelical School in Ramallah and the Youth Orchestra of the Barenboim-Said Foundation and Al Kamandjati.
Barenboim started the foundation along with his friend, the Palestinian theorist Edward Said, in 2003, not long before the latter's death. The foundation, which saw the creation of the music schools in Ramallah and Nazareth among other projects, declares as its main objective the "integrat[ion] of music into the fabric of society, from which it distanced itself throughout the course of the 20th century as a result of a general trend of specialization."
Last March, as soon as word got out that the school intended to perform the opera in Ramallah's cultural Palace, opposing voices surfaced demanding the city refuse to rent out the space. The Barenboim-Said Foundation learned by mid-June that the city council had decided against leasing the hall, with a vote of 6 to 5.
With time, however, it became apparent that the various political forces influencing the municipal arena did not see eye to eye. The parents of the children, who spent months rehearsing, were also opposed to the city's ruling. 
Pressure was also exerted from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' office, which requested that the city reverse the decision. On July 4, 10 days before the scheduled premiere, the municipality agreed to allow the performance to take place in its hall.
Although the city had made it clear that Barenboim would be welcome to attend, he ultimately decided not to come, citing his busy schedule as the reason for his own cancellation. His associates in Ramallah were concerned that protests outside or inside the hall would dampen the children's happy event.  
The bulk of dissent across Ramallah was not just over the performance, but over the very existence of the Barenboim-Said Foundation.   
A leading activist in the Palestinian movement for a cultural boycott of Israel told Haaretz that the foundation's publications make it clear that it "does not take any position against the Israeli occupation or apartheid policies. They talk about promoting mutual understanding and coexistence through dialogue, music, etc. This is an attempt to give a normal image to a very abnormal, colonial situation."
But a great share of the criticism, especially heard in the streets of Ramallah and in e-mail circulation, was directed at Barenboim himself. The criticism focused on three articles he has published over some years, particularly in his latest piece published by the British Guardian during the height of Operation Cast Lead. His critics accused him of referring to Israel's offensive in Gaza as an act of "self defense."
Opposition to Barenboim and his foundation is nothing new, but the status of the Israel boycott movement has strengthened since the offensive against Gaza.  Yet, as the activist said, the opposition to the Foundation's activity is not a top priority. 
Mariam Said, the late theorist's widow who has took her husband's place in directing of the foundation , told Haaretz on Thursday that Edward had always insisted that "this project has nothing to do with politics, governments, any of the current solutions or entities. It is a purely individual endeavor to break barriers."
Said said she is proud of the foundation's contribution to the musical and cultural education of Palestinian children, and has enormous appreciation of Barenboim's contribution to that process, as well. During the premiere of the opera, Said read a letter Barenboim had written to the audience and to the performers.

<title>Pro-Israel group: Carter's apology to Jews a 'publicity stunt'</title>
<date>Thu Dec 24 22:47:50 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The holiday season brought U.S. Jews a surprising gesture from former president Jimmy Carter recently, when he issued a letter of apology for "stigmatizing Israel"
The letter, published by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, raised many eyebrows in the Jewish community, with many wondering how sincere the apology really was, and others demanding that Carter prove his sincerity with actions to minimize the damage he had already incurred. 
The pro-Israel group Shalom International on Thursday called Carter's apology a publicity stunt. The group's Bob Kunst said that Carter has sought to build a global movement against Israel. He said Carter's apologies were questionable and fall on deaf ears.
Kunst's Miami-based advocacy group fights anti-Semitism through protests and rallies.
Other Jewish groups, including the Anti-Defamation League, welcomed Carter's apology. Carter offered an Al Het, a Hebrew plea for forgiveness, to the Jewish community this week for any words or deeds that may have stigmatized Israel.
One theory made the connection between Carter's apology and his grandson's bid for the Georgia Senate seat. The uneasy relationship between Carter and American Jews could make it harder for 34-year-old Jason Carter to win the election in a district rife with Jews. The outgoing Georgia senator, whose seat Jason is vying for, is Jewish. 
The younger Carter tried to dispel the allegations, saying that though he welcomes moves toward reconciliation, his grandfather's letter has nothing to do with his campaign. 
The crisis between Carter and the Jewish community came to a head three years ago with the publication of his book Palestine: Peace, not apartheid. After the book was published, 14 Jews resigned from the Carter Center. 
His recent visit to Gaza and his meetings with Hamas leaders coupled with his apathetic tone during a meeting with the father of captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, all have made Carter unwelcome in synagogues. 
In his letter, the former president offered Jews an "Al Het" for all his remarks, or actions, that may have contributed to this split.

<title>Reggae star Alpha Blondy in Israel to meet 'big brother Jesus'</title>
<date>Sun Dec 06 22:48:50 IST 2009</date>
<content>
"Bonjour maman" were the first words that Ivorian reggae star Alpha Blondy said Sunday when he arrived in Israel and entered the VIP reception room at Ben-Gurion Airport.
Blondy, a social activist from Cote D'Ivoire who rose to fame as one of reggae's best known performers when he came out against apartheid, was addressing Israeli ex-ambassador Dr. Tamar Golan, who came to the airport to greet him.
After hugging his host and longtime friend, Golan, who let out a few yelps of maternal joy upon seeing him, Blondy introduced his wife, Ran Young Hong Kone to her and to his country's ambassador to Israel, Prof. Koudou Kessie Raymond, who came to the airport at 3 A.M. with the embassy's entire staff.
For Alpha Blondy, who will perform on Wednesday at the inauguration ceremony of a Ben Gurion University's Africa Centre headed by Golan, this is his "fifth or fourth" visit in Israel. But it's a first for his wife.
"We have to go to Jerusalem to say hello to my big brother Jesus," he told her in his booming voice. "I've been here a few times before, you see, so I know where we can find him."
In his performance at the two-day inauguration event at BGU, Blondy plans to sing the eulogy he wrote for slain former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, as well another hit number entitled "Jerusalem."
"I wrote 'Jerusalem' in 1985 on my first visit, after thinking about Jesus," reminisced Blondy, who was born to a Muslim mother and a Christian father. "When I arrived at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, I thought that if I tell people back home that I saw the grave of Jesus, they will tell me: 'Alpha, you better stop smoking ganja.'"
A vocal critic of social injustice and war crimes during the Ivorian Civil War, back home Blondy is seen not only as a singer, but as a social activist, according to some of the 10 diplomats present. 
A few weeks ago Blondy announced his support for Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo, who declared last week he will run for office early next year in the recovering country's first election since 2000. The country remains divided following a civil war which erupted following a botched coup d'etat against Gbagbo's regime in 2002.
"I support Gbagbo because I support peacemakers and not warmongers," said Blondy, in an apparent reference to Gbagbo's elections rival and prime minister, Guillaume Soro, head of the former rebel New Forces.

<title>Rightist MKs scuffle with Arab families in East Jerusalem</title>
<date>Sun Aug 09 21:25:39 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Scuffles broke out Sunday between two rightist MKs and members of a Palestinian family in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, while the MKs toured the contested area.
At one point, stones were thrown at Yaakov Katz and Uri Ariel, both from the National Union party, and the MKs' bodyguards traded blows with protestors.
While the MKs were touring the neighborhood, a member of the Gawi family yelled at them "you learned the Apartheid laws from South Africa. East Jerusalem will be free, this is our land. We didn't expel you, why are you expelling us?"
The Gawi family is one of two Palestinian families in the neighborhood who were evacuated from their homes last week.
MK Katz said "all of this area belonged to Jews between 70 to 80 years ago and we are returning to it."
When asked if the same principle would apply to houses belonging to Arab families that were deserted during the 1948 Israeli War of Independence, Katz replied "on the contrary, let an Arab come forward and make a claim on a house that he thinks belongs to him and his family inside the state of Israel. This claim will be handled by the court."
Right-wing activist Aryeh King, who escorted the MKs through the neighborhood, pointed out a number of houses that had been acquired by the Nahalat Shimon organization or that were subject to documents saying they belonged to Jews. King vowed that in another year, the number of Jewish families in the area will increase from 28 to 40. 
On Monday night, left-wing activists from Israel and abroad will hold a demonstration in the neighborhood to show solidarity with the evacuated families.

<title>S. African minister accused of 'hate speech' </title>
<date>Thu Jan 29 01:47:11 IST 2009</date>
<content>
South Africa's Jewish community yesterday lodged a complaint of "hate speech"  against the country's deputy foreign minister, who earlier this month said that "Jewish money controls America and most Western countries."  
Stressing that the South African Jewish Board of Deputies "usually prefers dialogue," the board's national director, Wendy Kahn, told Haaretz: "Deputy Minister Fatima Hajaig has crossed all limits."  
Kahn, who is in Israel to attend the World Jewish Congress in Jerusalem, called Hajaig's comments "a demonstration of anti-Semitism of the oldest and most classic kind."  
The board filed the complaint against Hajaig to the country's Human Rights Commission - a national institution with some investigative and executive powers, which derives its powers from the post-apartheid constitution.  
In the complaint, the board quotes what Hajaig said at a pro-Palestinian rally in Lenasia on January 14. "They, in fact, control [America], no matter which government comes in to power, whether Republican or Democratic, whether Barack Obama or George Bush," Hajaig was heard saying.  
She also allegedly said: "The control of America, just like the control of most Western countries, is in the hands of Jewish money and if Jewish money controls their country then you cannot expect anything else."  
The minister, who is out of South Africa, has so far not commented on the complaint, nor has the government clarified its position on the controversial comments. However, Kahn noted the administration has been "overall more evenhanded toward Israel during the Gaza operation than during the 2006 Lebanon War." Hajaig's comments, Kahn said, were the exception.  
In the board's announcement about the complaint, chairman Zev Krengel said that although the decision "had not been taken lightly," it was necessary because "not since the era of pro-Nazi Nationalist MPs more than half a century ago had such statements been made against Jews by a senior government official."  
The Democratic Alliance of the opposition has called for Hajaig to be sacked if she does not offer an immediate public apology. Party spokeswoman Lindiwe Mazibuko said: "It is incumbent upon Hajaig to immediately apologize to the people of South Africa in general, the Jewish community in particular, and to U.S. President Barack Obama."  
The Israeli Foreign Ministry also recently complained to the South African government about Hajaig, after she used harsh and "undiplomatic" language in speaking with Israel's ambassador to South Africa, Dov Segev-Steinberg, during the Gaza operation.  
According to various sources, Hajaig accused the ambassador of bringing a diplomat of Ethiopian descent to the embassy "only because he was black," presumably to counter the often-heard accusation in South Africa that Israel is an apartheid state.

<title>Senior UN official skips Holocaust memorial amid accusations of anti-Israel bias, threats from U.S. Jews  </title>
<date>Wed Jan 28 02:03:05 IST 2009</date>
<content>
NEW YORK - UN General Assembly President Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann skipped the world body's ceremony marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day yesterday, after American Jewish leaders threatened to demonstratively exit the event if he used the podium to attack Israel.  
D'Escoto, who has repeatedly made strongly anti-Israel statements, was to be the event's host, by virtue of his official position, and he was scheduled give the opening speech.  
Last year, d'Escoto (who began his one-year term as president last September) likened Israel's actions in the West Bank and Gaza to "the apartheid of an earlier era," and tried to ban Israel's envoy to the UN from speaking at a ceremony to mark 60 years since the institution's adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  
Gabriela Shalev, Israel's ambassador to the UN, had also threatened to quit yesterday's ceremony should d'Escoto lash out at Israel.  
Several American Jewish groups, including the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, had earlier sought to have d'Escoto excluded from the ceremony, but to no avail.  
In her speech to the assembly, Shalev said the world has the "responsibility not to remain silent" to the genocide perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II.   
"To remain silent and indifferent to the horrors of the Holocaust is probably the greatest sin of all, let alone denying it," she said.   
"We have a responsibilty to act against the forces of anti-Semitism, bigotry and racism in any form."  
Some 1,600 guests were expected to attend the event, ranging from Holocaust survivors to UN ambassadors.

<title>South Africa: Israel actions in East Jerusalem akin to apartheid</title>
<date>Thu Nov 26 02:37:11 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The South African government has issued an unusually harsh statement condemning Israel for approving 900 new housing units in Gilo and evicting Palestinians from their East Jerusalem homes, comparing Israel's actions to the "forced removals" of the apartheid era.  
"We condemn the fact that Israeli settlement expansion in East Jerusalem is coupled with Israel's campaign to evict and displace the original Palestinian residents from the City," the statement said. "South Africa is deeply concerned that these activities by Israel will only serve only to deepen the cycle of violence in the region."  
Israeli officials and Jewish leaders in South Africa condemned the statement.  
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said: "We deeply regret this unexplainable statement, which ignores key facts while presenting as realities nonexistent matters. It is highly misleading not to take cognizance of Israel's repeated calls to renew peace talks unconditionally and without deferral. It is simply unjust to call the neighborhood of Gilo a 'settlement,' or to conjure a phantasmagorical 'campaign to evict Palestinians.'"  
"One cannot equate building new homes for Israelis... in Gilo with the forced removals that occurred under apartheid," said David Saks, the associate director of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies. "In the latter case, many thousands of non-whites were forcibly evicted from their homes to make way for white settlement; in Gilo, by contrast, no one is being forcibly removed to make way for new developments."  
Israel says the two Palestinian families evicted from homes in East Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood over the summer were living in buildings that have been owned by Jews since before Israel's founding, and that a court ordered the evictions because the families had violated the terms of their leases.  
Another leader of the South African Jewish community said that while individual government officials have occasionally invoked the apartheid comparison, it's unusual for the government itself to do so.  
A spokeswoman for the South African Zionist Federation, Bev Goldman, said the group "questions again why Israel is always judged to a standard different from that of the rest of the world." She said the statement would "do little more than create and heighten tensions within the local Jewish community and with South Africa's radical pro-Palestinian elements."

<title>South Africa Jews welcome minister's apology over 'Jews control America' jibe</title>
<date>Thu Feb 05 10:59:12 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The South Africa Jewish Board of Deputies (SAJBD) on Thursday issued a statement thanking South African President Motlanthe for ensuring an apology from Deputy Foreign Minister Fatima Hajaig, who said last month that "Jewish money controls America."
The South African cabinet termed Hajaig's comments, which came at a pro-Palestinian rally on January 14th in Lenasia, "anti-Semitic".
Last week the SAJBD filed a complaint of "hate speech" against Haijaig with the Human Rights Commission - a government body with some judicial and executive powers.
The SAJBD had rejected an earlier statement issued by Hajaig, saying that she "very clearly avoided addressing, let alone repudiating, the blatantly anti-Semitic sentiments originally expressed by her." 
The SAJBD praised the government for their "firm commitment to combating all forms of racism and prejudice in our society, including Anti-Semitism."
In the beginning of the earlier radio apology, Hajaig deplored "the attempts of Zionists to justify policies that have worsened the crisis in the Middle East" and "unmitigated state violence directed against unarmed civilians." She reserved the same criticism for "indiscriminate attacks against Israeli unarmed civilians." 
After delivering 300-odd words about her regional vision, Hajaig arrived at the controversial statement and said: "I conflated Zionist pressure with Jewish influence. I regret the inference made by some that I am anti-Jewish." 
She added: "To the extent that my statement may have caused hurt and pain, I offer an unequivocal apology for the pain it may have caused to the people of our country and the Jewish community in particular." 
Just hours before Hajaig's apology to the president, South Africa's largest trade union federation announced its members intend to refuse to service a ship scheduled to come in from Israel to Durban Port on Sunday. The union called this a "historic development." 
The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) - which has approximately 1.8 million members - added that following Israel's military campaign in Gaza last month, it is resolved to "strengthen the campaign in South Africa for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Apartheid Israel."

<title>South African deputy minister apologizes for 'anti-Semitic' slur </title>
<date>Thu Feb 05 01:17:06 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Following increasing pressure from South Africa's Jewish community, the country's deputy foreign minister yesterday apologized to the republic's president for saying last month that "Jewish money controls America." Meanwhile, the South African dock workers union said its workers would refuse servicing an Israeli ship.  
"Deputy Minister [Fatima Hajaig] expressed her deep regret to President [Kgalema Motlanthe]," the government said. "She accepted that the comments were contrary to stated government policy. She subsequently apologized unreservedly and unequivocally for the comments and agreed to withdraw them unconditionally."  
The cabinet also termed Hajaig's comment, which she made on January 14 at a pro-Palestinian rally in Lenasia, "anti-Semitic."  
Just hours before Hajaig's apology to the president, South Africa's largest trade union federation announced its members intend to refuse to service a ship scheduled to come in from Israel to Durban Port on Sunday. The union called this a "historic development." The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) - which has approximately 1.8 million members - added that following Israel's military campaign in Gaza last month, it resolved to "strengthen the campaign in South Africa for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Apartheid Israel." Last week, the South African Jewish Board of Deputies filed a complaint of "hate speech" against Hajaig with the Human Rights Commission - a government body with judicial and executive powers.  
"We are quite happy with this apology," the Board's national chairman, Zev Krengel, told Haaretz. "Without a doubt, it's the result of pressure that we've applied." Krengel added the Board has not yet decided on whether to withdraw the complaint against Hajaig. But the cabinet said that the president has accepted her apology "and trusts that the matter has been concluded satisfactorily."  
On Tuesday, Hajaig offered an earlier apology over the radio, which the Board rejected, saying it only "served to compound the original insult." In the beginning of the earlier radio apology, Hajaig deplored "the attempts of Zionists to justify policies that have worsened the crisis in the Middle East" and "unmitigated state violence directed against unarmed civilians." She reserved the same criticism for "indiscriminate attacks against Israeli unarmed civilians."

<title>South African Jews mixed on Zuma rise and election victory </title>
<date>Fri Apr 24 01:40:13 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
While leaders of South Africa's Jewish community expressed cautious optimism regarding Jacob's Zuma's rise to power on Thursday, other community voices described his presidency as a "depressing defeat" for democracy.  
The African National Congress on Thursday evening had a 64.73 share of the votes, making the party's controversial yet charismatic candidate the republic's next president. Zuma won the elections after overcoming a rape charge and numerous corruption charges.  
"No one can make predictions," South Africa's chief Orthodox rabbi, Warren Goldstein, told Haaretz. "But there are encouraging signs: The financial crisis hasn't hit the country so badly and Jewish emigration is down compared to last year."  
While remaining equally noncommittal, Ze'ev Krengel, chairman of the South African Board of Governors, mentioned that thanks to the "contacts between Goldstein and Zuma," the Jewish community could enjoy improved accessibility to the presidency.  
At Goldstein's request, earlier this year Zuma spoke before the community, and even presented the Jewish leadership with a document affirming the party's support for a two-state solution in the Middle East.  
But Steve Magid, the publisher of the popular Jewish affairs blog "It's Almost Supernatural," says Zuma's presidency could help one of the country's most anti-Israel bodies: South Africa's largest trade union COSATU, where Zuma is reported to have a "strong base of support."  
"Zuma's style is to tell everyone what they want to hear," said Magid, who called on readers to "try and stop the ANC," on his blog, which he runs with Michael Kransdorff. They both say they believe Zuma overcame his corruption charges by illegitimate means that relied on the ANC's power.  
"I was depressed to see Zuma might pass two-thirds of the vote. It's a defeat for democracy," Magid said.  
Goldstein argues COSATU's rank and file "are not interested" in Israel, and that the Israel boycotts promoted by COSATU are orchestrated by a "few people with limited influence, regardless of who's in power."  
The fact that the transition of power occurred smoothly attests to the resilience of democracy in the country, he said.  
Another concern by some pro-Israelis in South Africa is that Zuma may appoint Blade Nzimande from the Communist Party, known for making hostile statements about Israel, as foreign minister.  
"We will have to wait and see," said Krengel. "We'll know more about where Zuma's heading when we see his cabinet. Until then, he's done no wrong and he's done no right."  
South Africa's Ambassador to Israel, Ismail Coovadia, told Haaretz his country and Israel would continue to enjoy "excellent relations."  
"The whole world is witnessing the fact that South Africa has come a long way in fulfilling the vision to safeguarding the democratic principles for which we struggled so hard over so many decades: a non-racist, non-sexist, democratic society where people of all colors. Like any true democracy, national interests will take priority," he said. "All South Africans, irrespective of their party or political persuasions, treasure the constitution as the highest, collective, home-grown achievement of the struggle against the abominations of apartheid. As for its relations with Israel, South Africa will continue to build on the excellent relations we enjoy on many fronts: trade, person-to-person contact, increased diplomatic representivity and a continuing commitment to contribute to share our rich experience in the processes to end the conflict between the African National Congress and the apartheid regime."

<title>The cowardice, the vanity, the sin of boycotting Israel</title>
<date>Sun Sep 27 08:17:24 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Click here for more articles by Bradley Burston
Live in this tainted Holy Land long enough, and you come to learn that there are two kinds of political activists, much as there are two kinds of artists. 
The first kind, the kind who changes the world, points to something that has yet to have been seen, something that seriously needs to be seen, and cries out, "Look at this."
The second kind, the kind who changes nothing, barks in a voice every bit as insistent, "Look at me."
I was privileged this weekend to attend a marriage of art and activism of the first sort, the new film "Ajami." Jointly directed by an Israeli-born Palestinian and a Jewish Israeli, spoken mostly in an Arabic salted with Hebrew, Ajami is an overwhelming work, clenched, compassionate, violent, perplexing, complex beyond facile comprehension. It is a creature of this place. It rings true.
Given the depth and breadth of its lens, and the fact that the directors worked for seven years to fit their story into two hours, it is all the more galling that earlier this month, political activists very much of the second sort, bluntly caught Ajami in the collateral damage of a scattershot anti-Israel campaign.
Ajami was among a number of dark and critical Israeli films, among them "Lebanon" and "Jaffa," which were effectively sniffed at and dismissed by the strident, star power-chasing protest at the Toronto International Film Festival, a protest so shallow and so misplayed, that it has had the effect of doing the occupation a distinct favor.
There is something in Ajami's nuance that helps explain why the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel, of which the Toronto protest was an ingenuously unacknowledged bastard cousin, has proven a wholesale failure. 
What Ajami shows, in continually surprising revelations, is the essential core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: people on both sides trying to protect their loved ones and keep them alive, often with heartbreaking consequences.
This is what the BDS movement and the Toronto group cannot begin to accept. This is why they continue to alienate peace activists
The Toronto Declaration
Jane Fonda, a headliner of the celebrities who signed the Toronto group's declaration, came to recant her support
She added that "it can become counterproductive to inflame rather than explain and this means to hear the narratives of both sides, to articulate the suffering on both sides, not just the Palestinians. By neglecting to do this the letter allowed good people to close their ears and their hearts." 
The Toronto group was unmoved by Fonda's words. They had achieved their goal, that of turning the spotlight away from Israel and, if only briefly, toward the real martyrs for Palestine - themselves. The web flowed with praise - and even petitions - hailing the courage of the "true heroes" of the Toronto Declaration.
The progression was shocking to watch. The vanity of the movement is matched only by its cluelessness.  On the Declaration's blog site, one of the links following the text of the open letter and its framer's protestations that they were not calling for a boycott, was a statement by the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel: "We encourage filmmakers and audiences to boycott the Spotlight as it extends a gesture of 'goodwill' to a colonial and apartheid regime which is violating Palestinian human rights with utter impunity."   
One of the founding members of PCABI is Omar Barghouti, who, while arguing for a crippling academic boycott against Israel, is currently studying for his master's degree at Tel Aviv University. Asked by the Forward about his affiliation with an institution he wants boycotted, "Barghouti said he would not discuss his personal life."
Citing Barhjouti's refusal to walk the walk, the left-leaning weekly did not mince words in denouncing the BDS movement in an editorial this week. The movement's adherents, it said, "seem uninterested in performing any personal sacrifice, or even measuring their 'success' by hard numbers. They are most intent on sullying Israel's name and bullying anyone who might suggest another path toward peace in the troubled region."
There was something altogether fitting about going to see Ajami on the weekend before Yom Kippur, the time of year when Jews are commanded to re-examine themselves in the harshest of light.  Radical in its shifts across borders, language, and time, it forces shaken moviegoers to reconsider their preconceptions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and, no less, about themselves.
The BSD movement and the Toronto Declaration group, might consider doing no less. This has been a particularly self-defeating period for the boycott movement. It has shown itself to be mean of spirit and narrow of vision. 
When singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen sought to dedicate concerts in Ramat Gan, Israel, and the Palestinian city of Ramallah to the cause of reconciliation, donating the proceeds to Israeli-Palestinian groups working against all odds toward that goal, boycott activists, many from the U.K., forced the cancellation of the Ramallah concert. Many Palestinians were horrified, and said so publicly, no less when the boycott proponents succeeded in getting Amnesty International to cancel its plans to play a role in fostering the distribution of the proceeds.
This week we observe the ancient boycott known as Yom Kippur. We ask forgiveness for sins of a hardened heart, of judgmentalism and hatred, of a willful deceit of others and an unknowing deceit of ourselves.  
For the sin of demanding that only others search their souls and repent. And for the sin of finding others guilty and passing sentence, without having the courage to allow the accused to face their accusers.
To the BDS people and their spiritual kin in Toronto, let me say just this: When you criticize Israel, for God's sake - if only for the Palestinians' sake - tell the truth. The whole truth. Not just your carefully composed cardboard cutout, the cartoon of the Jewish villain and the Arab martyr. And not from a distance.
Come here. Do the work. Take the risks. Put your slogans and your posters and your buttons and signs and t-shirts and open letters to the test. Put your life where your sloganeering is. 
You despise Israel, we get that. You dismiss the capacity of Israelis for good faith and humanism. We get that too. But if you talk struggle in Toronto and San Francisco and Irvine, it's no more than talk, and wasted breath at that. You can boycott away, all you like. In the end, you're  only drumming up more business for Israel.
Alternatively, as a first step, you might go see Ajami. If it's hard as hell for you to understand, then you've made a beginning. See it again. 
It's Yom Kippur. It's time to get rattled. Just as in the cartoons, when you run off a cliff, it's only when you look down, that you begin to plummet. 
Look down. We're all falling here. We're all trying to keep our families and friends, our children and our elders, from the cliff. Until you understand that, you understand nothing.
[Late Saturday, after these words were written, Ajami won the Best Picture Award at the Ophir Awards ceremony, Israel's version of the Oscars. It will thus be Israel's entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was the first time a primarily Arabic language film has won the Ophir for Best Picture.]

<title>The cowardice, the vanity, the sin of boycotting Israel</title>
<date>Sat Sep 26 22:50:37 IDT 2009</date>

Live in this tainted Holy Land long enough, and you come to learn that there are two kinds of political activists, much as there are two kinds of artists. 
The first kind, the kind who changes the world, points to something that has yet to have been seen, something that seriously needs to be seen, and cries out, "Look at this."
The second kind, the kind who changes nothing, barks in a voice every bit as insistent, "Look at me."
I was privileged this weekend to attend a marriage of art and activism of the first sort, the new film "Ajami." Jointly directed by an Israeli-born Palestinian and a Jewish Israeli, spoken mostly in an Arabic salted with Hebrew, Ajami is an overwhelming work, clenched, compassionate, violent, perplexing, complex beyond facile comprehension. It is a creature of this place. It rings true.
Given the depth and breadth of its lens, and the fact that the directors worked for seven years to fit their story into two hours, it is all the more galling that earlier this month, political activists very much of the second sort, bluntly caught Ajami in the collateral damage of a scattershot anti-Israel campaign.
Ajami was among a number of Israeli films, among them "Lebanon" and "Jaffa," which were effectively sniffed at and dismissed by the strident, neo-Socialist Realism protest at the Toronto International Film Festival, a protest so shallow and so misplayed, that it has had the effect of doing the occupation a distinct favor.
There is something in Ajami's nuance that helps explain why the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel, of which the Toronto protest was an ingenuously unacknowledged bastard cousin, has proven a wholesale failure. 
What Ajami shows, in continually surprising revelations, is the essential core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: people on both sides trying to protect their loved ones and keep them alive, often with heartbreaking consequences.
This is what the BDS movement and the Toronto group cannot begin to accept. This is why they continue to alienate peace activists 
http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1112953.html
working in Israel and Palestine, and continue to blunder their way into doing the bidding of an eternal occupation.
The Toronto Declaration was ostensibly a protest against a festival decision But as one of its 
They were unmoved by Fonda's words. They had achieved their goal, that of turning the spotlight away from Israel and, if only briefly, toward the real martyrs for Palestine - themselves. The web flowed with praise - and even petitions - for the "true heroes" of the Toronto Declaration.
The vanity of the movement is matched only by its cluelessness.  On the Declaration's blog site, one of the links following the text of the open letter was a statement by the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel. "We encourage filmmakers and audiences to boycott the Spotlight as it extends a gesture of 'goodwill' to a colonial and apartheid regime which is violating Palestinian human rights with utter impunity.   
One of the founding members of PCABI is Omar Barghouti, who, while arguing for a crippling academic boycott against Israel, is currently studying for his master's degree at Tel Aviv University. Asked by the Forward about his affiliation with an institution he wants boycotted, "Barghouti said he would not discuss his personal life."
Citing Barhjouti's refusal to walk the walk, the left-leaning weekly did not mince words in denouncing the BDS movement in an editorial this week. The movement's adherents, it said, "seem uninterested in performing any personal sacrifice, or even measuring their 'success' by hard numbers. They are most intent on sullying Israel?s name and bullying anyone who might suggest another path toward peace in the troubled region."
There was something altogether fitting about going to see Ajami on the weekend before Yom Kippur, the time of year when Jews are commanded to re-examine themselves in the harshest of light.  Radical in its shifts across borders, language, and time, it forces shaken moviegoers to reconsider their preconceptions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and, no less, about themselves.
The BSD movement and the Toronto Declaration group, might consider doing no less. This has been a particularly self-defeating period for the boycott movement. It has shown itself to be mean of spirit and narrow of vision. When singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen sought to dedicate concerts in Ramat Gan, Israel, and the Palestinian city of Ramallah to the cause of reconciliation, 
This week we observe the ancient boycott known as Yom Kippur. We ask forgiveness for sins of a hardened heart, of judgmentalism and hatred, of a willful deceit of others and an unknowing deceit of ourselves.  
For the sin of demanding that only others search their souls and repent. And for the sin of finding others guilty and passing sentence, without having the courage to allow the accused to face their accusers.
To the BDS people and their spiritual kin in Toronto, let me say just this: When you criticize Israel, for God's sake ? for the Palestinians' sake ? tell the truth. Not just your carefully composed cardboard cutout, the cartoon of the Jewish villain and the Arab martyr. And not from a distance.
Come here. Do the work. Take the risks. Put your slogans and your posters and your buttons and signs and t-shirts and open letters to the test. Put your life where your sloganeering is. 
You despise Israel, we get that. You dismiss the capacity of Israelis for good faith and humanism. We get that too. But if you talk struggle in Toronto and San Francisco and Irvine, it's no more than talk, and wasted breath at that. You can boycott away, all you like. In the end, they only drum up more business for Israel.
Or, as a first step, you might go see Ajami. If it's hard as hell for you to understand, then you've made a beginning. See it again. 
It's Yom Kippur. It's time to get rattled. Just as in the cartoons, when you run off a cliff, it's only when you look down, that you begin to plummet. 
Look down. We're all falling here. We're all trying to keep our families and friends, our children and our elders, from the cliff. Until you understand that, you understand nothing.

<title>The Guardian publishes obituary of Hamas terror chieftain killed by IAF </title>
<date>Mon Jan 05 20:07:57 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The Guardian, eulogizing a Hamas terrorist commander killed by Israel, branded the fierce supporter of suicide bombings who sent his own son on such a mission as "a man of the street" and "something of a hero." 
Nizar Ghayan was killed last Thursday along with his family, and had refused to seek shelter, despite pleas by Hamas leaders who knew his Gaza home was a target for Israeli warjets. 
The obituary lauds Ghayan as "one of Hamas's top five decision-makers," and that he had been viewed by many to be more significant than Hamas prime minister Ismail Haniyeh. It says Ghayan, primarily associated with the Hamas military wing, was "highly regarded as an Islamic academic."
The piece says that Ghayan "strongly advocated" suicide bombings, and states that he sent his son on a suicide mission at the Israeli settlement of Elei Sinai in 2001, where he killed himself and two Israelis.
"We will never recognize Israel," Ghayan is quoted as saying in the paper. "There is nothing called Israel, neither in reality nor in the imagination." 
The final line of the obituary reads: "Nizar Rayan, political leader, born 6 March 1959; died 1 January 2009".
Israel's Ambassador to the Court of St. James, Ron Prosor, said he was not surprised by the tone of the obituary. 
"This is not the first obituary and it seems it won't be the last that The Guardian grants to Hamas terrorists." 
Others recently honored by an obituary in The Guardian include Clash of Civilizations author Samuel Huntington, South African anti-apartheid activist Helen Suzman and British Jewish playwright Harold Pinter.

<title>Top Israeli educator: Israel should probe Gaza war before it's forced to</title>
<date>Wed Sep 30 01:08:06 IST 2009</date>
<content>
If Israel does not investigate its most recent military operation in Gaza, it will be forced to do so by the international community, Prof. Uriel Reichman, president of the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, said yesterday.  
"A commission headed by a Supreme Court justice must immediately be established to examine Operation Cast Lead. And although the [Goldstone] report is very much not fair and borders on incitement, it also raises questions regarding our actions in Gaza," Reichman said.  
Reichman called for a probe in a joint statement with former education minister Amnon Rubinstein, a fellow jurist who is also affiliated with the Interdisciplinary Center.
"The situation requires balance between protecting our existence and the humanist heritage of our people. The harsh accusations of the Goldstone report being disseminated worldwide cannot be ignored. We must investigate Israel's conduct in Operation Cast Lead to stand guard over the combat morality of the Israel Defense Forces," he said.  
Reichman said one unfair conclusion of the report is that Israel planned to harm innocent civilians.  
"Israel is presented as a murderous country. Without saying so outrightly, [the report] describes Israel as an apartheid state. It says the Israeli justice system is unreliable in overseeing the military and in its attitude toward the Arab minority. It determines that the Arab minority lacks freedom of expression and protest.  
"The most infuriating thing is the invalidation of the legal system. After the Israeli legal system has been attacked from within for interfering too much, the Goldstone report now argues that it does not interfere enough," the statement said.

<title>Toronto Film Fest deflects criticism of Tel Aviv spotlight</title>
<date>Fri Sep 04 10:42:23 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Organizers of the Toronto International Film Festival this week defended their decision to present a series of films spotlighting the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, which a group of high-profile artists and celebrities say constitutes complicity in "the Israeli propaganda machine."
"If there are issues that have been raised by these films, that's exactly what the festival should be about, to show work that's challenging, work that raises questions, work that's contemporary, work that deals with today's issues," Festival director Piers Handling. The films speak for themselves, he said, and are meant to promote discussion. 
Several Canadian filmmakers plan to withdraw their movies from the festival, claiming that the screenings of 10 Tel Aviv films will show Israel in a positive light instead of creating a critical forum in which to discuss the occupation. 
The Tel Aviv-centric week launches the Toronto Festival's new City to City event and is intended to celebrate Tel Aviv's centennial. 
According to the protesting artists, including culture critic Naomi Klein and director John Greyson, the problem is not the official participation of Israeli films at the festival but the character of the forum in which they will be screened. 
Greyson last week pulled his documentary "Covered" from the festival in protest, and a statement published online on Thursday and signed by more than 50 artists, academics, and filmmakers likened the program to a celebration of apartheid-era South Africa. 
"This program ignores the suffering of thousands of former residents and descendants of the (Tel Aviv) area who currently live in refugee camps in the Occupied Territories or who have been dispersed to other countries," say the signatories, which also include actors Jane Fonda and Danny Glover and filmmaker Ken Loach. 
They accuse the festival of taking direction from the "Brand Israel" campaign, which seeks to improve the country's image and has focused on Toronto as a test city. 
"We do not protest the individual Israeli filmmakers included in City to City, nor do we in any way suggest that Israeli films should be unwelcome at TIFF," they say. 
"However... we object to the use of such an important international festival in staging a propaganda campaign." 
With a diverse multicultural population, including sizable Jewish and Arab groups, Toronto frequently sees public demonstrations of support for both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict. 
Earlier this year, the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees passed a resolution to boycott Israeli academic institutions, while "Israeli Apartheid Week", founded in Toronto in 2005, is held annually on several Canadian university campuses. 
In a blog posting last week, City to City festival programmer Cameron Bailey said he was attracted to Tel Aviv because "the films being made there explore and critique the city from many different perspectives". 
He also said the series was conceived independently and was not the object of pressure from any outside source.

<title>UN General Assembly President accuses U.S. of demonizing Iran</title>
<date>Wed Mar 18 05:31:19 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The outspoken president of the UN General Assembly on Tuesday accused the United States of demonizing Iran's president and criticized the International Criminal Court for issuing an arrest warrant for Sudan's leader for war crimes in Darfur.
Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, a Roman Catholic priest from Nicaragua with openly leftist views, also reiterated that the more he thinks about the conditions that Israel imposes on the Palestinians, the more he tends to think about apartheid.
During a wide-ranging press conference, d'Escoto insisted he wasn't being divisive or promoting his own agenda - but was just fulfilling his duty as president of the 192-member General Assembly to uphold the UN Charter and promote peace and non-violence.
Briefing reporters on his recent three-week trip that included a stop in Tehran, d'Escoto said he was struck by the great support and respect for Iran from its neighbors at a summit meeting of the Economic Cooperation Organization - a regional body founded in 1985 by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan - especially for helping to alleviate the plight of Afghan refugees in Iran.
"That was a very wonderful experience to see that, in contrast to the attitude that we find, sadly, here where we are," d'Escoto said.
"I don't think anyone can doubt that in our part of the world ... (President Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad has been demonized," he said. "The United States has been in the business of the demonization of people forever and the canonization of the worst of dictators.
D'Escoto singled out Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, Nicaragua's Anastasio Samoza and Chile's Augusto Pinochet. Asked whether he approved of Ahmadinejad saying he wants to wipe a UN member state - Israel - off the map, d'Escoto said if he said that, "it's lamentable," but he quickly added that words as such don't kill and it's the actions that have to be watched.
"I don't hate Israel, much less do I hate the Jewish people," d'Escoto added. "In fact they are very high on my list of people that I love."
But he said that won't keep him from criticizing Israeli actions, especially in the recent war in Gaza where some 1,400 Palestinians and just 13 Israelis were killed.
D'Escoto served as foreign minister in the 1980s during the rule of the Sandinistas, who aligned themselves with Fidel Castro and the Soviet Union. Since assuming the one-year General Assembly presidency in September, he has been a stern critic of the United States, and of Israel.
He criticized the United States on Tuesday for acting on its own rather than multilaterally as the UN Charter calls for, and singled out former President George W. Bush for going to war in Iraq in 2003 without Security Council approval and for then accusing the Sudanese government of committing genocide in Darfur.
"The United States dares to stick its tongue out to the Security Council and says you either give me the green light to commit the aggression that I want to commit, or I shall declare you obsolete, irrelevant," d'Escoto said.
Mark Kornblau, spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, when asked to comment on the criticism of the U.S., said: "It's hard to make sense of Mr. D'Escoto's increasingly bizarre statements."
D'Escoto called the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity unfortunate and lamentable because the African Union and the Arab League had asked the Security Council to delay the warrant for a year to pursue peace efforts in Darfur.
"It helps to deepen the perception that international justice is racist because this is the third time that you have something from the ICC, and for the third time it has to do with Africa," d'Escoto said.
Answering critics who said it's not his role to speak out against the court over the warrants for the Sudanese leader, d'Escoto noted that Bush first raised the issue of genocide in Darfur.
"That should tell you quite a bit already," he said. "Can you imagine (Chicago gangster) Al Capone phoning the police to say that somebody stole milk from the market? It's Al Capone standing up for uprightness."
D'Escoto said the United Nations needs the United States but it needs a United States with it, not against it, a United States committed to multilateralism, a United Nations committed to respecting the sovereign equality of all member states.
He said it was very good that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had raised the possibility of Iran attending a meeting on Afghanistan on March 31 in the Netherlands.
"If they're invited, they will participate ... that's what I gather," d'Escoto said.

<title>U.S. reconsiders boycott of Durban II anti-racism summit</title>
<date>Mon Apr 13 22:47:48 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
The Obama administration is reconsidering its planned boycott of a controversial United Nations racism conference that is deeply opposed by Israel and Jewish groups and will be attended by Iran's president, the State Department said late Monday.
In a move likely to upset its staunchest Mideast ally and its supporters, the department said the administration was pleased by a diplomatic push to revise an objectionable document that the meeting will adopt and suggested it could attend the meeting if the efforts succeed.
In February, after attending preparatory meetings for the follow-up conference, the Obama administration said it would not attend Durban II unless the meeting's final document was changed to drop references to Israel, defamation of religion and demands for reparations for slavery.
A State Department spokesman said Monday that there had been substantial improvements to the draft but that there were elements that continue to pose significant concerns, including the affirmation of the Durban declaration and a portion on incitement to religious hatred that the U.S. sees as suggested support for restrictions on freedom of expression.
The U.S. State Department later said in a statement, "We hope that these remaining concerns will be addressed, so that the United States can re-engage the conference process with the hope of arriving at a Conference document that we can support."
Israel and Canada already have announced they will boycott the meeting.
Israel, which was deeply concerned when the administration sent a delegation to the preparatory meeting, has lobbied hard for the U.S. to stay away from the conference.
Ahmadinejad to attend Durban 2 anti-racism conference
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will attend the United Nations anti-racism conference in Geneva in late April, Iran's state-run media reported Monday.
The IRNA website said Monday "the review conference is the follow-up to the 2001 First World Conference on Racism in South Africa which strongly condemned the racist policies of the Zionist regime."
Israel, Canada, and Italy have both decided to boycott the conference, while the United States is reportedly considering
The conference, to be held in Geneva next month, is a follow-up to the contentious 2001 conference in the South African city of Durban which was dominated by clashes over the Middle East and the legacy of slavery. 
The U.S. and Israel walked out midway through that eight-day meeting over a draft resolution that singled out Israel for criticism and likened Zionism - the movement to establish and maintain a Jewish state - to racism.
An original draft of the closing statement for the conference stated that Israel's policy in the Palestinian territories constitutes a "violation of international human rights, a crime against humanity and a contemporary form of apartheid." A later draft was released

<title>U.S. to boycott Durban 2 conference on racism</title>
<date>Fri Feb 27 21:30:44 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The United States will not attend a United Nations conference on racism that critics say will be a forum to criticize Israel, and will no longer participate in planning sessions for it, the State Department announced on Friday. 
The conference is a follow-up to the contentious 2001 conference in the South African city of Durban which was dominated by clashes over the Middle East and the legacy of slavery. The U.S. and Israel walked out midway through that eight-day meeting over a draft resolution that singled out Israel for criticism and likened Zionism - the movement to establish and maintain a Jewish state - to racism.
Israel and Canada have already announced that they will boycott the upcoming World Conference Against Racism in Geneva from April 20-25, known as Durban 2, but President Barack Obama's administration decided to assess the negotiations before making a decision on U.S. participation.
The decision to drop U.S. involvement comes one day before U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leaves on her first trip to the Middle East in her new capacity, including stops in Israel.
A U.S. delegation took part in negotiations this month on summit. Referring to the content of draft resolutions formulated during the preparations, the source said that during negotiations "a bad document became worse," prompting the U.S. to end its affiliation with the conference. 
The U.S. decided the final document that will be produced by the conference is "not salvageable," another official said.
"The document being negotiated has gone from bad to worse, and the current text of the draft outcome document is not salvageable," State Department spokesperson Robert Wood said. "As a result, the United States will not engage in further negotiations on this text, nor will we participate in a conference based on this text. A conference based on this text would be a missed opportunity to speak clearly about the persistent problem of racism."
"The United States remains open to a positive result in Geneva based on a document that takes a constructive approach to tackling the challenges of racism and discrimination," Wood said.
Critics of the April conference, say Arab nations will use it as a forum to bash Israel and charge that the draft document will limit freedom of religion and speech.
Last week, Haaretz learned that the draft resolutions for the conference branded Israel as an occupying state that carries out racist policies. They refer to "the plight of Palestinian refugees and other inhabitants of the Arab occupied territories," apparently meaning Israel itself. 
The senior UN source told Haaretz that the U.S. ended its contact with the nations that drafted the resolutions, which will be voted on during the summit. The Americans did not want a draft resolution reiterating the decisions of the first Durban summit, held in 2001, to be brought to a vote, the source said. 
They also insisted that no country would be specifically mentioned by name in any resolution and even objected to an initiative by Muslim countries to ratify a law banning criticism of any religion in the media, the source added. 
The 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in Durban was meant to lay down a blueprint for nations to address sensitive issues. 
Israel and the United States walked out in protest over a draft text branding Israel as a racist and apartheid state, language that was later dropped.
The State Department did say though that the U.S. plans to participate in this month's UN Human Rights Council in an observer status though it expressed its reservations over the body's frequent opprobrium of Israel.
"Our participation as an observer is a sign of the commitment of the Administration to advancing the cause of human rights in the multilateral arena," the State Department said. "We look forward to the help and cooperation of our friends and allies to ensure the Human Rights Council focuses on the pressing human rights concerns of our time."
Besides the Durban controvery, supporters of Israel will have their hands full. Pro-Palestinian activists plan on staging "Israel Apartheid Week" beginning Monday in New York. Among the prominent participants is Nir Harel, an Israeli member of Anarchists Against the Wall. Events will include "forums, films, cultural events and street protests."‬

<title>Anshel Pfeffer / Israeli and Jewish leaders tend to forgive 'our' racists</title>
<date>Fri May 28 00:52:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
The treasure trove of documents revealed by Sasha Polakow-Suransky in his new book on the secret relations between Israel and South Africa during the dark years of apartheid is fascinating and deeply troubling. But as much as he would like to convince us that they prove that then Defense Minister and now President Shimon Peres actually offered Pretoria Israeli nuclear weapons, there simply is no proof of that.
Polakow-Suransky's extrapolations between the different minutes and memos are convoluted and tenuous at best. There are much more plausible explanations to Peres' cryptic reference to "three sizes" of missile payloads, if that is indeed what he said in those secret meetings 35 years ago. You don't have to take my word for it. Professor Avner Cohen, the undisputed expert on Israel's nuclear capabilities and certainly no darling of the defense establishment for his efforts to scatter the clouds over Dimona, also dismisses the claims. He wrote this week that "there is no proof whatsoever that Israel ultimately officially OFFERED those weapons to SA. In fact, I know that Israel did not ... At the end of the day South Africa did not ask and Israel did not offer the 'correct payloads.' Israel did behave as a responsible nuclear state."
Professor Cohen is a brave researcher and writer with impeccable sources, and has never shied away from criticism of the nuclear program where it is due. Even before I read his judgment, the Polakow-Suransky theory simply did not make any sense to me. Shimon Peres went to such lengths over decades to built Israel's nuclear capability and safeguard it, that to picture him blithely offering this most valuable strategic asset to another country simply beggars belief.
But the justified outrage at this shoddy detail in Polakow-Suransky's book and the way in which The Guardian trumpeted it over its front page without a shred of skepticism, using it as proof that Israel's nuclear program was no different to that of Iran, just serves to deflect attention from the much more important and credible content of the book: The way in which successive Israeli governments dealt with an overtly racist regime, which shared many values and roots with Nazi Germany. This is not a new story of course, but the details of the shameful alliance in which the two countries developed numerous weapons systems together, usually with Israel supplying the knowhow, and its defense industry continued arming of South Africa's military, long after most western nations ceased doing so, are breathtaking.
I know all the excuses. An isolated and embattled country with limited resources cannot be too picky when it comes to choosing its allies. As the staunchly anti-communist Churchill said after war broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union, "If Hitler invaded Hell, I would at least make a favorable reference to the Devil in the House of Commons." But the ties with South Africa continued well into the 1980s, when Israel's strategic alliance with the United States was already well-established. Only in 1987 did Israel agree to join the sanctions on the apartheid state, and even that was after Yossi Beilin spent three years as director general of the Foreign Ministry trying to convince his boss, Peres, that Israel's policy was untenable. Old habits die hard.
Too many Israeli and Jewish leaders seem to have a disturbing tendency of forgiving, or at the very least condoning the actions of racists, as long as they are "our" racists. You can see that tendency at almost every level. The Israeli government resisted for decades any attempt to officially mark the Armenian genocide, for fear of harming the strategic alliance with the Turkish government. In the United States, the Anti-Defamation League eradicated any attempt to recognize the Armenian genocide within its own ranks. Supporting Israel's foreign policy was more important than keeping to its charter. This effort to cover up the genocide that inspired the Nazis,  (the quote "after all, who remembers the Armenians," is ascribed, perhaps apocryphally, to Hitler ) seems particularly ridiculous now that Turkey has become Iran's best friend in the region.
The Israeli right wing, from Benjamin Netanyahu downward and significant portions of the Jewish-American community, feel very comfortable cozying up to some of the most racist elements of the fundamental Christian movement in the United States. In return for their multimillion donations and political support in Washington, they conveniently overlook their belief that all the Jews who do not recognize Christ will be burned in Armageddon.
Support for Israel, and other political and diplomatic considerations, can always serve to whitewash racism and even anti-Semitism. The Jewish American establishment led by the Wiesenthal Center founder, Rabbi Marvin Hier, has clasped California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to its bosom, his problematic friendship with Kurt Waldheim buried deep in the past. American Jewish leaders have also defended senior Republican Party official, Fred Malek, despite the fact that he carried out an anti-Semitic witch-hunt in the Bureau of Labor Statistics on behalf of Richard Nixon.
British Jewish leaders, in their anxiety to rub shoulders with the new prime minister David Cameron, have forgiven his alliance in the European Parliament with the Polish Law and Justice Party, despite that party's umbilical ties with a virulently anti-Semitic Catholic movement. But then why should we blame Cameron, Israel also enjoys a "healthy" relationship with the same party, as senior Jewish figures in the Conservative Party have pointed out.
Many Jewish oligarchs and the Chief Rabbi of Russia, Berel Lazar, have steadfastly defended Vladimir's Putin's record, despite the increasing authoritarianism of the regime in Russia. "He is good for the Jews," is their constant refrain. But Russia's continuing ties with Iran, Syria and Hamas prove what a fickle friend it remains.
Ties with racists and dictators bring temporary strategic, political and financial benefits, but they are rarely justified by history. Israel may have never offered apartheid South Africa nuclear weapons, but its close relationship with Pretoria has tainted it for a generation and made it much harder to defend its record, even against absurd allegations.

<title>Canada students counter 'Israel Apartheid Week' with controversial campaign </title>
<date>Tue Mar 02 23:15:09 IST 2010</date>
<content>
A controversial pro-Israel campaign was launched in universities across Canada last week, in an attempt to counter the global pro-Palestinian campaign, "Israel Apartheid Week," launched on Sunday.
The campaign, named "Size Doesn't Matter," was initiated by the Canadian Federation of Jewish Students, and is taking place in 23 universities across Canada, according the official "Size Doesn't Matter" website.
An especially peppery video ad posted on the campaign website
Organizers said that the campaign was aimed at "highlighting the multitude of Israeli accomplishments and contributions," saying it was the "result of the combined efforts by the Canadian Federation of Jewish Students (CFJS), local Hillels, Jewish Student Associations, and Israel on Campus organizations across Canada."
The campaign website indicated that renowned speakers will be discussing Mideast-related issues, including Khaled Abu Toameh, Dr. Joel Kotek, Dr. Mohammed Wattad, and Ismael Khaldi.
"We are very excited about this campaign," said Rebecca Cherniak, Israel Affairs Chair for the Canadian Federation of Jewish Students.
"On many Canadian campuses, Israel is often vilified by anti-Israel proponents. The "Size Doesn't Matter" campaign will showcase an Israel that many students have never seen before," Cherniak said.

<title>Diaspora Jews beware: Stay away from bigots, no matter how friendly they seem</title>
<date>Tue Jun 29 16:38:00 IDT 2010</date>

Israel needs friends in Europe, but there are some friends that it could do without.
In June, the English Defence League, a thuggish anti-Muslim group known for its raucous (and sometimes violent) street protests, launched a Jewish division, attracting at least a handful of Jews among the 500 fans on its “Jewish Division” Facebook page.
The EDL had previously brandished Israeli flags at demonstrations to taunt its Muslim opponents, and even announced its intent to join a pro-Israel rally organized by Britain’s Zionist Federation following the recent Gaza flotilla crisis. (The rally’s organizers distanced themselves from the EDL, which has been condemned by mainstream Jewish communal groups; ultimately, EDL members weren’t much in evidence at the rally.)
While the EDL may be a fringe group, its embrace of Israel activism is part of a growing trend. Over the past few years, a string of politicians and factions on Europe’s far right, particularly those with anti-Muslim agendas, have taken to expressing strong support for the Jewish state.
The most prominent example is Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who led his Freedom Party to stunning success in Holland’s recent national elections, more than doubling its number of seats to become the third-largest party in parliament.
While Holland’s mainstream parties talked about the economy, Wilders campaigned on an explicitly anti-Islam platform. He has called for a ban on the Quran (which he calls a “fascist book”), an immediate end to Muslim immigration to Holland and a special tax on women who wear headscarves.
At the same time, Wilders is a flamboyant philosemite, who is passionate in his support for Israel — recently, for example, deriding critics of Israel’s flotilla raid as “wolves” who are “howling in the woods.” Israel, he says repeatedly, is the West’s most important bulwark against jihadism. 
Wilders’s brand of politics holds particular appeal in a country that is under considerable demographic pressure from its growing Muslim immigrant population. While Muslims form just 6% of Holland’s population, according to Statistics Netherlands, they are a much larger presence in major cities: In Amsterdam they are 24% of residents; in The Hague, Rotterdam and Utrecht they are more than 13%. Many of the country’s non-Muslim residents feel that their own, liberal way of life is under threat, particularly since the 2004 murder of filmmaker Theo Van Gogh by an Islamic extremist.Holland’s mainstream political parties have struggled to assuage these concerns, hampered in part by a hesitance to talk honestly about the repercussions of Muslim immigration out of fear of being seen as bigots. Wilders has no such compunctions.
Similarly, the EDL — formed last year after an Islamist protest against British troops returning home from Iraq — has capitalized upon the perception that it is taboo to raise questions about Islamic extremism and immigration in polite society.
While more straight-talk about immigration and extremism would be welcome in both countries, Wilders and the EDL go much further. Though both claim otherwise, they seem unable (or unwilling) to distinguish between Islamists — radicals with a political agenda — and plain old Muslims. On a continent in which a large Muslim presence is now a fact of life, such sweeping antagonism does nothing to solve real problems and serves only to inflame interreligious and interethnic tensions.
Observers believe that Wilders didn’t actually do any better among Dutch Jews than he did among the general population, notwithstanding his outspoken support for Israel.
Still, facing rising hostility toward Israel in Europe and anti-Semitic violence perpetrated by elements within the Muslim community, some European Jews may be tempted to reciprocate the far-right’s embrace. When it comes to the far-right, however, Jews have plenty of reasons to be wary.For starters, it’s worth recalling that those on the far-right often have their own — usually far-from-admirable — motives for wrapping themselves in the Israeli flag.
Last year, for instance, Nick Griffin, leader of the British National Party (which until this past February only accepted whites as members), boasted on prime-time television that his party was the only one that “stood foursquare behind Israel’s right to deal with Hamas terrorists” during Operation Cast Lead.
This was, presumably, part of his ongoing effort to gain electoral respectability by distancing himself and his party from their history of anti-Semitism. (Griffin once called the Shoah the “HoloHoax.”)Meanwhile, the EDL’s interest in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems to be mostly about goading its Muslim foes.
Granted, there are distinctions that can be drawn regarding motives. Wilders’s affection for Israel seems to be sincere. As a teen he worked for two years on a moshav, and he claims to have visited Israel 40 times since.
At the end of the day, however, for Israel and its supporters, these are distinctions that shouldn’t make much of a difference. Israel is currently battling systematic attempts to delegitimize it.
A favored tactic of its opponents is to paint Israel as a racist, apartheid country that discriminates against its Arab citizens and Palestinian neighbors. Israel simply cannot afford to be linked to real bigots, no matter how friendly they appear to be.

The King of Oil: The Secret Lives of Marc Rich, by Daniel AmmannSt. Martin's Press, 320 pages, $27
Is Marc Rich a brazen tax evader and a traitor to his adoptive nation, the United States? Or is this Jewish trader extraordinaire merely an adherent of Ayn Rand-style capitalism and an honest broker who adhered to the letter of the law, aiding whole nations and also law enforcement agencies (at least when the matter didn't pertain directly to him )?
Reading "The King of Oil" will leave you none the wiser about whether Rich technically broke any laws in the United States. The prosecutors insist to this day that he did; he disagrees, along with some top American officials. Daniel Ammann lays out the facts in masterly form and shreds the prosecution, charging that it chose to ignore key arguments in Rich's favor. But even after lengthy interviews with the man himself, his prosecutors and his friends and family, Ammann can offer no conclusion about the justice of the dogged prosecution of the commodities trader who reinvented the oil market and rescued Jamaica, South Africa and Israel.
So you will have to decide for yourself. Reading this book, you will be widely informed. Yet any judgment you reach will be based on no more than your personal ethics. Your reaction to Marc Rich's story will be as emotional as that of the U.S. law enforcers who in 1983 charged him with 51 crimes, including tax evasion, racketeering, conspiracy and trading with the enemy, charges that could have carried up to 325 years in prison. Or you may believe him when says, "I am innocent." They overreacted, Rich charges.
To this day Rich, once the world's most successful commodities trader and inventor of the spot oil market, remains in exile in Switzerland even after his controversial presidential pardon from Bill Clinton.
With crystal-clear writing that avoids the distraction of maudlinism, Ammann, the business editor of the Swiss weekly magazine Weltwoche, draws a timeline helpfully studded with sub-heads that serve as signposts through the convoluted story. But even though Rich submitted to multiple interviews with the author, glimpses into his soul are rare, and the legality of his actions remains unclear, or certainly, open to different interpretations. Rich is an enigmatic man and remains so, and Ammann's promise to unveil his "Secret Lives" is not delivered.
Marcell David Reich was born not of one era, but into the history of Jewish persecution over the ages. As a child his father, David Reich, had fled pogroms in his native Galicia, for Frankfurt. As an adult, David, a merchant, abandoned Germany with his wife Paula, heeding the lessons of generations -- "It's starting again." In this case, "it" was the rise of Hitler and Nazism. 
Marcell was born in Antwerp in 1934. When "it started again," the family escaped to France, in 1940. As the Nazi scourge started to spread across Europe, they abandoned Marseilles and caught a ship to Australia. But the ship was stopped and the Reichs found themselves interned instead in Morocco. In 1941, David's sister, a naturalized American, managed to bring the family to the United States.
Understanding what made Marc Rich who he is therefore requires an understanding of Jewish history and of World War II, a litany of horrors that Ammann describes concisely and unemotionally. Even as the story avoids dramatics, we learn of the shifting land beneath Rich's feet during his formative years: In the United States, the boy renamed Marc Rich changed schools almost on a yearly basis. From New York the family moved to Philadelphia, Kansas City, then back to New York, where they lived in several locations. Rich recalls attending 12 schools in as many years. He became a loner, an outsider, left to his own devices, and he developed a mechanism for handling defeats: "You cry a little and then you move on," he told Ammann.
In his travels as a lad, Rich developed a talent for languages, and could speak English, German and French. Yet later in life, he remained silent as the media attacked him, eschewing defense of his most important asset: his good name. He was skewered by a dilemma: For a trader, reputation is everything. But the best traders don't talk. They stay on the sidelines, explains Ammann, and Rich was as secretive as they get.
Reinventing the world of oil
As the child of a trader fast on his feet, Rich was itching from the get-go to start a life in business in his new home. At 19, he left New York University to intern, at $40 a week, in the mailroom of Philipp Brothers, then the world's largest commodities trading company. He was a hard worker in a cutthroat environment and he stood out. Promoted to the traffic department, he learned to be a commodities trader from scratch: "I handled shipments of merchandise and metals, covered insurance, and arranged for payments with letters of credit," Rich told the author.
His subsequent rise at Philipp Brothers was rapid. Rich pulled off a coup while still a junior trader: "creating a market," in his case in mercury, in the mid-1950s. He predicted a surge in demand for mercury, located sources of the liquid metal and developed a network of buyers and sellers. When indeed demand for mercury spiked, as he had predicted, Philipp Brothers made a killing. "To see the opportunity is the most important thing as a trader," Rich says, and by all accounts he was a master of the art. Soon sent to Bolivia for six months to be acting manager of the company's regional office, Rich learned Spanish and the art of doing business in politically volatile countries, both talents that would stand him in good stead.
Early on, Rich formulated the guideline that establishing long-term relationships based on trust, with individuals and whole regimes, supersedes short-term gains. One long-term relationship he forged while at Philipp Brothers was with Fidel Castro's regime. Philipp management was horrified by the Communists' nationalization of mines and industries, but Rich, 24, saw opportunity. He flew to Cuba in 1958, shortly after the revolution, and spent six months negotiating with the new leaders. Another guiding principle was born: Negotiations can only succeed when both parties profit. He walked out with long-term contracts for the island country's minerals. Did he admire the Communists? Not at all. "It was so bad for people," he says with his usual brevity. So why deal with them? It was just business, he explains. His opponents find that detached stance amoral, at best.
Neutral or amoral?
The Cuba deal propelled Rich skyward at Philipp Brothers and he spent years globetrotting. In 1964 he moved to Madrid. "It was love at first sight," writes Ammann.
General Franco's Spain had supported Nazi Germany and was anti-Israeli, Ammann points out. Yet in life as in business, it seems Rich did not judge. He lived, and he did business, leaving politics to others. He spoke Spanish with his family, not that he saw them much -- workaholic is a mild term for Rich, though this did not cause his much-publicized split from his first wife, Denise, later on, or from his second wife, Giselle, who had played a role in his first divorce.
Recognized by his peers as "a genius in the metals market," Rich turned his attention to oil. He is credited with inventing the oil spot market (in which a commodity is bought or sold for immediate or imminent delivery ).
Until 1970, oil was not traded on the open market. Rich thought it should be. The oil embargo in 1967, the first time that key oil-producing Arab nations threatened to stop selling petroleum to countries supporting Israel, created opportunity. The Arab nations might declare that they would boycott anybody connected to Israel, but if they sold their oil to an independent trader, who then sold it to Israel's friends or even Israel itself, well, that wasn't their fault, was it? In other words, an independent trader could serve all -- for a price of course.
The market then was dominated by the "Seven Sisters" oil companies, which bought 95 percent of the volume of the producing countries, then sold the fuel onwards. Rich wanted to buy directly from the producers.
In 1971 those producing countries were hurting from the weakness of the dollar, following president Richard Nixon's decision to have the United States abandon the gold standard. Their response was to nationalize their oil industries. Then they bogged down. "They didn't have the marketing knowhow, the established distribution channels, contacts to the refineries," Ammann writes. Rich realized they'd need traders, and mediators, like him.
He knew how to trade, but to handle logistics, he roped in Philipp Brothers colleague Pincus Green, a genius said to have a photographic memory. "At any given moment, Green always knew who was offering the best shipping rates or where a shipment was currently located during transport," Ammann wrote. Together they would revolutionize the global commodities trade, changing the way oil is traded forever.
After 20 years, in 1974, Rich walked out of Philipp Brothers over a pay dispute, taking Green and others with him. They formed Marc Rich + Co, a partnership based on raw talent, aggressive tactics, long-term relations based on trust, and a readiness to assume risks that other companies wouldn't dream of undertaking.
If Marc Rich + Co flourished, it was in part because it traded with pariahs such as Fidel Castro's Cuba and apartheid South Africa. Ever the business visionary, Rich had a knack for arranging transactions between "improbable" partners. For example, through him, Israel purchased oil from the ayatollahs of Iran.
The ayatollahs abided by contracts that had been signed by the Shah before his overthrow, in 1978. How did Rich get them to agree to that? "His laconic answer helps to explain why traders such as Rich exist in the first place and why they are in such great demand. 'We performed a service for them,' Rich explains. 'We bought the oil, we handled the transport, and we sold it. They couldn't do it themselves, so we were able to do it.'" Oh.
Big in Tehran
The fact that Rich did business with Iran even after extremists seized the American embassy in Tehran in 1979 was one of the reasons Rudolph Giuliani, then U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York, and others bayed for his blood. In 1983 Rich fled the United States. He was never to return.
Rich insists he obeyed the letter of the law. He carried out the transactions through his Swiss company, not any American entity. "[The hostage crisis] was a political development which did not affect the business," Rich told Ammann. "It was very unpleasant and tragic for the hostages and humiliating for the Americans, but it didn't affect the business." Asked if he feels any remorse about dealing with dictators and ugly regimes, he says, "No, no."
Rich is a man of contradictions. A handsome man, as pictured on the cover with a Havana cigar in his mouth, he is described as brilliant and courageous -- as well as modest and, mainly, understated. He talks about money, but there's more to him than that. "Israel's salvation came from none other than Marc Rich -- a fact that has remained largely unknown to this day," Ammann quotes Avner Azulay, former Mossad agent and longtime right-hand man to Rich, whose instincts and experience helped Rich evade the multi-agency task force chasing him. For 20 years, starting in 1973, Rich would be Israel's most important oil supplier. "It was perhaps the ideal trade for Rich," Ammann writes. "He earned a lot of money while at the same time helping guarantee Israel's survival." Guess where the oil came from.
Trading with the enemy aside, America's prosecutors also wanted him for evading taxes on gains that Rich argues were made legitimately. Ammann does not answer the question of whether his financial manipulations were licit or not. Why didn't he return to face trial? The prosecutors were seeking 325 years in prison plus financial penalties. "Marc was thoroughly demonized," says his lawyer Robert Fink: He felt he couldn't get a fair trial.
As to how he succeeded in keeping clear of the U.S. agents who were effectively attempting to kidnap him, there were evidently leaks from the American side over the years that also helped Rich evade capture. There were people on his side. Not least, ultimately, was his ex-wife Denise, who was persuaded to plead for the controversial pardon Rich received in 2001 from president Bill Clinton on his last day in office, after 17 years on the lam. Israeli contacts may have been crucial too. Calls came from Ehud Barak and Shimon Peres, among others.
Long-term relationships and loyalty did well by Marc Rich. Some American prosecutors remain convinced he didn't return the favor. That is precisely why Rich will never step foot in the United States again.
He had hoped Clinton's pardon would pave the way for his return. Six weeks after the pardon, the New York tax assessor sent Rich a bill for $138 million. He negotiated a settlement, though he won't say for how much, and contests owing so much as a cent. Rich understood the way the wind was blowing.
The pardon boomeranged, Ammann writes, ever cautious in his choice of words: "He had hoped to be able to liberate himself from many of the false accusations. He had hoped he would be given the freedom to return unmolested to the United States ... The reality was the exact opposite ... Marc Rich had hoped the pardon would allow him to regain his reputation. Now he had again lost control over his own name. Once and for all."
Rich was not only the world's greatest, if most controversial trader, he was also a philanthropist, secretly (and otherwise ) donating vast sums of money through more than one foundation. After his second daughter Gabrielle died of leukemia in 1996, he set up a foundation to find a cure to the disease. He has contributed to science, medicine, culture and much more, and in 2007 was awarded honorary doctorates from Bar-Ilan University and the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev for his philanthropic work.
So is Marc Rich an unethical man making amoral choices?
"A trader who had dealt in virtually every metal for Marc Rich illustrated [the ethics] to me quite clearly. I was speaking to him about commodities trading in a bar in a wintry midtown Manhattan. 'Ethics.' He laughed. Then he pointed at my Diet Coke. 'Your coke can is made of aluminum. The bauxite that is needed to make it probably comes from Guinea-Conakry. A terrible dictatorship, believe me ... The oil that is used to heat this room probably comes from Saudi Arabia. These good friends of the USA hack the hands off thieves just like in the Middle Ages. Your cellphone? Without coltan there wouldn't be any cellphones. Let's not pretend. Coltan was used to finance the civil war in the Congo.'" If Marc Rich is guilty of amoral trading, then so, evidently, are we all.

<title>How European Zionism has corrupted 'Jewish Arabs'</title>
<date>Sun Nov 14 02:23:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Carmel Shama was fed up, so the lawmaker decided it was time to reconnect with his ethnic roots. Responding to all the confusion over his identity, he asked the Interior Ministry to add an appendage to his name so that he could officially become MK "Shama-Hacohen."
Many people had mistakenly taken him for a Druze. Indeed, when he visited Auschwitz, MKs praised him for showing "solidarity with the Jewish people." He has also frequently been asked to voice his opinion "on Arab matters as a member of that community." Apparently, that was a bit too much for him to handle.
Here, then, is a blatant example of how "Ashkenazi Zionism," from Europe, has corrupted the souls of those referred to as "members of the Mizrahi group," from the Middle East and North Africa.
It bears noting that the original reason Israelis were required to list their national ethno-religious identities on official documents was to help Ashkenazi institutions distinguish between Jews and Arabs, since many Jews who came from Arab countries had Arab names. At first there were only two categories listed: Jews and Arabs. At a later stage, "Druze" was added as a separate category.
Because Interior Minister Eli Yishai refused to implement a High Court ruling to list Israelis who have undergone Reform conversions as Jews, in recent years, information on nationality appears merely as a series of asterisks on identity cards. But other identifying marks that distinguish between "Jews" and Arabs are still there.
Take, for example, a name like "Yosef Hadad." Based on the name alone, it is impossible to know if the bearer of this name is an Arab or Jew. Trained policemen, however, can instantly spot the difference. To promote the "worthy" goal of separating Arab and Jewish citizens, officials at the Interior Ministry were willing to waive the requirement to list the name of the "Jewish grandfather." So supposing that this Yosef Hadad is a Jew, his grandfather's name will not appear on his identity card. But if he is an Arab, his grandfather's name will be displayed proudly. Isn't that a rather elegant form of apartheid registration?
As years went by, nationalist tensions motivated many "Jewish Arabs" to try to distance themselves from their ethnic identity. Yet how could they when their outward appearances, musical tastes, favorite foods and lifestyles were so much a part of the cultural milieu from which they emerged?
The only way for them to make this break was to adopt conspicuous Jewish religious identity markers, prominent among them skullcaps and Magen David pendants. Indeed, the extent to which Magen David chains dangle on their necks and skullcaps cover their heads corresponds directly to the extent that they deny their Arab ethno-nationality. The most grotesque expression of such denial is the Hasidic clothing and hats worn by Shas members. To put it another way, a hat burns on the head of every self-denier.
Ethnic separation has, and continues to be, alive and kicking among citizens of this country. MK Shama-Hacohen can take it easy though. We can even seize the opportunity to give him a gift of two Druze MKs, MK Ayoob Kara  (Likud ) and MK Hamad Amar  (Yisrael Beiteinu ) - who together sound more hard-line than Avigdor Lieberman and Rabbi Eliezer Shach put together. In fact, if they listed "Hacohen" next to their surnames, they could kill two birds with one stone: first, they would stop shaming the Druze; second, the name change would drive MK Shama-Hacohen crazy.

<title>Jewish state won't exist without a Palestinian counterpart</title>
<date>Tue Apr 13 02:46:18 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
In an column headlined "Crime Without Punishment" (Haaretz, April 6) Moshe Arens proposes a two-pronged policy for dealing with Israel's Arabs: an uncompromising fight against the Islamic Movement's radical northern branch and strenuous action to integrate the minority into the fabric of Israeli society. In innumerable other columns, Arens has voiced his total opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state.  
Calls for integration of Israel's Arabs have become increasing popular recently, peaking in the "economic leadership bus tour" of the Arab sector organized by President Shimon Peres and a meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Arab and Jewish industrialists.  
Other right-wingers, like Minister Benny Begin, have also expressed support for the integration and equality of Israeli Arabs. Even though this trend has appeared late, it is of course welcome. But there can be no integration and equality for Israel's Arabs as long as there is no Palestinian state.  
Even if the government were to consistently implement all of the proposals - raising education levels, increasing employment, improving infrastructure, offering incentives for military or national service, and an emergency plan for the Negev Bedouin - it would at the same time continue to function according to the conflict-management ideology that Arens and Begin and others advocate, consistently thwarting the chances for the foundation of a Palestinian state.  
Such a two-pronged policy is doomed to fail for two main reasons. Firstly, Israel's Palestinian citizens, the people known as "Israeli Arabs," feel a sense of common destiny with their brethren who are subject to Israeli military occupation.  
Many have relatives living over the Green Line. Every day they envision the occupying forces repressing those relatives. Is there any chance that those Palestinians who are Israeli citizens will willingly integrate in the society that maintains said occupation and repression? Would they want to serve in the army that implements these policies? Even if the state makes an honest effort to integrate them, would they be able to be an integral part of it and what it represents?  
The second reason is a result of the effects that the prolonged conflict with the Palestinians has had on Israeli Jewish society, making large sectors of it regard the entire Palestinian people as an enemy. They are unable and unwilling to distinguish between those who are Israeli citizens and those living on the other side of the Green Line.  
Everyday reality in the territories legitimizes violence, repression of freedom of expression, and racism toward Palestinians. This is evident even in the Knesset, where bizarre measures are enacted to prohibit Arabs from commemorating their personal and national disaster, which took the form of the loss of their homes and communities. The Knesset also gives legal validity to measures that bar Arabs from living in Israeli communities. The amendment to the law that institutionalizes discrimination against Arab citizens in admission to communities, thereby ensuring the implementation of an intentional policy of apartheid, illustrates the rise in steps that have been taken to block Arab integration into the fabric of Israeli society.  
As long as we continue to prolong and intensify the conflict with the Palestinians, we can never create a reality of integration and equality.  
The policy of thwarting progress toward a Palestinian state is leading us steadily and directly toward a bi-national state and indirectly toward the end of Israel as a Jewish entity. Anyone who wants a state that is both a home for the Jewish people and a democracy has to fill both of those elements with content, and activate a different two-pronged policy: For Israel to be the Jewish national homeland, we must act to establish a Palestinian state, and for Israel to be a democracy, we must act to integrate and bestow equality upon the Palestinians who are Israeli citizens.  
The writer is co-chairman of the Abraham Fund Initiatives, which advances coexistence and equality between Arabs and Jews in Israel.

<title>Montreal Jews fear 'gang atmosphere' amid rise in anti-Semitic incidents</title>
<date>Wed May 05 12:14:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 
Many in Montreal's Orthodox Jewish community say they are afraid to leave their homes, due to the "gang atmosphere" that has taken over their neighborhood amid renewed anti-Semitic activity.The Chabad community in the city's Côte des Neiges district has experienced a number of violent incidences against it over the past few weeks, including the mugging of a visibly pregnant woman.
In addition, swastikas have been sprayed in at least three locations in the Montreal suburb of Outremont – home to a large segment of Hasidic Jews who wear traditional garb.
According to B’nai Brith Canada, which compiles the country’s figures on anti-Semitic incidents, reports of vandalism targeting Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses have accelerated rate in the last month.
"Some community members now reportedly think twice before they leave their homes. The ongoing fear and intimidation suffered by our community is an unacceptable situation in a free and democratic society like Quebec," a spokesperson for the Quebec branch of B’nai Brith said.
“There have also been and anti Semitic slurs in educational and workplace settings and web-based hate activity is also on the increase,” the spokesperson added.In March, the Ahavas Yisroel Viznitz synagogue in Outremont was broken into and two swastikas were drawn inside the synagogue. Vandals also threw prayer shawls and holy books onto the floor.
The rabbi of the synagogue met with police following that incident, but the perpetrators have still not been found.Rabbi Mendel Marasow, executive director of Beth Rivkah Academy in Côte des Neiges, told a local paper. “I live in the area and if I compare the situation now to five years ago there is a serious problem.“There is a gang atmosphere, with tough individuals walking the streets. It is uncomfortable and unsafe out there. Is it anti Semitic? Listen, all I can say is that Jews make good targets.”One local Jewish café owner who had a swastika painted on the sidewalk in front of his business said he was worried about the “media attention” being given to anti-Semitic incidents.“The Jewish community in Outremont has been getting a lot of media attention,” he told the Jewish Tribune. “I don’t want to see these incidents get too much publicity because it is only going to stir things up more. I did not even report this. Someone else did."Quebec is the latest region to fall prey to Canada’s growing anti-Semitism, registering the largest rise in incidents in a city over the course of the year - 373 incidents in 2009, compared to 245 in 2008.  The province holds 90,000 Jews - around a quarter of Canada’s Jewish community.In total, 1,264 incidents were reported in Canada throughout 2009, representing a 12% increase over the 1,135 cases in 2008, and a more than five-fold increase in incidents over the past decade. Last year there were 884 cases of harassment, 348 of vandalism and a doubling from 2008 in the incidents of violence to 32.. The anti-Semitic daubing seen in Montreal is nothing new in Canada. Calgary, Toronto, Oshawa, Woodstock, and Barrie have recently seen anti Semitic incidents including swastikas and slogans, such as "Kill Jews" and "six million more," spray-painted on Jewish community property, community centers, Holocaust memorials, Jewish-owned residential property and vehicles.B'nai Brith's audit into anti Semitic incidents identified “anti-Israel agitators” fuelled by opposition to Operation Cast Lead as the trigger for the spike in attacks.“Anti-Israel agitators, far-left-wing groups, and more recently Islamists, have latched onto Nazi motifs and age old anti-Jewish stereotypes, in an attempt to bolster their campaigns against the Jewish State, while the far-right-wing camp has eagerly embraced anti-Israel propaganda to give an updated appearance to its traditional hate material.”According to Frank Dimant, Executive Vice President of B’nai Brith Canada, “Anti Semitism is a serious and ongoing problem here in Canada. We have encountered everything from harassment and vandalism to physical assaults on individuals. "B’nai Birth’s community Anti-Hate Hotline is available 24-hours a day, seven days a week, to provide assistance and consultation but the organization is apprehensive about whether they are investigated as hate crimes. “We hope that the law enforcement officials across the nation investigate these crimes as hate-crimes from the outset – hesitation to designate as a hate crime is simply unacceptable.   We also urge that these crimes are treated seriously, and that proper resources are dedicated to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice," said Dimant.Although vandalism causes on-going fear in the street, the theme of anti-Israel agitation has reached boiling point, particularly on Campuses.  This came to a head three weeks ago after an alleged machete attack on pro-Israel students. Two Ottawa students, both well-known for their pro-Israel views, were assaulted when they left a local lounge in the early hours of the morning, by a large group of anti-Israel agitators, one of whom was wielding a machete.The Jewish student, who along with his friend was called numerous derogatory and anti Semitic slurs during the assault, was a local organizer of B’nai Brith’s recent Imagine With Us pro-Israel campus initiative – an initiative which was banned by York University, a university which last year saw Jewish Hillel students verbally abused by an anti-Israel group while trying to convene a press conference.Actions like this are leading to calls for a ban on anti-Israel campaigns on campus, such as those witnessed during Israel Apartheid Week.

<title>Pro-Israel groups face off with campus 'apartheid week'</title>
<date>Sun Mar 07 18:34:04 IST 2010</date>
<content>
"Do you suffer from ANIS?"
That's ANti-ISrael Fixation Syndrome, according to a caustic poster produced by one pro-Israel group in response to Israel Apartheid Week, a global pro-Palestinian event that began on March 1 and featured events on some 14 university campuses across the United States.
The poster showed a drawing of a human posterior and a list of symptoms, asking readers if they, "Project a bloated sense of victimization?" or "Ignore the persecution of non-Arabs in Arab countries?"
The poster, which has appeared around campus at the University of California, Berkeley and is being made available to other schools, was produced by BlueStarPR, an affiliate member of the Israel on Campus Coalition (ICC). It is one of a variety of disparate responses to Apartheid Week being offered by the member organizations of the ICC, a Hillel-sponsored coordinating body of pro-Israel campus organizations, even as the coalition itself advises against directly engaging Apartheid Week and its supporters.
"Israel Apartheid Week is a tired retread at this point," said Stephen Kuperberg, the ICC's executive director. "Rather than throw a spotlight on the lunatic fringe, we would rather have a coordinated approach to promoting Israel in a positive way."
Apartheid Week, whose name implies a moral equivalence between Israel and apartheid South Africa, supports the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, which aims to discredit Israel in the international community and has raised serious concern within the Jewish community. The Week, now in its sixth year, takes place around the same time each year and focuses in particular on college campuses. Speakers at campus Apartheid Week events include Israel critics Norman Finkelstein and Noam Chomsky, as well as anti-Israel boycott advocate Omar Barghouti.
A spokesman for one ICC member organization questioned the usefulness of direct efforts to counter Israel Apartheid Week's campaign.
"Putting out 10 reasons why Israel is not an apartheid state when the Israeli defense minister said in the last several weeks that Israel is in danger of becoming an apartheid regime may not be successful," said Noam Shelef, strategic communications director of Americans for Peace Now and its liaison with the ICC. Shelef was referring to a February 2 speech in which Ehud Barak said that Israel "will be an apartheid state" if no peace deal is reached and Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza do not gain citizenship rights in their own state.
"I think we need to have a real discussion about what the policies are that are problematic - that put Israel in danger of becoming an apartheid state," Shelef said.
But StandWithUs, another ICC member, took a different stand, in favor of confronting the Apartheid Week advocates directly and going on the offensive. A booklet it produced to help pro-Israel activists respond to Israel Apartheid Week bore an image on its cover of Neda Soltani, the Iranian woman whose videotaped death at a Tehran election protest last June was seen worldwide. The booklet argues that the term "apartheid" should be applied not to Israel, but rather to Muslim societies in the Middle East, based on what it describes as gender inequality, political repression and discrimination against gay men and non-Muslims in Saudi Arabia and other Arab states.
"Unfortunately, the [Palestinian Authority] still uses many of the apartheid practices described in this booklet on their own people," the booklet states.
"I personally don't think that's helpful at all," said Yahel Matalon, a student at Barnard College and a leader of a J Street-affiliated student group at Columbia University called Just Peace, of the StandWithUs document. Referring to the abuses by Arab states described in the booklet, Matalon said: "Okay, so that's horrible, but that doesn't excuse the treatment of Palestinians in Israel today. If what we're talking about is peace in Israel, it doesn't matter what Saudi Arabia is doing."
StandWithUs CEO Roz Rothstein disagreed, arguing that abuses in Muslim countries are germane because they generally escape notice. "What you've got is Islamist governments in the Middle East that are actually operating in legally sanctioned apartheid, and nobody's talking about it," she said. "Students, if they want to fight for human rights, should be fighting for these issues of the real apartheid today."
One student who distributed the StandWithUs brochure at Columbia University's campus March 1 said that some students objected to the brochure.
"There were some reactions from people that that wasn't the right message to send, but that the right message would be focusing on the vibrant multicultural society that Israel has built," said Jacob Shapiro, a member of the Columbia pro-Israel group LionPAC. Shapiro added that the brochure was one of many that his group handed out.
Like the students who confronted Shapiro, Kuperberg supports efforts that counter Israel Apartheid Week indirectly by portraying Israel in a better light. He praised one such program, dubbed Israel Peace Week, founded this year by graduates of Aish HaTorah?s Hasbara Fellowships and funded by small grants from a number of Zionist groups. The program runs concurrently with Apartheid Week on what organizers claim to be more than 40 campuses in North America and Australia.
Organizers of Israel Peace Week offered prepackaged programs to participating campuses. One is a "cafe poetry night to promote democracy and peace in Israel," according to Anna Richlin, a sophomore at the University of Rochester and a co-founder of Israel Peace Week. Students involved in putting on the night are given a packet of poems to be read during the event. In an e-mail, Richlin explained how one of the poems, titled "From Haifa to Near Faraway Cairo," promoted democracy and peace: "This poem demonstrates how Israel is a peaceful Democratic nation as it demonstrates how the Jew [in the poem] is yearning for the time when she and the Egyptian [in the poem] could be together as friends in peace. This portrays how Israel has [established] a foundation for peace, yet she has no partner for peace."
J Street and its student movement, which is not currently a member of the ICC, published a joint statement condemning Israel Apartheid Week. "Few events better exemplify the counterproductive polarization on campus than 'Israel Apartheid Week,'" the statement read. "J Street and J Street U are committed to an open, honest and civilized debate that allows students to work constructively towards adopting positions and actions that can help resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
J Street U offered no new materials or programs to counter Apartheid Week, but it did reiterate an older program titled "Invest, Don't Divest," which is designed to encourage donations to a Palestinian micro-finance group.

<title>South African Jewish community prepares for homecoming at World Cup </title>
<date>Fri Jun 04 02:02:16 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 Hundreds of Israeli soccer fans who are expected to descend upon South Africa for this month's World Cup - including more than a few expats from Israel - will have a chance to see much more than just soccer. The Israeli embassy in Pretoria and the local Jewish community are making extensive preparations to entertain the hordes of Jewish visitors from all over the world on the sidelines of global soccer's most important event, which starts next Friday. 
 The South African Jewish Board of Deputies has created a website that besides information about security, kosher food and religious services, lists a number of places of Jewish interest  (www.jewish2010.com ). Chabad will provide various hospitality services in "welcome centers" in three cities, while Cape Town's Astra community center will host special buffet lunches with a soccer theme on or close to matches played in the city. 
 Visitors interested in "sightseeing with a difference" are invited to contact country communities' "traveling rabbi" Moshe Silberhaft, who helps former South Africans trace their family roots, or to visit a township development program with prominent South African sports journalist Graeme Joffe. 
 Tararam, the South Africa-Israel Culture Fund, will hold a film festival in conjunction with the Israeli embassy featuring eight Israeli movies, an exhibition called "The Story of Israel" and the Israeli play "The Time Keepers" in numerous venues across the country. 
 "You don't have to be a soccer fan to want to go to the World Cup - it's an amazing event and I'm sure South Africa 2010 is going to be a fantastic experience," said Jonathan Pollen, a Johannesburg-born Jerusalemite. The 52-year-old software engineer, who has tickets for nine World Cup games, already has one World Cup under his belt: the 2006 tournament hosted by Germany. "The minute I knew it was going to be in South Africa I planned to go back for the World Cup," he told Anglo File, adding he will lodge in his mother's apartment in Johannesburg. Most Israeli South Africans interviewed for this article said they would stay with family or friends. 
 Besides catering to tourists who visit the country for the first time, the South African Jewish community is making a special effort to welcome home emigres. Many Jewish schools are hosting reunions and other events for their former students. The King David Schools Foundation - the alumni network of King David and Hillel schools - for example, will offer accommodation, day trips and a "mega reunion party" for alumni. 
 "We have asked local former Davidians to open their homes to other Davidians coming home for the World Cup," said Ronel Zeff, the foundation's marketing manager. "We often find that when expat South Africans come home, they want to come see the schools they attended, see how they've changed, show them to their families," he added. The June 10 reunion party in Johannesburg for King David and Hillel alumni, to which the general public is invited, will feature games, food and several performances by Jewish-South African bands. Zeff said he expects some 1,000 people to attend the event. 
 "Most members of the South African Jewish community are ardent soccer fans and I think they will support the local team," said Mel Cohen, who last year moved from Johannesburg to Ra'anana and will attend a quarterfinal in his former hometown. 
 "The only problem is that Bafana Bafana doesn't have a good track record," the 69-year-old added, using the squad's nickname. "We would like to seem them do well, but realistically we know they aren't as good as the other teams."  (South Africa is ranked 90th in the world by FIFA. Israel, which did not qualify, is ranked 26th. ) 
 Josh Levenstein, a 17-year-old from Ra'anana, roots for South Africa - the country he left about two years ago - but thinks Holland will take the trophy. A diehard Arsenal fan, Levenstein will attend nine games in four cities, including the opener and final. "It's not just the World Cup - it's the World Cup in your country," he said. "There's going to be a feeling like there's never been before in South Africa." 
 His father Brian attended the 1966 tournament in England when he was 10, but is staying in Israel this time, his son added. "He said [the 1966 event] was amazing. But it's always different when it's in your own country." 
 Too big a challenge? 
 Howard Tolkien, who commutes between Johannesburg and Modi'in and will attend a quarterfinal, agrees. "There is certainly a tremendous positive vibe, positive energy and patriotic fever in the country at the moment," he said. 
 Despite the enthusiasm, however, concerns remain about South Africa's ability to successfully carry out a World Cup tournament, a logistical challenge on a scale the young democracy has yet to face. "Many ... think South Africa cannot handle this big challenge, that they cannot take care of security and don't have organizing abilities," says Alon Liel, a former Israeli ambassador to Pretoria. Liel, who was in South Africa when the apartheid regime crumbled and Nelson Mandela took power, will attend 10 World Cup matches. "I hope this skepticism is wrong and that the games will be a success," he told Anglo File. "It's much more than another World Cup. It's the ultimate test of South African democracy."

<title>South African Jews open their doors to World Cup fans</title>
<date>Wed Apr 21 16:26:54 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
South Africa's Jewish population is gearing up for a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to play host to thousands of Jewish soccer fans from around the world, during this summer's World Cup.
The five week soccer festival, which sees 32 teams compete for the famous golden  trophy this June and July, is seen by Jewish community leaders  as a chance to display its own colours within the spectrum of South Africa's "Rainbow Nation".  
According to Kathy Kaler, the founder and director of Johannesburg -based  Jewish radio station Chai FM, '2010 fever' is already in evidence among the 90,000 Jews in South Africa: 
"It's not uncommon to see a car with three flags proudly displayed; the South African, Israeli and Bafana Bafana (the name of the SA team) driving around the local 'Jewish' areas of Glenhazel in Johannesburg. That's how it is. We are proudly Jewish and we are proudly South African."
She added that Chai FM were "participating in the countdown, covering soccer stories, tickets sales, focusing on transport into and around South Africa as well as providing information about hospitality and security  arrangements."  
The station, which has around 40, 000 listeners as well as more than  100,000  internationally via  its website, hopes to  showcase "the uniqueness and warmth of the South African Jewish community during the world cup, which includes a great commitment to Zionism."
In the 2005 Kaplan Survey into the Jews of South Africa, 53 per cent of respondents had a "strong attachment? to Israel and 33 per cent a "moderate attachment", something which Kaler says is born out by the community?s active support of Israel:
"There is a large attendance at all Israel related functions and the community expresses strong support for Israel.  There is emerging an anti-Israel lobby more recently, that while very vocal is quite small,"  says Kaler.
And any comparisons  between the policies of the Israeli government and Apartheid draw angry responses from the community, many of whom actively opposed Apartheid policies in South Africa.
"This analogy generates outrage and indignation from South African Jews.  All this simplistic analogy accomplishes to do is malign Israel and minimize the realities of Apartheid," she says, before  citing Morris Ostroff, a former anti-Apartheid activist, who stated that this analogy makes a mockery of the true anti-Apartheid struggle.
As well as sharing a warm  rapport with Israelis who are familiar with South African ex-pats in their home country, the South African Jewish community is opening up to Diaspora Jewry, through  the  website Jewish2010.com. According to Wendy Khan,   director of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies,   the website - run under its auspices- "allows us to market Jewish South Africa to international Jewry".
The site offers accommodation in kosher B&B;'s and guesthouses, information about kosher products, restaurants and shops, Jewish tours and Jewish museums. 
One couple in Cape Town are looking to undercut the hotel market and rent out a four-bedroom house with a swimming pool, plus a chauffer for a total of $200 US  a week and dozens more Jewish families are operating through lettings agencies, to try and cash in on the traveler boom, with many tourists struggling to  find suitable hotel accommodation.
According to Khan, based on website clicks , "15 per cent of Jewish tourists will be from Israel", with most of the others from North America, Britain, France, Argentina and Australia.
Rabbi Mendel Polpack of Chabad in Cape Town, said he is receiving three times as many emails as usual concerning their services in that city: ? We are normally popular in  June to August with tourists, but the interest this year is unprecedented. 
"We are already getting around 15 to twenty emails a week  just concerning our services in Cape Town."
Information on the Chabad Cape Town website includes where to get Friday night meals and how to obtain kosher flats. There are also provisions to drop off kosher meals at local hotels including in Sea Point where  Chabad have set up links to over twenty hotels, which will host Jewish travelers from all over the world.
There will also be a Chabad presence at all nine host cities, including offering   help to people in the event of a crisis, which is reassuring for those who venture outside of Johannesburg, which has 60,000 Jews and Cape Town (20,000).
"By calling a number we can send someone to offer help and reassurance," said Rabbi Polpack who has lived in Cape Town for 34 years.

<title>SPORTS / A greater goal</title>

Goals for Galilee: The Triumphs and Traumas of the Sons of Sakhnin, Israel’s Arab Football Club, by Jerrold Kessel and Pierre KlochendlerJR Books, 320 pages, 19 pounds sterling
“What’s the deal with rooting for a sports team?” Jerry Seinfeld asks in one of his monologues. After all, since players regularly change teams, fans are basically “cheering for a shirt.” Moreover, non-fans insist, “it’s only a game,” a parallel universe divorced from the “real” world, so why even care about it at all?
Still, competitive team sports, as just about everyone on the planet knows by now, are a big deal for a whole lot of people. Passionate fans live and die by the fortunes of their favorite clubs. Multinational corporations depend heavily on the endorsements of celebrity athletes, team sponsorships and advertising to create and maintain their brand.
Owner/moguls brandish their teams like trophies. Electronic and print media provide endless amounts of game coverage, analysis and gossip. Politicians seek advantage by supporting particular teams, especially national squads, while governments and societies desire the prestige and recognition conferred by the hosting of reputable international competitions. These, and particularly the quadrennial World Cup football frenzy, often seem to be a substitute for war, as nationalist passions are unleashed, albeit in a ‏(usually‏) controlled fashion.
Embarrassingly, a standard rhythmic chant in Israeli sports arenas is “Mil-kha-ma” ‏(“war”‏).
Indeed, like other large-scale social phenomena, sports offers a window into societies and their political systems, providing much grist for the mill of sociologists, political scientists, novelists and cultural critics of various stripes. They also frequently serve as playing fields for some of a society’s larger conflicts, for good or for ill. Take the Red Star Belgrade football club, whose supporters constituted some of the shock troops for Slobodan Milosevic’s fascist head-bashers and ethnic cleansers, as Franklin Foer described in his eye-opening book “How Soccer Explains the World” (2004‏).
Conversely, the revolutionary racial integration of Major League Baseball in 1947 by Jackie Robinson was a seminal event in African Americans’ long struggle for equality, while the 1995 Rugby World Cup provided Nelson Mandela with the perfect platform to promote his vision of healing and reconciliation in post-apartheid South Africa, a story memorably dramatized in the film “Invictus.”
What does all this have to do with an Arab town in the north of Israel, whose local football team, Ihud Bnei Sakhnin ‏(United Sons of Sakhnin‏), inhabits, in good years, the lower end of the table of Israel’s Premier League? Actually, plenty, as documented in “Goals for Galilee,” Jerrold Kessel and Pierre Klochendler’s empathetic and breezily entertaining account of the team’s triumphs and tribulations.
Veteran independent reporters and filmmakers the authors, both former longtime journalists with CNN ‏(Kessel also writes a weekly sport column for this paper‏), embedded themselves with the team and fans of Bnei Sakhnin for a number of seasons, in order to probe the special passion and commitment generated by the club and, by extension, some of the larger political, social and historical issues and forces shaping Israeli society. Along the way, readers become more familiar with how members of Israel’s Arab minority negotiate the tensions inherent in life on the periphery of both the Jewish state and the Arab world.
Alternative platform
“Goals for Galilee” opens with the night of Bnei Sakhnin’s most glorious moment of recognition − winning the 2004 State Cup final, in the Ramat Gan national stadium before 40,000 people, including Israel’s president, a victory that landed the team a place in the European UEFA Cup tournament, and ignited an ecstatic all-night celebration in Sakhnin, as thousands of neighboring Arabs and Jews streamed in to join the wild celebration. Finally, club spokesman Mundar Haleileh declared at the time, “we’ve earned respect and an alternative platform from which to win over the hearts of our Jewish brothers to score the goal politicians have failed to score − equality.”
But, as the authors rightly ask, can the cardinal issues of identity, discrimination, equality, acceptance and coexistence really find their resolution by way of soccer?Moreover, the morning after ecstasy can often be a rude, headache-filled return to earth. “Nothing, nothing, nothing, that’s what we have here ... only soccer,” declared primary school teacher Wurrod Miari in a breathless monologue, as she shepherded her 8-year-old charges through Sakhnin’s chaotic streets, which lack basic safety features such as traffic lights and pedestrian crossings.
Still, one can’t help think of Theodor Herzl when she adds: “We have to beat the nothing, to beat the impossible .... And if we believe in ourselves, we’ll make lots possible ... a revolution − not only in Sakhnin, but in the whole world.” Clearly, the team’s success served as a metaphor for the teacher and her still-innocent students.
Living on the geographical and societal periphery of the country often generates an inferiority complex. At the same time, it may also create a tough-mindedness, in order to survive as well as to bring about change, both psychological and material. That process is never linear, and it is never-ending. These themes crop up repeatedly as the reader follows the fortunes of Bnei Sakhnin, in the months and years after the big bang of the State Cup triumph.
Poignant vignettes abound throughout the book. The team, a mixture of Arab and Jewish Israelis plus a sprinkling of foreign players, along with club chairman Mazen Ghanaim and the man who was then the team’s take-no-prisoners Jewish manager Eyal Lachman, celebrate an ecumenical, bond-building Rosh Hashanah meal 48 hours before taking on mighty Newcastle in UEFA Cup action, in 2004. Predictably, the hoped-for miracle of victory doesn’t materialize, but the team gives a respectable performance and returns to its main mission − playing well enough to avoid being knocked out of the Premier League.
The next day, Sakhnin the town switched abruptly from celebrating soccer to commemorating the events of October 2000, when 12 Arab Israelis, two of them from Sakhnin, and a Palestinian Arab, were killed during confrontations with Israeli police. Ibrahim Bushnaq, the team’s foreign liaison official and an uncle of one of the two Sakhnin residents who were killed, asked visiting Israeli Jews to recognize the Arabs’ pain, distributing Hebrew-language stickers bearing the motto “Everyone Has a Name” ‏(a central theme of Israel’s annual Holocaust commemorations‏). He derided the term “coexistence,” saying that while a horse and rider coexist perfectly, one is on top and the other is on the bottom. What Bushnaq wants, he declared, is not to be ridden, but to exist together.
If winning the State Cup provided one feel-good moment for those who dream of Jewish-Arab reconciliation, the performance of Bnei Sakhnin’s captain and leader, Abbas Suan, during the Israeli national team’s 2005 campaign for a World Cup berth provided another. Facing certain defeat as the clock wound down against Ireland, Suan provided a miraculous, last-minute goal, making him a national hero and inspiring many Arabs and Jews to think that a new era of Jewish-Arab comity was dawning. Another Arab player, Walid Budeir, then provided a similar equalizing goal for Israel against France, prompting MK Ahmed Tibi to coin the pithy dictum “No Arabs, no goals,” a play on the anti-Arab Kahanist slogan, “No Arabs, no terror attacks.”
But again, the euphoria quickly dissipated, when anti-Arab ultra-nationalist fans of Beitar Jerusalem, Bnei Sakhnin’s bitter rival, unfolded a banner at the two teams’ next encounter proclaiming, “Abbas Suan: You don’t represent us.”
Still, the balm for bitterness, for promoting hope, remains the emerald-green pitch of a soccer stadium. The problem was that, in 2004, Sakhnin didn’t have one that met the standards of Premier League and international competition. We thus follow an ongoing saga, which sometimes has a theater-of-the-absurd feel to it: Can a diehard Sakhnin supporter named Abdullah Ghanaim demolish the concrete tribunes surrounding the old field all by himself, with his single jackhammer, in time to make way for a new stadium that might never actually get built? Will Ariel Sharon, who was prime minister at the time, come through with the funds he has promised? We are present for the joyous Id hadeshe ‏(“Lawn Day”‏), when the first clumps of new turf are laid. We can almost taste the birthday cakes for Sakhnin children, made in the shape of a soccer field, baked daily by Hamzeh Bros. Ultimately, in the summer of 2005, the emir of Qatar provided enough money to complete what henceforth would be called Doha Stadium, although we never learn precisely how this came about.
Unlike most conventional sports stories, this one, appropriately, doesn’t conclude on a ringing note of victory. Bnei Sakhnin has continued to struggle to maintain its place in the Premier League, falling out and then climbing back in. As the new season starts, it is ensconced at the bottom of the standings, facing another long battle to survive. Meanwhile, there have been new manifestations of anti-Arab racism in the soccer stands, this time emanating from the fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv. Soccer, particularly in Sakhnin, is more than just a game, and will undoubtedly continue to intersect with the larger issues surrounding Jewish-Arab relations and the Arab-Israeli conflict.The authors’ ultimate hope is that one day their children, together with the children of Sakhnin, will be able to celebrate “the real Sakhnin goal − a draw between majority and minority.” To that, one can only say, “Amen.”

<title>Tensions over Israel high on Canada campuses</title>
<date>Thu Apr 15 08:24:36 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Anti-Israel agitation has come to light in Canada following  an alleged machete attack on pro-Israel students in Ottawa last week.  
The students, both well-known for their pro-Israel views, were reportedly assaulted after leaving local lounge in the early hours of the morning on April 5. The alleged assaulters included a large group of anti-Israel agitators, one of whom was wielding a machete.
One of the alleged victims, who said he and his friend were subject to derogatory and anti-Semitic slurs during the assault, was a local organizer of B'nai Brith's recent Imagine With Us pro-Israel campus initiative - a movement already banned by York University in Toronto.
Last year, students from York's Hillel were verbally abused by an anti-Israel group while trying to convene a press conference.
Actions like these have lead to calls to ban anti-Israel campaigns on campus, such as those witnessed during the recent Israel Apartheid Week. 
Last year , the LSE student union in London succesfully passed a student law in which  rhetoric comparing the actions of the State of Israel with those of Nazi Germany was declared a contravention of the EU definition of anti-Semitism; explicit tensions at LSE have since been alleviated.

<title>The New Israel Fund for Deepening the Jewish-Arab Rift</title>
<date>Thu Feb 11 02:52:26 IST 2010</date>
<content>
The Im Tirtzu organization accuses the New Israel Fund of financing Israeli organizations which Judge Richard Goldstone used for information to accuse the Israel Defense Forces of "war crimes." 
The fund's response, as is the wont of radical leftist organizations under fire, was to smear its critics  as  "fascists".Granted, the NIF's president, Naomi Chazan, signed a petition that defined the IDF's operations in Gaza as "terror against civilians" and demanded that Israel abide by "all UN resolutions relating to the conflict" (including 194, which Palestinians interpret as granting them a "right of return"). Nevertheless, the personal campaign against her is a mistake.  
The NIF's many supporters in the media and among political organizations (which benefit from the fund, both directly and indirectly) have used this personal campaign to divert the debate from the fund's subversive goal (a "new Israel," not Jewish or Zionist), which it has furthered by donating more than $200 million thus far to hundreds of anti-Zionist organizations (I have a list, if anyone is interested).  
Adalah - The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel - has used its NIF funding to submit dozens of petitions to the High Court of Justice that seek to reduce and even abolish Israel's identity as a Jewish state.  
"Israel must recognize the [Palestinian] refugees' right of return, on the basis of UN Resolution 194," declares the introduction to a proposed constitution that Adalah authored. And this proposal would also abolish the Law of Return for Jews.  
The NIF also finances Jewish-led groups that seek to undermine Israel's Jewish identity, such as the Association for Civil Rights in Israel.  
"The proposal to define Israel as a Jewish state," ACRI declared (in response to a draft constitution prepared by the Israel Democracy Institute, not, heaven forbid, the one presented by the Institute for Zionist Strategies), "is problematic both in principle and in practice."  
Mada al Carmel, another group funded by the NIF, authored the "Haifa Declaration." Here are a few gems from that document: "Towards the end of the 19th century, the Zionist movement initiated its colonial-settler project in Palestine. Subsequently, in concert with world imperialism ... it succeeded in carrying out its project, which aimed at occupying our homeland ... The Zionist movement committed massacres against our people ... the State of Israel enacted racist land, immigration, and citizenship laws [a reference to the Law of Return] ... Israel carried out policies of subjugation and oppression in excess of those of the apartheid regime in South Africa."  
The document subsequently demands the repeal of the Law of Return and of Israel's definition as a Jewish state.  
The Haifa Declaration, and other similar "vision documents," were signed by prominent members of Israel's Arab community, including the leaders of dozens of other organizations that are also funded by the NIF.  
Similar statements, for instance, appear in the "Future Vision" produced by the Higher Arab Monitoring Committee, another NIF grantee.  
Thus in funding organizations that work to deepen the rift between Jews and Arabs in Israel, the NIF has racked up noteworthy successes. Astonishingly, however, these successes are not proudly displayed to the fund's philanthropists.  
These donors, most of them Jews who support Israel as a Jewish and democratic state, are asked to contribute to the fund's praiseworthy - but as it turns out, not primary - activities: improving welfare, education and human rights in Israel.  
Many NIF donors do not know that their money is being used to fund dozens of organizations committed to inflaming the Arab street, intensifying its nationalist tendencies and deepening the rift between Jews and Arabs.  
These philanthropists would almost certainly object to their money being used to undermine Israel's Jewish identity and to lay a theoretical, legal and political framework for establishing another Arab state, on top of the proposed Palestinian state, in place of the State of Israel.

<title>U.K. Jewish leader's rebuke of Netanyahu sparks ire of British Zionists</title>
<date>Wed Nov 24 16:40:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
A top leader in the British Jewish community stirred a wave of strong reactions this week among the U.K. Jewish community, after publically criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the waning peace talks and insisting that the Anglo-Zionists begin to voice their opinions on the matter.
Mick Davis, chairman of the UJIA and executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, warned in front of more than 160 people at the London Jewish Cultural Center that Israel could become an apartheid stateunless there was a two-state solution with the Palestinians, "because we then have the majority going to be governed by the minority".
Davis said Netanyahu lacked the courage and the strategy to take the steps to lead to peace in the Middle East.
For years the Jewish community not in Israel has avoided expressing moral reservations regarding the Israeli government's decisions and policies.
Davis said that the British leaders felt they could not voice their opinions for fear of their ideas being used by Israel's enemies.

<title>Want to delegitimize Israel? Be careful who you mess with</title>
<date>Tue Apr 13 18:53:22 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Delegitimization - it's the new buzzword in the world of pro-Israel activism.
The term, used to describe a broad spectrum of anti-Israel protests, has become a major rallying point for the American Jewish community and is the up-and-coming cause for Jewish organizations.
In particular, supporters of this emerging advocacy effort point to the campaign to boycott, divest from and sanction - BDS - Israel as a primary marker distinguishing "delegitimizers" from genuine critics. It's a campaign that has gained traction on the left in recent years. And in the past few months, pro-Israel advocates have begun to mobilize against what they perceive to be efforts to delegitimize Israel as a Jewish state, whether via BDS or other means.
"The delegitimization and BDS movement is nationally coordinated, and it requires a national response," said William Daroff, the Jewish Federations of North America's vice president for public policy. "We need to move forward as a community to counter this cancerous growth."
But while supporters of Israel see the fight against delegitimization of the Jewish state as a new frontier in the pro-Israel battle, critics believe that the term is used mostly to discredit opposition to Israeli policies.
"To be frank, the 'de-legitimization' issue is a fraud," historian Tony Judt, director of New York University's Remarque Institute, wrote in an e-mail to the Forward. Judt, a harsh critic of Israel, said: "I know no one in the professional world of political commentary, however angry about Israel's behavior, who thinks that the country has no right to exist... 'De-legitimization' is just another way to invoke antisemitism as a silencer, but sounds better because [it's] less exploitative of emotional pain.?
Judt has written that he believes Israel's settlement policies have made a binational one-state outcome to the Israel-Palestinian conflict all but inevitable - a stand that has led Israel advocates to label Judt himself a delegitimizer.
In the past year, JFNA and the Jewish Council for Public Affairs adopted resolutions calling for communitywide action against delegitimization. And the American Israel Public Affairs Committee?s executive director, Howard Kohr, outlined a plan to fight Israel's delegitimization by demanding the state?s admission into international bodies, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
A March 10 meeting in New York marked the most significant attempt yet to formulate a communitywide response to this perception of delegitimization. Israeli officials and participants from major Jewish organizations and federations discussed the possibility of creating and funding a mechanism to track and respond to what they see as delegitimization efforts.
As a first order of business, participants raised the need to educate the Jewish community about the issue.
"Members of our community need to be knowledgeable and need to be able to answer to these allegations," said Martin Raffel, JCPA's senior vice president. "There is no one-size-fits-all solution. We will have to have tailored responses for each constituency."
But seeking a response to delegitimization requires a clear definition of the problem. An in-depth study released in March by the Reut Institute, a Tel Aviv-based think tank, identifies delegitimization as an organized movement and goes to great lengths to define the elusive term in a way that draws a line between what authors of the 92-page report see as legitimate criticism of Israel and forms of protest that fall under the delegitimization category.
"We are asking people to go into the nuances. We need to keep in mind that not everyone is an Israel hater, but not everything is Israel's fault," said Gidi Grinstein, Reut's founder and president.
The think tank's paper defines delegitimization as criticism that "exhibits blatant double standards, singles out Israel, denies its right to exist as the embodiment of the self-determination right of the Jewish people, or demonizes the state."
But, as Grinstein pointed out, identifying Israel's delegitimizers can be tricky, since most do not see themselves as denying Israel?s right to exist.
"The effectiveness of Israel's de-legitimizers, who represent a relatively marginal political and societal force in Europe and North America, stems from their ability to engage and mobilize others by blurring the lines with Israel?s critics," the Reut paper states.
Would the students who disrupted the February 9 speech of Israeli ambassador Michael Oren at University of California, Irvine be delegitimizers? For most activists in the Jewish community, the answer is clear.
"They definitely are," said Michael Kotzin, executive vice president of Chicago's Jewish federation. "Instead of asking [Oren] about Israel?s policy, they are denying him the right to speak."
Kotzin said that many of those pursuing the delegitimization agenda are naive and are exploited by activists who deny Israel's right to exist.
According to Israel supporters dealing with the issue, the key is focusing not on the protesters' actions but on their intentions, even if they do not acknowledge these intentions publicly.
"You need to dig under the surface and see what drives them," Grinstein said. "Most of the students who protested Oren's speech don't understand the subtleties and believe they are not engaged in delegitimization, but those organizing them are."
Nancy Kricorian of CODEPINK, a women's anti-war group, might be seen as such an organizer. Kricorian coordinates CODEPINK?s boycott campaign against Ahava cosmetic products because the products are manufactured on a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank. But she rejected the thought that she was seeking to delegitimize the state. "This is only a way of changing the subject," said Kricorian. "All we want is [for] Israel to respect human rights and international law. I don't see how that delegitimizes Israel."
At the same time, the broad-based coalition of Palestinian civil society groups that launched the BDS movement in 2005 declares that one of its goals is to promote the right of Palestinian refugees to return to the homes they lost - sometimes through mass expulsion - during Israel's 1948 War of Independence. A 1948 United Nations Security Council Resolution endorsed this right, but Israel rejects it on the grounds that the flood of returnees would spell the end of Israel as a Jewish state.
Reut and advocates for Israel argue that singling out Israel and demanding that it adhere to higher human rights standards than its adversaries is another form of delegitimization.
Yet, a higher standard for Israel is something that Judt, for one, unapologetically upholds. "People will say, 'Why are we picking on Israel? What about Libya, Yemen? Burma? China?'" he writes in the March 25 issue of the London Review of Books. "Fine. [But] Israel describes itself as a democracy, and so it should be compared with democracies, not with dictatorships."
As a country in "a difficult relationship" with its neighbors, Israel should be allowed a "certain margin of behavior," Judt acknowledged in his email. But Israel's relative strength compared to other regional nations gives it "even less excuse for criminality, law-breaking or violence than they do," he said.
Amos Guiora, a law professor and former Israeli army senior military counsel, objected that Israel is judged by double standards even when compared with other Western democracies. Guiora, noted that attacks by German and American forces in Afghanistan that caused heavy civilian deaths received less censure from the international community.
"By what standard does Israel want to be judged?" Guiora asked. His reply was, "By a standard in which you judge countries that are in a very, very special situation."
Those seeking to distinguish legitimate criticism of Israel from delegitimization cite another criterion: the labeling of Israeli policies as "apartheid."
Yet, in recent years mainstream Israeli leaders have used the word to describe the danger the country faces if it does not resolve its conflict with Palestinians.
Recently, Ehud Barak, Israel's defense minister and Labor Party leader, said bluntly, "If millions of Palestinians cannot vote, that will be an apartheid state."
Grinstein warned that fighting delegitimization must not devolve into hasbara, or public relations. The struggle, he said, is both about confronting those who question Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state and making sure Israel pursues a path of seeking peace and an end to the occupation.
The Reut document states, "Clearly, an Israeli and Palestinian comprehensive Permanent Status Agreement that establishes a Palestinian state and brings about an 'end of conflict'... would weaken the grounds of Israel's de-legitimization."

<title>Why must Israel studies be laden with politics?</title>
<date>Mon May 17 19:49:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
TORONTO — Is it inevitable and altogether obvious that a scholarly conference devoted to Israel studies should be laden with politics? Academia, in its most classical Platonic ideal, confines itself to description and analysis, not to the prescriptive and hypothetical. And yet here, in Toronto, where the annual gathering of the Association for Israel Studies is taking place, politics intrudes at every moment. The language might be more lofty — “empirical” or “normalized” — but the debates at their core are that same old slugfest of left versus right.
There are roughly 300 professors and graduate students gathered at Toronto University, a sprawling Oxfordian campus of ivy-covered towers, tree-sheltered esplanades and grassy quads.
It’s the association’s 26th annual meeting, and there is an impressive collection of scholars, mostly American and Israeli. You can tell the difference between the two, because the Israelis are more casually dressed and can more often be found outside, smoking cigarettes. Both groups can be seen fiddling with their cell phones, but the Americans’ look more advanced.
Yet the stars of the conference are not academics. At the end of the first day, at the gala dinner at which Princeton University political philosopher and public intellectual Michael Walzer was to speak, I found myself standing a few feet away from the two figures who are, if anyone is, the celebrities of this event: Gerald Steinberg, the fierce critic of Israeli human rights and civil rights groups, and Naomi Chazan, president of the liberal New Israel Fund, one of Steinberg’s primary targets.
Yes, both can put “professor” in front of their names. Steinberg is at Bar-Ilan University, and Chazan wrote and taught about African politics. But their standing here has to do with their roles as political actors and, recently, antagonists.
As disheveled-looking professors and eager graduate students milled about and sipped red wine outside the gala dinner, Chazan paced, nervously chain-smoking through a plastic filter. A few feet away stood Steinberg, a tall, mustachioed man who bears an uncanny resemblance to Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist (and, according to his detractors, a deceptively congenial personality). Each scholar was surrounded by a group listening to them expound on the most discussed session of the day: “Human Rights, the Politics of Advocacy and Israel’s Security.”
Steinberg had used the session to justify his work as president of NGO Monitor — an organization devoted to exposing what he sees as the nefarious influence of nongovernmental organizations supposedly concerned with upholding international law and human rights. In addition to Steinberg’s criticisms of her, Chazan has been the target of ugly ad hominem attacks in Israel by a group that believes she has somehow contributed to the creation of the Goldstone Report. Ads depicted her with a horn coming out of her head.
The session, in one of the university’s lecture halls, was packed. Steinberg smiled and kept referring magnanimously to “my friend Naomi,” who sat in the back of the room. But he also described NGOs as “superpowers” with dubious sources of funding and base ulterior motives guilty of a “cynical exploitation” of human rights. He didn’t go unchallenged. Another member of the panel, Gad Barzilai, a professor at University of Washington, asked Steinberg why he wasn’t equally disparaging of right-wing NGOs. 
“You don’t like the NGOs on the left, and to that I say, so what?” Barzilai said, to which the 100 or so observers let out an almost audible sigh. From the other presentations I had observed that day, it was clear that most of the audience probably agreed with Barzilai’s attack. Someone else in the audience reminded Steinberg that the Zionist movement had started off as an NGO, to which he also didn’t have a good response.
Another person asked if Steinberg planned on scrutinizing the millions of dollars that flow into Israel from unknown charities in support of the settler movement. 
Chazan didn’t say anything. She sat quietly in the audience with her arms folded. Once the session was over, she rushed out to smoke a cigarette. In the evening, she told me that Janice Gross Stein, a University of Toronto professor who sat on the panel, had defended her position well. She argued that the “international law,” frequently attacked by Steinberg, could not be seen as a monolithic set of well-defined rules. The field is fluid enough that it demanded a more nuanced critique than the often bombastic one launched by Steinberg and those who would defend Israel against Goldstone and others.
Chazan had the last word on this. In a plenary session on the conference’s second night, she gave a rousing defense of Israel’s democratic values, which she described as being under real and serious attack. “We are in the grips of a growing paranoia that does not distinguish between real existential threats and imagined threats,” she said, to the loudest applause of the evening.
And not just applause. During the question-and-answer period, Yoram Perri, director of the University of Maryland’s Institute for Israel Studies, stood up and, full of emotion, accused his colleagues of not doing enough to back Chazan.
“We should be praising her for the life-threatening work she does everyday,” Peri exclaimed. “If no one is standing behind you, I will. I am Naomi Chazan!”
But it wasn’t just in discussions of international law that politics intruded. On the conference’s opening day, my first session, called “State-Minority Relations,” moderated by longtime Haaretz journalist Zvi Bar’el, consisted of three professors, each painting a dire picture of the situation of Israeli Arabs and offering their ideas about how it might or might not be improved.
The most dramatic and depressing presentation was Amal Jamal’s. A professor at Tel Aviv University, he is one of only two scholars of Palestinian origin at the conference. He said there was no mystery why more Arabs weren’t in attendance. He had received angry e-mails from many friends, imploring him not to stand behind a podium that said “Israel Studies.” He called the conference a piece of Israel’s “public diplomacy.” But he was there, and he took the opportunity to paint the various options for Israel’s Arab population if nothing changes: As he put it, “apartheid, expulsion or genocide.”
“A professor friend, a Zionist, recently told me that ‘what’s going on in Israel now reminds me of Germany in the 1920s,’” Jamal said. It was a line I was sure would get the room riled up, but nobody raised an eyebrow. Only Steinberg, sitting behind me and fiddling with his computer in a desperate attempt to get Wi-Fi, later whispered in my ear: “See, they all agree with each other. There is no other viewpoint on that panel.” 
A talk by Michael Walzer came at the end of the first evening, at the gala dinner held in the cavernous Hart House building. Amid an interior of carved wood beams and walls covered in medieval coats of arms and paintings of past university presidents, Walzer issued an eloquent call for Jewish ethical engagement with the challenges of having a state. Unlike the day’s proceedings, Walzer’s talk did stay away from any political reference more recent than that of David Ben-Gurion: “We never had to deal with questions of what is just or unjust in war, until 1948.” This, it should be said, has been Walzer’s main theme for the past three decades. In some ways, it was an extended plug for the continued relevance of his 1977 seminal book, “Just and Unjust Wars.” But even if he was phoning it in, there was a level of erudition, of being elevated a few inches above the fray, that was refreshing after a day that seemed only slightly different from observing a series of smart people standing on soap boxes.
His opening words were his only concession to the particular mood of the moment. He offered a disclaimer of sorts. His talk was going to be full of “anxiety and self-criticism.” But this, he said, was very much a “Jewish tradition.” I’d say.

<title>Why should Israel care what the rest of the world thinks?</title>
<date>Tue Feb 16 11:02:58 IST 2010</date>
<content>
"First, let me tell you one thing: It's not important what the world says about Israel. It's not important what they say about us anywhere else. The only thing that's important is that we can live here on the land of our ancestors. And if we don't show the Arabs that they have to pay a high price for killing Jews, we won't continue living."
These words, spoken to a young Ariel Sharon by David Ben-Gurion, exemplify the realist strand that dominated and still dominates the thinking and discourse of many Israelis.  However, these days, in the wake of the Goldstone report and international efforts to delegitimize Israel, it has become increasingly apparent that in order to "live here on the land of our ancestors" Israel must also pay heed to the opinion of the international community.
Netanyahu articulated Israel's new realism in a December speech to the Knesset where he outlined the major challenges that Israel faces today: "The nuclear threat, the missile threat and what I call the Goldstone threat." Regarding the latter, the prime minister said, "Goldstone has become code for a much broader phenomenon: the attempt to negate the legitimacy of our right to self-defense." 
Ignoring for a moment Netanyahu's conflation of the Goldstone report with general efforts to delegitimize Israel, there is no doubt that the growing practice of questioning or denying Israel's right to exist is a concern the government must address head-on. I can attest from personal experience as an Israeli living and studying abroad that the content of discourse in the United States (especially in academia) has become worrisome. Never in my life have I had to defend the right of Israel to exist as the nation-state of the Jewish people as much I have done in the last year. 
Like it or not, Israel has become (or is quickly becoming) a pariah state. The new apartheid South Africa. Certainly some of this image is deserved, but an equal amount is a consequence of selective information, ignorance and/or hatred. More and more people have internalized the model of Israel as demonized nation. This means that every action by the state (or those identified with the state) is interpreted in a matter that is congruent with that model - in other words, in the worst possible way.
Of course diagnosing and treating the problem are two separate operations. The question that now needs to be posed is: How should Israel respond? How can we prevent Zionism from officially becoming a dirty word?  One popular opinion is to do a better job at Hasbarah - making our case to the world.  If we could only churn up an army of Alan Dershowitzes, the argument goes, things will improve.  Another version of this response is to rebrand Israel's image by focusing on the country?s positive qualities.    
While these approaches are important, alone they are wholly insufficient.  I am reminded of a story about a police officer who sees a man down on all four looking for something on the street.  When the officer asks the man if he lost something, the man replies, "Yes, my keys."  "You lost them here?" asks the officer.  "No," replies the man, with slurred speech, "I lost them in the alley, but the light is much better here."   
If we really want to take the problem of delegitimization seriously, we need to do more than just change the way we talk about Israel. We need to venture into the dark alley where we originally lost our way. Otherwise, we are no different, and will have no better luck, than the drunken man in the story.  
According to organizational psychologists, when there is a significant gap between what people expect and what they actually get, two types of learning can take place: single-loop and double-loop learning. Single-loop learning refers to efforts to reduce this gap by modifying the strategy originally employed - improving Hasbarah skills, for example.  Double-loop learning, on the other hand, requires us to question the assumption, values and actions that brought us to this problem in the first place.  
There are no shortcuts here. Double-loop learning means we need to radically transform our relationship with the Palestinians. This is not to say Israel deserves to be delegitimized, but when it chooses an overall course of action - yes, the occupation, blockade and settlements are choices - it significantly contributes to the problem. Of course peace also depends on the Palestinians undergoing some double-loop learning of their own.  
While it is probably true that certain anti-Israel groups will continue seeking to delegitimize Israel even in a post-two-state solution world, the key point is that their power to attract support will be significantly weakened.  And without the support of major international organizations, media outlets, academics or laypeople in the public sphere, these groups will be relegated to the dustbin of history where they legitimately belong.

<title>Abbas: Our wounded hands still capable of holding olive branch</title>
<date>Sat Sep 25 19:19:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In an address before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas waged harsh criticism against Israel, adding that the Palestinians were still determined to make recently relaunched peace talks with Israel a success.
"Despite the historic injustice that has been inflicted upon our people, their desire to achieve a just peace which guarantees the achievement of their national rights in freedom and independence has not and will not diminish, and our wounded hands are still able to carry the olive branch from the rubble of the trees that the occupation uproots every day," Abbas told the UN.
Declaring that Israeli mentality was controlled by expansionism and domination, Abbas said that Israel must choose between its settlement policy and peace, one day before the expiration of a temporary freeze on Israeli settlement construction.
Abbas, and other Palestinian negotiators have threatened to walk out on peace talks if Israel resumes construction in the West Bank settlements.
Abbas' long list of grievances against Israel, termed the "abuse of the occupation", included the "unjust blockade" on the Gaza Strip, the "flouting" of international law, UN resolutions and basic human rights, the demolition of homes, the destruction and usurpation of property, and the detention of "thousands of Palestinian freedom fighters" in Israeli jails.
"The occupying power continues to occupy our land and has made non-compliance with resolutions of international legitimacy including UN General Assembly and Security Council resolutions its prevailing policy. Such disrespect has rendered ineffective those resolutions, denigrating the credibility of the United Nations and deepening the predominant view that there is a policy of double standards, especially with regard to the cause of the Palestinian people and that Israel is a state above the law," the Palestinian president said.
"Israel has been flouting all these resolutions and relentlessly carrying out oppression, arrests and detentions, killings, destruction, demolition of homes, siege, settlement expansion, apartheid wall, violating and undermining the rights of our people and presence in their homeland without consequence," he added.
He went on to accuse Israel of destroying 25 percent of the homes in Gaza and eliminating the livelihood of 75 percent of the Strip's inhabitants, causing widespread unemployment and dependence on foreign aid. "This blockade against the Gaza Strip must be lifted completely and fully and the tragedy and suffering of our people there must be ended."
"We are willing and ready to reach a comprehensive, just and lasting peace settlement, which would lead to the withdrawal of Israel, the occupying power, from all the Arab and Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem as their capital, to enjoy the independence and sovereignty and for peace to prevail in the Middle East as a whole," Abbas said.

<title>After denied entry to West Bank, Chomsky likens Israel to 'Stalinist regime'</title>
<date>Mon May 17 02:52:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
The Interior Ministry refused to let linguist Noam Chomsky into Israel and the West Bank on Sunday. Chomsky, who aligns himself with the radical left, had been scheduled to lecture at Bir Zeit University near Ramallah, and visit Bil'in and Hebron, as well as meet with Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and various Palestinian activists.
In a telephone conversation last night from Amman, Chomsky told Haaretz that he concluded from the questions of the Israeli official that the fact that he came to lecture at a Palestinian and not an Israeli university led to the decision to deny him entry.
"I find it hard to think of a similar case, in which entry to a person is denied because he is not lecturing in Tel Aviv. Perhaps only in Stalinist regimes," Chomsky told Haaretz.
Sabine Haddad, a spokesperson for the Interior Ministry, confirmed to Haaretz that the officials at the border were from the ministry.
"Because he entered the Palestinian Authority territory only, his entry is the responsibility of the Office of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories at the Defense Ministry. There was a misunderstanding on our side, and the matter was not brought to the attention of the COGAT."
Haddad told Haaretz that "the minute the COGAT says that they do not object, Chomsky's entry would have been permitted."
Chomsky, a Jewish professor of linguistics and philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had spent several months at Kibbutz Hazore'a during the 1950s and had considered a longer stay in Israel. He had been invited by the Department of Philosophy at Bir Zeit.
He planned to spend four days in the West Bank and give two lectures.
On Sunday, at about 1:30 P.M. he came to the Israeli side of the border with Jordan. After three hours of questioning, during which the border officer repeatedly called the Interior Ministry for instructions, Chomsky's passport was stamped with "Denied Entry."
With Chomsky, 81, were his daughter Aviva, and a couple of old friends of his and his late wife.
Entry was also denied to his daughter.
Their friends, one of whom is a Palestinian who grew up in Beirut, were allowed in, but they opted to return with Chomsky to Amman.
Chomsky told Haaretz that it was clear that his arrival had been known to the authorities, because the minute he entered the passport control room the official told him that he was honored to see him and that he had read his works.
The professor concluded that the officer was a student, and said he looked embarrassed at the task at hand, especially when he began reading from text the questions that had been dictated to him, and which were also told to him later by telephone.
Chomsky told Haaretz about the questions.
"The official asked me why I was lecturing only at Bir Zeit and not an Israeli  university," Chomsky recalled. "I told him that I have lectured a great deal in Israel. The official read the following statement: 'Israel does not like what you say.'"
Chomsky replied: "Find one government in the world which does."
"The young man asked me whether I had ever been denied entry into other countries. I told him that once, to Czechoslovakia, after the Soviet invasion in 1968," he said, adding that he had gone to visit ousted Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubcek, whose reforms the Soviets crushed.
In response to the official's question, Chomsky said that the subjects of his lectures were "America and the world," and "America at home."
The official asked him whether he would speak on Israel and Chomsky said that because he would talk of U.S. policy he would also comment on Israel and its policies.
He was then told by the official: "You have spoken with [Hassan] Nasrallah."
"True," Chomsky told him. "When I was in Lebanon [prior to the war in 2006] I spoke with people from the entire political spectrum there, as in Israel I also spoke with people on the right."
"At the time I read reports of my visit in the Israeli press, and the articles in the Israeli press had no connection with reality," Chomsky told the border official.
The official asked Chomsky why he did not have an Israeli passport.
"I replied I am an American citizen," Chomsky said.
Chomsky said that he asked the man at border control for an official written explanation for the reason his entry was denied and that "it would help the Interior Ministry because this way my version will not be the only one given to the media."
The official called the ministry and then told Chomsky that he would be able to find the official statement at the U.S. Embassy.
The last time Chomsky visited Israel and the West Bank was in 1997, when he lectured on both sides of the Green Line. He had also planned a visit to the Gaza strip, but because the Palestinian Authority insisted that he be escorted by Palestinian guards, he canceled that part of the visit.
To Haaretz, Chomsky said Sunday that preventing him entry is tantamount to boycotting Bir Zeit University. Chomsky is known to oppose a general boycott on Israel. "I was against a boycott of apartheid South Africa as well. If we are going to boycott, why not the United States, whose record is even worse? I'm in favor of boycotting American companies which collaborate with the occupation," he said. "But if we are to boycott Tel Aviv University, why not MIT?"
Chomsky told Haaretz that he supports a two-state solution, but not the solution proposed by Jerusalem, "pieces of land that will be called a state."
He said that Israel's behavior today reminds him of that of South Africa in the 1960s, when it realized that it was already considered a pariah, but thought that it would resolve the problem with better public relations.

<title>Annul order allowing expulsions of Arabs, groups urge Barak </title>
<date>Mon Apr 12 02:08:08 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Ten Israeli human rights organizations sent a letter to Defense Minister Ehud Barak yesterday, asking him to rescind two military orders permitting the immediate expulsion from the West Bank of thousands of Palestinians and others defined as "infiltrators" from the West Bank.  
The orders are supposed to take effect on Wednesday.  
The organizations, including the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Rabbis for Human Rights and Adalah - the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, called the orders illegal, and said they permit arbitrary, extreme harm to a huge number of people.  
As Haaretz reported yesterday, six months ago then-Israel Defense Forces West Bank commander Gadi Shamni signed one order designed to prevent infiltration, and another regarding security directives.  
The letter to Barak states that under the orders, "any Palestinian in the West Bank is at risk of facing criminal charges as well as expulsion, and could be be expelled without [recourse] to appeal or oversight, as required by law."  
It notes that in March, the Moked Center for the Defense of the Individual sent a letter to GOC Central Commander Maj. Gen. Avi Mizrahi, stating the orders had grave implications. That letter did not receive a response.  
The organizations sent copies of yesterday's letter to Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein and to military justice officials as well.  
Publication of the matter has aroused major concern among those whom the orders would affect: People with Gaza addresses who live in the West Bank, and foreigners with family in the West Bank whom Israel has not allowed to obtain residency through family unification. As a result of the media interest, the IDF spokesman issued a clarification stating: "The law in Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] permitted the expulsion of illegal residents in the past, too. The aim of the amendment to the order on infiltration is to enable a judicial review process for the expulsion proceedings ... by a committee headed by a judge, and therefore to provide additional oversight."  
Lawyers Elad Kahana and Ido Blum of the Moked Center said the IDF response fails to address the primary order regarding infiltrators, which does address judicial oversight at all. They told Haaretz that the change now permits almost anyone in the West Bank to be defined as an illegal infiltrator and be subject to expulsion. They say the other order actually thwarts judicial oversight, because it allows for expulsion within three days or less, while judicial oversight would apply only after eight days.  
Urgent meetings were convened in Ramallah yesterday, and social activists and people at risk from the orders are planning an urgent meeting today, to demand that the Palestinian Authority and the diplomatic community take action.  
The international media also has taken great interest in the story.  
The head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's negotiating team, Saeb Erekat, issued an official statement of condemnation, saying the military orders come from an apartheid state and turn Palestinians into criminals in their own homes, directly harming the Palestinians' ability to manage their internal affairs.  
Officials in Ramallah said they will report on the matter to Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, who will be in Germany today on his way a Madrid conference of donor countries.

<title>Anti-Israel group could cost Toronto Gay Pride parade its funding</title>
<date>Thu Apr 22 18:19:33 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
The City of Toronto this month threatened to cut funding for its main gay pride event, following complaints by Canadian and Israeli gay rights activists who documented what they call acrimonious anti-Israel propaganda at the event.
Jewish gay rights activists from Toronto and Tel Aviv lauded the move, but the Toronto Jewish community's main body noted the city is yet to take any concrete action. Others, including prominent Canadian gays and pro-Palestinian campaigners, condemned the move as interference with free speech. 
The municipality's general manager of culture, Mike Williams, told the Toronto Star this week that the city has received complaints following the use of the phrase "Israeli apartheid" at Pride Toronto. T-shirt slogans equating Israel to Nazi Germany were also reported, with some complaints coming from Israel.
He added the complaints pertained to the group Queers Against Israeli Apartheid - or QuAIA - which may have violated the city's anti-discrimination policy in previous parades, and may do so again if allowed to participate this summer. This, he said, would have "very serious" repercussions for organizers. 
"We have the right to disqualify [parade organizers] from future grants, so we certainly would look at that," he warned. In 2009, the city funded Pride Toronto to the tune of $175,000. Funding for 2010 has already been pledged, but the city may halt it in 2011.
Elle Flanders, the spokesperson for Queers Against Israeli Apartheid, commented that the T-shirts in question were not anti-Israel but rather anti-racist. ?There were no Nazi symbols?there were T-shirts that were worn by anti-racist activists with a NO to fascism sign (crossed out swastika) who marched with us, who have been marching in Pride for years,? said Flanders in an e-mail to Haaretz..
The decision by the city - which is among the world's gay-friendliest - came after repeated complaints by Martin Gladstone, a Toronto lawyer and gay rights activist, who made a film about QuAIA entitled "Reclaiming our Pride." In the film, activists at a Pride Tononto 2009 parade call Israel an "apartheid state" and one of them wears a T-shirt with a crossed-out swastika. 
"How does demonizing Israel celebrate gay rights?" Gladstone said, adding: "It creates a hateful and exclusionary environment." Jonathan Danilowitz, a prominent, South Africa-born gay rights activist from Tel Aviv, praised the city's stand, which he defined as "going against hypocrisy."
Flanders, a Jewish filmmaker and artist who is also a PhD candidate in Toronto, rejected these accusations, adding that they were meant to "shut down the debate" and that she will "start a defamation suit against the next person who attempts to call us anti-Semitic."
Born in Montreal, Flanders, 44, said that she grew up in Israel with her parents before returning to Canada after her first year at Hebrew University. "Many of us in the group are Jews, many with long histories of Jewish activism and human rights work," she said. 
Gladstone, the pro-Israel film maker, responded by saying that groups like Flanders' "always put the Jews in front to deflect the accusation." 
Pro-Israel groups such as StandWithUs have in the past few years been mounting a concentrated effort to advertise Israel as a gay-friendly society in stark contradiction to its neighbors, where homosexuality is illegal and gays are often persecuted.
Flanders said that "when Israel flaunts its record on gay rights achievements, it does not excuse the occupation and/or other human rights abuses and war crimes."

<title>Arab MK: U.S. beginning to question Israeli policy on Palestinians </title>
<date>Fri Mar 12 20:18:28 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Knesset Member Ahmed Tibi has lashed out over the treatment of American lawmakers brought to Israel by the J Street organization, warning that unconditional U.S. support for Israel is on the wane. 
Writing in an opinion piece
"The visiting members of Congress, though staunch supporters of Israel not yet questioning American aid, are beginning to raise questions about Israel's actions against the Palestinians."
The visit by members of Congress in February was apparently subject to an attempted boycott by a senior Israeli official due to the involvement of J Street. 
Rep. William Delahunt (D-Massachusetts), who headed the delegation, said at the time that Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon had "apparently attempted to block our meetings with senior officials in the Prime Minister's office and Foreign Ministry".
Tibi also had harsh words for what he branded Israel's apartheid policies, saying: "Israel's policies are putting it in league with the West's most notoriously racist governments of the past five decades." 
He went on to quote Defense Minister Ehud Barak, who told the prestigious Herzliya Conference earlier this year that Israel was in danger of becoming "an apartheid state". 
For Palestinians, this was already a reality, Tibi said, with "the separation wall running through the West Bank and East Jerusalem," and "different Israeli laws for Jews and Palestinians in the occupied territories".
The Arab lawmaker, who is also the deputy speaker of the Knesset, slammed Israel for responding to growing international criticism with a lackluster "propaganda" campaign to boost its image abroad, rather than tackling "the fundamental injustices meted out to Palestinians every day". 
Tibi concluded: "Members of Congress don't need another decade of complicity with Israel's occupation, but the political courage to tell an ally and its associated lobbyists that continued domination of the Palestinians is simply not acceptable in the 21st century."

<title>Army and art as the same </title>
<date>Sun Aug 29 00:56:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Israeli theater directors made a big mistake by committing to stage their plays at the cultural center in the settlement of Ariel. They made this commitment without speaking first to the playwrights and artists, creating a fact on the ground. This fact needs to be overturned. The directors will pay dearly for the almighty row about to erupt.
The row started Saturday, in fact, with the publication of statements by the culture minister and Ariel's mayor. The directors never imagined what a hole they've dug up for themselves with their hasty decision.
The campaign waged recently against the universities will pale compared to what will be done to the theaters. The artists can't be dragged to Ariel in blunt contradiction of their political beliefs; they can't be driven on our Jewish-only apartheid roads.
For if plays are staged in Ariel, why not Hebron? A curfew will fall on the Palestinian residents as the curtain goes up. The checkpoints will be removed for the honored guests; only collaborators  travel through checkpoints without hassle.
Do you need to be paranoid to hear a threat in Culture Minister Limor Livnat's demand yesterday for an immediate "enlistment to take care of the emerging crisis," as if the directors were being called up to the army and were being tested by the authorities?
The "crisis" has only just begun and already the signatories are being accused of "dividing Israeli society." But artists and actors are not soldiers marching in formation. No one can force them to perform, unless his name is Zhdanov.
It's not the artists who are divisive, but those who decided to build the settlements, including the culture minister. Her most laughable argument was the need to "leave the political debate outside cultural and artistic life." This may sound familiar because the sacrosanct, virtuous IDF too is supposed to remain outside politics. The minister sees army and art as the same.
The settlers have proved they have a good sense of drama. The have lived for decades without stage plays coming from Israel proper, and they might wait a little longer until an agreement determining their fate is signed and stick to their own productions. After all, the prime minister says an agreement will be signed "within a year." Bibi is well known for keeping his promises, and who but the settlers should know that?

<title>Barak: Turkish intel head's ties to Tehran 'disturbing' </title>
<date>Mon Aug 02 00:59:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Defense Minister Ehud Barak yesterday voiced concern that the appointment of a Turkish intelligence chief who is close to Iran could result in Tehran gaining access to Israeli secrets.
Barak's unguarded comments came at a closed conference of the Labor Party's kibbutz committee, where he apparently did not realize his remarks were being recorded. His statements were aired yesterday on Army Radio.
"In recent weeks a man who is a supporter of Iran was appointed to head Turkey's Mossad. There are a fair number of our secrets that are in [Turkish] hands. The thought that in the past two months they could have been open to the Iranians is quite disturbing," Barak said.
In the past two months Barak has attempted to defuse some of the tensions between Jerusalem and Ankara, which peaked with the Gaza flotilla incident at the end of May, but in closed forums he has said it will be very difficult to halt Turkey's growing ties to Islamic extremist organizations in the region.
The name of the game 
The Reut Institute released last week a devastating report on the fallout from the flotilla incident. According to the experts from the nonpartisan Israeli research institute, the flotilla was a "political-strategic terror attack" that was planned, undisturbed, over the course of more than a year, succeeded beyond its organizers' expectations and caused significant damage to Israel.
The report's authors state that the crux of the incident was the alliance forged among Hamas, various Islamic organizations and leftist organizations operating in places like London, Paris, Brussels, Madrid, Toronto and San Francisco. They write that the planning of the flotilla was carried out openly over the Internet and in public conferences, and that Ankara's decision to make Gaza a main sticking point with Israel was apparent months in advance.
The researchers point to a broad, global, constantly changing campaign for the delegitimization of Israel that began several years ago and whose ultimate purpose is to bring about the dissolution of Israel, a la South African apartheid and the Soviet Union.
It's possible, said Reut founder and president Gidi Grinstein, that the flotilla is "already yesterday's war and Hamas and its partners will search for other avenues. The name of the game is delegitimization. The problem is that Israel is not prepared to deal with this war. If it's a strategic problem then it must be dealt with accordingly. A broad coalition of organizations that work against us and cause us enormous damage in terms of global public opinion has been created, but it is still a war that can be won."

<title>Carter in new book: Obama turned back on settlement freeze</title>
<date>Sat Sep 18 11:12:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
In his new book, former United States president Jimmy Carter criticizes President Barack Obama over his policy on Israel's settlement freeze, writing that the President has backed away from his initial commitment to a complete halt to building in West Bank settlements.
The Associated Press purchased a copy of Carter's book, White House  Diary, on Friday, ahead of its release Monday.
Carter also criticizes fellow Democrat and former president Bill Clinton over his policy on Israel settlement expansion, writing that settlement building was especially rapid during Clinton's administration.
This past week, the newspaper Asharq Al Awsat reported that the Obama administration has suggested Israel extend the current moratorium on construction in West Bank settlements, which is set to expire on September 26, for an additional three months.
The expiration date for the settlement freeze has loomed over the recently re-launched direct peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. The Palestinians have threatened to walk away from the talks if the freeze is not extended.
On Thursday, the European Union called on Israel to extend the settlement freeze in light of the peace talks which began this month.
"The European Union deems it indispensable that both parties observe calm and restraint and refrain from actions that could affect negatively the progress of the negotiation," the group stated following a meeting in Brussels. "In this regard, it recalls that settlements are illegal under international law and, with a view to ensure that these talks continue in a constructive manner, calls for an extension of the moratorium decided by Israel."
The former president's views on Israel have caused controversy in the past, such as when he likened Israeli policy in the West Bank to apartheid South Africa in his book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid".

<title>Declare Independence. Free Israel. End the Occupation.</title>
<date>Mon Apr 19 12:07:00 IDT 2010</date>

Click here for more articles by Bradley Burston 
Shimon the Tzadik, the righteous, the just, the saintly, was one of the last of the Great Knesset. He used to say: The world continues to exist because of three things: Torah, Worship, and Acts of Lovingkindness. 
Talmud, Pirkeh Avot
SHEIKH JARRAH, East Jerusalem - It's taken us years and years, but we've finally realized the dream of every Israeli.
It was my wife who noticed. "I really like this," she said one Friday as we left the house, "getting out and going to a foreign country every weekend."
Our fellow Israeli Jews, inveterate world travelers that they are, literally go out of their way to avoid this place, which is called East Jerusalem. Some steer clear because it scares them, others simply because it feels so, well, foreign.
In the end, what they miss out on, is the view from here. If just once they'd make the trip. On a clear day, they could see their own future.
This is not just any neighborhood of East Jerusalem. Just as the settlers here, with their Baruch Goldstein celebrants, are not just any settlers, nor the anti-settlement protest held here each Friday, a demonstration like any other.
More than any other area of the Holy Land, this is the place where Israelis gather regularly to declare their independence from Occupation.
Here, because Sheikh Jarrah is where the settlement movement has come to die. The settlement named for Shimon the Just, is where the Occupation has begun to write its own ending.
Even the pro-settlement right has begun to realize that there is something different and dangerous here. That the circumstances of the creation of this settlement not only have the effect of turning all of Jerusalem into the status of a settlement, but of turning all of Israel into the status of Occupied Territory.
"The entrance of Jews to Sheikh Jarrah is a crazy and irresponsible act," rightist Jerusalem City Councilman Yakir Segev was quoted as telling a Hebrew University panel discussion last week.
"It's a terrible and crazy idea to open the question of ownership of properties from before 1948. It may open up a Pandora's box," Segev told Ynet, referring to the fact that Palestinians - even the families expelled to make way for the Sheikh Jarrah settlers - could reasonably ask courts to return them to land they owned until 1948 and had to flee, to homes which are now the homes of Jews in places like Jaffa and West Jerusalem.
"There are very wide-reaching repercussions and a reverse precedent may be set."
Occupation is an ugly word. That is why people who support the idea of a Jewish state should use the term, and use it often. Because, on this, Israel's 62nd independence day, the Occupation has to be identified for what it has become: Israel's worst enemy.
Not Iran. Not Hamas or Hezbollah. All three would like to see Israel cease to exist. But our government has tools to fight them. Against the Occupation, though, the government is powerless. 
For much of the last decade, this city was engulfed in fire. The pro-settlement right - let us, for once, call it what it is: the Movement for a Permanent Occupation - taught anyone who would listen, that it is peace moves that provoke terrorism; that it is the peace process that has led us, time and again, to war; that to question the act of settlement is to be anti-Israeli.
No more. This is where it has to stop. There is a name for the systematic burning of our bridges with the world, with our friends, with the majority of world Jewry, all for the sake of the settlements, all for the sake of permanent Occupation: Suicide.
Years past on Independence Day, I used to wonder if my generation would survive the Occupation.
Now I wonder if Israel will.
This is perhaps Israel's most dismal Independence Day in memory. Not because of war. Nor terrorism, nor economic crisis.
In a country where polls show that nearly two-thirds of the population would cede the West Bank under a future peace deal, Israelis are hostages to the nightmare scenario of permanent Occupation.
Today, after 62 years of furious effort, Israelis and Palestinians are in many respects farther from true independence than ever before. The reason becomes clearer by the year. Both peoples are prisoners of the Occupation.
These people, my friends, the Israelis, now face the most difficult challenge in the history of their country. Their country is still young as nations go, but is aging dangerously with every passing year that the Occupation terrorizes us, invades us, roots itself, spreads, poisons the spirit and the soul.
Most of all, the Occupation has blinded smart people to its own dangers. The Occupation exploits our fears even as it magnifies the real threats against us. The Occupation feeds and fosters those who hate us. It is their secret weapon. It is our Achilles heel.
We know now that our government, our prime minister and defense minister, are prisoners of the Occupation as well, unable or unwilling to do what they know they must to safeguard Israel's future.
That is why individual Israelis are going to have to do what they do best: Take action on their own.
It is not a large group that demonstrates here. But it is persistent, and growing. There are no speeches, and no hurled rocks. Only something which, thanks to the Occupation, is all but gone everywhere else in Israel: hope.
Will a serious battle against Occupation cause a deep rift in the Jewish People? Will it drive a wedge between all those who believe that the Jews, like other peoples, deserve a state of their own?
Too late. The Occupation has already been there, and done precisely that.
The Occupation has become the greatest single threat to the social fabric of the Jewish state. The Occupation causes division, strife, tension and alienation in Jewish families and Jewish communities the world over. Nothing causes Israel more diplomatic damage than the Occupation, and its outrider, the siege of Gaza.
Nothing delegitimizes Israel more in the eyes of the world - and in the eyes of many Jews - than the nation's unwillingness or inability to dismantle and end the Occupation.
You don't have to take the short jaunt to Sheikh Jarrah to understand that Israelis must put an end to the Occupation before the Occupation puts an end to Israel.
What will permanent occupation mean for Israel? Not only that the nation will cease to be a democratic state, disenfranchising millions of Palestinians. In the end, permanent Occupation will see to it that Israel will cease to be a Jewish state as well. Israel will have delegitimized itself out of existence.
It will have knowingly opted for and adopted apartheid, and, in the end, either through democracy or through fire, and, thanks to the Occupation, the world community will see to it that an Arab-ruled Palestine from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River will finally come into existence.
That, in the end, may explain why the demonstrations here in Sheikh Jarrah, which are not massive in scale, have managed to set in motion a chain of events which has not only affected Washington's view of settlement in the Holy City, but - in the manner of the settlers' disproportionate leverage over the rest of us - has managed to paralyze, at least for now, the inroads of militant settlers into several points across East Jerusalem.
After our most recent visit to the foreign country that may one day be called Palestine, I've refined my goals as far as the future is concerned. This, then, is my mission statement for this Independence Day: Let the Occupation end with me.
May it end here. Let it end soon.
May Jews and Arabs become again what they once were: Neighbors. True cousins.
May this be the generation that outlives the Occupation.
May we find ways to cripple it, take it apart. End it.
This is Independence Day. Free Israel. End the Occupation.
Addendum. As I was writing this, the Im Tirtzu organization, which promotes the Occupation through division, libel and graphic and verbal obscenity, distributed pamphlets in synagogues aimed at changing the Yizkor memorial prayer for fallen soldiers on Memorial Day, to include an attack on leftist Israelis. I will respond at length to this next week, but suffice it to say that the corrupting effect of the Occupation on the concepts of Torah, Worship, and Lovingkindness, has never been more evident.

<title>Dispatch from an Israeli journalist in Istanbul</title>
<date>Fri Jun 04 10:52:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
The special welcome begins at Attaturk airport. The line to purchase  visas snakes down the corridor and halfway to Iran. I stand dejectedly  in it for a moment and then notice that while Americans and Europeans,  along with almost every national I can make out, need the visas --  Israelis inexplicably sweep right through. I am thrilled, march up to  the clerk on the shorter line and smile brightly.
"We don't need to buy visas?" I ask. "How wonderful!"
"For now, No," he replies, slowly, even for a clerk, and looks me  over. "But next time we wont even let you folks in."
And so begins my trip to Istanbul in the aftermath of the Israeli  raid on the humanitarian flotilla organized by the Turks.
Popular here, we are not.
My first port of call is the Israeli consulate in the Levent  neighborhood. It is shut and locked, and the square leading to it is  barricaded off -- but there is no lack of activity.  "God is Great,"  yell the bearded demonstrators, climbing on the barricades and waving  Palestinians flags. "We are ready to fight," they chant. "Israel is a  terrorist state," they sing.
The signs, of course, are all in Turkish, a language I find  completely incomprehensible, and so I ask a young woman in an abaya to  translate for me. "Die Jews," she explains, and then squints her eyes,  closes one, and reconsiders. "No, no, it's 'Die Israelis.'" Her friend  pipes in to help. "I think it's 'Kill Israel,' or maybe 'Die Killers.'"  They debate. I understand the principal. They are from Bursa, they tell  me, and have taken a bus here to join in the demonstration. Each has  bought a green headbands -- two Turkish Lira each -- which they now  wrap, lopsided, over their head coverings. "We are all Palestinians,"  they read. "How do I look?" they ask each other.
I head to the heart of town, Taksim Square, to observe a larger  demonstration, organized by the Communist party. "What do your signs  say?" I ask some protestors, students from Italy, as it turns out. They  are not exactly sure. Turns out they don't read Turkish either. "Israel  is an Apartheid State," a fellow protestor explains to us, and, pointing  to another: "Die Jews." Oh, so, that's what is says.  I must revert  back to the Bursa girls later.
By 10 P.M. I have filed a story and am exhausted and rather depressed  by the situation, on various levels. I remember coming to Turkey with  my family in far better times. "Hello Israeli cowboy," the merchants  would yell out, back then, to my mom, who has a penchant for Panama  hats. "We love Israel!," "Shalom."
My friends, the girls from Bursa, text me: Another demonstration  is taking place at the consulate, much bigger, they say. I should  probably go check it out. But to schlep all the way back there?  Oh, how  I would like to sit and have a shishkabab or watch TV. I flick it on in  my room -- it's all in Turkish, and it's all about Israel and while,  again, I cannot understand the words, the images are clear enough. I  push myself out the door and decide to head to the demonstration by  metro, which is cheaper (take note Haaretz finance department)  and faster.
But not, however, more pleasant. The metro tunnels are echoing with  the screams of thousands of youngsters, mainly young men, chanting and  pushing their way into the trains. With kafiyyas draped over their heads  and shoulders and Palestinian flags in their hands they call back and  forth to each other. "Takrir, Allah." "Takrir Allah." God is Great. I  feel slightly uncomfortable for the first time, as I get swept up in the  throng.
"Where are you from? Where are you from?" the youngsters ask me. This  might not be the time to discuss the nuances, be they what they may, of  the Israeli-Palestinian, or the Israeli-Turkish, relationship, I  figure. "I am a journalist," I suggest by way of diversion and mime some  writing and photo snapping actions with my hands. "Ahhh!" they say,  satisfied. "America." "The Celtics. Good." So be it.
Emerging from the metro near the consulate with my latest pals, I  find myself in the midst of  tens of thousands of people. It's a  carnival atmosphere. Kids are sitting on their parents' shoulders, and  cotton candy and corn on the cob is being sold along with Palestinian  flags and headbands. The chants and the signs are all familiar, but here  there is a new energy in the air. The traffic is completely blocked in  both directions but drivers don't even seem to mind. They blare their  horns in solidarity with the marchers and wave out their windows.
As the night goes on, the crowds only seem to swell. Not being the  tallest person around, I can't see a thing, and somehow find myself  climbing over a few fences and being hoisted up on top of a bus hired by  the Islamic movement for VIPs. "Takrir" comes a voice from a  loudspeaker right beside me. "Allah," respond the masses. An Israeli  flag is burnt directly beneath. My mother, ringing my mobile from  Jerusalem, is whispering to me as if the Islamic militants could hear  her on Shamryahu Levin street. I now can see, but can barely hear a  thing. "Don't go out on the streets alone," she suggests to her  journalist child. "And don't drink anything anyone gives you," she  adds. "What? I cant hear a thing!" I yell. "Takrir" "Allah" Just then  someone in offers me some water.
I start day two looking for Israelis. "Any hints on where will I find  them?" I ask my editor. Try the breakfast room, she suggests. Obvious. I  slowly walk around the dining room in my hotel, and then in the hotel  next door, scanning the buffet bar for faces of my countrymen and women.  'Is that an Israeli or an Iraqi?" I think to myself. 'An Iranian or an  Israeli?' 'Italian or Israeli?' My radar zooms in on one likely couple. I  sidle alongside their table. "Do you speak Hebrew," I ask, in Hebrew,  under my breath, as if on some secret Mossad mission. "Of course,  Motek-Luvie- come have breakfast with us," they offer. Success.
A mother and her daughter-in-law from Ramat Hasharon on a roots trip.  "That's so sweet," I say, as I dip my cucumber into their Tehini. "So  nice to see an Israeli," they admit. I feel the same. "Why don't you  come with us to Topkapi Palace," they offer. I'm a little busy, I say,  wistfully. "Be careful," they warn me. "Don't talk in Hebrew," they  insist. "Don't drink anything suspicious!" Are all Jewish mothers  exactly alike? I have to wonder.
I head to the offices of IHH, the controversial Islamic charity that  funded a great part of the flotilla -- chartering three of the ships and  recruiting and paying the way for all of the Turkish passengers. Israel  has banned the charity, claiming they are humanitarian only in name,  and in fact are a militant body supporting Hamas and other terror  organizations. I am not going to lie about who I am, I decide, and give the friendly  secretary with blood shot eyes my Haaretz business card. "You  are Israeli?" he says loudly. I feel like telling him to keep it down,  but just nod. "Yes." I ask to speak to one of the senior officers and am  told to wait. It takes about 15 minutes for the other Turkish reporters  present, with little else to do, to train their video cameras on me.  "You are Israeli?" they ask. "We would like you to explain to us the  position of your government." Oh dear.
I am saved by a press conference, called by the leaders of the IHH to  say that their comrades being held in Israel are being given water in  prison they believe is poisoned. "We have told our people to not drink  anything," they explain. I see we have more in common with these guys  than might first meet the eye and wonder what is going on with the  poisoned water theme. I spend the rest of the afternoon basically just  hanging out at this headquarters, trying to communicate in Turkish (not  easy) and trying to piece together information (harder still) about what  is happening next. Families of those on the flotilla wander in and out  of the offices, worried, wanting to know who is injured, who is dead.  Some are crying.
Finally, I get my interview. "Sorry to keep you waiting, says senior  IHH board member Umar Farooq, "...but because of you Israelis we are  very busy these days." I feel the organization has made an effort to  talk to me because, and not despite of where I am from. "Provocation?"  he shrugs his shoulders. "Metal bars?" "We did not start this fight, he  says, "...but we have won it." It seems he is keen to express himself to  an Israeli paper. The interview is sobering. I am increasingly tired.  "Let's not talk again until Israel changes her ways," he suggests in  parting, ever courteous.
On my last night in Istanbul, yet another demonstration is raging,  now back in Taksim square. I wander the streets. It feels like Miami  Beach meets Nablus. One street filled with Karaoke bars teeming with  women in high heels and tank tops flirting with muscle men, the next  street filled with thousands women in abbayas yelling for the  destruction of Israel and radical looking types shaking their fists in  the air. I notice a new style of black headband reading "Hail to Hamas."  Music praising Sheikh Ahmed Yassin is piped over the loud speakers. The  police - in full riot gear - seem to be enjoying the balmy night out on  the town, and some have popped into Jimmy's Chicken for some fast food.   Tourists, meanwhile, a street or two away, go about their business,  bargaining for fake leather wallets and evil eye key chains.
On my flight back to London I am sitting, lo and behold, near one of  the flotilla passengers, who, released to Turkey, is now going home to  give a press conference, and, she explains, start planning her next  flotilla mission. "Israelis are animals," she tells me. "Everyone now  knows this." I tune out. It has been a long three days.

<title>Egypt: World should push toward establishment of Palestinian state</title>
<date>Wed Dec 08 16:17:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Major powers should push Israel and the Palestinians to agree a deadline for establishing an independent Palestinian state before a two-state solution becomes impossible to achieve, Egypt said on Wednesday.
Israelis and Palestinians held three rounds of U.S.-backed talks in September. Palestinians pulled out when a 10-month freeze on Jewish settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem ended on Sept. 26.
In some of Egypt's strongest language since the talks ended, Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said discussions should shift to an "end-game for a Palestinian settlement" after Washington had failed to push Israel to halt building work.
"The Americans have been informing all of us that their efforts did not succeed. They wanted to reach a moratorium on settlement activities with Israel. That came to an end now."
He said Egypt's concern was that "we continue haggling without (making) any breakthrough, then in few years there would not be a possibility of two states living side by side."
The Palestinians on Wednesday said "Israeli obstinacy" made Washington give up on efforts to freeze Jewish settlements and questioned whether the United States could ever help them attain independence.
Egypt became the first Arab state to reach peace with Israel when it signed a deal in 1979.
"You have a bi-national state or you have occupation or apartheid. The ... option which we are all preferring is to have two states instead of one state based on apartheid," Aboul Gheit said at a briefing during a visit to Bulgaria.
He said the quartet of the United States, European Union, United Nations and Russian Federation should devise a framework agreement that fixes a Palestinian state's borders and the status of East Jerusalem while ensuring Israel's security.
"If there would be an exchange of territories it has to be minimal," the minister said.
He said the agreement "can be drafted by the Americans, by the quartet, by a group of experts, two or three pages of a grand understanding to be offered by the international community to both parties" with a specific time for a deal to be reached.

<title>Embraces, warm and cool </title>
<date>Mon Apr 26 14:40:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad delayed a working trip abroad in order to open the fifth Bil'in International Conference on the Popular Struggle that took place from April 21-23. He also brought with him a bountiful dowry: representatives of 23 foreign consulates and diplomatic missions.
They sat in the giant tent set up in the village's schoolyard, among activists from Bil'in and other villages, as well as children who had come along with their parents and were wandering around with cooked beans and za'atar, women who sat behind tables laden with embroidered handicrafts for sale, a handful of Israelis and dozens of activists from abroad.
In addition to speeches, the conference included tours of various local sites and participation in the weekly demonstration against the separation fence, whose construction is ongoing and continues to wound the land and eat away at the rocks and the fields.
On one side stood a row of white chairs bearing the photographs of 15 men - a representative sample of the dozens of popular struggle activists from the Palestinian villages who had been jailed or are still serving time in Israeli prisons. Opposite them and behind the dais was a picture of Bassem Abu Rahma, who was killed in a demonstration on April 17, 2009 by a tear-gas grenade fired directly at him at a high velocity by an Israel Defense Forces soldier.
Activists of the popular committees who lead the struggle against the separation fence and the settlements are well aware of the criticism that the "embrace" they are receiving from the Palestinian Authority is too strong and too tight. They are aware of the suspicious remarks to the effect that the PA is interested in regulating and adjusting the popular struggle, and that it exploits its well-publicized support for it to thwart public criticism of its policies. The activists' solution to this problem is to maintain their political and partisan independence, to distance themselves from the schismatic arguments that characterize the political arena, to continue to plan popular activities, and to put pressure on Hamas and Fatah so that they will reconcile.
In any case, the Israeli security forces make sure that the activists will not turn into the "spoiled children" of the PA and ensure that the popular struggle will continue to spread.
In the dark of night, a few hours before Fayyad's speech at the three-day conference, an army unit raided the village of Bil'in.
This is a routine occurrence in villages that have turned into symbols of unarmed struggle against the occupation, constituting a kind of routine that no one really becomes accustomed to. This time the soldiers had been sent to arrest a 17-year-old youth, designated as the prosecution's witness and due to appear at the Ofer military court (located on the lands of the village of Bitunia) last Wednesday. For the Israeli taxpayer, this is an expensive substitute for a written summons or a telephone call. The youth was not home but he knew he had to give testimony. And indeed, he did appear the next morning at the trial of Abdullah Abu Rahma who has been held since December 10, 2009, International Human Rights Day, on charges of incitement, throwing stones and organizing and participating in a demonstration without a permit.
Wind in the sails
According to a list supplied to journalists by the spokeswoman of the conference, attendees included representatives of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, the United States, the European Union, Spain, France, Italy, Malta, England, Romania, the Czech republic, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Holland, Austria and Hungary, plus the special envoy of the United Nations secretary general in the region.
The participants did not need a tent in Bil'in to hear Fayyad's doctrine, according to which the struggle for independence involves three paths, which are intertwined and interdependent: the popular (and unarmed) struggle, the building of state institutions, and the political-diplomatic struggle led by the Palestine Liberation Organization. Those present are also familiar with his views about Area C, which he also reiterated at the opening of the conference: It should be opened and projects (which cost money) should be developed there regardless of Israeli policy that forbids this.
The attendees have also heard from him before what he stated there: that his government is demanding that Israel rescind military order No. 1650 concerning the prevention of infiltration (despite the calming words of Hussein a-Sheikh, a senior Fatah activist, who is responsible for the Department of Civilian Affairs in the PA - the Palestinian counterpart of the Israeli Civil administration, which mediates between Palestinian civilians and the military authorities.
By the way, this military order - which the Palestinians consider an expression of Israel's ever-enduring plans for expulsion - has succeeded for the first time in many years in uniting political forces in Gaza. On the day that the Bil'in conference opened, representatives of all the organizations, including Fatah and Hamas, held a rally in Beit Hanun against the order. Senior Fatah official Hisham Abdel Razek and senior Hamas official Ayman Taha made speeches and marched together.
The foreign dignitaries did not stay to hear the other sessions of the conference where words like "apartheid" and "racism" were frequently uttered in the speeches about Israeli policies. They also missed the session broadcast by video from Gaza. There, too, small but determined groups of unarmed activists are trying to challenge the IDF, which constantly fires at a swathe of several hundred meters along the security fence stretching along the border, to keep farmers from working their lands. The Gazan activists insist on going to cultivate the forbidden lands, endangering their lives and health and at the same time adding yet another chapter to the experience of the unarmed Palestinian struggle.
It is possible to interpret the presence, even if it was somewhat brief, of the foreign diplomats at Bil'in as evidencing a kind of support for the popular and unarmed Palestinian struggle, whose declared aims are bringing down the separation fence and dismantling all the settlements.
The declarative combination of Fayyad (who is also finance minister) and representatives from the donor countries is also a sort of answer to the IDF's threats - as were mentioned in a report by Yaakov Katz in The Jerusalem Post last week - to the effect that the army will act to thwart the financial support of the PA for the popular struggle. The IDF, it transpires, is breathing wind into the sails of that very struggle that it is trying by various other means to suppress.

<title>Erekat to Meridor: Without two-state solution by year's end, 'you will sweat' </title>
<date>Sat Jun 26 08:09:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Palestinian Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat warned Friday that if by the end of this year there was no two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian Authority then Israel will "sweat."
"If by the end of this year we do not have a two-state solution, you will sweat, you will sweat," Erekat told Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor who met with him at the International Peace Institute in New York.
The two officials insisted that their appearance was neither an indirect nor a direct negotiation - but it did show the more than 100 United Nations ambassadors, academics, journalists and others in the room how wide the gap still is between the two sides.
Israel has three options, Erekat said. A two-state solution, a single state including Jews and Palestinians, or what he called "a continuation of Israel's racism and apartheid system in the West Bank where Arabs and Christians can't use roads reserved only for Israelis."
"This government of Israel has a choice: settlements or peace," he said. "They can't have both."
He explained that the Palestinian Authority was founded to establish the institutions for a Palestinian state, not to keep Israel as a source of authority forever. "If Israel insists on maintaining control," he said, "the Palestinian Authority cannot stand - it's irrelevant," and he indicated it might be dissolved.
Erekat accused Meridor and the Netanyahu government of refusing to answer key questions: Will Israel begin negotiations where they left off in December 2008, accept East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine and accept the 1967 border as a baseline for a two-state solution?
Meridor said Israel wants to return to direct negotiations with the Palestinians and indicated the talks with U.S. special Middle East envoy George Mitchell were making progress.
"I do hope in the coming weeks negotiations will skip over this strange proximity talks into real talks," he said. "We need to talk to each other and make the tough decisions needed, and if this is done we'll see progress this coming year."
Meridor said, however, that "if there is no full agreement on the outstanding issues of Jerusalem, refugees, final borders and security we will not let the negotiation collapse.It should not be all or nothing. We all wish for all, but if we can't get it, we should be very cautious not to risk everything on that," he said.
"The future of Palestinian refugees is the most crucial issue for Israel," he added. "Any peace agreement that did not settle the refugee issue would mean there is no end to the conflict."
Meridor said Erekat's statement that the Palestinian Authority has no right to negotiate the right of return of the refugees - that the refugees themselves will have to make the choice and they have the right both to return and to compensation - raised major problems.

<title>Ex-U.S. President Carter to start Mideast peace tour </title>
<date>Thu Oct 14 22:53:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter will start a tour of the Middle East on Saturday to build support for a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.Carter, 86, will visit Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories with a delegation called The Elders, to be led by former Irish President Mary Robinson and including former UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi."The aim of their visit is to encourage support across the region for the current final status negotiations with emphasis on the need to reach a just and secure peace," said a statement by The Elders, a group set up by South Africa's Nelson Mandela in 2007.The Palestinians called off direct peace talks with Israel just a few weeks after they began last month after Israel refused to extend a 10-month moratorium on housing starts in Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.Carter has been active in international diplomacy since serving as president from 1977 to 1981. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, in part for his contribution to the 1978 Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt.Jewish groups sharply criticized a book he published on the Middle East in 2006 in which he described Israeli policy in the occupied territories as a "system of apartheid."Carter spent two nights in an Ohio hospital last month for treatment of an upset stomach.

<title>Fayyad to Barak: Israel must show that it is rolling back occupation</title>
<date>Tue Feb 02 22:06:17 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and Defense Minister Ehud Barak made a rare joint appearance at the Herzliya Conference on Tuesday.
Fayyad, the widely respected leader who is credited with the economic turnaround in the West Bank, said ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the only path to security for Israel.
"The roughness of this neighborhood can be reduced if not eliminated if [Israeli] occupation comes to an end," Fayyad said. "I do not believe that there can be permanent peace unless the concept of Palestinian statehood is accepted."
Peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority have stalled since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assumed power last year.
While Netanyahu says his government is prepared to resume talks without preconditions, the Palestinians are insistent that Israel cease all construction in settlements that lie beyond the 1967 armistice lines.
"We are now at state of impasse," Fayyad said. "Everyone knows that. It would appear as though progress had been impeded because there is no formal political process."
"What is required is negotiations based on settled principles," the Palestinian prime minister said.
Fayyad said Israel must demonstrate its seriousness about a two-state solution. "We need to begin to see things that suggest to our people that indeed the occupation is on its way to being rolled back," he said.
The Palestinian leader pointed to his government's institutional build-up as proof that it is cognizant of the burdens inherent in managing the state-in-the-making.
"We Palestinians have resolved to shoulder responsibility of getting ready for statehood," Fayyad said.
The prime minister said West Bank stability was contingent upon an increased security presence in more Palestinian towns.
"In the context of the occupation being rolled back, us Palestinians need to have formal security presence on population centers outside of Area A," Fayyad said, referring to West Bank territories that are under exclusive security and administrative Palestinian control.
Fayyad said one shortcoming of the Oslo Accords was that it failed to recognize the principle of eventual Palestinian statehood.
"The road map is one document that makes a great deal of sense [because] it takes as a given the emergence of a Palestinian state and an end of Israeli occupation," the prime minister said. 
Fayyad said the terms of the road map call for a complete freeze of construction in Israeli settlements, an issue that threatens to prejudice the results of a final-status agreement.
"If settlements continue, the political question is how confident can we be that once relaunched, the political process will be able to deliver on permanent status issues," he said.
Barak said on Tuesday that "if the Palestinians living in the West Bank could, in the future, vote in the Israeli elections, Israel will become a bi-national country." 
"But if they are not allowed to vote," he added, "we will become an apartheid country." 
Barak stated at the Herzliya conference, speaking alongside Palestinian Prime Minster Salam Fayyad, that "the alternatives force us to uphold a border where on one side is a Jewish majority, and on the other side a Palestinian state" 
The defense minister praised the Palestinian Prime Minister for his work, and said that he lead towards practical political thought in the Palestinian Authority.
"We are witness to the fact that the security situation in the West Bank is in good shape, which hasn?t been true for many years, and even the Jewish leaders admit to it," Barak said. 
Commenting on the stagnant negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians Barak said "the negotiations will take time, perhaps a year of two, and a final status agreement could take three years, but it is time to enter negotiations and stop playing games." 
Barak added that "we have accepted the road map and a two state solution."

<title>Fear of peace will be the death of Israel</title>

SHEIKH JARRAH, Jerusalem - As the grandson of anarchists, I've always had a soft spot in my heart for fanatics. Expressions of extremism, and passionately reasoned, exquisitely twisted world views make me feel, how shall I put this, at home.
So it was with a certain relish that I approached the cover story of a recent issue of Commentary, "The Deadly Price of Pursuing Peace," written as it was by a talented colleague and friend, Evelyn Gordon. 
The thrust of the piece, which Commentary Editor John Podhoretz understandably calls "groundbreaking," is that Israel's international standing has plummeted to an unprecedented low - and the number of Palestinians killed by Israel has concurrently soared - specifically because of Israel's having done much too much for peace.
"The answer is unpleasant to contemplate, but the mounting evidence makes it inescapable," she writes. "It was Israel's very willingness to make concessions for the sake of peace that has produced its current near-pariah status."
The essay has the seamless, compellingly elegant, hyper-lucid, parallel universe logic of a hallucination - or a settlement rooted in the craw of the West Bank. Until I read it, it was difficult for me to comprehend the current runaway-freight recklessness of Israeli authorities and a certain segment of the hard right, bolstered by shady funding from abroad.
It was hard to fathom why Israeli police in this quiet hollow of the Arab half of Jerusalem, would choose to openly flout and violate the rulings of an Israeli court. I was unable to grasp why they would manhandle and arrest non-violent demonstrators - among them the executive director of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel - for protesting the official expulsion from their homes of more than two dozen Palestinian families here, driven out and into the street, so that subsidized and sheltered settlers could move in.
It was beyond my understanding why an Israeli government which views the idea of a Palestinian Right of Return as tantamount to annihilation of the Jewish state, would set a legal precedent that paves the way for just such a right. 
Just as I was clueless as to why the Knesset was to vote Wednesday on a bill that would make aiding asylum seekers fleeing African genocide, granting them shelter, medical care, food, a crime subject to up to 20 years in prison.
Or why there were vigorous new campaigns to increase gender segregation at the Western Wall and on public buses, and why women have been arrested and interrogated on suspicion of having worn prayer shawls while praying on their side of a barrier raised so that they would no longer be able to watch their sons' bar mitzvah on the mens' side.
Or why a sudden and ferocious campaign against human rights organizations and charity work agencies in Israel is coinciding with new human rights outrages against Palestinians and foreigners, some of them unable to leave, others forced to.
It was not until I saw the title of the Commentary piece that it all made sense.
The right is terrified of peace. And, in the end, the right's fear of peace will be the death of Israel.
They are afraid of peace, in part, because it threatens the core of what has come to replace other values as the goal of Judaism: permanent settlement of the West Bank. But that is only a part of it.
They are afraid of peace because they are afraid of the world. They dismiss fellow Jews who want to see a two-state solution - a majority of Israelis - as unrealistic, as living in a bubble. The name of the bubble these moderates live in, however, is planet Earth.
The right, meanwhile, wants to wall off Israel as the world's last remaining legally mandated Jewish ghetto. A place where all the rules are different, exit and entry, citizenship and human rights, because the residents within are Jews. A place where non-Jews, dehumanized as congenital Jew-haters, are rendered invisible. A place which, if suffocating and insufferable, still seems safer than the scary world outside.
A place which, because of its walls and its politics and its cowardice, is losing its ability to function as a part of the world, reveling in cheap-shot humiliations of key foreign ambassadors, deliriously proud of its sense that of all the world, including most of its Jews and Israelis - only the right sees the real truth.
This braid of thought was venomously endorsed this week both by an uncharacteristically Kahane-sounding Alan Dershowitz, and the obscenely infantile Im Tirtzu movement. According to them, where Cast Lead was concerned, the real war criminals are Richard Goldstone and Naomi Chazan - two people who are open about their love of Israel, and who have worked their whole adult lives for its well-being.
The fears of the right are not mere devices of rhetoric. The risks of making peace are real. Every bit as real as the risks of failing to make peace.
It all comes down to belief. It comes down to the kind of country the believer wants Israel to be. And for that reason, there is a civil war going on for Israel's soul.
It will not be weaponry that decides this war, but courage. People who care about the direction that Israel is moving, and whose watchword is moderation, would do well to choose one facet of the fight, and join. One place to start, is to support the New Israel Fund and the groups it supports.
Another place to start is this one. At the weekend, challenging the threats of rightist thugs and law-scorning police, the weekly demonstration on behalf of the Palestinian residents of Sheikh Jarrah doubled in size. The police backed down on their vow to break up the protest, and the Kahanists barely showed.
If non-violent peace activism scares the right to this extent, there must be a great deal of power in it.
After all, most Israelis can sense that if peace is to be the enemy, more dangerous even than the threat of war, this is one doomed ghetto.
Things have reached such a devastating point, that for the first time in recent memory, even Ehud Barak is beginning to get it: "The simple truth is, if there is one state" including Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, "it will have to be either binational or undemocratic," Barak told the Herzliya Conference Tuesday.
"If this bloc of millions of Palestinians cannot vote, that will be an apartheid state."
The fear of peace has left Israel as a country which is prepared for nuclear warfare but not for non-violent protest on behalf of Palestinians. The fear of peace, and the blackmail of the right on behalf of settlement, has contorted Israel into a body which, unable to countenance the perils of treating the sickness of occupation, will eventually be killed by it.
Israel's defense minister, for one, is convinced: "The lack of a solution to the problem of border demarcation within the historic Land of Israel - and not an Iranian bomb - is the most serious threat to Israel's future." Follow Bradley Burston on Twitter

<title>Founders' descendants fight to keep city from converting former Tel Aviv religious center </title>
<date>Wed Oct 27 02:10:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Eighty-one years after its founding, the Ohel Shem house in central Tel Aviv is embroiled in litigation, with claimants demanding that the municipality's trusteeship of the asset, which is considered consecrated property designated for religious needs  ("hekdesh" ), be revoked.
Parties responsible for the facility's status as a publicly or religiously beneficial asset are demanding that the municipality's connection to it be severed - the municipality has plans to convert the facility into a theater, whereas the claimants demand that its original purpose as a center for the study of Torah and Jewish religious sources, and of Hebrew literature, be preserved.
"The court is asked in this matter to uphold historical justice, and honor the lifelong purposes and heritage of the late Shmuel and Rivka Blum by nullifying the plans of the Tel Aviv municipality," attorneys David Shoob and Aviad Hacohen wrote on behalf of the claimants. Shoob and Hacohen submitted their clients' claims to the Tel Aviv District Court yesterday.
The litigation relates to an asset whose past is richly intertwined in the city's history. The claimants want to prevent the municipality from allowing the Ohel Shem house, on 30 Balfour Street, to be used by the Orna Porat Theater for Children and Youth.
They argue that such use would violate the facility's designation, and its status as a religiously and publicly endowed asset.
Though this is ostensibly a local conflict about the use of a specific asset, Shoob and Hacohen formulate the claim in a broad manner, as though the litigation is part of a campaign to rectify perceived anti-religious bias in municipal preservation policies.
"The Tel Aviv municipality invests many millions of dollars in projects for the preservation of 'trees and stones,' and yet willingly and knowingly persists with a policy of cultural apartheid that erases entire, splendid chapters in the city's cultural [history]," the claimants argue.
The claimants are Yael Rosenberg, 27, a descendant of the late Rivka and Shmuel Blum, and the Public Committee for the Preservation of Hekdeshot in Tel Aviv.
Shmuel Blum built the Ohel Shem house in 1929 in memory of his wife. At the facility's 1928 dedication, he declared that it would a "permanent center of culture in Tel Aviv, particularly for the dissemination of knowledge of Judaism in all its branches."
Blum promised that the facility would remain open all days of the year, including Sabbath days and Jewish holidays.
The facility's study activities drew an array of participants, including the poet Hayim Nahman Bialik; at its dedication ceremony, Bialik stressed Ohel Shem's special purpose of "sanctifying the Shabbat ... Like the Torah, which is Israel's covenantal book, so too does the Shabbat signify Israel's covenant with God; this house is being established to serve these two holy topics [the Shabbat and Torah]."
Nobody at this dedication ceremony, the claimants' attorneys wrote, "would have imagined in his wildest dreams that several decades later this holy vision would be subverted and eradicated in such a vulgar, brutal and thoughtless fashion by, of all things, a public body, the Tel Aviv municipality, which was entrusted with the house's preservation."
Due to economic problems, the house was registered with the municipality in the 1960s, but the municipality promised to protect its original purposes, which it defined officially as "restoring the glory of the Shabbat." The building remained abandoned for many years, until the municipality started in recent years to make it available to the Orna Porat Theater.
The claimant's father, Zvi Rosenberg, told Haaretz that "this facility was designed to preserve a certain kind of Jewish culture in a framework that existed 70 years ago - this was not exactly a religious or scrupulously Shabbat-observant culture. Its proper use would feature the continued honoring of Jewish tradition. In our view, the relevance of this institution's purpose has not eroded over the years; on the contrary. The desire to be connected with Judaism, with Jewish roots, is increasing. The Shabbat does not belong exclusively to the religious, and this facility should serve a wide public, via lessons devoted to the Hebrew Bible and Jewish philosophy. Since there is such great thirst for such learning, and if the facility was donated for this relevant purpose, why is it being taken and converted for other purposes?"
The Tel Aviv municipality relayed that this is a municipal asset which was allotted eight years ago to the Habima theater but for various reasons, including safety, Habima left the facility. Since then it has remained idle. Recently, it was allotted to the Orna Porat Theater; for the past five months, the facility has been renovated at the theater's expense, and the theater expects to begin using the facility in January. The claim has no substantive basis, and the municipality will respond to it in court."

<title>Free Barghouti Now</title>
<date>Mon Jan 04 15:08:49 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Click here for more articles by Bradley Burston
It's a spellbinding opal of a Saturday afternoon in winter. A number of close friends are tackling the Haaretz weekend quiz, the Hebrew edition of 20 maddeningly arcane and demanding questions. 
They manage to get 16 right. No small feat. The talk then turns to Israeli politics. At last, the question is a  simple one. If there were an election now, who would get your vote? There are 10 people present. Not one of them manages to come up with a single answer.
Moral: If Benjamin Netanyahu plays his cards right, he could be prime minister indefinitely. Not because he's done so well. Rather, because there's no one at all to vote for, and thus, no reason for Israelis to vote. 
Corollary: This may, in fact, be Netanyahu's big chance. In vacuum, there is opportunity. In this context, the time may never be more auspicious for a move that, in its boldness, changes the Mideast subject overnight.
It's time, in short, for Netanyahu to give the Palestinians someone to vote for. Marwan Barghouti.
The Palestinians are at least as deeply disenchanted with their current leadership as Israelis are. Polls show Hamas' popularity continuing to decline. Even in its power base of Gaza, Hamas is no longer viewed by Palestinians as the disciplined, fearless, corruption-free organization which valiantly and efficiently sees to their social welfare and to their personal defense. In an era of  shattered futures, it appears that hatred of Israel's policies can no longer be reliably equated with love of Hamas.
Hamas' blood rival Fatah, meanwhile, has political problems which run even deeper. It is dogged by an aging, graft-tainted, calcified hierarchy, woefully unable to heal the disunity which has crippled the Palestinian drive for statehood.
The decline and death of Yasser Arafat left Palestinians with only one unifying figure, Barghouti. His credibility with his people was established in his role both as a central architect of both Palestinian uprisings, and in his spearheading of drives within Fatah to combat corruption and human rights violations on the part of Arafat's own people. Now, more than ever, Palestinians need Barghouti.
But Israel needs Barghouti as well. He is the key to the future of the two-state solution, and therefore, to an Israel which is democratic without qualification, peaceable without biennial war, demographically Jewish without apartheid, a true neighbor to its neighbors - for once, a full member of the community of nations, economically, diplomatically, and, on the level of one-on-one human interaction.
Israeli leaders who have worked with Barghouti - even some who had him arrested and nearly assassinated - know the potential value to a future peace of his political skills, his standing and charisma among Palestinians, his work on behalf of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in the past.
The senior Israeli security and government officials who have lobbied for Barghouti's release include former senior Shin Bet official and ex-public security minister Gideon Ezra, and cabinet minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, who served as defense minister under Ariel Sharon during the second intifada.
Although known as a relative hawk - as an IDF brigadier general he was once Israel policy chief for the territories - the Iraqi-born Ben-Eliezer has often demonstrated a unique understanding of Israel's Arab negotiating partners. In August, Israel's Channel 10 television quoted Ben-Eliezer as saying that Barghouti "is the only one" capable of bringing the Palestinians to a final-status peace deal with Israel.
There will, of course, be those who will who dismiss and disqualify Barghouti as a terrorist. Most Israelis, however, need look no farther than Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Shamir, and, in fact, Ariel Sharon, to recognize that a tough neighborhood tends to yield statesmen with dark passages in their resume.
Should Barghouti be freed now, and not under the terms of a prisoner exchange for Gilad Shalit, Israel will have deprived Hamas of a central victory in bragging-rights over the release of the Fatah leader.  A stand-alone Israeli decision to free Barghouti is a sign of strength, in stark contrast to caving, hands wrung, to Hamas demands. 
Moreover, the Palestinian center of political gravity and diplomatic momentum would shift overnight back to Fatah and its administration of the West Bank. The release of Barghouti would be an incentive to progress in peace negotiations, and Hamas would find itself hard-pressed to openly oppose, or continue to snipe at and boycott, a Barghouti-led Fatah.
This is a decision which could dramatically alter the Mideast equation. It is one of the few which, under the current political constellation, Netanyahu can carry out. It is one of the first that he should.

 Israel offered to sell South Africa nuclear warheads in 1975, a Guardian newspaper report on secret apartheid-era documents revealed yesterday. The British daily reported that the papers provide the first official evidence of Israel's possession of nuclear weapons. 
 According to the documents, a secret meeting between then-defense minister Shimon Peres and his South African counterpart P.W. Botha produced an offer for Jerusalem to sell nuclear warheads "in three sizes," which may refer to conventional, chemical and atomic weapons. 
 The Guardian reported that the documents surrounding the military agreement between the countries, to be kept under wraps, were uncovered by American scholar Sasha Polakow-Suransky, doing research for a book. 
 The report added that the documents show Pretoria wanted the weapons to keep neighboring states and other enemies from attacking them. 
 The report said Israeli authorities attempted to keep the South African government from declassifying the documents. According to the Guardian, the minutes of the meeting record that "Minister Botha expressed interest in a limited number of units of Chalet subject to the correct payload being available. ... Minister Peres said the correct payload was available in three sizes. Minister Botha expressed his appreciation and said that he would ask for advice."

<title>Iran: World has not done enough to curb Zionist atrocities </title>
<date>Sun Jul 04 15:56:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki on Sunday accused the United Nations of neglecting their responsibility to deal with the "atrocities" of the Zionist regime, according to the Iranian news agency IRNA.
At a ceremony marking 28 years since four Iranians vanished in Beirut - an event Iran claims was orchestrated by Israel - Mottaki said he regarded "Zionists as the worst threat to the Middle East."
"If the UN had adopted a severe stand against the crimes and atrocities of the Zionists in the past, the regime would not have dared to commit new crimes such as targeting Gaza-bound flotilla," Mottaki said.
The Iranian FM was referring to the May raid by Israeli special forces on a Gaza-bond aid flotilla, which resulted in the death of nine of the flotilla participants.
 "The Zionist regime has turned into a source of threat to all nations of the region, endangering peace and security of the world," Mottaki said, adding that the "inhuman crimes committed by the usurper regime in the past six decades in the occupied lands as well as other parts of the region, truly demonstrates the savage nature of the fabricated regime.""The Zionist regime has lost its credibility and legitimacy among world nations and is now on the verge of collapse," Mottaki said, adding that "the Zionist regime like the former apartheid regime in South Africa is doomed to failure and the nations of the region mainly the Palestinians will witness formation of a democratic system in place of the Zionist occupiers."
Mottaki also reiterated Iranian claims that Israel was behind the disappearance of the four Iranian diplomats. Evidence proved that the officials were "kidnapped by the Zionist regime are held in Israeli jails," Mottaki said, urging all Lebanese and Palestinian groups and international organizations to help secure their release.
An Iranian official indicated last week that Iranian lawmakers protesting Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip would join an aid ship destined to leave from Lebanon.Lebanon had said last month that it would allow a Gaza-bound ship called The Julia to sail via Cyprus, despite warnings from Israel that it reserved the right to use all necessary means to stop ships that tried to sail from Lebanon to Gaza.Mahmoud Ahmadi-Beighash, a member of the Iranian parliament's national security and foreign policy committee, said Iranian parliament delegates could sail on the ship rather than attempt to enter Gaza via Egypt."A ship is going from Lebanon to Gaza in the course of the current week and the lawmakers are following up to go to Gaza via this ship," he said in comments carried by semi-official news agency ISNA.

<title>Israel denies offering nuclear weapons to Apartheid South Africa</title>
<date>Mon May 24 01:05:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 
Israel on Monday vehemently rejected claims in a British newspaper that it offered to sell nuclear warheads to Apartheid-era South Africa in 1975.
"There exists no basis in reality for the claims published this morning by The Guardian that in 1975 Israel negotiated with South Africa the exchange of nuclear weapons," the president's office said in a statement.
"Unfortunately, The Guardian elected to write its piece based on the selective interpretation of South African documents and not on concrete facts," said the statement.  "Israel has never negotiated the exchange of nuclear weapons with South Africa. "There exists no Israeli document or Israeli signature on a document that such negotiations took place."
The Guardian newspaper said Sunday that documents uncovered by a U.S. academic during research for a book on Israel's ties with South Africa provided the first hard proof that Israel has nuclear weapons. Israel maintains an official policy of "nuclear ambiguity" over whether it is an atomic power.
The Guardian said documents declassified by South Africa's post-apartheid government at the request of author Sasha Polakow-Suransky included top-secret minutes of meetings between senior officials of the two countries in 1975.
Those papers, the newspaper said, showed that South Africa's defense minister at the time, P.W. Botha, asked warheads and his counterpart Shimon Peres, now Israel's president, offered them in "three sizes". The Guardian claimed that this referred to conventional, chemical and atomic weapons.
Asked about the report, Peres spokeswoman  Ayelet Frisch said: "There is no truth to the Guardian report."
"We regret that the newspaper did not seek a comment from the president's office. If it had done so, it would have discovered that the story is wrong and baseless," she added.
According to the Guardian report, the alleged nuclear deal did not go ahead, partly because of the cost.
Speculation about Israeli-South African nuclear cooperation was raised in 1990 when a U.S. satellite detected a mysterious flash over the Indian Ocean. The U.S. television network CBS reported it was a nuclear test carried out by the two countries.

<title>Israelis are behaving like spoiled rich brats</title>
<date>Sun Mar 21 18:54:53 IST 2010</date>
<content>
The terrifying specter of non-violent resistance to the occupation and the apartheid regime is hovering over the State of Israel, and all the state's dignitaries have been recruited to battle it.
This non-violent resistance operates both in areas under Israel's reign of control, in the form of a popular struggle on both sides of the green line, and across the globe, through the Israeli and international affirmative response to the Palestinian call for boycotts, divestment and sanctions on Israel, until it ends the occupation and grants full equality to people from both nations living under its rule.
As an act of solidarity with the subjugated Palestinian people, a group of Jewish Israelis has decided to join those Palestinians who have chosen the non-violent struggle for civic and national justice.
This act has given politically conscientious Jewish Israelis a golden opportunity to join a campaign against their own government without forsaking their own people. Indeed, this act leads the way towards a broader joint struggle with the oppressed people, through a rebuilding of our fundamental human values, enabling us to do away with the friend/foe dichotomy, which lies at the root of Israeli racism and anxiety.
One should hope that this non-violent resistance, led by a popular Palestinian leadership, will evolve into a binational Palestinian-Jewish front for an equitable and egalitarian political solution.
Right-wing groups and government organs have joined forces with all their might at the face of this new adversary who has risen up to challenge the decades-long racist theft of land from one ethnic group and its transfer into the hands of another. This is not surprising.
It is the hysterical reaction coming from so-called "leftist" circles which ought to be considered more surprising. Those "liberals" prefer to march, shamed and humiliated, alongside the Netanyahu-Barak-Lieberman triangle, than associate themselves with enlightened Palestinians. 
From their viewpoint, violating a Tel Avivian's right to listen to Elton John in concert here is equivalent to, and possibly worse than, violating a Palestinian farmer's right to cultivate his land. They accuse the "radicals" of opposing dialogue, though the support for the non-violent struggle and the boycott campaign is precisely what has breathed new life into the cooperation between action groups from both nations.The call issued to rock musicians not to perform in Israel, which has elicited angry responses in Israel, is aimed at thwarting the normalization of occupation and apartheid, a normalization reflected in the insouciant everyday life of the city of Tel Aviv.
The majority of Jewish Israelis are complicit in the perpetuation of the current state of affairs. When growing groups of conscientious people refuse to play the game of building a fictitious democratic sand castle on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Israeli Jew behaves like a spoiled rich brat, who would rather destroy his own castle than see natives share his world and his dreams. 
As long as the Jewish settler who is sitting on the plundered land of Bil'in, and the contractor from uptown Tel Aviv who is making a fortune from building on that land, are free to go to the Pixies concert, while the original inhabitants of Bil'in are prevented from doing so, simply because they are Arab - the concert should be regarded as an apartheid concert.
Neither establishment-drafted artists nor the President of the Israel's Supreme Court can erase this sign of infamy from the collective face of Israeli society. Only those modest, yet determined, groups of individuals who have joined the non-violent Palestinian struggle can succeed  in this. On that day, instead of smearing them as "irrelevant", "puritan", "condescending" and "self-hating", the following statement will apply to them: never was so much owed by so many to so few.

<title>Jerusalem & Babylon / A year in  the bubble </title>
<date>Wed Sep 08 02:14:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
I had lunch this week with an old acquaintance who is working now as a lawyer in one of the departments of the Justice Ministry. Despite smiling throughout our meal, he found it hard to suppress his rage when talking about the media. Being subjected to diatribes in the press is an occupational hazard, but for once, I felt that I agreed with him.
"Every paper and radio channel I opened over the last two months has been talking about 1,200 children of illegal immigrants," he said. "And I know that this is a tragedy for them but at the same time we are doing nothing in any way about the tens of thousands of refugees coming in from the south every year, people to whom we have both a moral and legal duty as UN-recognized refugees from a war zone in Sudan. But in the media you are just obsessed about this minor affair because children singing are sexy and people are worried about how it will look if Israel deports children."
His words echoed those of a battalion commander on the Egyptian border I met last month. "There really is no way to turn them back," he said. "We have seen what the Egyptian guards do to them if they catch them. My soldiers just take cover when the Egyptians start shooting, then if any of the wounded still get over the border, we send them to hospital."
Both men are right and the reality they are dealing with is one we are busy running away from, preferring to deal with more simple moral issues. The entire Israeli media, and even such celebrated Jewish luminaries from abroad as Elie Wiesel, have focused on the 400 children who currently fall outside the new residency boundaries. They prefer to ignore the fact that in its 63rd year of independence, the Jewish State still relies on an outdated law, based on Nazi racial ideology, to define its national concept of citizenship and identity.
Tendency to tunnel vision 
Looking back on a year of news coverage  (this is a Rosh Hashanah column, after all ), our collective inability to look outside our little Israeli bubble seems to be the main characteristic. To be honest, that would probably be true of most of the last 62 years, but I don't think the dissonance between Israelis' self-image as globalized, cosmopolitan citizens of the world - and our tendency to tunnel vision - has ever been so pronounced. This isn't just about us looking at events solely from the local prism - as opposed to seeing us as outsiders do  (all too often these foreign observers are prisoners of bubbles of their own ), I am referring to our increasing failure to look at the wider picture of just about anything.
Take the stories that have dominated the news over the past month, from the most serious to the seemingly frivolous. Let's begin with the so-called "Galant document," the story that one of the editors at this paper said "saved August for us." The nasty rivalry that has poisoned the highest ranks of Israel's defense establishment is naturally more than simply that, and the hyperbole about "a breaking of the nation's trust in the IDF" was partially warranted.
But aside from a tiny handful of columnists, the public debate totally disregarded the fact that the ongoing saga demonstrates just how skewed the relationship between the army's high command and its supposed civilian overseers is. No matter how central a role the armed forces play in Israeli society, such an imbalance cannot be allowed to persist in a democracy. Yet if you learn a bit about the clashes between David Ben-Gurion and the generals of 1948, the only conclusion is that we have actually gone backward in most regards of civilian oversight. Despite all this, recent polls prove that the public still trusts the IDF above all other institutions.
Staying with the army, we had the photo album of Eden Abergil, the young woman who shocked the blogosphere and became an overnight international sensation thanks to two photographs from her army days in which she was seen grinning with bound and blindfolded Palestinian prisoners. Commentators were quick to blame her for yet another blow to Israeli hasbara and the IDF Spokesman had a field day castigating her for conduct the violated the army's "ethical code."
It was left to human rights groups such as B'Tselem and Breaking the Silence to remind us that Eden was not the one to blame, but 43 years of occupation during which - like it or not - generations of Israelis ceased to see the other side as human beings. This is not a political issue of left and right and it transcends the debate on the future of Israeli presence in the West Bank - small wonder that we moved on after 48 hours.
Missing the point 
The "big" story of the month seemed to be the summit in Washington and the opening of direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians. The "big" question that everyone was asking was "has Netanyahu crossed the rubicon?" Yet another escape from reality. I admit that I, like everyone else, spent time pondering this question until I participated in an international panel of "experts" on Al Jazeera last week. I belatedly realized after hearing the Palestinian representative that Benjamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas may by now be in the same camp. Around them, the forces fighting for one state, be it Jewish apartheid-style or binational "right of return" chaos, are gradually gaining the upper hand.
I'm not saying that the two-state solution is totally lost - at least I hope it isn't - but the question of whether it is still salvageable is far more important than how well Bibi and Abu Mazen can get along.
And now, for hopefully the last story of the silly season, ironically, the argument over when to end summer time. This was naturally framed as yet another state vs. religion clash, a question of who rules our lives, down to the very time of day, but that is an oversimplification. Finance Minister and former philosopher Yuval Steinitz for once got it right when he said that he doesn't see why anyone needs to make such a fuss about something that in macroeconomic terms makes only a negligible difference.
On a scale of all the unresolved issues of Jewish identity bedeviling Israel, this really is probably the least important. If Israelis who fast on Yom Kippur feel that it makes it psychologically easier to do so if clocks are set back in advance, then indulging them is worth the very minor nuisance of going back to winter time while still sweltering from a hamsin.
If we are about to launch the long overdue kulturkampf over Israel's future identity, let's try and make it a fight for something real. Here's to a year of trying to see outside the bubble.

<title>Jerusalem & Babylon / Demons on the streets of Israel </title>
<date>Fri Dec 24 02:27:30 IST 2010</date>
<content>
 Almost 30 years ago, my father employed a computer programmer who was an early and prominent support of Rabbi Meir Kahane's Kach party. Innocently, I once asked him how an educated man, an accomplished linguist and mathematician, could support racism. "Jews can't be racist," he answered. "We allow anyone to convert and become a Jew and once he is a Jew, he is equal to us in every way. So how can anyone say we are racists?" 
 I have learned a few things since then. Among them, that having an education is no bar to holding obscene views, and that racism is not technically just about race. But the idea that Jews cannot really be racist is far from being a fringe belief. The reasoning behind this is not just theological. 
 Two millennia of persecution have ingrained us with the knowledge that whenever there is racism around, we will be on the receiving end. True, the Torah includes exhortations to exterminate whole nations, men, women and children, but those are relics of an ancient time with no relevance to today's world. Or so we tell ourselves. 
 Most of the disparaging references to non-Jews in the Talmud were censored out a thousand years ago, mainly for fear of provoking more persecution. Racism always seemed like a luxury that a downtrodden minority group could not afford. Early Zionism may have ascribed to the notion of a "land without a people," disregarding the Arab inhabitants of the land, but this was originally an English Christian notion and by the time 1948 was here, the new Jewish state enshrined equality for members of all races and faiths in its founding declaration. 
 Sure, 63 years later we still have not yet got around to ensuring that Arab citizens enjoy equal access to land, resources, employment, education and budgets, but we see that as just one more problem that our facile politicians and small-minded bureaucrats have yet to solve. Racists? Us? Have we not we given homes and livelihoods to millions of immigrants, many of them non Jews by any standard? William Safire wrote in the New York Times after the airlifting of the Beta Yisrael from Ethiopia became public that "for the first time in history, thousands of black people are being brought to a country not in chains but in dignity, not as slaves but as citizens." Yes, not everyone wants their children to learn with them in the same school, but that's only because they have so much to catch up, that they bring down the academic level. And the segregation between Sephardi and Ashkenazi girls in Haredi schools? That's only some weird religious observance issue. 
 After 1967, Israel assumed control of the lives of millions of Palestinians, without civil rights, and after three generations of Israelis became accustomed to letting Jewish settlers through roadblocks and stopping Arabs, and mainstream state-employed rabbis began channeling biblical hatreds, we still convince ourselves it is a result of the existential nationalist conflict between us and them. They were the ones who shouted Itbach al-Yahud [slaughter the Jews], treated prisoners inhumanely and attacked Jews worldwide whenever tensions boiled over in the Middle East. We sent sophisticated field hospitals to Haiti after the earthquake. Two weeks ago, when dozens of rabbis signed the letter against renting apartments to Arabs, former Knesset Member Rabbi Haim Druckman proposed to change the wording. Instead of Arabs, he proposed "hostile elements trying to take advantage of the equality between loyal citizens, realize the 'right of return' and banish us from our land." Anything to maintain the illusion. 
 Well, finally the racist cat is out of the bag. The demonstrations in South Tel Aviv and Bat Yam against foreigners living in their neighborhoods can no longer be interpreted as anything else. 
 The group of teenagers that systematically hunted down Arabs on the streets of Jerusalem is not just a freak occurrence. The xenophobia is no longer political, or even solely religious. Rabbis stood by women in shorts at the demonstrations. Veteran Kach members such as MK Michael Ben-Ari were there, but so was Kadima MK Yoel Hasson. Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai, a member of Labor, said the demonstration in his city was "understandable." I wonder how he understood the booing and jeering that greeted an Ethiopian immigrant speaker until he assured his listeners that he was Jewish and then called for the Sudanese to be deported back to their land. 
 The failure of successive governments to secure the border with Egypt, impose consistent regulation on the import and abuse of foreign labor and, above all, to develop coherent and up-to-date immigration and citizenship legislation, has finally unmasked the demons that were always lurking close beneath the surface. Finally, we have the damning proof that in hurtling down the slippery slope between legitimate concerns over immigration and downright hatred of foreigners, Jews are no different from the goyim. 
 There is a lesson to be learned here from the Diaspora. The parties of the far right in Europe have shed their old neo-Nazi ties and recast themselves as anti-immigration and especially anti-Muslim. In doing so, they have tried to court the local Jewish communities, citing joint concerns over anti-Semitic attacks. By and large, these overtures have been shunned; most Jewish leaders responsibly knew where to draw the line between speaking out against Muslim hate crimes and the resulting racist backlash. Some of those very politicians who would never be allowed on any respectable platform in their own countries were welcomed here last month and taken on a tour of the settlements. 
 Israel, for all its faults, is not a predominantly racist or Apartheid-like country. But there has been a continuing failure of Israeli society as a whole to recognize victimhood in others; to understand that there were other genocides in the 20th century that need commemorating other than the Holocaust; that while an entire nation hopes to see Gilad Shalit returned to his family, there are 10,000 mothers on the other side who see their imprisoned sons as fighters and not murderers; and to realize that no amount of PR can ever change the impression made by 43 years of occupation of another people. These demons have been unleashed on our streets. 
 The government has a duty, finally, to build the southern border fence, to find ways to integrate some of the illegal immigrants and find alternative solutions for the rest, but all of us have a duty to ourselves - to admit we can also be racists.

<title>Justice to Irish Nobel laureate: Keep Gaza propaganda out of courtroom</title>
<date>Mon Oct 04 13:52:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
An Irish Nobel peace laureate accused Israel of being an apartheid state during a deportation hearing before the country's Supreme Court Monday, prompting a strong rebuke from a justice who told her to keep her propaganda to herself.
Mairead Corrigan Maguire is under a 10-year ban from entering Israel because of her attempt to breach the Gaza naval blockade aboard a vessel in June. She was detained last Tuesday upon landing at Tel Aviv international airport but appealed the move and asked the court to allow her into Israel to join a women's human rights delegation.
Maguire, her face pale and twitching, called on Israel to cease what she called its "apartheid policy against the Palestinian people."
"This is no place for propaganda," Justice Asher Grunis retorted and cut her off. The session ended soon thereafter.
The government opposed a court-proposed compromise that Maguire be allowed to join the delegation for two days and then leave. The court is expected to rule later Monday.
The comments were unlikely to endear Maguire to the court.
Her lawyers said they expected Maguire to be deported, but the incident is likely to further batter Israel's image abroad. Interior ministry officials say Maguire knew she would not be allowed into the country but sought to provoke an incident.
Jody Williams of the Nobel Women's Initiative, which sponsored the delegation, denied they were aware of the ban. But earlier in the year, Israel's foreign ministry denied the group's appeal to ease the ban and let Maguire take part in the delegation that arrived last week.
The 66-year-old activist won the peace prize in 1976 for her efforts to end sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.
Israel has banned other pro-Palestinian activists from entering the country, including Jewish-American linguist Noam Chomsky in May. The government later said that was a mistake.

<title>Lebanon PM: Israel's loyalty oath akin to South Africa apartheid</title>
<date>Thu Oct 21 15:46:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Lebanese Prime Minister Sa'ad Hariri on Sunday condemned as racist Israel's controversial amendment to the citizenship bill, which would require non-Jews seeking citizenship to pledge allegiance to Israel as a "Jewish and democratic state".
Hariri also said that the law would make ongoing peace talks with the Palestinians unbearable. He compared the law to practices in apartheid-era South Africa and warned it would encourage extremism.
The Lebanese premier urged the EU to persuade Israel not to apply it.
Cabinet members approved the amendment two weeks ago by a majority. The amendment is one of the promises Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made to Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beitenu party in the coalition agreements.
Since coming into government Yisrael Beitenu has advanced a long list of "loyalty" laws, which many consider to be discriminatory against Israel's Arab citizens.

<title>Lieberman: Israel's gestures to Palestinians met with 'slaps in the face'</title>
<date>Thu May 13 01:20:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Israel's many gestures to the Palestinians have been reciprocated by "slaps in the face," Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said yesterday. Speaking to Haaretz by telephone from Japan, Lieberman said that "we took the unilateral step of deciding on a moratorium, a construction freeze in Judea and Samaria. We recognized two states for two peoples. We removed a dramatic number of roadblocks."
He said that "I think we made countless gestures, and what did we get in return? The glorification of terror." He added that "the day before Israel's acceptance by the OECD, [Palestinian Authority Prime Minister] Salam Fayyad approached dozens of countries with a request to sabotage that acceptance. They keep going on with their stories about war crimes during Operation Cast Lead in Gaza. After all, [PA President] Mahmoud Abbas himself called and asked us, pressured us to continue the military campaign and overthrow Hamas."
Lieberman insisted that no agreement exists to freeze construction in East Jerusalem, that the United States has not dictated anything to Israel. He called the issue "a misunderstanding."
In response to the statement yesterday by Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch that the police will continue to demolish illegal homes in East Jerusalem despite the proximity talks with the Palestinians, Lieberman said that "there is one law for everyone, and we can't disobey court decisions."
With regard to Fayyad's statement that a Palestinian state would be established unilaterally in the summer of 2011, Lieberman said that "I'm not interested in what Salam Fayyad declares. His pronouncements are not aimed at establishing a Palestinian state but rather to augment his political power."
Asked whether he had met recently with Fayyad, he said "No, God forbid .... I don't think now is the right time for talks."
With regard to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's meeting with the head of Hamas' political wing, Khaled Meshal, Lieberman said that "it's not new, but it's certainly an escalation, and we certainly see it as a very negative step."
 
Mr. Lieberman, is there no agreement to freeze building in Jerusalem?
There is no such agreement.
The Americans are lying?
Well no. Look, I think this is simply a misunderstanding. We aren't being contrary with anyone, including the Americans. We're not being contrary and we won't accept any dictates. The ordinary processes of life go on and we're not going to interrupt them.
But if the Americans come out and say there is a construction freeze, could it be that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised it to them and you don't know anything about it?
No. I think Bibi explained that there are procedures that will take such-and-such an amount of time and we'll go along with the acceptable things; it will be now just like it was before.
A representative of your party Yisrael Beiteinu, Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch, has announced that the police will continue to demolish Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem despite the proximity talks. Do you think this is the correct action to take?
It's hard for me to comment on something I haven't heard about while I'm in Japan, but there is one law for everyone, and we can't disobey court decisions. Usually in such a ruling it's only possible to carry out demolitions after all the appeals are over. I don't believe there is an enlightened country in the world that will say it doesn't want to carry out court decisions. Again, we are not being contrary, but no one expects us to interrupt our lifestyle and stop obeying court orders.
There is a court order that has been renewed time and again: to demolish the settler building in Silwan, Beit Yonatan. And it is not being carried out.
I think that every court order should be executed, and I've also been questioned about East Jerusalem and why Jews are building there. I asked one simple question in return: Let's imagine that the Israeli government decides to forbid Arabs in the eastern part of the city from buying or renting apartments in the west; what will they say about Israel in the enlightened world? That we are racist, an apartheid regime. But no one can imagine the Israeli government forbidding Arabs from East Jerusalem from living in the west. Today there are thousands of Arabs from the eastern part of the city living in the western part, and we don't see any problem with that.
It's a problem to equate private individuals with a country's takeover of disputed land.
Listen, we can't forbid anyone ... it's impossible that the Israeli government will forbid Jews of all people from building or buying in East Jerusalem. With all due respect to the proximity talks, they can't stop the processes of normal life.
That is, from your point of view, there's no room to make a goodwill gesture with regard to these talks?
I think we've made many gestures and all we've gotten in response are slaps in the face. As you remember, we took the unilateral step of deciding on a moratorium, a construction freeze in Judea and Samaria. We recognized two states for two peoples. We removed a dramatic number of roadblocks and allowed Fatah to hold a conference in Bethlehem.
Cooperation with Tony Blair led to [economic] growth of 8 to 9 percent in Judea and Samaria, while the rest of the world was in crisis. I think we made countless gestures, and what did we get in return? The glorification of terror, streets named after Yihyeh Ayash and Dalal Mughrabi. And they try to incite against us and cut us down in every international forum.
The day before Israel's acceptance by the OECD, [Palestinian Prime Minister] Salam Fayyad approached dozens of countries with a request to sabotage that acceptance. They keep going on with their stories about war crimes during Operation Cast Lead in Gaza. After all, [Palestinian President] Mahmoud Abbas himself called and asked us, pressured us to continue the military campaign and overthrow Hamas. And how many days later did he complain to the International Court in The Hague? And they keep on doing this.
How do you feel about Fayyad's announcement that he is working to unilaterally establish a Palestinian state?
I'm not interested in what Salam Fayyad declares. His pronouncements are not aimed at establishing a Palestinian state but rather to augment his political power. It's no secret that there's a lot of tension between Salam Fayyad and Fatah, and it's clear that all his pronouncements are meant to build his personal position, and political power for Salam Fayyad. It's clear that he has a lot of political ambition and he has apparently started to come out publicly and build a position for himself.
Which means you don't believe that a state will materialize?
He no doubt knows better than anyone that it's very much not worth it to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state. It's obvious to him, and he is aware of this better than you or me. He only stands to lose from such an event.
Why? Even if Europe recognizes it?
Never mind, he's on top of things and believe me he's very well aware of reality and there's no reason to think he'll act unilaterally.
I don't see what he has to lose.
The moment he starts unilateral actions, we will too, and it's obvious that on balance he will lose.
What kind of unilateral actions?
There are enough, we have a large arsenal of steps, you don't need examples.
Annexing territory?
Never mind, but believe me he knows for sure.
Wow. Have you spoken to him yourself?
No, God forbid.
Why 'God forbid'?
Because I don't think now is the right time for talks.
The prime minister says that Iran is trying to provoke a war between us and Syria. What do you think about this statement?
It's nothing new. The Iranians are always trying to tell Syria directly, and by passing on lies through Hezbollah, that we're going to attack at any moment. There's no doubt that they are happy that the attention given to their nuclear developments is moving on to a quarrel between us and Syria. I think the penny has dropped for the Syrians, too, and they understand these tricks.
It's not in the Syrians' interest?
No, definitely not.
The strategic affairs minister has mentioned that a military option exists to deal with Iran. How close are we to this?
I think there is no need to talk about any military option, and the Iranian problem is not Israeli, it's a problem for the entire world. But we definitely need to keep this option on the table. I expect first of all for clear and tough decisions by the UN Security Council.
That's the best way, there is an understanding now, and a readiness on the part of the international community. I hope we can reach this understanding at the moment of truth, which is clear to everyone right now.

<title>Lieberman: Peace talks must reassess Israeli-Arabs' right to citizenship</title>
<date>Sun Sep 19 11:27:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Israeli Arab politicians responded furiously Sunday to Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman's suggestion suggesting that "disloyal" members of that sector should take Palestinian citizenship.
The question of Israel's citizens needs to be one of the central issues on the negotiating table, in light of the Palestinian refusal to recognize Israel as a Jewish state," Lieberman said ahead of Sunday's weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem.
Recognizing Israel as uniquely Jewish is one of the key demands by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the latest peace talks with the Palestinians, which began earlier this month.
"We can't continue to ignore issues like that of Hanin Zuabi, who identifies completely with the other side," Lieberman said, , referring to an Israeli Arab member of Knesset was stripped of her parliamentary privileges after sailing aboard a pro-Palestinian aid convoy attacked by Israel en route to the Gaza Strip.
"It's as if someone sells you a flat and then demands that his mother-in-law continues living there," he said. "Any Israeli you takes pride in his citizenship should be able to serve in any post, but people like Hanin Zuabi should in my opinion be Palestinian citizens elected under Hamas in Gaza."
In response to Lieberman's remarks, Zuabi declared: "We [Israeli Arabs] represent the only possible democratic option, while Lieberman represents apartheid and ethnic cleansing."
"Lieberman bases his claims on a doctrine of racism, while I base mine on the principle of full equality among citizens – but both of us agree that there needs to be a discussion on the question of Palestinians in Israel and how to classify the state in any negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians," she added.
MK Ahmed Tibi pointedly referred to Lieberman's status as an immigrant from the former Soviet Union, saying: "We aren't calling for the expulsion of citizens from within the State of Israel, but if we were, then whoever got here in the last century should leave first."
"It is very serious that the deputy prime minister is a settler who is constantly concerned with programs pertaining to the expulsion of citizens or the collective expropriation of citizenship," he said.
"We were here before the fascist immigrant Lieberman and we will stay here even after him," Tibi declared.
Israeli Arab MK Mohammed Barakeh said his sector just wanted to "live with hםnor and in equality in our own homes."
Lieberman, whose ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party campaigned under the slogan "no loyalty, no citizenship", has made national allegiance a central component of his political agenda, demanding all Israelis, swear an oath of loyalty to the state.
The foreign minister's remarks came just days after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak dismissed as "unnecessary" Israel's demand to be recognized by the Palestinians as a Jewish.
"I say to Israeli citizens, including Jews, Muslims and others, that there is no such thing as a state in which all the citizens are Jews," Mubarak said. "In Egypt, we have Muslims, Christians and Jews and there is no problem. When they wanted to establish a Muslim state in Kosovo, the world came out against it because it did not want a Muslim state in central Europe."
Israeli Arabs make up around a fifth of the country's population.

<title>Lieberman: Talks must tackle Israeli Arabs' citizenship </title>
<date>Mon Sep 20 01:15:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
The Palestinians' refusal to recognize Israel as a Jewish state should be "one of the central topics on the negotiating table," Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Sunday, causing an uproar among Knesset members outraged by his suggestion that Israeli citizens who fail to demonstrate loyalty to the state should be transferred to Palestinian territory.
"This is a subject that we've run away from until now, but we can't go on like this. It's as if someone were selling you an apartment on the condition that his mother-in-law continue living there," Lieberman said ahead of Sunday's cabinet meeting. "Every Israeli citizen who accepts his or her citizenship with pride can serve in any position, but people like Hanin Zuabi need to be Palestinian citizens. They can go run for election in Gaza under Hamas."
Zuabi is a Balad party lawmaker who participated in the Turkish aid flotilla to Gaza in May.
Zuabi said in response, "We represent the only possible democratic option, while Lieberman represents apartheid and ethnic cleansing." The foreign minister's remarks "are based on a racist creed, while ours rests on the principle of full equality for citizens. We both agree, however, that the question of the Palestinians in Israel and all matters regarding the definition of the state are related to the talks between Israelis and Palestinians."
Hadash chairman Mohammed Barakeh said, "We never sold the apartment. We stayed in the apartment, which he has taken over. We are asking to live in dignity and equality in our own home."
Ahmed Tibi, chairman of the United Arab List-Ta'al, said, "It is grave when the deputy prime minister is a settler who constantly talks about deporting citizens or collectively appropriating citizenship. We were here before Lieberman the fascist immigrant, and we'll be here after him.
"We're not talking about banishing citizens from the State of Israel, but if we are, then let's have those who arrived last leave first. The first stumbling block to a final-status agreement and equal rights is the settlers, not indigenous Arab citizens," Tibi said.
Minority Affairs Minister Avishay Braverman said, "Lieberman's racist remarks harm the sensitive social fabric between Jews and Arabs, and only cause damage to the State of Israel."

<title>Likud MK: Israeli public fed up with lunatic fringe that controls theater, cinema</title>
<date>Sat Nov 06 20:11:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
"The vast majority of the Israeli public is fed up with the lunatic fringe that has gained control of Israeli theater and cinema," MK Yariv Levin (Likud) said on Saturday in response to a letter sent on Friday by dozens of theater figures to Be'er Sheva theater actors urging them to boycott the newly built arts center in the West Bank settlement of Ariel.
Levin said he would initiate an emergency session of the Knesset Education Committee in order to set new criteria for support of cultural institutions, so that state funds would not go to boycotters.
"The new criteria will focus on promoting works that express our magnificent culture and heritage," Levin said. "It's time to put an end to taxpayer funds going directly into the pockets of fringe elements that use the funds to promote an anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish narrative while boycotting the public that finances them."
MK Otniel Schneller (Kadima), who lives in the Ma'aleh Machmesh settlement, said that political leaders needed to inform the actors that Ariel is part of a settlement bloc that will remain part of Israel in any peace agreement with the Palestinians.
The Be'er Sheva theater company is scheduled to perform in Ariel on the cultural center's opening night this week.
In September a group of theater actors and public figures signed a petition saying they would not perform in the new Ariel center as a protest of Israel's settlement policies. The protest was supported by over 150 academics.
"Ariel is not just another community," the letter sent on Friday said, stressing that the actors were about to perform in the cultural center that was erected in Ariel on occupied land. "Just several kilometers from the thriving and flourishing Ariel, Palestinians live in refugee camps, in harsh living conditions and without any basic human right. Not only are they not entitled to see performances in Ariel, some of them have no access to running water."
The letter added that the two contrasting realities of Ariel and the Palestinian refugees constituted "an apartheid nation."
Among the signatories of the current letter to the Be'er Sheva Theater are several prominent theater and culture figures such as film director Eitan Fux, artist and critic Yair Garbuz, television director and activists Doron Tzabari, theatre director Yehoshua Sobol and others.

<title>Livni: Loyalty oath amendment is 'politics at its worst'</title>
<date>Sun Oct 10 15:27:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Leader of the opposition and Kadima chairwoman Tzipi Livni condemned on Sunday the cabinet's approval of a controversial amendment to the Citizenship Law requiring non-Jews seeking citizenship to pledge allegiance to Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.
"What we have seen today is politics at its worst. The sensitive issue of Israel's existence as a Jewish and democratic state has become subject to political horse-trading."
"It is essential that we maintain Israel's status as a Jewish state with equal rights for all its citizens. This proposal contributes nothing to this goal. On the contrary, it will cause internal conflict and damage [Israel's image in the world]."
Israeli Arab MK Ahmed Tibi attacked earlier on Sunday the cabinet's approval of the amendment.
"The government of Israel has become subservient to Yisrael Beiteinu and its fascist doctrine," said Tibi. "No other state in the world would force its citizens or those seeking citizenship to pledge allegiance to an ideology."
"Israel has proven that it is not equal and is a democracy for Jews and not for Arabs," he added.
The amendment is one of the promises Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made to Yisrael Beitenu in the coalition agreements. Since coming into government Yisrael Beitenu has advanced a long list of "loyalty" laws, which many consider to be discriminatory against Israel's Arab citizens.
Yisrael Beiteinu was enthusiastic over the cabinet's majority vote, calling it "an important message to all those, both inside and outside, who seek to question the State of Israel's existence as the national state of the Jewish people."
Meretz chairman MK Haim Oron also condemned the amendment on Sunday, saying that "time and again it is evident that the government has adopted Lieberman's agenda in its entirety."
Oron added that the government has sunk into a "moral and political abyss."
Hadash chairman Mohammed Barakeh blamed on Sunday Netanyahu and Barak for supporting and promoting "mega-racist legislation."
Israeli Arab MK Talab al-Sana said on Sunday that "the amendment is a serious blow to democracy and will cause the exclusion of 20 percent of the country's citizens... [It] will situate Israel as the successor of Apartheid-era South Africa."
The cabinet voted Sunday by a majority in favor of the amendment, which was submitted by Justice Minister Ya'akov Ne'eman. But ministers had been divided on the issue since it was first raised.
At the last minute, Ne'eman had suggested amending the draft to require Jews to sign a similar loyalty oath. Defense Minister Ehud Barak submitted an amendment of his own to the draft, demanding it include mention of  "Jewish and democratic state in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence of [1948]."
Barak insisted that adding a reference to the Declaration of Independence "would be the best way to reflect the fundamental values of the State of Israel."
This slight change to include the declaration "would not harm the Arab minority," he said, noting that similar declarations are common in many countries in the world.
Most Labor politicians opposed the bill, including Isaac Herzog and Avishay Braverman, who lead the opposition, and Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, who was absent from the meeting but left a letter in which he expresses his opposition.
Minister Shalom Simhon (Labor) also skipped the meeting, as he was abroad on a business trip.
Herzog told Haaretz late Saturday that the resounding support for such an amendment showed that "fascism was devouring the margins of society."
"We are on a most dangerous slippery slope," he warned.
Likud ministers Dan Meridor and Benny Begin were expected to try and dissuade their cabinet colleagues from supporting the amendment.
Meridor led an assault on the amendment and warned that such an amendment to the law could severely damage relations with the Arab population in Israel.
Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin was also opposed to the bill, declaring: "The students of Jabotinsky see no need for such bill. I am a fervent Zionist, and I need no strengthening of my belief. The establishment of a Jewish state in the Land of Israel was an ethical act that the world recognized, and it gained great respect when we described our country as Jewish and democratic. This description is also anchored specifically in the Declaration of Independence and the Law on Elections, and any additions of this type can only be harmful."
"This law will not assist us as a society and a state. On the contrary, it could arm our enemies and opponents in the world in an effort to emphasize the trend for separatism or even racism within Israel," Rivlin said.
"I am not opposed to saying each morning and evening that we are a Jewish and democratic state, but why do we need this law?" Rivlin said.
Interior Minister Eli Yishai said, meanwhile, that he would propose his own bill that strip citizenship off of anyone convicted of disloyalty to the state.
"Declarations are not enough in the fact against incidents such as [MKs] Azmi Bishara and Hanin Zoabi," Yishai said in reference to two Israeli Arab lawmakers, one who is suspected of having contacts with enemy states and the other who took part in a Gaza-bound aid flotilla. "Anyone who betrays the state will lose his citizenship."

<title>Mass demonstration in Bil'in marks five years  of protests against West Bank separation fence </title>
<date>Sun Feb 21 02:07:07 IST 2010</date>
<content>
On the fifth anniversary of the start of demonstrations against the separation fence, nearly 1,000 protesters gathered on Friday in Bil'in, dwarfing the weekly protests that usually draw 100-200 demonstrators. Rallying demonstrators from the radical left and a large portion of the local village population, the mass protest took on a near festive character, with the participation of Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.  
The world's media was also there in large numbers to cover the anniversary, as was Al Jazeera, the Arabic satellite television station that is there every Friday broadcasting the demonstrations. Overlooking the site more than 20 television crews took up position, and many dozens of journalists and photographers too.  
The strong media presence highlights the fact that over the past five years Bil'in has become a symbol of the Palestinian struggle against the separation fence, which has great media appeal.  
Each of the participants in the event had a role to play, and each was prearranged with diligence. Ro'i Wenger, one of the leftist protesters who is a regular at the Bil'in demonstrations, gathered together the many Israeli protesters - mostly in their 20s or younger, wearing T-shirts comparing Israel's policies to apartheid - at a home in the center of the village, across from a mosque with a sign of the "Popular Struggle."  
"We celebrate five years to the demonstrations in Bil'in," Wenger tells the young protesters packed in one of the rooms. "Popular demonstrations organized by the Palestinians against the fence," he adds.  
But the organization is controlled by a very small group of locals and Israelis, who coordinate events in an exemplary fashion and even have people directing the media vehicles into a parking lot. One of the local activists, Abdullah Abu Rahma, in whose home the briefing is being held, is under arrest in Israel. He was arrested in one of the IDF's evening raids.  
The villagers of Bil'in say that the fence, which passes near their community, prevents access to some 90 percent of their land, estimated at 2,000 dunams (some 500 acres). A Supreme Court ruling has ordered the Defense Ministry to move the fence, restoring 700 dunams to the village. The activists insist that they will not cease protesting until the fence is razed.  
Senior IDF officers of the Judea and Samaria Division insist that the protests in Bil'in are anything but popular, and claim that it is a drama created by a small number of activists who, along with Israeli and foreign volunteers benefiting from contributions from international peace groups, are stirring up trouble and profiting from it too. As evidence to their allegations, the officers point to a number of recently refurbished homes and new SUVs belonging to the activists.  
The activists maintain that their demonstrations are peaceful. However, youths were preparing slingshots, and took up positions in front of an IDF checkpoint on the other side of the fence, throwing stones. IDF statistics claim that since the start of the demonstrations 110 members of the security forces suffered injuries, and one officer lost an eye as a result of projectiles fired with slingshots.  
On the Palestinian side, there have been hundreds of wounded and one dead, Bassem Abu Rahma, killed last April when a smoke grenade hit him in his chest.  
Expecting violence to break out on Friday, the security forces took defensive positions much further away, and avoided responding when the protesters broke through the outer gate of the separation fence. Eventually a vehicle specially designed to counter demonstrations was used to drive the protesters off, with a water cannon firing specially designed, foul smelling fluid. Tear gas pushed the demonstrators back toward the village.  
Security forces said that the damage to the fence is estimated at NIS 100,000.

<title>Netanyahu is incapable of making peace - but does Israel care?</title>
<date>Wed Apr 28 14:22:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
About the MESS Report 
Dinner at the home of a foreign diplomat, earlier this week. Two high-ranking visitors from the diplomat's home country listen as an Israeli delegation paints a less than encouraging picture of the Middle East. The Israelis - academics, journalists and a former negotiator in the peace process, all of them somewhere between the center and the left on the political map - are united in their prognosis: Things aren't what they were.
Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, is incapable of any serious diplomatic action. Ordinary Israelis aren't worried enough about security to take much of an interest in politics, mistrust Arabs in general and have no particularly desire for a breakthrough. The chance of peace, either with the Syrians or the Palestinians, is near zero. The Obama administration would be well advised to stake neither its efforts nor its reputation on Middle East peace.
Their assessment completes a grim picture sketched by Thomas Friedman in his column in the New York Times last month. Once Israelis saw peace with their neighbors as a matter of life or death, Friedman argued, while for America it was just hobby. Now the situation has reversed. Israelis have completely lost faith in Palestinian sincerity in the wake of a wave of murderous attacks that followed the outbreak of the second intifada. They have since built a fence to cut themselves off from the threat - with the consequence that what goes on in the West Bank is as interesting and relevant to them as the dark side of the moon.
Israelis living within the Green Line once again feel safe; and, thankfully, Israel troops are rarely killed (in the past few years Canada has lost more soldiers in Afghanistan than Israel in the Palestinian territories). The economy has weathered the global crisis remarkably well, hi-tech industry is flourishing. So why worry?
Add to this assessment several other factors, all of which make a settlement even more unlikely: The lesson most Israelis draw from the retreat from Gaza and Lebanon is that evacuating occupied territory just brings more rockets; Likud party ideology barely allows the government to push through even limited outpost evacuations - let alone a full-scale withdrawal; and changes in the army's demography (almost a quarter of officers in combat units are now religious Jews) will make it hard to rely on the IDF next time the government decides to evict Jews from their homes.
On the Palestinian side, there is a lack of both political maturity and will to compromise, exacerbated by faith in the unflinching support of the Obama administration. Nor do the Geneva Initiative's warnings of a 'demographic time bomb' hold much sway over Israel, which is happy enough for the Palestinian population to explode - provided it does so beyond the confines of the separation fence. As for the radicalization of Arab Israelis, this will always be a problem, peace settlement or no.
The skeptics have a point. There is a lot to be claimed against Western advocates of a peace deal. Who said every conflict has a solution? And why is the West so naive when it comes to Arab intentions? How can they be so presumptuous as to think that the United States can dictate peace from above?
And yet there is one question to which Israelis, whether pessimistic or pragmatic, have no answer: How can Israel redress the decline in its legitimacy? Ariel Sharon was so concerned by Israel's failing image that he devised the withdrawal from Gaza. But five years have passed since then. At issue is not just the dwindling international support for Israel but the state's ties with the Jewish Diaspora. Will the next generation of American Jews stand beside Israel with the same determination, when in the West the occupation is increasingly associated with apartheid?
While the Israelis at the dinner had no doubt of the perils of the current situation, they were also resigned to it. But as I listened to them, I could not help dwelling on the consequences of political stagnation - and all the nasty things that flourish in stagnant water. Will Netanyahu, like the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland, have to keep running just to stay in the same place?
Somehow - and I know the analogy is imperfect - events of the past year are reminiscent of the prelude to the Yom Kippur war. Conversations with senior army officers reveal similar fears. The Middle East is in for a long, difficult summer. We can only hope the pessimists are wrong.

<title>Netanyahu wants loyalty oath bill to include Jews as well</title>
<date>Mon Oct 18 21:21:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed Justice Minister Ya'akov Ne'eman on Monday to prepare a new bill extending the loyalty oath, which is currently aimed at non-Jews, to include Jewish immigrants as well.
"We expect that every person wishing to become an Israeli citizen recognize Israel as a Jewish and democratic state," Netanyahu said on Monday evening.
"There is broad approval among the Israeli public regarding the Jewish and democratic identity of Israel, and that is not incidental. The state of Israel was founded as the sovereign state of the Jewish people and as a democratic state in which all its citizens – Jews and non-Jews alike – enjoy equal rights. Any person wishing to become an Israeli citizen must recognize these two key principals."
Last week, cabinet ministers approved by a majority vote a controversial amendment to the Citizenship Law which would require every non-Jew wishing to become a citizen of Israel to pledge loyalty to "the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state."
At the time, Ne'eman suggested rewording the draft of the proposed loyalty oath to include Jews and non-Jews alike.
On Monday, Netanyahu has decided to have Ne'eman draft a proposal wherein Jewish immigrants who are granted citizenship under the Law of Return to also be required to say the loyalty oath.
According to sources close to the prime minister, Netanyahu has not changed his stance on the bill. Apparently, Netanyahu already showed his support of this addition to the bill during the cabinet meeting in which the initial loyalty oath bill was approved.
Following Diaspora Minister Yuli Edelstein's hesitations on the bill, Netanyahu asked Ne'eman during the meeting to examine the option of extending the loyalty oath to Jews as well.
In response to Netanyahu's request, Ahmed Tibi, Chairman of the United Arab List-Ta’al, said "the idea in its original form is bad."
"There is no place for this version, not for Jews or for Arabs, unless someone feels the need to give in to Lieberman's whims or to battle his fascism," said Tibi. "Forcing a principal ethical identity on Jews and Arabs as one is completely unnecessary. It is redundant and is an attempt to enforce an ideology which Jews and Arabs need to adamantly oppose."   
Last week, leader of the opposition and Kadima chairwoman Tzipi Livni condemned the loyalty oath bill, calling it "politics at its worst."
Hadash chairman Mohammed Barakeh blamed Netanyahu and Barak for supporting and promoting "mega-racist legislation."
Israeli Arab MK Talab al-Sana said that "the amendment is a serious blow to democracy and will cause the exclusion of 20 percent of the country's citizens... [It] will situate Israel as the successor of Apartheid-era South Africa."

<title>Nick Clegg to Haaretz: I admire Israel, but won't stop criticizing its government </title>
<date>Wed May 05 23:44:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
I lift the receiver and hear: "Adar?" In recent weeks the voice on the other side has become familiar to millions of people in Britain and around the world.
"Nick Clegg is speaking," he says, amused. "I'm so glad to renew our contact after all these years."
A few minutes earlier I was still involved in intercontinental conversations with a dozen other graduates of the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium, recently dubbed "the Harvard of the European elite" by the British media.
Clegg's dizzying success hasn't surprised any of us alumni. Many of those old friends are being hounded by Britain's tabloid press these days, as they search for small crumbs of information to shed light on - or smear - the relatively unknown Liberal Democrat leader.
Eran Katz, the other Israeli who studied with us at the time, in the early 90s, has become well known in his own right, for the books he's written on memory theory. On the phone, Katz recalled how he helped along Clegg's love affair with Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, a talented and attractive fellow student: how he recommended a romantic vacation spot in the Ardennes Mountains, and how, thanks to his intervention, or so he would like to believe, they eventually married.
The Spaniard Jose-Ramon Leon Lora, today the European Commission representative in Morocco, reveled as he remembered how he overcame Clegg, the undisputed star of the exclusive university with his candidacy for head of the student council. Canadian Millie Stanisic, now a film producer in New York, is convinced she could have written the script even back then. She recounts a conversation she had with Clegg in the college cafeteria in which she prophetically uttered: "The day will come, Nick Clegg, when I'll be your guest at 10 Downing Street."
Clegg laughs loudly when he hears this. He has made clear during the election campaign that he is going for gold, betting all he's got, and that he wants to be Britain's next prime minister.
But now's the time to put things into perspective: "We're not there yet," he says modestly.
His glowing performance in the first televised debate shuffled the deck completely, turning him into the Susan Boyle of British politics, and the campaign's hottest story. He has been called "the most popular British politician since Churchill," and "the British Barack Obama." He has even been compared to Che Guevara.
The kingmaker
If the surveys are right, no party will win an absolute majority in the British Parliament today, for the first time in 35 years. Clegg, who may take second place, will be the kingmaker who decides whether Labour governs Britain for another four years, or whether there will be an upset in the Conservatives' favor after 13 years out of power.
He is the one who will decide whether a minority or a coalition government will rule; and whether for the first time in 90 years, the Liberal Democrats will return to a position of influence, with the implications reaching all the way to Jerusalem.
On the eve of the election, he refuses to make any predictions. He prefers not to talk about his ministerial preferences. It all depends on "these untypical elections," and "the great desire of millions for change."
Instead, he talks about "an opportunity that won't be repeated, the one-in-a-lifetime chance to change Britain forever."
In his mind's eye he sees "a quick and radical shift in the tectonic plates of politics," but he's also cautious. "Our message is that this time there's no need to return to the old patterns and alternatives. If enough people vote for the Liberal Democrats, then we can make big changes," he states.
Commentators say that Clegg's popularity lies in, among other things, the fact that he managed to steal the banner of change and new ideas from David Cameron and the Conservatives. These new ideas include a new distribution of taxes to benefit the poor, more money for education, canceling an expensive nuclear submarine project in favor of investment in the economy, the development of ecologically sound "green businesses," granting legal status to illegal immigrants who have spent at least a decade in the country; and above all, changing the anachronistic election system which distorts the will of voters and which allows the candidate less votes than his rivals to take office as prime minister.
No joy in Jerusalem
Though Cleggmania is rife in the U.K., Jerusalem is sunk in a Clegg-pression.
"Clegg is bad news for Israel," one official here said. "His party is running on a human rights platform, and the atmosphere is hostile to Israel. We remind the Liberal Democrats of South Africa during apartheid. Even if Clegg decides not to take the foreign portfolio, the very fact that Liberal Democrats sit in the cabinet is likely to mean trouble for us."
In the wake of the Second Lebanon War and Operation Cast Lead, the Liberal Democrats asked for an arms embargo on Israel, and to suspend its preferential trade status with the European Union. The party was also behind the demand to mark Israeli products made in the West Bank.
In December, Clegg was at the head of the list of signatories of a letter attacking the Israeli government for the blockade on Gaza. "The confinement and punishment of an entire population is no way to bring about peace for all of the people of the Middle East," the letter read.
Most of the bad blood was created by Baroness Jenny Tonge, a former Liberal Democrat MP, who became a member of the House of Lords in 2005. A year earlier, Tonge announced that if she were a Palestinian living under occupation, she would herself have become a suicide bomber. In 2006, she said that the pro-Israel lobby exerted a "financial grip" on her party and on Britain.
In February, she went even further and called for an investigation into claims that IDF soldiers who were sent to aid Haitian earthquake victims were involved in harvesting body organs from the dead. Her remarks caused a storm and Clegg fired her from her job as shadow health spokesperson.
"Too little, too late," a member of the British Jewish community said. "In light of the blood libel, he should have expelled her from the party."
Clegg, who called Tonge's remarks "wrong, distasteful and provocative," says that he is "a very staunch defender of the people of Israel, of a very staunch defender of the rights of the Jewish community here in Britain, a community which is feeling quite beleaguered at the moment because of the rise in anti-Semitism and the rise in prejudice generally."
He recently criticized the cooperation of British Conservatives in the European Parliament with extreme right-wing parties in Eastern Europe, whom he terms, "nutters, anti-Semitic, and homophobic."
"As to the accusations that I am hostile to Israel, my actions prove the opposite. I have always sharply opposed various efforts to impose academic and cultural sanctions on Israel. I am also one of those who said that Britain should not have participated in the Durban 2 conference when it became clear that it would turn into an anti-Israel event."
"I have tremendous admiration for the state of Israel and its people. When I visited, I was once again exposed to the genius of this nation, which has managed to maintain a democratic regime and a thriving and open economy, despite its existence under a constant threat. This is a great achievement.
But we must distinguish clearly between the Israeli and the Jewish people on the one hand, and certain actions of the Israeli government on the other. If I have criticism it is focused solely on these actions. I plan to continue to voice my thoughts, which stem from honest and legitimate concern, and in my estimation that the long term interests of the people of Israel are not being met properly at this time."
Clegg rejects speaking to Hamas "as long as Hamas continues to nurture an extremist ideology of violence and terror. I totally understand the feelings of the residents of Sderot who are under constant missile attacks that are meant to impose terror. My condemnations of Hamas have always been clear and unequivocal, and the same is true of my attitude toward the fact that Israel has the full right to defend its inhabitants. That is the role of every country and every government.
"However," he adds, "I don't understand the Israeli strategy regarding Gaza. The imposition of the siege against 1.5 million people, many of them young people who become increasingly itter, and the disproportionate use of force.
Operation Cast Lead did of course bring about a certain neutralization of the attackers and the missile attacks ¬ but did it reduce the bitterness prevailing between the peoples, did it weaken Hamas' position, and did it guarantee Israel's long-term security interests? I'm not at all certain."
Clegg comes out against Israel's "continued development of the illegal settlements," he welcomes the approaching proximity talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and as far as Hamas is concerned, he says: "The only way to deal with Hamas is to work to split the organization between the extremists who want to destroy the peace process and those who are willing over the long term to recognize Israel and to work to find a solution in a non-violent manner."
Clegg rejects out of hand the claim that the British public is today the most "anti-Israel" in Europe.
"Operation Cast Lead and incidents like falsifying documents in Dubai do create tension, but just as I would never treat any public criticism of some activity or other of the British government as an anti-British attitude, in the same way, British criticism of the policy of the Israeli government should not be treated as 'anti-Israeli,'" he says.In December 2009, 51 of the 63 members of the Liberal Democrats stood behind a draft bill in the Parliament in support of universal jurisdiction, which allows private citizens to apply for the arrest of Israeli politicians for alleged war crimes while they are on British soil.
"I'm very happy that we should review it, but it shouldn't be reviewed in a sort of panic. It needs to be reviewed in a calm and deliberate way. I was against the Labour government's wish to try and rush through changes before the election, I think that's wrong. I think there are issues of principles at stake, which I would like us all to have a look at calmly after the elections."
Looking to Europe
As befits a graduate of the College of Europe, 43-year-old Clegg is undoubtedly a dyed-in-the-wool "European." He speaks five languages. His Dutch mother was a captive in Indonesia during the Japanese occupation during World War II. His banker father, who is half Russian, is the scion of an aristocratic family. His wife, a lawyer, is the daughter of a former Spanish senator. His three sons have Spanish names. He himself spent more than 10 years in the corridors of the European Union. This record is already making many people nervous, both in England and abroad.
Although he supports his country's joining the eurozone, he says that this is "a totally mistaken move now." He cannot say anything else, in light of the fears that Britain will become "the Greece of Northern Europe." Nevertheless he declares that "we have to recall that the crisis in Greece stems from the fact that past governments there were not up front regarding their financial situation. The fault is theirs, not that of the euro bloc."
Between the lines, we can perhaps understand that he has not really abandoned the dream of adopting the single currency.
He is proud of the fact that he was one of the first to oppose Britain's participation in the Iraq war. His policy is to put an end to the era of being a "poodle" of the United States. He wants to abandon the "exaggerated dependence" on Washington and at the same time to build closer ties with Europe.
Jerusalem is afraid that Clegg, who sees Washington's approach to Israel as overly gentle, is liable to oppose joining future U.S. war activities.
"We cannot leave pressure on the Middle East to the U.S. alone," he declared recently at a press conference.
To Haaretz, he says, "No country is allowed to embark on war only out of loyalty to its ally. To this day I'm angry about the way in which Gordon Brown and [former British prime minister] Tony Blair - with the support of David Cameron and the Conservatives - decided to go to war in Iraq, in order to make [former U.S. president] George W. Bush and [former U.S. vice president] Dick Cheney happy. That certainly cannot be a good enough reason for an illegal invasion of another country. We must embark on military actions only when they are in our interest. That's why we supported and continue to support the international effort in Afghanistan. As opposed to Iraq, Britain has a clear interest in the war in Afghanistan, in spite of the fact that we have growing fears about the way in which the war there is being conducted."
Clegg rejects a military option in Iran too. "If they were to convince me that there's a practical option, then clearly we would have to consider it. I have not been exposed so far to any proof that we can stop the Iranian nuclear program by means of an aerial attack, while a comprehensive and all-out ground war is not an option. Our greatest ally against [Iranian President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad and the extremists in Tehran is of course the Iranian people themselves. The opposition in Iran is widening and it's our best chance over the long term to neutralize Iran's nuclear capability. We must find the proper and difficult balance between putting pressure on the Iranian regime by expanding the sanctions on the one hand and creating the conditions that will enable the Iranians themselves to confront their leaders on the other. Talking about a military option does not contribute to that - on the contrary, it makes Ahmadinejad's life easy and enables him to claim that he is acting as he is because of the external military threats."
As far as relations with the U.S., says Clegg, they should be described as "special."
"I lived and worked there [at the University of Minnesota], and I love that country. We have a common language, history and culture - it's a unique partnership that cannot be taken away from us. All that doesn't mean that our relationship should become a subservient one, in which we automatically do what they tell us to do. At the end of the day, Britain's foreign policy, just like that of Israel, must be conducted in accordance with British interests rather than those of the White House."
"In any case, I think that's the type of relationship that President Obama and his White House advisers are interested in. What they want is for Britain to be a strong force in Europe, so that it can influence the continent in accordance with our common transatlantic interests. There's no contradiction between being strong within Europe and being a close ally of the U.S. On the contrary: One is necessary to guarantee the other."
When Clegg talks about "common transatlantic interests" he is of course referring to the Middle East as well.
"I tend to say that the European Union must stop being an economic giant and a political pygmy," he says. "Since it is Israel's largest trade partner and one of the largest providers of assistance, infrastructure and money to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza - it must use its influence to bring about the goal to which we all aspire - a peaceful solution of old and bloody conflict, to bring about a situation where the two nations will live in peace alongside one another. That has always been my perspective."
Clegg's attitude indicates that his recent stardom has not gone to his head."What goes up can come down too," he says. "The higher they lift you, the more painful the fall. Those are the laws of gravity."
But whatever the results, nobody in Britain today will question the fact that the election campaign that has already been described as "the most important since 1918" ¬ when women were given the vote - will be remembered as such mainly because of one man. His name is Nick Clegg.

<title>Palestinians dance to Lady Gaga in Hebron, to counter video made by IDF troops</title>
<date>Sun Jul 11 17:01:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Palestinian residents of Hebron and their Israeli supporters have posted on YouTube a dance-video of their own, to respond to one created by Israel Defense Forces troops apparently bored during patrol duty in the contentious West Bank city.
The minutes-long video created by six soldiers shows them stopping patrol to dance to American electro-pop singer Kesha's hit Tik Tok. The video "Batallion 50 Rock the Hebron Casbah" shows six dancing Nahal Brigade soldiers, armed and wearing bulletproof vests, patrolling as a Muslim call to prayer is heard. Then the music changes and they break into a Macarena-like dance.
The army called their video a stunt, but promised that the soldiers would face disciplinary action over the matter.
The video garnered hundreds of thousands of clips on YouTube, after it was pulled from the web by its creator and then reposted.
Palestinians and activists choreographed a video of themselves in response, showing two kaffiyeh-clad men searched, handcuffed and arrested as Lady Gaga's Poker Face plays in the background.
The response video has already received a number of responses, including calls to stop the "occupation and apartheid."
Similar clips involving other armies have grabbed headlines in recent months, including one of American forces in Afghanistan doing their take on a Lady Gaga song.

<title>Palestinians hope to derail Jerusalem light rail project </title>
<date>Fri Jan 29 13:11:28 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Jerusalem's first light rail starts test runs this spring, with its sleek silver cars gliding across the city and promising to relieve the perpetual congestion.
But Palestinians see no reason to celebrate.
They hope to derail the $1 billion tram because they fear it will further entrench Israeli control over East Jerusalem, the part of the city they want as a capital. They've asked a French court to force two French multinationals, Veolia and Alstom, out of the project and are urging Arab countries to cancel contracts with the two companies.
The 9-mile (14-kilometer) line runs from Jewish west Jerusalem to the largest of several settlements Israel built in the traditionally Arab eastern sector.
Palestinians say Israel is creating more facts on the ground with the tram, just as it has with its ever-expanding Jewish enclaves in East Jerusalem that are now home to 180,000 Israelis.
"The purpose of this project is to make a bridge between the settlements?and west Jerusalem and they use our land, Palestinian land," said Ahmed Rweidi, an adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. "The train is illegal and the settlements are illegal."
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he's not willing to give up any part of Jerusalem, taking a harder line than some of his predecessors, and insists Israel has the right to build anywhere in the city.
Government spokesman Mark Regev said the light rail will serve all of Jerusalem's residents and beyond, Arab and Jew alike.
The campaign against the train is part of a wider attempt by Palestinian activists and politicians to use new ways to challenge Israeli rule over the lands they want for a state. Frustrated by the failure of nearly two decades of peace talks, they are increasingly trying to hit Israel where it hurts - the pocket book.
Palestinian security forces have been confiscating goods made in Jewish settlements from West Bank shops. Dozens of Palestinian grassroots groups have been orchestrating a boycott Israel campaign since 2005.
Inspired by the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa, they say they've gained momentum, particularly after the international outcry over Israel's war against Gaza's Hamas rulers last winter. 
Israeli officials say the campaign has failed to dent Israel's economy and bristle at comparisons to apartheid-era South Africa. Jewish activists have been pushing back, branding the attempted boycott as anti-Semitic.
The fight over the rail line comes amid an especially bitter deadlock over the fate of Jerusalem.
Netanyahu's refusal to stop settlement construction in East Jerusalem is one of the reasons Abbas won't resume peace talks that broke off more than a year ago.
But stopping the trains will be an uphill battle.
Tracks have already been laid on most of the route, which will have 23 stations and link west Jerusalem with Pisgat Zeev, the largest Jewish settlement in the eastern sector. Forty-four cars are parked at a depot in east Jerusalem, ready for a test phase that is to begin around March and last several months.
The Palestine Liberation Organization has asked a French court to order Veolia and Alstom to drop out of the project, on grounds that it violates the Geneva Convention's prohibition of an occupier changing the nature of occupied lands.
The two firms are members, along with Israeli companies, of the City Pass consortium which is building the rail line and is to operate it until 2036.
The court ruled in December that it has jurisdiction, but has not set a date for the next hearing.
The Abbas government is also urging Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries to cut business ties with the firms. Among other projects in the region, Alstom is involved in building a rail line between the holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.
Palestinian officials say they will raise the issue at a March summit of the Arab League.
"This is the least Arabs can do to support our rights in Jerusalem," said Rweidi, the Abbas adviser.
PLO officials said they were unaware of any actions taken by Arab governments. Saudi Arabia has kept silent about the pressure.
Veolia officials in Israel told AP the company is in the process of transferring its 5 percent share in the Jerusalem rail project to Israel's Dan bus company. But they insist it's strictly a business decision. The proposed sale would have to be approved by the consortium, but that may take several years.
Alstom, which is providing the rail cars, defended the project.
Spokesman Philippe Kasse rejected claims that the tram creates a new reality on the ground, noting that buses now service the future train route.
"We are told [by critics] that this tramway is a weapon designed to make irreversible the annexation of East Jerusalem and the colonization policy led by Israel," he wrote in an e-mailed response. "Replacing an existing bus line by a tramway is neither using warfare nor establishing a political fait accompli."
Jerusalem municipality spokesman Stephan Miller defended the rail project as beneficial to both Arabs and Jews. The train will make three stops in the Arab neighborhood of Shuafat. Some residents there expressed hope it will ease chronic congestion, while others complained that the tracks use up two lanes of their four-lane main road.
Hind Khoury, a Palestinian diplomat in France involved in the legal battle against the tram, said the campaign is a measure of Palestinian frustration.
"In the last few years, we were still hoping that the peace process would be credible enough to come to a conclusion," she said. "Now we are taking the legal route."

<title>Peace talks deadlocked as settlement freeze set to expire</title>
<date>Sun Sep 26 02:15:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
The freeze on construction in West Bank settlements is due to end in less than 24 hours, potentially creating a crisis that could halt direct negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, and there is still no solution in sight.
American negotiators have been holding intense discussions with the Israelis and the Palestinians, but the parties are still locked in their positions.
The Americans are focusing their pressure on trying to get Israel to continue the construction moratorium.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas struck a hard line in a speech to the UN General Assembly yesterday, saying that Israel had to choose between settlements and peace.
He accused Israel of flouting UN resolutions and "relentlessly carrying out oppression, arrests and detentions, killings, destruction, demolition of homes, siege, settlement expansion, apartheid wall, violating and undermining the rights of our people and presence in their homeland without consequence."
He said Israel should be forced to meet its obligations, especially to stop construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and to dismantle "the annexation apartheid wall."
"Despite the historic injustice that has been inflicted upon our people," Abbas said, "our wounded hands are still able to carry the olive branch from the rubble of the trees that the occupation uproots every day."
Palestinian sources said Abbas is waiting to see how the Israeli government handles the moratorium issue. If it announces that construction will resume, and holds ceremonies to mark the occasion, then direct talks will stop immediately, said the sources.
However, sources close to Defense Minister Ehud Barak said that the despite the Palestinians' outwardly belligerent stance, the Palestinians were willing to compromise.
Despite the Palestinians' stated refusal to compromise, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat reamined in the United States yesterday for more discussions.
Abbas met with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in New York on Friday, who asked him not to make good on his threat to end talks. He also met with U.S. special envoy George Mitchell yesterday.
Israel's chief negotiator Isaac Molho also is staying in New York for discussions with Mitchell and U.S. President Barack Obama's adviser Dennis Ross.
Sources close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that so far, all of Israel's proposals that would enable limited construction have been rejected by the Palestinians.
On Friday, Netanyahu met in Jerusalem with Quartet envoy Tony Blair, who flew over from New York to try to persuade Netanyahu to extend the freeze. Netanyahu told Blair he would not be able to get the cabinet to approve such a move.
Netanyahu called his advisers to his Caesarea home Friday to discuss possible solutions, and held another meeting at his Jerusalem residence last night.
The Palestinian newspaper Al Ayyam reported yesterday that the Americans told the Palestinian leadership that they understood its position regarding the freeze and that Obama had said so in his speech to the UN General Assembly last week.
Abbas' spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh said yesterday that the Palestinians were demanding that the freeze continue in its entirety, and that no interim solution would be acceptable. Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa said the Palestinians would not be able to continue the talks if the freeze ended.
However, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman told reporters, "We are urging Israel to extend the moratorium and we are also making clear to the Palestinians that we do not believe that it is in their interest to walk out of the talks."
Feltman told reporters the United States hoped that at the Arab League Summit on October 9, the Arab League would show support for the peace process, Abbas and the PLO, and increase economic assistance to the PA.
Congressmen calling for Pollard pardon
Meanwhile, four U.S. Congressmen are circulating a letter calling on Obama to pardon convicted spy Jonathan Pollard in a bid to further the peace process, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported.
Pollard has served 25 years of a life sentence for spying on the United States for Israel.
According to the JTA, the congressmen - Barney Frank of Massachusetts, Adolphus Tanner and Anthony Weiner of New York and Bill Pascrell of New Jersey's Eighth Congressional District - have signed the letter and are circulating it in Congress.
The letter says pardoning Pollard would show Obama's good will toward Israelis.
According to various recent reports, Pollard could be released in exchange for three more months of construction freeze.
Meanwhile, disturbances that started last week in East Jerusalem continued over the weekend. In the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Isawiyah, 1-year-old Hussam Abu-Sara died yesterday of an asthma attack. Relatives said it was caused by tear gas fired near his home.
In a related development, the Israel Navy plans to launch an investigation tomorrow into the death of a Gaza fisherman, Mohammad Manzur, after a navy vessel fired on his boat. The navy said the boat had entered a zone near the Gaza Strip the Israel Defense Forces has declared off limits.

<title>Pushing for a provisional Palestinian state </title>
<date>Wed Apr 28 02:08:25 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
The announcement of upcoming "proximity talks" between Israel and the Palestinians raises a number of questions - what exactly will they talk about? What else can be renewed in the peace process, where everything seems to have been tried while peace remains elusive? What trick does George Mitchell, the mediator of the hour, have up his sleeve that was kept from his frustrated predecessors?  
Israel wants to extract itself from the morass of control over the Palestinians, who accuse it of apartheid and force it to choose between its Jewish identity and its democracy. But Israel also wants to keep most of the West Bank, the settlements and security control, and to enjoy exclusive rights over Jerusalem.  
Israel's answer to this stagnation calls for upgrading the Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas and Salam Fayyad to a body responsible for a polity within provisional borders. This dwarf state would be created by a special UN vote, effectively absolving Israel of responsibility. The dispute over the remaining territories, refugees and Jerusalem would be settled later in talks between two sovereign states, Israel and Palestine, not between an occupier and its subjects.  
The Palestinians want as much of their historical homeland as possible, to be rid of Israeli soldiers and settlers, and to maintain international support. The Palestinians are calling for the creation of a state within the 1967 borders, with small land swaps that would leave the large settlements on the Israeli side, Jerusalem divided as the capital of two states, and the return of an undetermined number of refugees to Israel. They fear that unless they receive the maximum now and instead settle for a mini-state, the world will lose interest in them just as it ultimately came to terms with Israeli control over the Golan Heights.  
Leaders on both sides must prove they have not given up, that it was the other side that reneged. Both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Abbas see negotiations as a zero-sum game rather than a give-and-take in which both sides benefit from a redistribution of resources.  
Abbas opposes an interim arrangement, and Netanyahu is unwilling to sign on to a final-status deal. Each has adopted a strategy of attrition, locking into his position and battering the other with accusations in an attempt to win over the American mediator. The Palestinians are hoping Barack Obama will blame Netanyahu for the diplomatic stagnation and force Israel into a favorable final-status agreement. Israel expects that the U.S. president, hungry for foreign-policy achievements but restricted by Netanyahu's supporters in Congress, will settle for an interim agreement and impose it on the Palestinians, just as he retreated from his demands for a complete settlement freeze and a halt to Israeli construction in East Jerusalem.  
Can the sides be bridged? A year ago the Reut Institute recommended that Washington present a vision for a final-status agreement to give the Palestinians a "diplomatic horizon," after which a Palestinian state would arise within provisional borders. President Shimon Peres has presented a similar initiative, calling for separate talks on an interim arrangement and a final-status agreement respectively.  
After a year of fruitless wrangling over a settlement evacuation, a provisional Palestinian state seems like the most practicable arrangement, either through mutual agreement or a unilateral Israeli decision. It is, of course, subject to political limitations, but Israel could settle for a limited evacuation of settlements and outposts, retain security control and not even negotiate over Jerusalem for now. Meanwhile, the Palestinians are not being ordered to offer anything in return - not to recognize Israel as a Jewish state or relinquish the right of return, both of which Netanyahu is demanding as conditions for a final-status agreement. But here, too, lie the initiative's weak points. Disputes over the most sensitive issues will remain, ever threatening to bubble over, and Israel will be drawn into internal clashes over settlers - all without an actual solution to the wider conflict.  
Netanyahu believes that the only answer to the current diplomatic stagnation is an interim agreement based on a Palestinian state within provisional borders, but he is hesitant to openly state his support for the idea. He would rather reach that result for lack of an alternative, under heavy U.S. pressure, and if possible, in exchange for an American attack on Iran - just as his predecessor Ariel Sharon evacuated Gaza only after George W. Bush conquered Iraq.

<title>Richard Goldstone: I have no regrets about the Gaza war report</title>
<date>Thu May 06 01:26:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 
Judicial decisions Richard Goldstone made in South Africa that resulted in sending black South Africans to their deaths under the apartheid regime have nothing to do with his report on the Gaza war, he told Haaretz yesterday.
The comments came in response to an article in which he was accused of being in no moral position to judge Israel because he was involved in capital punishment in the apartheid regime.
The article in the Yedioth Ahronoth daily said Goldstone, who headed the UN committee that accused both Israel and Hamas of war crimes during the Gaza war of 2008-2009, was responsible for sending at least 28 black South Africans to their deaths when they appeared before him in court.
"As far as I'm concerned, there's no connection to the appointment I had in South Africa to these accusations," said Goldstone, who calls himself pro-Zionist. "I took an appointment to the bench, as did a number of liberal judges, and we had to uphold the law of the country. It was a moral dilemma to do that, but the approach was that it was better to fight from inside than not at all. The moral dilemma came up when I had to apply the law."
Goldstone said he sentenced only two people to death directly, but upheld a majority of appeals in the Supreme Court, as one of three judges on a panel.
"The law at the time stated that when there were aggravating circumstances, the death penalty was obligatory," he said. "The regrets I have now are the same that I had at the time. I have not changed my position on this. It was unpleasant to be involved in capital punishment - then and now. And I've always been against the death penalty. But when I accepted the position to the bench I had to honor the oath of office."
Regarding the UN report on the Gaza war, for which many Jewish groups have attacked Goldstone, the judge said he has no regrets about the position he took.
"I felt that because I was Jewish, it would be hypocritical not to get involved in the Middle East," he said. He said he advises Israel to have an open public inquiry into the war crimes allegations.
Goldstone said he was "extremely upset" by the attacks and by the effect they have had on his family.
Some members of the Jewish community had tried to keep Goldstone away from his grandson's recent bar mitzvah in Johannesburg because they objected to his position on Operation Cast Lead.
"It was a wonderful simcha," Goldstone said of the bar mitzvah. "It was joyous and meaningful, and it came after much aggravation. There were people who wanted to stop me from attending. But that was eventually solved after a meeting on Monday."
Goldstone said no South Africans, including the country's much revered first black president Nelson Mandela, who appointed him a judge, had accused him of undermining his moral authority by sentencing defendants to death or dismissing their appeals.
"I never had accusations of this sort," he said. "The first time I have been accused of such things is now, by Yedioth."

<title>Rights group slams planned 'Israelis only' highway in West Bank</title>
<date>Tue Jan 05 07:53:54 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Less than a week after Israel's highest court ordered the state to lift its ban on Palestinian motorists from a highway that stretches into the West Bank, left-wing activists are denouncing new plans on Tuesday to build a road on West Bank land which they claim is intended for use by Israelis only.
According to an Army Radio report, planning officials are diligently laying the groundwork for Highway 20, an artery which will connect Highway 443 ? the road which has remained off limits to Palestinian traffic since the outbreak of the second intifada - with the northern neighborhoods of Jerusalem, including Pisgat Ze'ev.
Officials at Peace Now slammed the plan for the road, which they say will be built on privately owned Palestinian land to be condemned for the project and will cater solely to Israeli motorists. 
Peace Now, which submitted an official complaint to the Transportation Ministry's planning committee, says that the planned highway will usurp land in the adjacent West Bank village of Beit Hanina. 
"This is a political highway," Hagit Ofran, the head of Peace Now's Settlement Watch project, told Army Radio. "The purpose of the highway is to create facts on the ground which will have bearing on future decisions relating to a two-state solution."
While the paving of Highway 20 has yet to begin, the Transportation Ministry has allocated some NIS 80 million for the highway's construction. 
The government views Highway 20 as a means to ease the traffic burden that has plagued the French Hill section of Jerusalem. 
The highway's opponents hope that last week's High Court ruling allowing for Palestinian motorists' use of Highway 443 will serve as a precedent.
"Preventing local residents from using a highway simply because they are Palestinians is discrimination that is forbidden," Barak Medina, a professor at Hebrew University's Faculty of Law, told Army Radio. "While the [443 ruling] did not speak of apartheid, unfortunately this case is not that far from apartheid."
The Jerusalem municipality said in response that Highway 20 will be equally accessible to both Arabs and Jews.
"In order to prevent condemnation of Palestinian land, a bridge will be built and compensation will be offered to those whose land will be used to build the bridge's columns," the municipality said.

<title>Settlement boycotter: We're not divesting from Israel, but from occupation </title>
<date>Wed Nov 24 20:42:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
There is a budding movement by foreign investors and activists to join a Palestinian campaign against companies doing business in the West Bank - aimed at hitting them in their pockets.
Pension funds in Norway and Sweden have divested themselves of holdings in some firms involved in building in settlements or helping to erect Israel's contentious West Bank separation barrier.
European activists are cranking up pressure on companies by exposing the West Bank ties and picketing stores that sell settlement goods. And some major U.S. churches are questioning companies as a precursor to possible divestment.
The economic impact is still negligible. Jewish groups are pushing back and key institutions, including U.S. universities, have rejected calls to divest.
But in business, where image is all-important, it's tough to shrug off potentially negative publicity.
Israel accuses boycott advocates of trying to delegitimize the Jewish state.
It also argues that plenty of companies with ties to states with horrendous human rights records are not similarly targeted.
The focus on corporate involvement comes against the backdrop of a wider Palestinian movement of divestment and boycott, inspired by the economic assault on apartheid-era South Africa.
The Palestinians hope such pressure will achieve what years of negotiations have not - end Israel's occupation of the West Bank and east Jerusalem, lands they want for a state. Israel withdrew all forces and settlers from the Gaza Strip, the other territory claimed by the Palestinians, in 2005.
While the Palestinians seek a blanket boycott of Israel, many foreign supporters do not.
This is not divestment from Israel. It's divestment from companies supporting the occupation, said William Aldrich, head of the divestment task force at the New England Conference of the United Methodist Church.
Divestment is meant to make a moral statement, said Aldrich, whose group recommends that Methodists sell stock in 29 foreign and Israeli companies, though that call has not been adopted by his church at the national level.
The big success is that is has become an issue, added Merav Amir of the Tel Aviv-based Coalition of Women for Peace, whose database of companies has become a resource for investors and activists.
Israeli opposition leader Tzipi Livni, a former foreign minister who supports a West Bank pullout, said Israel should be concerned.
There is a trend of ideological consumerism in some of the world's countries, in addition to a delegitimization campaign against the state of Israel, she told a business conference Wednesday. I believe we have to light a few warning lights.
Foreign and Israeli companies operating in the West Bank have benefited over the years from cheap land, tax incentives and low-cost Palestinian labor. A growing settler population - 500,000 in the West Bank and east Jerusalem – has made it increasingly worthwhile for Israeli banks, supermarket chains and others to set up branches on war-won land.
With scrutiny intensifying, foreign companies and investments could be more vulnerable to pressure.
Results are still modest.
Norway's $500 billion oil fund, Europe's largest institutional investor, and Swedish pension funds managing more than $100 billion in assets have dropped the Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems Ltd., which provides surveillance equipment for the separation barrier.
The funds say Elbit violated ethical norms because of its involvement in the barrier, ruled illegal in a nonbinding decision by the International Court of Justice. Israel says it built the barrier to keep out Palestinian militants, but it swerves through the West Bank to incorporate Jewish settlements on the Israeli side.
Norway's investment in Elbit was $6 million, negligible for a company valued at $2 billion. Elbit won't discuss the divestments. The Norwegian fund also sold its $1.2 million in shares in Africa Israel Investments, which has a real estate holding that builds in settlements.
The Brussels-based bank Dexia, targeted by Belgian activists for lending to settlements, said its Israeli subsidiary is phasing out the settlement business. Assa Abloy, a Swedish lock maker, said it would move its Israeli factory from a settlement industrial park to Israel proper within a year.
SodaStream, a maker of home carbonating systems, said some of the $109 million raised in a public offering in November is to be used to build a new factory outside the West Bank, though it won't say whether it would eventually close an existing settlement facility.
Some major Christian denominations also are wrestling with the divestment issue.
The World Council of Churches, which represents 560 million Christians, has called for responsible investment and a boycott of settlement products.
The Presbyterians are trying to persuade several multinationals to cut West Bank ties and leave open the possibility of future divestment. The United Methodists buried a divestment bill at a 2008 convention, though activists say they'll try again in 2012.
For now, boycott and divestment don't affect the Israeli economy or the businesses, said Israela Many, chief economist at the Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce. The problem is, it creates a negative image, she said.
Mark Regev, an Israeli government spokesman, alleged that boycotters show very selective indignation and ignore egregious human rights abuses elsewhere, including in Libya, Syria and Iran.
The Scandinavian pension funds deny singling out Israel.
There is no country perspective on this, said Annika Anderson of the Ethical Council that advises four Swedish pension funds. She noted that the funds have dropped nine other companies from around the world since 2007.
The Norwegian fund, which invests in more than 8,000 firms, has dropped 49 companies worldwide, including those making cluster bombs and cigarettes. The list includes Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Wal-Mart.
The fund's decisions are closely watched by other investors in Scandinavia.
Being excluded by the oil fund can cause massive damage to a company's reputation in those countries, said Caroline Liinanki, editor of the Nordic Region Pensions and Investment News at the Financial Times. You don't want to end up on the black list.

<title>South African academics reject call to boycott Israeli university</title>
<date>Wed Sep 29 19:38:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
University of Johannesburg professors rejected calls to sever ties with an Israeli university Wednesday, but called on Ben-Gurion University to work with its Palestinian counterparts.
Calls for similar academic boycotts to protest Israel's Palestinian policies also have failed in the West.
The South African university's faculty senate met Wednesday to vote on the proposal, which had been endorsed by anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu, but instead accepted a compromise without a vote. They asked Ben-Gurion University to work with Palestinian universities on research projects, and to start the collaborations within six months if it wants to maintain ties with the University of Johannesburg.
UJ Vice Chancellor Adam Habib said the compromise reflected his institution's values.
"We believe in reconciliation," Habib said. "We'd like to bring BGU and Palestinian universities together to produce a collective engagement that benefits everyone."
The universities have joint research projects and academic exchanges on biotechnology and water purification.
Relations between Ben-Gurion University and Rand Afrikaans University, a formerly all-white university under South Africa's apartheid system, began in 1987. The University of Johannesburg, created in 2005, took over various campuses including Rand Afrikaans University and a university in the black township of Soweto as part of efforts to ensure higher education was transformed with the rest of South Africa after the end of apartheid.
Israel officially opposed apartheid, but its ties with the white government were seen as close. South Africa's post-apartheid government has been a sharp critic of Israel's Palestinian policies. The late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was among the guests at Nelson Mandela's 1994 inauguration as South Africa's first black president.
Tutu and more than 200 prominent South African academics had supported ending UJ's links with the Israeli institution.
"Israeli universities are an intimate part of the Israeli regime, by active choice," Tutu wrote in an essay that appeared in a South African newspaper Sunday. "While Palestinians are not able to access universities and schools, Israeli universities produce the research, technology, arguments and leaders for maintaining the occupation."
Academic boycotts of Israeli universities have been inspired by boycotts of South African institutions during apartheid. A 2003 proposal for British universities to sever all ties with Israeli academic institutions was defeated. Two years later Britain's Association of University Teachers voted to boycott Israel's Haifa and Bar Ilan universities. That decision was overturned only a month later under fierce international pressure.
U.S. professors and students also have called for academic and cultural boycotts of Israel.
The moves have prompted sharp criticism. Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz once threatened legal action that would "devastate and bankrupt" anyone who boycotts Israeli universities.
The New York-based Anti-Defamation League described the British moves as anti-Semitic, arguing Israel was being singled out while human rights violators such as Iran, Sudan, Venezuela and Zimbabwe were ignored.

<title>South Africa opera rejects Archbishop Tutu's call to boycott Israel </title>
<date>Wed Oct 27 15:21:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Cape Town's renowned opera troupe is rejecting a call from retired Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu to cancel a performance in Israel scheduled next month.
The opera's managing director Michael Williams said in a statement Wednesday that the opera would not take a political position and cut cultural ties with Israel or the Palestinian territory.
Tutu, who earned a Nobel for his peaceful opposition to apartheid, on Tuesday compared Cape Town Opera's planned visit to international artists performing in apartheid South Africa. He said Israel is "luring" international artists to the Tel Aviv Opera House to advance its "fallacious claim to being a 'civilized democracy.'"
Tutu said it would be "unconscionable" to perform "Porgy and Bess," in Israel, which he said has a "universal message of nondiscrimination."
Tutu has emerged as a sharp critic of Israel. Last month, he backed calls for a South African academic boycott of Israel.

<title>Still flying after all these years</title>
<date>Sun Apr 04 01:48:25 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
The late Orthodox Rabbi Phillip Rosenberg of South Africa was once asked by one of his congregants how he could preach every week that we need to respect the Sabbath, while allowing his son to play rugby on that day. ?Well,? Rabbi Rosenberg responded, ?my son was born with a God-given talent. Who I am to argue with God??
If his argument was suspect, the rabbi was certainly correct about his son?s extraordinary gift. Wilf Rosenberg, who recalled this anecdote about his father during a recent interview, continued playing on the Sabbath and soon became one of South Africa?s greatest rugby players of all time.
Born in 1934 in Cape Town, Rosenberg played for South Africa?s legendary national team, the Springboks, as well as for Leeds Rugby League Club, where his 1961 record of 48 tries − the equivalent of a touchdown − in one season is still unbroken.
About three months ago, ?the flying dentist? − as he was called because he used to dive for the ball and pursued dentistry when he wasn?t on the field − moved to Ra?anana to be near his daughter, Nicola Kroft, of Modi?in.
?I learned something that is very encouraging, that Israel is getting into rugby and hopes to be a challenger on the world [rugby] scene in a few years,? the 75-year old said about his first few weeks in Israel. ?Quite a few people came up to me and said Israelis are now taking rugby seriously,? the former center continued, adding he is surprised by Israelis? interest in his career. ?I feel very comfortable here. I have to say that I?m very honored. You?re very good to me here.?Israel will play Bulgaria and Greece this month in a bid to be promoted from Europe?s Division 3C to 3B.
Within the country?s South African ex-pat community, Rosenberg undoubtedly remains a legend. ?He?s probably one of best players of all time in his particular position,? said Charles Abelsohn, a Kfar Sava resident originally from Cape Town. ?Like everyone else, I was a big fan of his.? Howard Tolkien, who was born years after the dentist had stopped flying, calls Rosenberg a legend. ?My father used to talk about him a lot,? said the 43-year old. ?The Jewish community is very proud of him.?Rosenberg was identified as a natural talent while still a teenager, according to the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, to which he was inducted in 1994. Having started playing at the age of six, he became a national hero in 1955, when during his first match for the Springboks he led his country to victory against the British Lions by scoring two tries.
Rosenberg soon caught the attention of international talent scouts, one of whom approached his father during a stay in London and offered his son a five-year contract at Leeds. The 6,000 pounds sterling the club paid for him was the ?highest sum ever paid for a rugby player,? he says.Leeds was then the center of the clothing trade and home to many Jews, who were proud to have one of their own on their home team, he recalls. ?They were delighted, because a Jewish boy had never, ever played rugby league in Britain. I?m the only Jewish boy to this day who played rugby league in Great Britain.?
Always hated politicsAfter his active career, Rosenberg returned to South Africa, where, besides working as a dentist, he became a boxing promoter and rugby commentator. In 2010, a few weeks after his arrival in Israel, he spoke at a screening of ?Invictus,? the current Clint Eastwood film about the Springboks and how their bid to win the 1995 world cup united South Africa in its fragile first years after apartheid. The movie, which Rosenberg calls ?very realistic,? shows how non-whites despised the Springboks, as the team represented for them the racist discrimination of the apartheid era.
Rosenberg says he always hated politics. During his first match for the Springboks, however, he did something that won him the hearts and minds of black rugby fans − and the contempt of the South African government.?We ran onto the field and I ran toward the [stands for black spectators]. I was doing it quite unconsciously,? he says. ?They were on their toes, cheering me. I turned around and smiled and waved at them, they went berserk. They cheered me and followed me wherever I went,? he recalls. ?The foreign minister was [Johannes] Strijdom at the time, and I don?t think he liked it.?
Rosenberg says he did the ?unthinkable.? However, he stresses, he didn?t care. ?What the hell, apartheid, blacks and coloreds − they were cheering me! So I ran toward them and warmed up in front of them and they kept on cheering.? Later in the game, when he scored twice, his new fans jumped the fence and had to be held back by police, he adds.An ?apartheid team?
Historians diverge on the Jewish community?s stance toward apartheid: While Jews were disproportionately represented in the movement against the racist government, other Jews supported and even defended the regime. Helen Suzman, a South African-Jewish MP and a leading figure in the anti-apartheid movement, once scolded Rosenberg for playing for an ?apartheid team,? he recalls. But Rosenberg insists he never wanted to be an activist.
?I said [to Suzman]: what do you want me to do, I?m being picked,? he explains. ?Do you want me to say I?m not playing because they don?t have colored or blacks [on the team]? That would not help them. They [the team managers] would just say, well bugger, if you don?t want to play, don?t play! Now to play rugby for South Africa is one of the biggest honors that can be bestowed upon a rugby player... I couldn?t get involved. I had to concentrate on playing rugby and my studies.?

<title>Tennis star surrounded by guards in Dubai </title>
<date>Tue Feb 16 02:16:06 IST 2010</date>
<content>
The people suspected of killing senior Hamas operative Mahmoud al-Mabhouh disguised themselves as tennis players so they could move freely between hotels, the Dubai police claimed yesterday.  
As they made the announcement, Israeli tennis star Shahar Peer, 22, was in Dubai - undisguised - to take part in the Dubai Championships.  
Mabhouh was murdered in Dubai last month.  
Peer, who is ranked 22nd worldwide, played her first match yesterday against 15th-seeded Yanina Wichmayer of Belgium for a 6-3, 2-6, 5-7 win.  
"It was a very important victory for me," said Peer, flanked by a large contingent of bodyguards, after the game. "I felt very proud to be representing Israel in a country that does not recognize it."  
Peer faced the complex diplomatic situation with her usual aplomb. "I get a lot of support from Israel and that's important to me," she said. "The attitude to me here is very warm and I feel quite safe."  
To further Peer's sense of safety, the tournament organizers closed off the entire floor of her hotel and restricted her to either the hotel or the court.  
Later yesterday, Peer also won her doubles match. The twin victories mean she will be extending her stay in Dubai, so security will remain high.  
Last year, just 24 hours before Peer was to have arrived in Dubai for the tournament, she was denied a visa. The move raised hackles in the World Tennis Association, which slapped the organizers with a $300,000 fine, the highest ever in an international tournament. Of that sum, Peer received $44,250. She was also assured entry to this year's tournament.  
A month ago, in Auckland, New Zealand, 10 protesters called for Peer's ouster from the competition and a boycott of Israel. Two weeks later, ahead of the Australian Open, a pro-Palestinian group showed a picture of her in army uniform with the slogan "Shahar Peer serves apartheid Israel."

<title>Theater figures urge Be'er Sheva actors to boycott West Bank arts center</title>
<date>Sat Nov 06 09:42:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Dozens of theater figures boycotting the new Ariel cultural center sent Friday a letter to Be'er Sheva Theater actors urging them to join their battle and boycott the newly built arts center in the West Bank settlement.
"No one can force you to perform there," the prominent cultural figures wrote. In September a group of theater actors and public figures signed a petition saying they would not perform in the new Ariel center as a protest of Israel's settlement policies.  The protest was supported by over 150 academics.
The Be'er Sheva theatre company is scheduled to perform in Ariel on the cultural center's opening night this week.
"Ariel is not just another community," the letter said, stressing that the actors were about to perform in the cultural center that was erected in Ariel on occupied land. "just several kilometers from the thriving and flourishing Ariel, Palestinians live in refugee camps, in harsh living conditions and without any basic human right. Not only are they not entitled to see performances in Ariel, some of them have no access to running water."
The letter added that the two contrasting realities of Ariel and the Palestinian refugees constituted "an apartheid nation."
Among the signatories of the current letter to the Be'er Sheva Theater are several prominent theater and culture figures such as film director Eitan Fux, artist and critic Yair Garbuz, television director and activists Doron Tzabari, theatre director Yehoshua Sobol and others.

<title>Think tank: Israel faces global delegitimization campaign</title>
<date>Fri Feb 12 01:05:19 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Israel is facing a global campaign of delegitimization, according to a report by the Reut Institute, made available to the cabinet on Thursday. The Tel Aviv-based security and socioeconomic think tank called on ministers to treat the matter as a strategic threat.
The report cites anti-Israel demonstrations on campuses, protests when Israeli athletes compete abroad, moves in Europe to boycott Israeli products, and threats of arrest warrants for Israeli leaders visiting London.
Reut says the campaign is the work of a worldwide network of private individuals and organizations. They have no hierarchy or overall commander, but work together based on a joint ideology - portraying Israel as a pariah state and denying its right to exist.
Reut lists the network's major hubs - London, Brussels, Madrid, Toronto, San Francisco and the University of California, Berkeley. The network's activists - "delegitimizers" the report dubs them - are relatively marginal: young people, anarchists, migrants and radical political activists. Although they are not many, they raise their profile using public campaigns and media coverage, the report says.
The "delegitimizers" cooperate with organizations engaging in legitimate criticism of Israel's policy in the territories such as Amnesty and Human Rights Watch, blurring the line between legitimate censure and delegitimization. They also promote pro-Palestinian activities in Europe as "trendy," the report says.
The network's activists are not mostly Palestinian, Arab or Muslim. Many of them are European and North American left-wing activists. The Western left has changed its approach to Israel and now sees it as an occupation state, the report says. To those left-wing groups, if in the 1960s Israel was seen as a model for an egalitarian, socialist society, today it epitomizes Western evil.
The delegitimization network sees the fight against the former regime in South Africa as a success model. It believes that like the apartheid regime, the Zionist-Israeli model can be toppled and a one-state model can be established.
The Reut team says the network's groups share symbols and heroes such as the Palestinian boy Mohammed al-Dura, American peace activist Rachel Corrie and joint events like the Durban Conference.
Israel's diplomats overseas, meanwhile, must counter the attempts to delegitimize the country. "The combination of a large Muslim community, a radical left, influential, English-language media and an international university center make London fertile ground for Israel's delegitimization," says Ron Prosor, Israel's ambassador in London.
Prosor gives many interviews to the British media and lectures at university campuses throughout the country. Although he says he has encountered anti-Israel demonstrations on almost every campus, Prosor has told his people to increase their campus activity.
"What is now happening in London universities will happen, at most, in five years at all the large universities in the United States," he says.
The Reut report says Israel is not prepared at all to deal with the threat of delegitimization. The cabinet has not defined the issue as a threat and sees the diplomatic arena as marginal compared to the military one.
"The Foreign Ministry is built for the challenges of the '60s, not the 2000s," the report says. "There are no budgets, not enough diplomats and no appropriate diplomatic doctrine."
Reut recommends setting up a counter-network, in which Israel's embassies in centers of delegitimization activity would serve as "front positions."
The report says the intelligence service should monitor the organizations' activities and study their methods. The cabinet should also confront groups trying to delegitimize Israel but embrace those engaged in legitimate criticism.
The report adds that Israel should not boycott these groups, as Israel's embassy in Washington does with the left-wing lobby J Street. Boycotting critics merely pushes them toward joining the delegitimizers, Reut says.

<title>Two Italian grocery chains to boycott Israeli produce</title>
<date>Sun May 23 19:54:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Two Italian supermarkets have announced that they plan to stop selling all Israeli products as they could not differentiate whether they came from West Bank settlements or inside the Green Line.
Italian grocery chains Coop and Nordiconad will remove all Israeli products from their shelves by the end of the month, according to the Stop Camel-Agrexco Web site - an Italian based coalition dedicated to the boycott of one of Israel's top agricultural exporters.
Grocery chain Coop Italia issued a statement saying that they had a problem with "traceability, namely that the consumer is unable to verify whether or not the product in question comes from the occupied territories."
The Coalition Web site added that this was "an important success for the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israeli apartheid."
According to the Web site, the campaign to lobby Italian supermarkets was launched in January this year and has since been coordinated in both Italy and France.
The statement added that the coalition "has vowed to make sure that both chains follow through on their promises, and encourages everyone to participate in this struggle for respect for international law, and freedom and self-determination for the Palestinian people."

<title>U.K. media's coverage of Salam Fayyad is starkly different to U.S. reporting</title>
<date>Sun May 30 17:29:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
 
British media handling of Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and the substantial economic progress in the West Bank which has taken place under his auspices, suggests that there are certain journalists who are somewhat reluctant to accommodate such "awkward" developments. The story in the United States, however, is very different.
A report released by Just Journalism, documents how Fayyad’s achievements in securing these economic and security improvements for Palestinians are majorly downplayed by the British broadsheet newspapers – The Guardian, The Independent, The Times, The Daily Telegraph and Financial Times. This stands in stark contrast with reporting of the same subject in both left and right-leaning U.S. publications, which have covered the positive developments in the West Bank more faithfully.
A typical approach in the U.K. can be seen in an editorial published on the day after Fayyad announced in London in August 2009 that he intended to have laid the groundwork for an independent Palestinian state within two years, outside the framework of political negotiations with Israel. The Financial Times headline accused: "Netanyahu’s peace is a cynical evasion," and the piece went on to caution: "During his1996-99 premiership, instead of land-for-peace he offered peace-for-peace; now he obfuscates about an 'economic peace'."
Extraordinarily, Fayyad and his policy announcement were not even mentioned in the leading article, which attributed solely to the Israeli PM the idea that improving the West Bank economy was a first priority in the creation of a viable Palestinian state.
Contrast this with an article the New York Times ran on the same day, in response to the same events. The headline says it all in many respects: ‘Palestinian Leader Maps Plan for Separate State’. Isabel Kershner described the plan as the ‘first of its kind from the Palestinian Authority’ and cited the U.S. Consul General Jacob Walles lending his approval: "He said that it was the first time he had seen such a 'concrete plan' and that the Palestinians were working in a practical way toward their goal."
Another occasion triggering these opposing presentations was Fayyad’s unprecedented appearance alongside Ehud Barak at the Herzliya Conference in February 2010. This passed largely unnoticed in U.K. Middle East reporting. The Independent’s Robert Fisk, who did cover the event, wrote of Fayyad’s participation with utter disdain and the only other British broadsheet to cover the event only did so on the back of a story primarily about Barak’s warning about the dangers of a failure to create a Palestinian state, in an article provocatively entitled: "Barak: make peace with Palestinians or face apartheid." 
Once again, across the pond at The Washington Post, a totally different portrayal emerged, in the form of, "Palestinian premier speaks at Israeli conference," in which the journalist commented that Fayyad’s attendance at such an event in Israel was ‘novel’, as was his sharing a podium with Defense Minister Ehud Barak ‘at a time when the two sides are not formally meeting.’
What can adequately explain these dramatically differing treatments of the phenomenon, last year coined "Fayyadism" by veteran New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman?
In the case of the U.K., I propose that the media’s intense dislike of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a big part of the answer. Netanyahu’s publicly stated desire to focus on the economic, rather than political, track, regarding the putative Palestinian state, obliterated any chance of a fair hearing of Fayyad’s similar approach, hence the Financial Times editorial which fixated on Netanyahu’s "cynical evasion," to the exclusion of Fayyad’s innovation.
American journalists, on the other hand, while not wildly keen on Netanyahu, have been able to adjust their narratives to make room for the hugely important developments which have positively affected Palestinians across the West Bank. I would suggest that if U.K. journalists want to uphold their responsibility to portray events in the Middle East faithfully, they start awarding the Palestinian prime minister the relevance he has plainly earned, regardless of whether it upsets their framing of Netanyahu as habitually wrong.
It is not difficult to understand why people find it hard to amend their political positions to reflect changing realities. One you have a framework in place for understanding a particular topic then the slightest shift can cause an inconvenient mess. But if you are a journalist, and therefore, largely responsible for public perceptions of that very subject, surely it is your duty to make such adjustments and tidy up the ensuing mess regardless of the inconvenience?

<title>Universities across the globe mark Israeli Apartheid Week</title>
<date>Mon Mar 01 02:21:08 IST 2010</date>
<content>
LONDON - A filmmaker, anthropologist and economic researcher are among those headlining events marking what pro-Palestinian organizers have declared as "Israeli Apartheid Week" - and all three speakers are Israeli.  
University campuses in more than 40 cities around the world are marking the week with lectures, films, multimedia events, cultural performances and demonstrations.   
Since they were first launched in 2005, the events have become some of "the most important global events in the Palestine solidarity calendar," according to its organizers.
 
Its aim, they state on their Web site, is to "contribute to this chorus of international opposition to Israeli apartheid and to bolster support for the boycotts, divestments and sanctions (BDS) campaign."  
Though many of the details about those events were not being promoted on the Apartheid Week Web site, it did list several events being offered by Israelis.  
Among them is Shir Hever, an economic researcher at the Alternative Information Center in Jerusalem, who is scheduled to give a series of lectures at the University of Amsterdam entitled "Could the Economic Policies of Israel be Considered a Form of Apartheid?"  
In addition, Israeli activist and filmmaker Shai Carmeli-Pollak is screening his 2006 documentary "Bil'in Habibti," about Israel Defense Forces violence, at Boston-area universities.   
Jeff Halper, the Israel-based professor of anthropology who is co-founder and coordinator of the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions, was scheduled to speak on "Israeli Apartheid: The Case For BDS" at Glasgow University.  
The participation of several Israelis in the anti-Zionist events is "atrocious," said David Katz, a member of Britain's Jewish Board of Deputies who grew up in South Africa and has long fought the comparison between that country's racial segregation and Israel's ethnic divisions.  
"They are free to do as they please, but it's atrocious," he said of the participating Israelis. "I think they don't understand the analogy they are making... which is insulting to those who suffered under apartheid."  
"It's like calling things 'holocaust' which are not the Holocaust or terming something 'genocide' which is not genocide," said Katz.  
As part of efforts to counter the Apartheid Week events, one Jewish charity brought over Benjamin Pogrund, a South African immigrant to Israel who is the former deputy editor of the Johannesburg-based Rand Daily Mail, to speak to British university students about why Israel is not an apartheid state.  
"The game plan of those who seek the destruction of Israel is to equate us with South Africa, a pariah state which had to be subjected to international sanctions," Pogrund has said. "Israelis coming to take part in this week should know better."  
In Canada, the legislature in the province of Ontario unanimously condemned Israeli Apartheid Week, voting for a resolution that denounced the campus events.  
"If you're going to label Israel as Apartheid, then you are also... attacking Canadian values," Conservative legislator Peter Shurman told Shalom Life, a Toronto-based Jewish Web site.   
"The use of the phrase 'Israeli Apartheid Week' is about as close to hate speech as one can get without being arrested, and I'm not certain it doesn't actually cross over that line," he said.

<title>U.S.-Israel row clouds opening day of AIPAC conference</title>
<date>Mon Mar 22 02:41:07 IST 2010</date>
<content>
WASHINGTON - Barbara Isaacson, 78, took the overnight train from Massachusetts to make it on time to the opening of the annual AIPAC conference in Washington. At one time she fought to gain exit visas for Jewish Prisoners of Zion in the Soviet Union, but now too she admits that the struggle goes on.  
She is writing letters to President Barack Obama, asking him to deal fairly with Israel and telling him that Jerusalem is not up for negotiation.  
The crisis Israel-U.S. relations underwent during the past week, did not leave her indifferent.  
"Our vice president, [Joe] Biden, was wrong," she says. "They should not have said that it was an insult. Israel showed great restraint. Israel is an amazing country that is giving us pride and it should not have to build bomb shelters in Sderot instead of playgrounds. I came to this conference so that Israel will know that in America there are those who dedicated their whole life to it, even though my five children live in the United States."  
On the steps of the conference center in Washington, Barbara is ready to enter a new battle: now against a group of demonstrators wearing t-shirts with Palestinian flags, protesting against an "apartheid state."  
During the exchange of words, it turns out that the mother of one of the demonstrators is Jewish.  
"So you are Jewish!," Barbara declares victoriously. "May God bless you and lead you to understand how wrong you are!"  
Protesters in front of the conference center put up signs in favor and against. Boris Zelkin puts up signs saying "Bibi - You are a Leader! Bibi, We believe in you!" and complains that he has been driven away from a number of places and has not been permitted to demonstrate inside the hall.  
"I came to tell the American Jews too that if they want to be multicultural and tolerant, then I don't - I want to be Jewish," he says.  
Several meters away stands Bill Perry, a Vietnam veteran whose wounds left him disabled. He is holding up a sign which says "AIPAC bought the Congress and the Senate."  
"It is embarrassing for how little our politicians can be bought," he declares. "This is the first time I came to demonstrate. It just makes me laugh, the 'conflict' between Israel and Washington. There was no conflict. Israel will continue its apartheid policy."  
On the face of it, opening day at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee Conference was business as usual. Congressmen and Senators complimented Israel, spoke of the strong bonds between Israel and the United States, historical moments of meetings between the leaders of the two countries were broadcast on a large screen, along with shots of new immigrants and IDF soldiers.  
The hallways were decorated with the photographs of the major donors and activists of the organization, with their comments on why they support AIPAC.  
In various halls there were lobbying seminars, for beginners and advanced, discussions on Syria, Iran, Turkey, Latin America, and meals accompanied by discussions, including a meeting with young African-Americans whose generation does not really know the role that American Jews played in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  
Even the competition with the new Israel lobby group on the left, J Street, did not succeed in shaking the standing of AIPAC, at least in terms of the numbers of participants, with 7,500 people signing up, a record high for the group.  
But the week of friction between Jerusalem and Washington has left a bitter taste in the mouths of many veteran activists.  
"I would not say that I am disappointed by the Netanyahu government," says Donell Weinkopf from New York. "But I feel like shit. Israel did something stupid by declaring this construction. I am not concerned about he future of the relationship because I think that the shared values and interests still stand, and that this was genuinely an 'accident inside the family,' but I think that the time has come for Israel to stop biting the hand of a friend."  
Rabbi Yossi Lipsky from Massachusetts says he thinks the current discord will leave a "minor scar."  
"People in the community were disappointed by the disproportionate response from America to what, in the worst case scenario, was bad timing," he says. "In the agreements with the Americans there was no mention of freeze in East Jerusalem. But because this response had no basis and made no sense, I am optimistic that it will pass. Now both sides are doing the right thing - they are trying to fix things quietly, diplomatically. I hope that they will focus on the fact that Israel made unprecedented concessions without seeing any return from the other side."  
Seymour Krinsky from Kansas is worried by the reception that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will receive this morning.  
"I am making an effort so that people will behave toward her with civility," he says using the Hebrew words derekh eretz, "and that they will remember that she is a guest in spite the things she said recently. There were many interpretations in the press. I hope that they were mistaken, that she said different things."  
AIPAC meanwhile is trying to renew its power base and bring in fresh supporters. This year, in addition to using Twitter and YouTube, some 1,300 young activists and students are taking part.  
For many of them, immigrating to Israel is not part of their immediate plans. "We were never exposed to anti-Semitism, but we heard about anti-Israel campaigns in colleges, and next year we are going to college, and we want to have the tools to deal with that," one said.

<title>U.S. Presbyterians urge government to end Israel aid over settlements</title>
<date>Sat Jul 10 01:35:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
Presbyterian leaders strongly backed a proposal Friday calling for the U.S. government to end aid to Israel unless the country stops settlement expansions in disputed Palestinian territories. The move was immediately criticized by Jewish groups.
But other aspects of the report on Middle East issues adopted by delegates of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) earned qualified praise from pro-Israel organizations, which have long taken issue with various Presbyterian statements on Middle East peace.
The report is meant as a guide for the denomination's more than 2 million members in many facets of the Israeli-Palestinian relationship. It was approved with 82 percent of the vote during the church's annual general assembly in Minneapolis.
"We feel we've brought together people who previously had trouble talking about some of these issues together," said the Rev. Karen Dimon of Northminster Presbyterian Church in North Syracuse, N.Y., and chairwoman of the committee that produced the 172-page report.
Ethan Felson, vice president of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said he still took issue with major aspects of the report, but said it contained important signals that could lessen long-standing tension between Presbyterians and pro-Israel Jews. He said it strengthens support for Israel's right to exist and removes comparisons of Israeli policy to apartheid.
"Concerns remain, but I have hope that authentic dialogue and better relations can come of this," Felson said.
The Anti-Defamation League said the report managed to avoid a rupture with Jewish people, but bias against Israel continues.
The Protestant denomination's relationship with Jewish groups took a hit in 2004, when its general assembly voted to authorize phased selective divestment in multinational corporations operating in Israel because of Israel's policies toward Palestinians. That stance has since been softened, and this year convention delegates voted down an amendment to the Middle East report that would have put divestment back on the table.
Despite the strong convention vote, some delegates expressed concern that the Middle East report remained too slanted toward a Palestinian perspective.
"There are many longtime friends in the Jewish community who believe this report misstates Jewish theology and misquotes the Jewish voice," said the Rev. Susan Zencka, pastor at Frame Memorial Presbyterian Church in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. "We have come to a position of Palestine good, Israel bad. Life is not that simple."
But supporters stressed that the overarching goal of the report is to encourage activism toward peace in the Middle East.
"I fully support a state of Israel, but I also believe Israel's peace will not come until they seek peace with Palestinians," said Dottie Villesvik, a church elder from Everett, Washington.
The church's annual convention began July 3, and is scheduled through Saturday.

<title>Will Israel turn into the fascist State of Judea by 2022?</title>
<date>Fri Jul 23 09:34:00 IDT 2010</date>
<content>
State-wide censorship of sexually explicit material on the internet. Laws prohibiting driving vehicles on the Sabbath and Jewish holidays. Women allowed to bathe in the Mediterranean only a few hours a week. The face of Baruch Goldstein on the 20 shekel bill. A national holiday celebrating our spiritual founding father, Rabbi Meir Kahane.
Sound ludicrous? It's the nightmare scenario of art school graduate Yosi Even Kama - and the subject of his 4th-year thesis project. Any Israeli can step into his dystopia, on exhibit at the Shenkar College of Engineering & Design in Ramat Gan until the end of July.
The project consists of four cylindrical public notice boards representing four different snapshots in time from the streets of Tel Aviv, between the years 2020 to 2023. In this twisted parallel universe, the government of Israel finally signs a peace deal with the Palestinians, in which it agrees to withdraw from the West Bank and share control over Jerusalem.
Incensed by what they believe to be high treason, Jewish supremacists manage to mobilize tens of thousands of Israeli citizens and successfully carry out a coup d'etat. In the newly-established State of Judea, there is no freedom, no feminism, and no fun. Only fascism.
"I read the most recent survey of Israeli society and I was shocked," Even Kama recalled. That report, commissioned by the Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research at Tel Aviv University, found that most Israelis believe that "there is too much freedom of expression" in Israel.
So this is what will come to pass in only ten years' time? "It won't happen exactly like that. But it's already happening right now, bit by bit: the loyalty oath law, the religious conversion law, the ban on commemorating the naqba, the ban on demonstrating at the homes of high-ranking army officers... When you break down the basic building blocks of democracy, fascism will fill that void."
They are not our brothers
In the run-up to a totalitarian state, Even Kama's made-up religious right-wing extremists combine visual imagery of slithery snakes and armies of insects with slogans that demonize democratic institutions. In the following year of this imaginary timeline, the rebels post pictures of snakes being sliced open and bugs being squashed, as they make their power play with an armed insurrection.
Following the fictional narrative, what remains of the liberal left in Israel sells off its properties and evacuates the country while it is still able. And finally, fabricated rabbinical edicts quoting traditional texts provide a religious justification for the execution of the secular heretics that resist the new order.
Destroying Democracy
Unsurprisingly, Even Kama's provocative project has angered many people on the opposite end of the political spectrum. On srugim.com, an internet news portal for the nationalist-religious community, many have vilified the artist, and the Shenkar school for providing him a platform. But other visitors to the site admit that they admire his designs and even advocate adopting them. "I would use different colors, but this is basically what I believe," wrote one commenter.
These undercurrents have not escaped the attention of more mainstream political commentators. Last month (June 22, 2010), reporting on the same set of phenomena that is frightening Even Kama, retired judge and Yediot Ahronot Legal Affairs Editor Boaz Okon wrote in a chilling op-ed piece: "These dots are growing evidence of the lack of spirit of freedom and the emergence of apartheid and fascism."
Using iconography that references our historical memories of evil dictatorships is bound to push people's buttons; the most amazing artwork almost always does. It is easy to dismiss the "State of Judea" as agitation against Even Kama's political opponents. But it's a lot harder to dismiss the anti-democratic parties and populist movements that he parodies. One thing is certain: if his deepest fears are realized, he could be the first one to be burned at the stake.

<title>Yisrael Beiteinu: Israel must not fund artists who boycott settlement arts center</title>
<date>Sun Nov 07 11:23:00 IST 2010</date>
<content>
Yisrael Beiteinu chairman, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, announced Sunday that his party has decided to act against theater personnel who are boycotting a new arts center built in the West Bank settlement of Ariel, by working to stop state funding channeled to the artists.
Lieberman and other Yisrael Beiteinu ministers will act against the boycotting artists by halting direct funding of their travel expenses for shows abroad and by preventing their appearances before state bodies.
In September, a group of theater actors and public figures signed a petition saying they would not perform in the new Ariel center as a protest of Israel's settlement policies. The protest was supported by over 150 academics.
Lieberman condemned the boycott and urged action against the theater actors. "These artists can enjoy freedom of speech but not at the expense of the taxpayers' money," said Lieberman. "Those who call Israel an apartheid state cannot also profit from it."
"The theater figures who signed on the boycott letter represent a small extreme fringe group in Israeli society, and there is no reason to fund their incitement against the state," said Lieberman.
"Everyone is allowed to criticize the government's policies, but they cannot act against it and doubt the legitimacy of it or of the Knesset, which were democratically elected, and at the same time ask for state funding."
"The show must go on, but the incitement must stop," he emphasized.
On Friday, dozens of theater figures boycotting the new Ariel cultural center sent a letter to Be'er Sheva Theater actors urging them to join their battle and boycott the newly built arts center in the West Bank settlement.
"Ariel is not just another community," the letter said, stressing that the actors were about to perform in the cultural center that was erected in Ariel on occupied land. "just several kilometers from the thriving and flourishing Ariel, Palestinians live in refugee camps, in harsh living conditions and without any basic human right. Not only are they not entitled to see performances in Ariel, some of them have no access to running water."
Likud MK Yariv Levin responded to the letter, saying that "the vast majority of the Israeli public is fed up with the lunatic fringe that has gained control of Israeli theater and cinema."

 Sha'ar Shivayon  (Equalizer ),  
 by Alon Liel. Hakibbutz Hameuchad, 220 pages, NIS 84 
 A year later, the question remains open: Was the soccer World Cup in South Africa last summer really only a cosmetic make-over? Did that magnificent event serve to cover up a bloody countenance? Did the hundreds of thousands of tourists who came mainly in order to enjoy life, but at the same time to take pleasure in the way a human society can surpass itself and become more equal - observe the reality that exists even when there is no World Cup, or were they witness to a colorful disguise donned by a body that has yet to recover from the serious illness that it harbored for decades? 
 Take, for example, the Soccer City Stadium, in Johannesburg - the site that hosted the opening ceremony and and the final, championship game of the event. "Soccer City" has a cosmetic sound to it. So, what's being covered up? For one, the funeral of Chris Hani, one of the most popular leaders of the battle against apartheid, second only to Nelson Mandela. In 1993, 100,000 people came to the FNB  (First National Bank ) stadium, as Soccer City was then known and is known again today, and almost caused its walls to collapse. Outside another 100,000 waited. Hani had been murdered nine days earlier by a white assassin. Those events put at risk the delicate web of arrangements that was beginning to be woven at the time between the apartheid regime and those rebelling against it. 
 Not only Hani's funeral lurks behind the name "Soccer City." The funeral of Oliver Tambo, Mandela's deputy during the 27 years of his imprisonment, also took place there. The central pre-election rally of the African National Congress - the group that in effect led the struggle against apartheid - also took place in the stadium, preceding the 1994 elections that were the culmination of the democratic revolution. Etched beneath today's luxurious and sophisticated stadium are many scars and much plastic surgery. Here is a possible description of the revolution: The site that served as a central platform for stormy political events in the struggle against apartheid today contains some 90,000 spacious seats, including luxurious VIP facilities in the upper part of the bleachers. 
 That is only one possible description, and its accuracy is in question. The issue of a cosmetic cover-up is more complex: Soccer City is situated outside Soweto, an urban area on the outskirts of Johannesburg. The name "Soweto" is an acronym for "Southwestern Townships," the neighborhood built in the second half of the 20th century that was designated for blacks only. The apartheid regime confiscated the property of blacks who lived in "white" areas and expelled them to Soweto. 
 In 1976, riots broke out there after a government decision to replace English with Afrikaans as the language of instruction in the schools. The latter is the language of the Afrikaners, aka the Boers, the descendants of 17th-century white settlers who came mainly from the Netherlands and who developed the ideas of the apartheid regime. Twenty-six people were killed in the riots, including two whites. 
 Now, tens of thousands of people from all over the world can stretch out in the new seats and enjoy a soccer game. They look around them and see black and white fans. They see them cheering and blowing vuvuzelas. They see equality and innovation. They say to themselves: Yes, the illness is gone, the scars have healed. Yet if they leave the stadium and travel for five minutes in the direction of Johannesburg's Central Business District (CBD), they will be exposed to a somewhat different situation. 
 On the way there they will pass John Vorster Square, the site of the old police headquarters, which during the period of apartheid occasionally issued the laconic report, "fell from the window of the detention room." Behind this report lay the torture of hundreds of anti-apartheid activists. Those who couldn't endure the torture and committed suicide had the privilege of falling from "the window of the detention room." 
 Next comes the CBD. In the 1990s this was the site of all the important business events, including those of the Jewish community. Today it is a "no go" area. Why is there no entry? Because this is the "wild south" - aside from hundreds of thousands of blacks, the old city houses millions of "illegals," mainly from Zimbabwe, but also from Mozambique, Nigeria and Sudan. Everything has been taken over by "illegal" squatters: office buildings, the Carlton Hotel, the Chelsea Hotel, the Summit Club. There are policemen on the streets, all of them black, but there is no enforcement. Nor is there a World Cup. 
 So what is Soccer City? On the one hand VIP rooms, on the other Soweto, on the third, the CBD. What exactly is South Africa? The answer to that question is not clear and certainly not unequivocal. That is also what makes Alon Liel's book "Sha'ar Shivayon" fascinating, for the most part. Liel, who was the Israeli ambassador to South Africa from 1992 to 1994, does not force a preconception on the reality, but allows the reality to force itself on him. He doesn't hide the desire he felt to see exciting images of democracy and equality during the World Cup games, but he met with enough people, in enough places, to get a somewhat more complex picture than that seen by the average tourist who cheered in Soccer City. 
 Liel's book is composed of well-written reports that describe splinters of reality and look at various parts of South Africa from many angles of observation. His knowledge is impressive, as is his personal acquaintance with several of the key figures in politics and in everyday life in the country. The fact that his term as ambassador coincided with the period when the country underwent its most significant democratization processes prepared him to return and do a good job of carrying out the declared mission of his book: "to delve into the physical and emotional scars of apartheid ... to examine whether it is an illness from which it is possible to be cured." 
 As for soccer, Liel claims already at the outset that it was only "an excellent excuse" for him. And in fact, the more one gets into the book, the less important it becomes. At a certain point it almost disappears. In a sense, Liel does answer the key question, indirectly: In a place where the scars are so deep and the blood hasn't dried yet, even the most beautiful cosmetic cover-up - the World Cup - is doomed to melt in the sun.

<title>Bridging the Palestinian-Israeli divide, one U.K. campus at a time</title>
<date>Sat Aug 13 16:57:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
A group of U.K. university students has come together to improve pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel relations, but with rampant anti-Israel sentiments throughout the country, it is still an uphill climb.
London, as Howard Jacobson recently explored in his 2010 Man Booker Prize winning Novel 'The Finkler Question', is becoming an increasingly uncomfortable city for supporters of the state of Israel, with 'Boycott Israeli Apartheid' stickers found posted in public places throughout the city.
Some of the most fervent anti-Israel sentiments come from London universities' Palestine societies. It would be unfair to say these attitudes are unprovoked, with groups like 'Stand with Us' intent on denying any Palestinian suffering at the hands of Israel,  however, the disparity between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel groups has the potential to become politically dangerous.
With campus activists butting heads about whether Israel is the "only democracy in the Middle East" or an Apartheid state, a group of students (myself included) decided to launch an initiative to temper these polarized approaches to the conflict.
The project began a few years ago when an Israeli student, Alexander Siedes, at Warwick University formed the Israeli Palestinian Forum (IPF), a group conceived in a bid to achieve mutual understanding and respect.
Warwick students began staging debates on topical Middle East issues, with pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian activists playing reverse roles in an attempt to bring about a paradigm shift or at least acknowledgement of the legitimacy of opposing views.
Today, Warwick IPF is a resounding success with a mixed Arab-Jewish committee and events often attended by over 100 people.
The IPF initiative has spread to other campuses throughout the U.K., with its importance and utility further highlighted by university groups’ invitations to speakers toting both anti-Israel and anti-Palestinians agendas.
At the London School of Economics last academic year, the Palestine society invited Abdel Bari Atwan, editor of the Al-Quds Al-Arabi newspaper, to speak about the "Zionist control of U.S. and U.K. foreign policy".
Bari Atwan used the terms "Zionist" and "Jewish" interchangeably, and accused the Jewish students attending the lecture of being responsible for bombing Gaza. The rabble-rousing address sparked anti-Semitic sentiments in the audience, with one of the attendees describing the Jews as Nazis.
The Israel society staged a provocation of its own, inviting Dr. Solon Solomon who attempted to deconstruct the international consensus that the area captured by Israel during the Six Day War is territory illegally occupied by Israel. This enraged both Palestinians and political moderates alike.
These types of events and the ideas they promoted prompted three Kings College students (one of them being myself) to start their own branch of IPF. The group’s aim is to break down hostile relations  between students caused by the polarized nature of campus debate on the Israeli-Arab conflict. We hope to achieve this through education, dialogue and eventually activism.
The first IPF event at Kings was a lecture delivered by Professor Raimond Gaita, editor of ‘Gaza: Morality, Law and Politics', which is a collection of essays that provide varying opinions on the legality and justification (or lack thereof) of Operation Cast Lead in the winter of 2008-2009.
The room was filled to capacity as the professor discussed Israel’s history and its existential legitimacy. He then held a Q&A session in which participants from all points of the political spectrum respectfully asked the academic about his stance on the military operation in the Gaza Strip.
The second IPF event hosted representatives from One Voice Israel and One Voice Palestine who came to present their personal opinions on why the two-state solution is the only desirable outcome for both peoples and a goal that must be actively pursued.The speakers were passionate and genuine in their wish to end the conflict, and the event was thoroughly enjoyable for those who attended.
The final event of the 2010-2011 academic year entitled “The Unilateral Declaration of a Palestinian State: Consequences for Regional Peace" was a huge success. It was a debate between speakers holding divergent opinions and included former PLO negotiator and Kings College Professor Yezid Sayigh, London Israeli Embassy Counselor Ran Gidor, human rights activist and founder of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign Peter Tatchell and Kings College conflict expert Simon Waldman.
All four speakers provided invaluable insight into one of the most pertinent questions of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict today - what will happen in September when the Palestinians plan to approach the United Nations to receive recognition?
IPF is still in its infant stage, and the prospect of effecting a true change of heart on either side of the conflict is lofty at best. However, our hope is that after a promising start, we will be able to engage an increasing number of students and start the initiative on other London campuses in the coming academic year.
We have formed a national IPF committee with Warwick and Manchester in the hopes that through our joint efforts we can continue to promote dialogue in college campuses throughout the U.K.
Although IPF participants may be set in their political opinions, it is our hope that by seeing the conflict through another lens, students will be more open to the legitimacy of other narratives and be able to create sustainable partnerships toward a viable Palestinian-Israeli peace.

<title>Court dismisses Jewish students’ lawsuit against U.S university</title>
<date>Tue Dec 27 09:42:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
A lawsuit filed by two Jewish students against a California university, alleging that the university did not protect them from anti-Semitic attacks, has been dismissed.
The plaintiffs said that they and other Jews were harassed during the annual Apartheid Week event at the University of California, Berkeley, held by Muslim student groups to protest Israeli policies.
U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg ruled late last week that there was no evidence that university officials violated the Jewish students’ rights, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

<title>Interview / Writer without borders </title>
<date>Thu Feb 17 18:22:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
 
PARIS - Jean-Christophe Rufin makes sure to explain right at the start of our interview that, although he is French - in other words, tightly wound - many years outside his homeland have taught him not to place too much importance on manners. That was a genuinely important gesture for me, since the man has so many titles it's hard to know how to address him: "Dr. Rufin," "Honorable Member of the Academy," "Mr. Ambassador"? Rufin is satisfied with the minimalist "Sir."
"Today I'm 'only' myself," he says modestly - himself being of France's most successful writers over the past decade, who has already won the prestigious Goncourt Prize twice, for his historical novels "The Abyssinian"  (1997 ) and "Brazil Red" (2001), both of which have also appeared in English. He is probably referring to the fact that, as of a few months ago, he is no longer serving as his country's ambassador to Senegal, and that he is no longer at the helm of an important humanitarian organization - neither the Nobel prize-winning Medicins Sans Frontieres  (Doctors Without Borders, which he started with his colleague Bernard Kouchner ), nor Action Against Hunger  (which he also helped establish ).
Rufin, who is actually a psychiatrist by profession, has now decided to devote himself entirely to his writing. His recently published novel, "Katiba"  (in French; Flammarion Books ), a geopolitical thriller whose title refers to the name of a terror base in the Mauritanian Sahara, sold 30,000 copies in its first week. And in a few weeks, a collection of seven short stories  (his first crack at the format ) will be out.
Rufin (who appears on Thursday evening at the book fair's  Literary Cafe) is a writer-adventurer in the best tradition of Ernest Hemingway, and in reading him, it is clear that these are first of all the authentic experiences of someone who knows what he's talking about. And on top of offering realistic descriptions of countries the world over, his books contain tools for understanding the important conflicts of our time.
"Today, nonfiction books bore me somewhat," Rufin admits. "I plan from now on to devote myself to writing novels only." That is a surprising declaration from the man who began his literary career in 1986 with a nonfiction essay that became a classic, "L'aventure humanitaire," which directed a uniquely critical glance at the West, accusing it of flooding needy third-world nations in a manner that leaves their economies dependent and crushed.
Back to Paris 
Rufin is returning to Paris after three years as French ambassador to Senegal, an experience he describes as "intense." He responded to the call from Kouchner, then France's foreign minister, who sought to open the ranks of his ministry to non-diplomats who possess special familiarity with a specific region or issue.
Rufin, who avoids a declared affiliation with any particular political party, decided to take the job - although his description of those years seems to imply he has some regrets about having done so. There is no question that through the heroine of "Katiba," Jasmine - a Frenchwoman of Algerian origin who tries to make her way up the ranks of French diplomacy - he conveys the empty ceremony that characterizes much of diplomats' lives. One of the more entertaining scenes in the book  (which is not blessed with abundant humor ) describes Jasmine's many mistakes in seating dignitaries at an official ceremony: How can she seat the minister's wife next to a mere attache?
Harder to understand than Rufin's readiness to leave the foreign service is his willingness to forfeit any connection to the medical profession with which he was involved for so many years. He entered the field out of "a true calling," he says: "My grandfather was a doctor."  (In fact, Rufin's grandfather saved the lives of members of the resistance during World War II - and for that the Germans sent him to Buchenwald for two years. )
But the profession that he originally entered no longer exists, he says. "Medicine has developed in a direction that conflicts with my literary, humanist nature. Today it's a scientific profession, and increasingly distant from human beings .... I wanted a more open career that would express my desire to be politically and socially involved, and organizations like Medicins Sans Frontieres allowed me to experience the profession much more broadly. I began to write so I could understand and describe what I had experienced."
Although he served as an adviser in several governments on human rights issues and humanitarian assistance, Rufin never assumed an establishment position. "I've always kept my distance from politics," he explains. "Political issues are at the top of my agenda, but I find French politics at the moment quite boring and I really don't feel like defending principles that are far removed from mine."
Despite his exalted status and the fact that he is almost 60, Rufin is trying to return to the antiestablishment rebelliousness that characterized the start of his career. In that case, I ask him why he accepted the invitation to join the French Academy - which more than anything else symbolizes conservatism and conformism.
"Wait, wait, you haven't seen me in uniform yet!" he says, after bursting out laughing.  (Members of the academy, founded in 1635, wear festive uniforms, including a sword and a helmet, to their meetings. )
"France is now at a historical crossroads," he continues, replying in all seriousness. "It is undergoing a profound transformation of identity, and today, more than anything else, we are in need of traditional milestones, which come from the past. I'm sitting in the chair of the late Henri Troyat, a chair that has been occupied by intellectuals since the 17th century. That is important historical continuity, even if we feel like criticizing or improving it."
Witness to Operation Moses 
Rufin, whose connection to Africa began during military service as a doctor in the former French colony of Tunisia, is surprised to hear that in Israel there is minimal interest in neighboring Africa, and that eyes are turned exclusively to the United States and Europe. "But how can that be? After all, you have the Falashas," he says, using a term for Ethiopian Jews that has long been out of fashion. "I was in Ethiopia during Operation Moses [which brought thousands of Ethiopian Jews to Israel in 1984]. I wasn't particularly attracted to the country until I met my wife, Azeb, the mother of my two daughters.
"You should know that the Falasha always had inferior status; they were involved in a limited number of trades. My wife told me about the many prejudices toward them. For example, if a Falasha looks at someone while he is eating, it brings him bad luck. The Jews of Ethiopia may regard the lost homeland with nostalgia, but I remember how then, in 1984, their situation was terrible. They were considered foreigners.
"During Operation Moses, I saw all the Israelis who prepared the journey. It makes no difference what the deep ideological motives were, it was in my opinion extremely fortunate for them. That operation laid the groundwork for the immigration of the rest of the Jews later on.
"I admit that I didn't imagine that the difficulties in Israel would include theological obstacles that the rabbis would place before them  (when they asked them to convert and so on )... There's no question that I also see things through my wife's eyes; she's an Ethiopian, but of Coptic origin. She is shocked by the situation of the Falashas in Israel."
Rufin, who was raised as a Catholic but today is nonpracticing, has visited Israel before, but insists he is not very familiar with the Middle East. He is, however, quite familiar with the situation of the Jews in France. In 2004, the interior minister commissioned him to research the nature of anti-Semitism and racism in France, and how to fight these blights. Rufin submitted a report in which he concluded that the radical anti-Zionist viewpoints in France amount to a kind of camouflaged anti-Semitism.
The report was met with indignation and cataloged as "pro-Israeli." And its recommended sanctions for journalists and other opinion makers who label the Israeli regime as apartheid, Nazi or racist were never implemented.
In "Katiba," Rufin once again analyzes an explosive issue. Although he claims to be very far removed from various types of religious fundamentalism, and from any religious belief himself, his book offers an analysis of the mechanism that leads young people to carry out suicide attacks.
"My heroes were forced to carry out the attacks," he explains. "Such attacks are not part of any tradition in that region of Africa, which belongs to Sunni Islam. I think the suicide bombers are imitating Shi'ite behavior. Many of the young Muslims in France have prejudicial opinions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and they actually repeat word for word what they hear on the main French news channel and on Al Jazeera. This is a process that is possible because they lack any independent culture - most of them come from families that did not pass on their own history to them. They therefore have a kind of culture that is basically an imitation.
"In my book, the two young people who do that are actually petty criminals, 'troublemakers,' who are influenced by others. They are between two cultures and they totally lack backbone," he says.
When asked how he sees the phenomenon as a psychiatrist, Rufin seems amused, saying he doesn't want to reduce a political phenomenon to a type of psychiatric syndrome. "But there is no question that there is a certain type of personality here who tends toward that [behavior]," he says. "And they are the ones who attracted me as a writer, [creating] a novel that is totally fictional. In my eyes these are first of all people without a culture. Not only in Africa, in France too.
"I situated the plot and the heroes in Mauritania for a reason," Rufin continues. "This is a country in the desert, these are Arabs who are isolated from everyone. Today it's an Islamic country that is not extreme, on the face of it, but there, of all places, one can find lots of candidates for this type of terrorism. They explained to me that they have always felt lost and cut off from others. They are a product of being severed from the original culture. They feel 'insufficient' - 'insufficiently Muslim,' 'insufficiently Arab,' 'insufficiently active,' and the like. They felt like orphans who wanted to find a family at any cost, and they are doing it in the most extreme manner possible."

<title>Israeli Apartheid Week scores condemnation from Canadian officials</title>
<date>Sun Apr 03 09:50:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
The annual Israeli Apartheid Week held last month by university students in 11 Canadian cities brought condemnation from Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who called the controversial event a clear act of anti-Semitism.
“We must be relentless, relentless and uncompromising in exposing this anti-Semitism for what it is,” the prime minister told participants at a Toronto Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee conference, after the week of workshops, demonstrations, and performances to mark the seventh annual international event.
“The new anti-Semitism is a global threat,” Harper warned the sold-out crowd at the Royal Conservatory of Music. “It targets the Jewish people by targeting Israel, which it depicts as a source of injustice and conflict in the world perversely using a language of human rights to do so.”
Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff also spoke out against the annual event, saying while one may criticize the state of Israel, “it is impermissible to compare it to South Africa.”
Ignatieff had earlier released an official statement calling Israeli Apartheid Week a “dangerous cocktail” of ignorance and intolerance. “By portraying the Jewish state as criminal, by demonizing Israel and its supporters, and by targeting Jewish and Israeli students for abuse on our university campuses, the organizers and supporters of Israeli Apartheid Week tarnish our freedom of speech.”
According to its website, Israeli Apartheid Week aims to support Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against “Apartheid Israel.” Organizers claim that their goal is to promote “full equality for Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel, an end to the occupation and colonization of all Arab lands- including the Golan Heights, the Occupied West Bank with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip” and “the protection of Palestinian refugees’ right to return to their homes and properties.”
This year’s IAW events, which ran from March 7-26th , included lectures, performances, film screenings, and demonstrations on university campuses. Although the campaign started in 2005 at the University of Toronto, it has now spread to 55 cities across the globe, including Paris, Mexico City and Haifa.
In Canada, a popular IAW workshop described the Jewish National Fund as “the perfect example of Zionist racism and ethnic cleansing.”
The Canadian IAW program also featured “Won't Stop Til the Wall Drops,” an Israeli Apartheid Week hip-hop show, and a program called “Yoga for Resistance.”
Jason Kenney, Canada’s Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, urged students not to participate in IAW events, which he says are often accompanied by anti-Semitic harassment, intimidation, and bullying.” He adds that IAW activities can cultivate an atmosphere that is antithetical to the “free exchange of ideas and the development of the mind with the aid of facts and logic.”
Kenney argues that while criticism of Israel is not itself necessarily anti-Semitic, the selective condemnation of the only Jewish State and its right to exist can create a hateful environment.
“Such scapegoating becomes yet another symptom of a worrying new acceptance of the vilification of Israel and of Jews around the world,” he warned.

<title>The importance of national repentance </title>
<date>Wed Sep 28 11:33:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
	My student years were a lot of fun. As young idealists. we marched, rallied and campaigned for numerous causes, but one of the major issues that stood at the heart of our radical consciousness was the South African apartheid.
	It took time, but the results were astonishing and apartheid was replaced with democracy.
	Last summer, when I visited South Africa for the first time, I marveled at the collapse of the mighty apartheid regime and the outstanding efforts of the new South Africa to integrate its rainbow of nations.
	On Yom Kippur, we read the curious tale of Jonah and the big fish that swallowed him. At the end of the story, Jonah recants and travels to Nineveh, where he preaches powerful sermons warning of the city's imminent destruction.
	His message is heard by the people who proclaim a fast day, don sackcloth and ashes and repent for their misdeeds. When the King of Nineveh hears what has happened, he joins the penitential frenzy, ordering a mass fast which includes not only people, but animals as well.
	The response from Nineveh is immediate, dramatic and extreme. It is high on passion, but low on maturity. When bizarrely, the people force their animals to fast and dress in sackcloth, Jonah is unimpressed.
	But God is more tolerant, conceding that although the people "do not yet know their right from their left", their actions are sincere, they are His beloved creations, and so He forgives them.
	In South Africa, I saw signs of it nationwide-repentance everywhere. The old "whites only" benches have been consigned to museums; black and white people sit together in parks, universities and the judiciary.
	A revolution has occurred. Human rights activists like Judge Albie Sachs who were once hunted and persecuted by the apartheid regime are now national heroes, making extraordinary contributions to the New South Africa.
	A nation can repent.
	The South African revolution remains young and in some senses immature. Violence is a continuous threat and AIDS is still rampant. In Durban, all of the road names were changed overnight, replacing the old "white names" with new black ones. The results are chaotic as drivers and pedestrians have no idea which streets they are traversing.
	Yet, there is something thrilling and uplifting about a nation which repents. England too, is going through a process of national introspection as it tries to understand the violent riots which recently erupted on its streets. And the Arab spring has elements of penitence as nations rise up against unjust, authoritarian regimes.
	On Yom Kippur, God judges not only every individual, but every nation too. (Rambam Laws of Penitence 3: 2) One of the most radical, exciting and enticing ideas at the heart of religious Zionism is the concept that the Jewish people must strive to build the most moral, ethical society in the world. 	We are all very proud of Israel and its extraordinary achievements. Against all the odds, we have built an outstanding democracy and performed miracles in technology, Torah study, integration of different peoples and ethnic groups and so much more.
	Nevertheless, as Yom Kippur approaches, we are not exempt from national stock-taking.
	The more religiously observant we are, the more concerned we should be about the moral level of our nation. We must never lose sight of our national mission to be the most righteous of the nations. If others see imperfections in our state, we should listen carefully before dismissing their criticism.
	Smugness is the enemy of true piety. Introspection, repentance and striving for improvement are the hallmarks of our identity and the fuel of Jewish moral achievement.
	So as Yom Kippur approaches, let us be open to criticism, regardless of its source. Let us be sure to ask searching questions about how we treat "the strangers who dwell amongst us", the poor and the vulnerable. Let us investigate the flaws in our society and correct them.
	We may not achieve perfect penitence, but every effort that we make is recognized by God and brings us closer to fulfilling the mission of the Jewish people – because a nation can repent.

<title>There is a Jewish-Arab left </title>
<date>Mon Aug 01 01:41:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
I am sure that Salman Masalha's article  ("You call this a left?," July 27 ) was flattering to Jewish readers and affirmed their prejudice, already pervasive, that most Arab citizens are nationalistic and that the affliction has even spread to Hadash and the Israeli Communist Party  (Maki ). There is nothing more convenient for an oppressor than to receive assurances of his righteousness against the oppressed. My friend Masalha produced, as is his wont, a cogent article in which few could discern the barren moral and ideological landscape.
Masalha claims that "the left is supposed to bridge the gap and the national tension by positing a civic agenda..." From a few remarks of Maki's secretary general Mohammed Nafa, he concludes that such a left wing "does not exist."
Nafa was mistaken when he appeared to be supportive of the murderous tyrannical regime in Syria, but he was right when he said: "We will never surrender to the Israeli prostitution that is trying to portray Israel as a victim."
Nafa's priorities are certainly logical. Arab citizens cannot change the situation in North Korea, Iran or even in Syria. Their task is to fight here to free their people in Palestine and for full equal rights in Israel. Since the government of Israel and the United States have been collaborating for more than 40 years to preserve the oppression, Nafa sees the struggle against then as the most important thing of all.
The task of the left is not to bridge gaps by means of a civic agenda. That is the traditional task of the conservative-liberal bourgeousie. The left is supposed to fight for justice and equality, against oppression and the hegemony of force in the international arena. The national struggle of an oppressed people is the raison d'etre of the left; the nationalism of the fundamentalists in the United States and Israel, whose purpose is to perpetuate discrimination and repression, is unacceptable.
The Cuban revolutionaries believed that national emotions in Latin America were fuel for the anti-imperialist struggle. That was true then and it is true now.
There is therefore no symmetry between the nationalism of a settler in Kedumim and that of a resident of Gaza. Terror against civilians is unacceptable, but the intent of national unity in Gaza is to liberate the Palestinians from occupation and siege; the intent of national unity in the name of "Zionism" is to perpetuate the occupation and create an apartheid state here.
The uniqueness of Hadash is in the fact that the Arab citizens who support the movement identify with the national aspirations of their people; however, they reject not only terror but also the negation of the rights of the Jews here. Masalha also knows, and concedes halfheartedly, that Hadash educates toward Jewish-Arab brotherhood not only in Bat Yam or Tel Aviv, but in Sakhnin, Nazareth and Taibeh.
Nafa, as quoted by Masalha, does not say that he supports the evil regimes in Syria, Iran or North Korea  (and they are evil, make no mistake ). He only asserts that the Jewish-Arab left in Hadash must "be more involved" in the struggle against the Israeli and the American occupation. That is the opinion of everyone who is part of the socialist left.
North Korea is an abomination, but it must not serve good Israeli radicals as an excuse to vote for Meretz - which comes out against all wars after they are over - instead of Hadash, which blends a social and a political line that should engender widespread support.
Nafa must see to it that his positions are not perceived as supporting Syria and the wicked regime there. But when Masalha ignores the role of Israel and the United States in the regional and global arena, it helps the enemies of the left and the enemies of peace.

<title>U.S. judge dismisses claims of anti-Semitism at UC Berkeley</title>
<date>Tue Dec 27 22:36:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit against the University of California, Berkeley filed by two Jewish students who claimed the school fostered an atmosphere of anti-Semitism by not doing enough to curb alleged harassment during pro-Palestinian protests that included mock checkpoints.
Plaintiff Jessica Felber claimed in the lawsuit that a leader of a campus pro-Palestinian group rammed her with a shopping cart as she staged a counter-protest to "Apartheid Week," an annual event that compares Israel's policies to the institutionalized racism of South Africa's former white government.
Felber, who graduated last year, and current undergraduate Brian Maissy sued in March to demand the university enact rules to curb what they called ongoing harassment that they said amounted to a violation of their First Amendment rights to freedom of religion and speech.
Much of the alleged harassment, even if true, constituted protected political speech, San Francisco U.S.District Judge Richard Seeborg wrote in dismissing the case Thursday.Seeborg found that the university itself did not violate the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.
Furthermore, he said UC Berkeley did not have a legal obligation to intervene in any dispute in which a private individual was allegedly interfering with those rights.
"The incident in which Felber was assaulted with a shopping cart, for example, did not occur in the context of her educational pursuits," Seeborg wrote.
"Rather, that event occurred when she, as one person attempting to exercise free speech rights in a public forum was allegedly attacked by another person who likewise was participating in a public protest in a public forum."
Joel Siegal, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told the San Francisco Chronicle his clients were reviewing their options and that the suit had stimulated dialogue about acceptable conduct at the university.
In the Apartheid Week protests as described in the lawsuit, students dressed as soldiers carry fake assault weapons and demand to know whether passing students are Jewish.
Felber said she required medical attention as a result of the shopping cart incident and obtained a permanent restraining order against the alleged assailant.
The plaintiffs cited what they said was a long history of harassment of Jewish students by Muslim and pro-Palestinian student groups on UC campuses.
Among those is a high-profile case in Orange County, where 10 Muslim students were convicted of misdemeanors for disrupting a speech given by an Israeli ambassador last year at UC Irvine. The students appealed, arguing that the law used to convict them was vague and unconstitutional.
In dismissing the UC Berkeley case, Seeborg observed that many of the incidents of alleged harassment occurred before the plaintiffs were enrolled or did not happen at UC Berkeley. He also said the incidents as described showed that campus police intervened to arrest disruptive protesters and that the university has worked to mediate conflicts between opposing student groups.
Tensions between Jewish and Muslim student groups have often run high on UC campuses over the issue of Israel's policies toward Palestinians.
In March, the U.S.¬ Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights notified UC Santa Cruz it was investigating a faculty member's complaint that a series of pro-Palestinian events had created a hostile environment for Jewish students.
Hebrew lecturer Tammi Rossman-Benjamin said administrators repeatedly failed to address her and students' concerns about film screenings and appearances by "viciously anti-Israel" speakers sponsored with campus funds. The university said Rossman-Benjamin's complaints were unfounded.

<title>Yes Mr. Lieberman, I'm a proud Jewish terrorist </title>
<date>Tue Jul 19 03:08:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
In 1942, as a young boy, a high school student in Tel Aviv, I joined the Haganah  (the main pre-state underground Jewish militia ). The British Mandatory government considered me, and others who did as I did, to be members of an illegal organization. Two years later I enlisted in the Palmach, the elite strike force of the Haganah, and during my period of activity in the framework of the Jewish resistance movement the British government considered me a "terrorist." Afterwards I fought in the War of Independence and spent another 32 years in the Israel Defense Forces as a career soldier.
Today I consider the continuation of our occupation rule in Judea and Samaria an existential danger. As I see it, this situation is threatening the main achievement to which I contributed 70 years ago: the establishment of a sovereign and democratic Jewish state. If we don't separate as soon as possible from the Palestinian population on the ground, Jewish and democratic Israel will be unable to survive.
A few years ago I became a member of the public council of Yesh Din - Volunteers for Human Rights. I can't influence Israel's diplomatic decisions, but I saw it as my duty to contribute to upholding the law in the occupied under our control. I believe that the Israeli government, the Knesset and the vast majority of the people want the law to be enforced in the area east of the Green Line, just as they want it to be enforced to the west of it. But in the present situation, unfortunately, there is no equal treatment for Jews and Arabs when it comes to law enforcement. The legal system that enforces the law in a discriminatory way on the basis of national identity, is actually maintaining an apartheid regime. And I wanted to prevent that with my activity and contribution as a member of the council of Yesh Din.
The Palestinian resident in the occupied territory is unable in most cases to stand up for his rights and to find his way in the State of Israel's civil and military bureaucratic maze. The group of researchers and volunteers  (mainly female ) of Yesh Din serve as his mouthpiece. We do not presume to decide who is right in each and every instance. Our job is only to learn about all the details of the complaint and to bring it to the authorities.
The Israeli administration in the area, the IDF and the Israel Police, don't like our activity. They feel uncomfortable dealing with the complaints that we place before them. But none of them claims that our activity is unnecessary, unacceptable or subversive.
Yesterday something shocking happened. A respectable minister in the Israeli government, the foreign minister, the man who heads the Yisrael Beitenu party, called the organization of whose public council I am a member, Yesh Din, a terrorist organization - 69 years after the British Mandatory government defined me as a terrorist.
At the time I considered the epithet attached to me by the Mandatory government a badge of honor. Today I see the same title, which this time was attached to me by Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, as a new badge of honor. I believe that the activity of Yesh Din deserves a medal. I see our activity as a crucial attempt to save the State of Israel from becoming an apartheid regime.
The foreign minister should have been the first to understand that. Doesn't he understand that a person who condemns the activity of Yesh Din is in effect announcing a deliberate intention to maintain a miscarriage of justice, a deliberate intention to maintain separate systems of law and justice for Jews and Arabs? Under these circumstances, Mr. Lieberman, I'm proud to be called a "terrorist" by you.

<title>A clash of narratives as Abbas and Netanyahu duel it out at the UN</title>
<date>Fri Sep 23 23:38:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
NEW YORK – There was little room for optimism at the end of what some may describe as a historic day in which Palestine asked for UN recognition while its leader Mahmoud Abbas went head to head with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the entire world to see.
Both Abbas and Netanyahu spoke well, from their own point of view, but each spoke past each other and to completely different audiences. Theirs was a dialogue of the deaf, a clash of divergent narratives; proof, if one was needed, that Israelis and Palestinians reside in parallel universes, and never the twain shall meet, if nothing dramatic occurs.
Abbas was courting the Palestinians, first and foremost, and his target audiences were the Arab and Third Worlds. His speech was peppered with the kind of harsh anti-Israeli catchphrases that are the staple of the UN’s “automatic majority” at forums like Durban and the Human Rights Council, including “apartheid”, “colonialism”, “racism” and “ethnic cleansing”. Fresh off the heels of the stinging rebuke he sustained in U.S. President Barack Obama’s UN speech this week, Abbas was obviously in no mood to please Americans or Israelis, opting instead for a no-holds-barred presentation of the Palestinian narrative that grated on the ears of most Israelis but fueled the enthusiasm of his many supporters in the General Assembly building.
Netanyahu, for his part, addressed those parts of the world that Abbas chose to ignore. In a well-executed though rather long-winded presentation - which drew most of its applause from the Israeli delegation and an imported crowd of cheerleaders -  Netanyahu cast himself as a Daniel in the hyenas’ den of the UN’s anti-Israeli bloc,  appointed himself a spokesman for “100 generations of Jews”, rebuffed Abbas’ more incendiary allegations and saved a little something for each of his favorite groups:  the Lubavitcher Rebbe for religious Jews,  a citation from the Bible for evangelical Christians,  the memory of 9/11 for his American audience and the invitation to Abbas to “talk dugri”, the Israeli equivalent of  the American “talk turkey”, for his Israeli voters at home.
But though they pledged their supposed allegiance to a negotiated two-state solution, Abbas and Netanyahu made no effort to hide their deep mistrust of each other’s true intentions and their mutual underlying assumption that they both lack a credible partner for peace. Nonetheless - in the only bit of good news for those who insist on maintaining a slight glimmer of hope despite all the proof to the contrary – in the wake of the Quartet’s call Friday, Washington is sure to seek an early resumption of peace talks, if only to rid the United States of the political hot potato that Abbas dumped on its lap when he decided to press ahead with his big UN offensive.

<title>ADL chief to Abbas: Stop demonizing Israel, resume direct peace talks</title>
<date>Thu Oct 06 13:34:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
The Palestinian Authority must stop demonizing Israel in the international stage, the Anti-Defamation league said in an open letter to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday, urging the PA leader to return to the negotiations table.
In an open letter released on Wednesday, ADL director Abraham H. Foxman criticized Abbas for his recent address in front of the United Nations General Assembly, urging the PA president to return to peace talks and halt the Palestinian campaign to delegitimize Israel.
"You say you will not come to negotiate until Mr. Netanyahu says in advance that Israel will concede all the territories and stop all settlements," Foxman wrote, citing Abbas' self-proclaimed inability to trust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
"Trust is a two-way street," the ADL chief said, adding: "Let's stop this demonizing.  Let's move forward.  If you sit down to talk, you may learn that you have far greater reason to trust Prime Minister Netanyahu than you thought."
The ADL: director urged Abbas to quell Israeli concerns over the sincerity of the Palestinians' wish to end the Mideast conflict, saying that the only way to do so was not through smearing Israel's name in the international community by but "coming back to the table, by negotiating in good faith and by reaching an agreement that finally ends the conflict and provides for a Palestinian state and a Jewish state living side-by-side in peace and security."
In his letter, Foxman criticized the Palestinian president for attacking Israel in his UN speech, saying that while Abbas "claimed that the initiative to get the U.N. to accept Palestine as a member state was not intended to isolate or delegitimize Israel," he nonetheless "used the very language that was employed against apartheid South Africa to achieve that very purpose."
"You used all the code words and phrases that provoke Israel’s isolation from the world community: racist, colonialist, annexationist, brutal, ethnic cleanser, aggressive," Foxman added, saying: "You miscast Israel’s understandable desire to be recognized as a Jewish state, a recognition which should not be a big matter if the goal is two states living side-by-side in peace and security."
Foxman's missive came following a Palestinian bid for statehood at the UN late last month, a move which Israel and the U.S. have criticized as "unproductive" to continued direct peace talks.
In a statement following the Palestinian bid, the Quartet - the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia -- said it wanted to see comprehensive proposals within three months on territory and security, and substantial progress within six months.

<title>A page out of Bibi's playbook </title>
<date>Fri Sep 23 03:00:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Nu? Are we isolated yet? Have the tidal waves of September's diplomatic tsunami crashed over Israel? Is the Jewish state hurtling down the steep slope of pariahdom? Even before Barack Obama's surprisingly pro-Israel speech at the United Nations and the sudden shift in the Quartet's policy, to applying pressure almost exclusively on the Palestinians, I would have argued that the specter of an Israel isolated in the world, facing boycotts, sanctions and a relentless campaign of delegitimization was a false one. The facts on the ground just don't support it.
Take the last couple of years as a test case. Israel is being governed by one of its most right-wing governments ever, the Knesset is passing anti-democratic laws and Israeli society seems more insular and xenophobic than ever. Has the country become an outcast among nations? No, it has become a member of one of the most exclusive clubs, the OECD. Has Israel's trade relations suffered? In a period of global financial turmoil, all the economic indicators are up.
The clash of personalities and ideologies between the American president and the Israeli prime minister could hardly be more strident, but has this harmed the strategic ties with the United States? Not at all. In addition to the annual $ 3 billion dollars in aid, Israel will now be getting $ 205 million dollars to build more Iron Dome missile-defense batteries and there are more joint exercises between Israeli and American armed forces than ever. The last month in which Israeli diplomats were expelled from Turkey and the embassy in Cairo was sacked may have seemed a bad one, but at the same time, Standard and Poor upgraded Israel's credit rating to A + and Israel became the first non-European nation to become an associate member of the European nuclear research agency, CERN.
So what is happening here? Is Binyamin Netanyahu really a magician? "Don't worry," he has been saying to Israelis for the last two and a half years, "don't listen to all the noise and nuisance around you, Israel is strong, Israel is just, we will persevere and prosper." So far, he seems to pulling it off.
Yes, we all know that the situation around us, in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and Turkey has not been this unstable for decades, but all the more reason - so Bibi tells us - to hunker down, not make any changes and weather the storm. The west will soon realize it has only Israel to rely on in the region. Is this all short-termism? How long can Netanyahu and the right wing get away with thumbing their noses at the world? From their perspective at least, it could carry on indefinitely. If Obama has just raised the white flag, what other American president will ever pressure Israel again? Certainly not any of the prospective Republicans who may be sitting in the White House in fifteen months.
What about the European Union - could they finally get together long enough to pursue a coherent Mideast policy? It wouldn't seem so, not with the looming meltdown of the Eurozone. They won't have the time or the energy. So who else is there? Russia? China? India? When did these countries ever pursue a foreign policy not based on narrow financial interests? So what else? Western public opinion? Civil acitivism? NGOs? If they had the power to change Israel's policy, it would have happened long ago.
For some years now, there have been those on the left who have been trying to peddle the Israeli apartheid line, in the hope that it would generate a widespread movement of boycotts against Israel. It hasn't worked for any numbers of reasons. For a start, the comparison between Israel and racist South Africa is so evidently an immoral and lazy one, that it simply doesn't wash - especially among those left-wing Jewish Zionists who actually know Israel. They are fully aware of Israel's many faults and don't need anyone else to characterize them in such an erroneous fashion. So the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra gets heckled in London, a few academic organizations and trade unions pass motions boycotting Israel, some shops selling Dead Sea cosmetics get picketed - who feels isolated by that? Certainly not the majority of Israelis who are only going to see this as an affirmation of the "anti-Semitic world is out to get us" trope.
Of course, in the long run, this is not sustainable. Israel's current prosperity is due to its dynamism and entrepreneurship. But such a state would have been impossible if the country still had to channel huge financial and human resources into facing a mortal enemy in the south  (Egypt, not Hamas ) and if everyday life was constantly disrupted by terror attacks in cities. The peace with Egypt - which looks increasingly precarious - may have been cold throughout its entire existence, but it still served as the impetus for the economic miracle. That miracle could hardly be sustained without the current level of security cooperation with the Palestinian Authority, which ensures calm on Israel's streets. Even if the international community doesn't get off its haunches and impose a diplomatic solution, Netanyahu's refusal - or political inability - to embark on a credible peace initiative will ultimately reap a storm. And in the meantime, Israel will become even more polarized in the process, riven into a network of fighting tribes, failing to build a national ethos.
Where does this leave those who love Israel yet are convinced it is going down a disastrous path, for its own society and sense of Jewish justice first and foremost? Maybe the time has come to play to Israel's strengths. It is, for all its faults, a democracy and an open society. The attempts of various NGOs and foundations to quietly fund "civil society" movements have not had much effect, as they have only fed into right-wing suspicion and created a backlash. A more open and broader approach is needed. Why not take a page out of Netanyahu's playbook?
Bibi has proved that he can rely on the strategic relationship with the United States while playing off the Republican Party against the Obama administration. That should be the strategy of all those who care about Israel's future. Opposing Israel's isolation and the boycott movement does not have to mean embracing Likud paralysis and Liebermanesque xenophobia. And it doesn't mean going underground as wanna-be dissidents either.
As of Wednesday night, Israel has two mainstream opposition leaders with a clear agenda for a two-state solution. Foreign politicians and Jewish community leaders should make it clear that they can do business with Bibi as long as he is the elected prime minister, but it is not his version of Israel they choose.

<title>British orchestra suspends 4 over call to boycott Israel </title>
<date>Sun Sep 18 00:32:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
The London Philharmonic Orchestra has suspended four of its musicians for nine months after they called for a boycott of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra earlier this month, in what cultural commentator Norman Lebrecht called, in his blog, "the most severe public penalty inflicted on London orchestral musicians in memory."
Cellist Sue Sutherley and violinists Tom Eisner, Nancy Elan and Sarah Streatfeild were among the 21 signatories to a letter that was sent to BBC Proms concert series director Roger Wright and published in The Independent on August 30. The signatories, headed by the Irish composer Raymond Deane, called for the cancelation of the IPO's appearance at the popular festival, held at the Albert Hall on September 1. The four LPO members who were later suspended, and a few of the other signatories, indicated the ensembles to which they belonged next to their signatures.
The letter noted that Wright "was asked to cancel the concert in accordance with the call from the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott" of Israel, but refused. It cited the IPO's "deep involvement with the Israeli state - not least its self-proclaimed 'partnership' with the Israeli Defence Forces" - "the same state and army that impedes in every way it can the development of Palestinian culture, including the prevention of Palestinian musicians from travelling abroad to perform." The letter called the orchestra "perhaps Israel's prime asset" in its "campaign" to hide "denials of human rights and violations of international law ... behind a cultural smokescreen."
"Israel's policy towards the Palestinians fits the UN definition of apartheid. We call on the BBC to cancel this concert," the letter concluded.
The September 1 concert was not canceled, but disturbances by audience members and protesters in the auditorium led the BBC to halt its direct broadcast of the performance.
Several demonstrators in the venue shouted as Zubin Mehta stood to conduct Bruch's Violin Concerto, while other audience members booed in response to the protest.
Britain's main weekend newspapers and prominent blogs are filled with invective against the LPO for suspending the musicians. Norman Jeras, a music critic who is a fierce opponent of the campaign to boycott Israel culturally, asked "whether a nine-month suspension from one's job for writing a letter to a newspaper isn't rather excessive."
According to The Guardian, London Philharmonic Orchestra chief executive Tim Walker and chairman Martin Hohmann released a statement regarding the suspensions, which they said were meant to send a "strong and clear message that their actions will not be tolerated." The statement said that while the orchestra would never restrict the right of its players to express themselves freely, such expression has to be independent of the LPO itself. The orchestra has no desire to "end the careers" of the musicians, the statement said. Nevertheless, it continued, "for the LPO, music and politics do not mix."

<title>Fear and no clean clothing: Amira Hass preparing to sail for Gaza </title>
<date>Sun Jun 26 02:37:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Social activist Stephan Corriveau warned all of us due to set sail on the Canadian ship dubbed the Tahrir - one of the boats participating in the upcoming Gaza flotilla - that we would have no opportunity to bathe during the three-day journey to Gaza but would have drinking water. There was no point in bringing a change of clothes, the Montreal-based Corriveau noted, because there would be nowhere to change, encouraging us to take as little as possible. In the best case scenario, we will make it to Gaza and can buy some clothing there, he said.
There are about 50 of us, men and women, due to sail on the Tahrir, whose name is a reference to the Cairo square where protests earlier this year led to the downfall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's regime. Several hundred other activists, from about 20 countries, and several dozen journalists are currently preparing to set sail for Gaza.
At several Mediterranean ports, ships await their participants for the upcoming flotilla. The vessels were acquired in a transatlantic fund-raising effort which began about a year ago, immediately after the Israeli Navy killed nine partcipants aboard a Gaza-bound flotilla ship, the Mavi Marmara, last May. The new flotilla has been organized by a coalition of organizations, all of which refuse to accept the Israeli argument that the Gaza Strip is no longer besieged and that if there is a siege, it is only because of the arms Hamas has been smuggling into the territory. The activists' participation is designed to apply popular pressure on their own governments to stop cooperating with the Israeli policy.
Canadian activists raised about $350,000 over the past year for the operation, setting up an account in the name of a group called Turtle Island Humanitarian Aid. The Canadian government has announced it does not support the flotilla, viewing it as a provocation against Israel. Other governments have had a similar reaction to the effort in response to the participation of their nationals. Only the Irish government has called on Israel to refrain from violence in response to the flotilla.
Last Thursday, the Greek port authority announced it had received a  claim contending that the the Amercian boat,  whose delegates are mostly from the U.S. but some are Israelis, was not seaworthy and the ship's departure would be delayed until the claim was investigated.  Flotilla organizers say they believe the claim to be politically motivated. Their lawyer is currently negotiating with authorities over the issue but the plan is to set sail with the rest of the flotilla.
Although the Tahrir has been generally referred to  as Canadian, it was purchased for about $500,000 with contributions that also came from Australia, Denmark and Belgium; nationals of all of these countries will be on board when it joins the flotilla. The donations came primarily from individuals and non-governmental organizations, said David Heap, a Canadian professor of linguistics and French who has a history of activism against apartheid in South Africa and on behalf of native peoples in North America.
Heap said he was not surprised by the Canadian government's opposition to the flotilla, and claimed Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper had been a founder of a think tank that supported South Africa during the apartheid regime and that opposed sanctions against the regime and the release of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela.
In advance of the departure of our ship, we - the particpants - sat in a Greek hotel, getting to know one another and rehearsing the prospect that the Israeli Navy would take control of the ships in the flotilla. In simulation drills over several hours, about 50 civilians - ranging in age from 20 to 69 - attempted to imagine themselves facing Israeli warships and M16 rifles with fighter helicopters hovering overhead, along with water cannon, tear gas and Taser stun guns. The participants also imagined verbal abuse along with physical blows, dogs, and masked commandos.
The activists concluded from the exercise that they should acknowledge their fears and learn as a group of people, mutually responsible for one anther, how to confront their fears.

<title>Full transcript of Abbas speech at UN General Assembly</title>
<date>Fri Sep 23 20:22:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Mr. President of the General Assembly of the United Nations,
Mr. Secretary-General of the United Nations,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the outset, I wish to extend my congratulations to H.E. Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of the Presidency of the Assembly for this session, and wish him all success.
I reaffirm today my sincere congratulations, on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian people, to the government and people of South Sudan for its deserved admission as a full member of the United Nations, wishing them progress and prosperity.
I also congratulate the Secretary-General, H.E. Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his election for a new term at the helm of the United Nations.  This renewal of confidence reflects the world’s appreciation for his efforts, which have strengthened the role of the United Nations.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Question Palestine is intricately linked with the United Nations via the resolutions adopted by its various organs and agencies and via the essential and lauded role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East - UNRWA - which embodies the international responsibility towards the plight of Palestine refugees, who are the victims of Al-Nakba (Catastrophe) that occurred in 1948. We aspire for and seek a greater and more effective role for the United Nations in working to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in our region that ensures the inalienable, legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people as defined by the resolutions of international legitimacy of the United Nations.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
A year ago, at this same time, distinguished leaders in this hall addressed the stalled peace efforts in our region. Everyone had high hopes for a new round of final status negotiations, which had begun in early September in Washington under the direct auspices of President Barack Obama and with participation of the Quartet, and with Egyptian and Jordanian participation, to reach a peace agreement within one year. We entered those negotiations with open hearts and attentive ears and sincere intentions, and we were ready with our documents, papers and proposals.  But the negotiations broke down just weeks after their launch.
After this, we did not give up and did not cease our efforts for initiatives and contacts.  Over the past year we did not leave a door to be knocked or channel to be tested or path to be taken and we did not ignore any formal or informal party of influence and stature to be addressed. We positively considered the various ideas and proposals and initiatives presented from many countries and parties. But all of these sincere efforts and endeavors undertaken by international parties were repeatedly wrecked by the positions of the Israeli government, which quickly dashed the hopes raised by the launch of negotiations last September.
The core issue here is that the Israeli government refuses to commit to terms of reference for the negotiations that are based on international law and United Nations resolutions, and that it frantically continues to intensify building of settlements on the territory of the State of Palestine.
Settlement activities embody the core of the policy of colonial military occupation of the land of the Palestinian people and all of the brutality of aggression and racial discrimination against our people that this policy entails.  This policy, which constitutes a breach of international humanitarian law and United Nations resolutions, is the primary cause for the failure of the peace process, the collapse of dozens of opportunities, and the burial of the great hopes that arose from the signing of the Declaration of Principles in 1993 between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel to achieve a just peace that would begin a new era for our region.
The reports of United Nations missions as well as by several Israeli institutions and civil societies convey a horrific picture about the size of the settlement campaign, which the Israeli government does not hesitate to boast about and which it continues to execute through the systematic confiscation of the Palestinian lands and the construction of thousands of new settlement units in various areas of the West Bank, particularly in East Jerusalem, and accelerated construction of the annexation Wall that is eating up large tracts of our land, dividing it into separate and isolated islands and cantons, destroying family life and communities and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of families.  The occupying Power also continues to refuse permits for our people to build in Occupied East Jerusalem, at the same time that it intensifies its decades-long campaign of demolition and confiscation of homes, displacing Palestinian owners and residents under a multi-pronged policy of ethnic cleansing aimed at pushing them away from their ancestral homeland.  In addition, orders have been issued to deport elected representatives from the city of Jerusalem.  The occupying Power also continues to undertake excavations that threaten our holy places, and its military checkpoints prevent our citizens from getting access to their mosques and churches, and it continues to besiege the Holy City with a ring of settlements imposed to separate the Holy City from the rest of the Palestinian cities.
The occupation is racing against time to redraw the borders on our land according to what it wants and to impose a fait accompli on the ground that changes the realities and that is undermining the realistic potential for the existence of the State of Palestine.
At the same time, the occupying Power continues to impose its blockade on the Gaza Strip and to target Palestinian civilians by assassinations, air strikes and artillery shelling, persisting with its war of aggression of three years ago on Gaza, which resulted in massive destruction of homes, schools, hospitals, and mosques, and the thousands of martyrs and wounded.
The occupying Power also continues its incursions in areas of the Palestinian National Authority through raids, arrests and killings at the checkpoints.  In recent years, the criminal actions of armed settler militias, who enjoy the special protection of the occupation army, has intensified with the perpetration of frequent attacks against our people, targeting their homes, schools, universities, mosques, fields, crops and trees. Despite our repeated warnings, the occupying Power has not acted to curb these attacks and we hold them fully responsible for the crimes of the settlers.
These are just a few examples of the policy of the Israeli colonial settlement occupation, and this policy is responsible for the continued failure of the successive international attempts to salvage the peace process.
This policy will destroy the chances of achieving a two-State solution upon which there is an international consensus, and here I caution aloud: This settlement policy threatens to also undermine the structure of the Palestinian National Authority and even end its existence.
In addition, we now face the imposition new conditions not previously raised, conditions that will transform the raging conflict in our inflamed region into a religious conflict and a threat to the future of a million and a half Christian and Muslim Palestinians, citizens of Israel, a matter which we reject and which is impossible for us to accept being dragged into.
All of these actions taken by Israel in our country are unilateral actions and are not based on any earlier agreements.  Indeed, what we witness is a selective application of the agreements aimed at perpetuating the occupation.  Israel reoccupied the cities of the West Bank by a unilateral action, and reestablished the civil and military occupation by a unilateral action, and it is the one that determines whether or not a Palestinian citizen has the right to reside in any part of the Palestinian Territory.  And it is confiscating our land and our water and obstructing our movement as well as the movement of goods.  And it is the one obstructing our whole destiny. All of this is unilateral.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
In 1974, our deceased leader Yasser Arafat came to this hall and assured the Members of the General Assembly of our affirmative pursuit for peace, urging the United Nations to realize the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people, stating: “Do not let the olive branch fall from my hand”.
In 1988, President Arafat again addressed the General Assembly, which convened in Geneva to hear him, where he submitted the Palestinian peace program adopted by the Palestine National Council at its session held that year in Algeria.
When we adopted this program, we were taking a painful and very difficult step for all of us, especially those, including myself, who were forced to leave their homes and their towns and villages, carrying only some of our belongings and our grief and our memories and the keys of our homes to the camps of exile and the Diaspora in the 1948 Al-Nakba, one of the worst operations of uprooting, destruction and removal of a vibrant and cohesive society that had been contributing in a pioneering and leading way in the cultural, educational and economic renaissance of the Arab Middle East.
Yet, because we believe in peace and because of our conviction in international legitimacy, and because we had the courage to make difficult decisions for our people, and in the absence of absolute justice, we decided to adopt the path of relative justice - justice that is possible and could correct part of the grave historical injustice committed against our people. Thus, we agreed to establish the State of Palestine on only 22% of the territory of historical Palestine - on all the Palestinian Territory occupied by Israel in 1967.
We, by taking that historic step, which was welcomed by the States of the world, made a major concession in order to achieve a historic compromise that would allow peace to be made in the land of peace.
In the years that followed - from the Madrid Conference and the Washington negotiations leading to the Oslo agreement, which was signed 18 years ago in the garden of the White House and was linked with the letters of mutual recognition between the PLO and Israel, we persevered and dealt positively and responsibly with all efforts aimed at the achievement of a lasting peace agreement.  Yet, as we said earlier, every initiative and every conference and every new round of negotiations and every movement was shattered on the rock of the Israeli settlement expansion project.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I confirm, on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, which will remain so until the end of the conflict in all its aspects and until the resolution of all final status issues, the following:
1. The goal of the Palestinian people is the realization of their inalienable national rights in their independent State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, on all the land of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip,  which Israel occupied in the June 1967 war, in conformity with the resolutions of international legitimacy and with the achievement of a just and agreed upon solution to the Palestine refugee issue in accordance with resolution 194, as stipulated in the Arab Peace Initiative which presented the consensus Arab vision to resolve the core the Arab-Israeli conflict and to achieve a just and comprehensive peace.  To this we adhere and this is what we are working to achieve.  Achieving this desired peace also requires the release of political prisoners and detainees in Israeli prisons without delay.
2. The PLO and the Palestinian people adhere to the renouncement of violence and rejection and condemning of terrorism in all its forms, especially State terrorism, and adhere to all agreements signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel.
3. We adhere to the option of negotiating a lasting solution to the conflict in accordance with resolutions of international legitimacy.  Here, I declare that the Palestine Liberation Organization is ready to return immediately to the negotiating table on the basis of the adopted terms of reference based on international legitimacy and a complete cessation of settlement activities.
4. Our people will continue their popular peaceful resistance to the Israeli occupation and its settlement and apartheid policies and its construction of the racist annexation Wall, and they receive support for their resistance, which is consistent with international humanitarian law and international conventions and has the support of peace activists from Israel and around the world, reflecting an impressive, inspiring and courageous example of the strength of this defenseless people, armed only with their dreams, courage, hope and slogans in the face of bullets, tanks, tear gas and bulldozers.
5. When we bring our plight and our case to this international podium, it is a confirmation of our reliance on the political and diplomatic option and is a confirmation that we do not undertake unilateral steps.  Our efforts are not aimed at isolating Israel or de-legitimizing it; rather we want to gain legitimacy for the cause of the people of Palestine. We only aim to de-legitimize the settlement activities and the occupation and apartheid and the logic of ruthless force, and we believe that all the countries of the world stand with us in this regard.
I am here to say on behalf of the Palestinian people and the Palestine Liberation Organization: We extend our hands to the Israeli government and the Israeli people for peace-making.  I say to them: Let us urgently build together a future for our children where they can enjoy freedom, security and prosperity.  Let us build the bridges of dialogue instead of checkpoints and walls of separation, and build cooperative relations based on parity and equity between two neighboring States - Palestine and Israel - instead of policies of occupation, settlement, war and eliminating the other.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Despite the unquestionable right of our people to self-determination and to the independence of our State as stipulated in international resolutions, we have accepted in the past few years to engage in what appeared to be a test of our worthiness, entitlement and eligibility. During the last two years our national authority has implemented a program to build our State institutions.  Despite the extraordinary situation and the Israeli obstacles imposed, a serious extensive project was launched that has included the implementation of plans to enhance and advance the judiciary and the apparatus for maintenance of order and security, to develop the administrative, financial, and oversight systems, to upgrade the performance of institutions, and to enhance self-reliance to reduce the need for foreign aid.  With the thankful support of Arab countries and donors from friendly countries, a number of large infrastructure projects have been implemented, focused on various aspects of service, with special attention to rural and marginalized areas.
In the midst of this massive national project, we have been strengthening what we seeking to be the features of our State: from the preservation of security for the citizen and public order; to the promotion of judicial authority and rule of law; to strengthening the role of women via legislation, laws and participation; to ensuring the protection of public freedoms and strengthening the role of civil society institutions; to institutionalizing rules and regulations for ensuring accountability and transparency in the work of our Ministries and departments; to entrenching the pillars of democracy as the basis for the Palestinian political life.
When division struck the unity of our homeland, people and institutions, we were determined to adopt dialogue for restoration of our unity.  We succeeded months ago in achieving national reconciliation and we hope that its implementation will be accelerated in the coming weeks.  The core pillar of this reconciliation was to turn to the people through legislative and presidential elections within a year, because the State we want will be a State characterized by the rule of law, democratic exercise and protection of the freedoms and equality of all citizens without any discrimination and the transfer of power through the ballot box.
The reports issued recently by the United Nations, the World Bank, the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) and the International Monetary Fund confirm and laud what has been accomplished, considering it a remarkable and unprecedented model.  The consensus conclusion by the AHLC a few days ago here described what has been accomplished as a “remarkable international success story” and confirmed the readiness of the Palestinian people and their institutions for the immediate independence of the State of Palestine.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is no longer possible to redress the issue of the blockage of the horizon of the peace talks with the same means and methods that have been repeatedly tried and proven unsuccessful over the past years.  The crisis is far too deep to be neglected, and what is more dangerous are attempts to simply circumvent it or postpone its explosion.
It is neither possible, nor practical, nor acceptable to return to conducting business as usual, as if everything is fine.  It is futile to go into negotiations without clear parameters and in the absence of credibility and a specific timetable.  Negotiations will be meaningless as long as the occupation army on the ground continues to entrench its occupation, instead of rolling it back, and continues to change the demography of our country in order to create a new basis on which to alter the borders.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a moment of truth and my people are waiting to hear the answer of the world.  Will it allow Israel to continue its occupation, the only occupation in the world?  Will it allow Israel to remain a State above the law and accountability?  Will it allow Israel to continue rejecting the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations and the International Court of Justice and the positions of the overwhelming majority of countries in the world?
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I come before you today from the Holy Land, the land of Palestine, the land of divine messages, ascension of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the birthplace of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him), to speak on behalf of the Palestinian people in the homeland and in the the Diaspora, to say, after 63 years of suffering of the ongoing Nakba: Enough. It is time for the Palestinian people to gain their freedom and independence.
The time has come to end the suffering and the plight of millions of Palestine refugees in the homeland and the Diaspora, to end their displacement and to realize their rights, some of them forced to take refuge more than once in different places of the world.
At a time when the Arab peoples affirm their quest for democracy - the Arab Spring - the time is now for the Palestinian Spring, the time for independence.
The time has come for our men, women and children to live normal lives, for them to be able to sleep without waiting for the worst that the next day will bring; for mothers to be assured that their children will return home without fear of suffering killing, arrest or humiliation; for students to be able to go to their schools and universities without checkpoints obstructing them.  The time has come for sick people to be able to reach hospitals normally, and for our farmers to be able to take care of their good land without fear of the occupation seizing the land and its water, which the wall prevents access to, or fear of the settlers, for whom settlements are being built on our land and who are uprooting and burning the olive trees that have existed for hundreds of years.  The time has come for the thousands of prisoners to be released from the prisons to return to their families and their children to become a part of building their homeland, for the freedom of which they have sacrificed.
My people desire to exercise their right to enjoy a normal life like the rest of humanity. They believe what the great poet Mahmoud Darwish said: Standing here, staying here, permanent here, eternal here, and we have one goal, one, one: to be.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We profoundly appreciate and value the positions of all States that have supported our struggle and our rights and recognized the State of Palestine following the Declaration of Independence in 1988, as well as the countries that have recently recognized the State of Palestine and those that have upgraded the level of Palestine’s representation in their capitals.  I also salute the Secretary-General, who said a few days ago that the Palestinian State should have been established years ago.
Be assured that this support for our people is more valuable to them than you can imagine, for it makes them feel that someone is listening to their narrative and that their tragedy and the horrors of Al-Nakba and the occupation, from which they have so suffered, are not being ignored.  And, it reinforces their hope that stems from the belief that justice is possible in this in this world. The loss of hope is the most ferocious enemy of peace and despair is the strongest ally of extremism.
I say: The time has come for my courageous and proud people, after decades of displacement and colonial occupation and ceaseless suffering, to live like other peoples of the earth, free in a sovereign and independent homeland.
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I would like to inform you that, before delivering this statement, I submitted, in my capacity as the President of the State of Palestine and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, to H.E. Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, an application for the admission of Palestine on the basis of the 4 June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, as a full member of the United Nations.
I call upon Mr. Secretary-General to expedite transmittal of our request to the Security Council, and I call upon the distinguished members of the Security Council to vote in favor of our full membership. I also call upon the States that did not recognized the State of Palestine as yet to do so.
Excellencies,Ladies and Gentlemen,
The support of the countries of the world for our endeavor is a victory for truth,freedom, justice, law and international legitimacy, and it provides tremendous support for the peace option and enhances the chances of success of the negotiations.
Excellencies,Ladies and Gentlemen,
Your support for the establishment of the State of Palestine and for its admission to the United Nations as a full member is the greatest contribution to peacemaking in the Holy Land.
I thank you.

<title>Gaza-bound / From Aborigine to Palestinian rights </title>
<date>Wed Jun 29 02:59:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
GREECE - This is not the first time that Sylvia Hale, 69, has been asked why she is so active for the Palestinian cause. What about the discrimination against the Aborigines in her own country, Australia, for example?
Hale, a former Green Party parliamentarian who is still active in the party, immediately responded: "Undoubtedly, Australia has a very racist history. Aborigines were give the right to vote only in 1967. But whoever asks us 'what about the Aborigines,' are not the ones who are interested in their rights, and not the ones fighting for those rights. They are using this as a diversionary tactic for evading the debate over Israel's policy, or to delegitimize criticism of Israel."
And yes, for anyone who is interested: She was and remains involved in other struggles. She has rallied against the initiative to limit the rights of the Aborigines, fought the discriminatory attitude toward refugees in Australia and opposed the policy of stopping boat refugees.
Prior to entering parliament, she hid two refugees in her home so that they would not be arrested.
This week Hale and three of her compatriots will climb on board the Tahrir, the Canadian ship that is participating in the flotilla to the Gaza Strip. She and her Australian colleagues traveled the greatest distance of all the participants. Their flight lasted 48 hours, including the stops in various airports.
Hale and her friend, Vivienne Porzsolt, also 69, give the impression of being typical Western tourists, middle class, middle aged, staying at the hotel where the passengers of the Tahrir have gathered.
In Greece there is a general strike, demonstrations and tear gas in Athens, but the tourists are oblivious: They walk around and catch the rays. Perhaps the tourists wonder who these people are, as they go from one meeting to another, from the dining room to the lobby, and then to the corner where the Internet is available. These tourists have not caught any sunshine during the past five days.
Porzsolt has also been involved in social struggles in New Zealand, where she was born, and in Australia, where she now lives. In her CV of activism she includes protesting against the war in Vietnam, and apartheid in South Africa, and involvement in the feminist movement.
Activism against Israel's occupation is a given for Porzsolt, as it is for Hale. From this point of view they are characteristic of most of the voyagers on the Tahrir, and especially those aged 40 and up. Social and political activists for many years, for whom this sort of activity is as natural as going to work or establishing a family. For the two of them, activism for Palestinian rights is part of a general outlook they hold as Western citizens, with the privileges that this gives them.
But Porzsolt's involvement also stems directly from being Jewish, she says. "My activism against the Israeli occupation is linked to my Jewish-secular background, the values of equality and morality in the home of my parents [who were] natives of Prague who managed to escape from it immediately following the Nazi occupation in March, 1939. During the 1990s the Jewish element in my life became stronger and I became more interested in the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Because Israel considers itself the country that represents all the Jews of the world, my participation in this voyage is my way of declaring that Israel is not acting on my behalf."
"There are situations a person cannot avoid being aware of and cannot pretend they do not exist. And this is the case of the situation in Gaza," Hale says.
She visited the Gaza Strip with a delegation of Australian unions. The pictures of the children at the hospital at Khan Yunis, full of bombings and tanks, continue to haunt her and remind her of her granddaughter.
"We went to see the tunnels and the airport. It had already been completely destroyed. I saw people with carts with donkeys, going through the rubble to find construction materials. The next day I read that the army had fired into that area. What is especially shocking in this situation is that lack of proportionality in the means Israel is utilizing, and the collective punishment that it regularly applies."
Porzsolt visited the Gaza Strip more than a decade ago. She visited Israel and the West Bank several times, and participated in demonstrations at Sheikh Jarrah  (in East Jerusalem )and Bili'in  (in the West Bank ). "In my visit to Israel I discovered that the Israeli and Palestinian movements against the occupation are weak and need outside support,' she said.
What troubled her most is the extreme situation in Gaza, "an enormous prison under the sky. The strong sense that there is something wrong in every sense of the word."
During the past year they worked to raise $50,000 for the purchase of Tahrir and to fund the flotilla. The fund raising in Australia was a good way to raise awareness of the blockade on Gaza, they say.
But they are not deluding themselves about the speed with which changes occur. The struggle against "White Australia," the policy which limited the immigration of non-Whites to the continent, and which lasted some 70 years before being canceled in 1973.

<title>Gaza flotilla activists: Queers welcome aboard aid ships </title>
<date>Thu Jun 30 15:59:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
John Greyson, a Canadian film director and Gaza flotilla activist told Haaretz in an interview that homosexuality is not a barrier to participating in the upcoming voyage, and in fact he and other flotilla participants have created an “unofficial queer caucus” on board the ship.
Greyson’s remarks come in light of a recent YouTube video in which a man related to viewers that Gaza flotilla organizers told him that he could not take part in the mission because he is a homosexual.
The video, nearly three minutes long, featured a young man who called himself Marc and claimed to be a gay and human rights activist. The man recounted a story in which he asked the organizers of the upcoming Gaza flotilla to join their mission, and claimed that his request was allegedly denied on the grounds that participation of the gay and lesbian group with which he was affiliated would not serve the flotilla’s “interests”.
Greyson, a 51-year-old Canadian who is gay and has directed many films about queer life, said he was shocked when he heard about the video. “At first I laughed, then I got mad, and then laughed again,” Greyson told Haaretz on board the “Tahrir” ship on Tuesday.
The Canadian director related how not only is he part of what he calls an “unofficial queer caucus” aboard the Tahrir, but every boat participating in the upcoming flotilla has queers.“This is common sense and human nature,” Greyson said, adding “who knows, maybe when we get back there will be more queers.”
“One of the hats that I wear on this boat is 'queers against Israeli apartheid,'" the Canadian director said. He continued, saying that they have also work with Palestinian homosexuals who have not yet come out entirely.
When asked about the possible validity of the YouTube video, which reports have revealed to be linked to the Prime Minister’s office, a report that it has neither confirmed nor denied, Greyson told Haaretz that it “is another ridiculously transparent attempt to vilify the flotilla.”
Greyson, teaches film at York University in Toronto. In 2009 he canceled a screening of his documentary “Covered” at the Toronto International Film Festival as a protest against the screening of a series of movies about Tel Aviv marking the city’s centennial.

<title>Goldstone: Israel is not an 'apartheid state'</title>
<date>Tue Nov 01 13:04:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Judge Richard Goldstone, who led the UN investigative commission into Israel and Hamas’ conduct during Israel’s Operation Cast Lead, defended Israel against charges of being an “apartheid state” in a New York Times op-ed published Tuesday.
Goldstone, who was harshly criticized for his scathing report which determined that Israel and Hamas committed war crimes during the 2008 operation, states that the apartheid designation is used to describe the situation of pre-1994 South Africa, in which blacks could not vote, hold political office, use “white” toilets or beaches, marry whites, live in whites-only areas or even be there without a “pass.” Applying such the term to Israel is “unfair and inaccurate slander”, and is used to “retard rather than advance peace negotiations.”
The piece also states that nothing in Israel “comes close to the definition of apartheid” according to the 1998 Rome Statute, which defines apartheid as “Inhumane acts ... committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime.” According to Goldstone, Israeli Arabs have the right to vote, have representation in the Knesset, and are subject to equal treatment in hospitals.
Goldstone also stated that the situation of Palestinians in the West Bank is “more complex”, yet rejected the claim that the separation barrier was built to “stop unrelenting terrorist attacks” rather than with an intention to discriminate, and that road blocks in the West Bank “get more intrusive after violent attacks and are ameliorated when the threat is reduced.”

<title>Goldstone rebuffs claims of 'Israeli apartheid' </title>
<date>Wed Nov 02 00:51:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Accusations that Israel is an apartheid state are false, malicious and do not promote peace, in the view of Richard Goldstone, a retired South African and international judge and author of a report into Israel's 2008-09 operation in the Gaza Strip.
"While 'apartheid' can have broader meaning, its use is meant to evoke the situation in pre-1994 South Africa. It is an unfair and inaccurate slander against Israel, calculated to retard rather than advance peace negotiations," Goldstone wrote in an opinion piece published in Tuesday's New York Times.
Goldstone, who served as a judge in apartheid-era South Africa and whose fact-finding report on the Gaza fighting accused Israel and Hamas of committing war crimes, wrote that although there was de-facto separation between Jews and Arabs in Israel, "it is not apartheid, which consciously enshrines separation as an ideal."
He said that while the situation in the occupied West Bank was "more complex," there was "no intent to maintain an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group."

<title>'Goldstone retraction affected by misuse of Gaza report findings'</title>
<date>Wed Apr 20 04:42:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
	A New York Times article Tuesday claimed Richard Goldstone's apparent retraction of at least some of the war crime allegations leveled against Israel came as a result of his realization that his Gaza war report was used not to advance peace but to attack Israel on the international stage.
	Speaking with several of the South African former jurist's friends, and citing some of his recent remarks, the article contends that the Washington Post op-ed, in which Goldstone said claims that Israel intentionally targeted civilians during Operation Cast Lead should be reconsidered, was the result of an ongoing process.
	Maurice Ostroff, a retired South African engineer and resident of Israel, told the New York times Goldstone was "upset by the misuse of those who accused Israel of being an apartheid state,” adding that "mostly, as new information came out, he shifted his thinking.”
	The new information Ostroff may have referred to was the product of several internal Israel Defense Forces investigations that came in the wake of both the Gaza war and the Goldstone report, information which led the former South African jurist to reconsider some of the war-crime claims he had leveled against Israel.
	Writing in the Washington Post article published earlier this month, Goldstone wrote: "We know a lot more today about what happened in the Gaza war of 2008-09 than we did when I chaired the fact-finding mission appointed by the UN Human Rights Council that produced what has come to be known as the Goldstone Report."
	He then continued, saying "if I had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report would have been a different document."
	Goldstone was also reportedly affected by both Israel's scathing response to the report, as well as the fact that the report's findings that were used by anti-Israel groups worldwide, the New York Times articles said.
	Speaking with the New York Times, Aryeh Neier, president of the Open Society Foundation and a long-time acquaintance of Goldstone, said the South African jurist was "extremely hurt by the reaction to the report."
	"I think he was extremely uncomfortable in providing some fodder to people who were looking for anything they could use against Israel," he added.
	The article also claimed that at least part of Goldstone's reconsideration of his Gaza war report was the result of his original intentions, which were, according to those who know him, not to damn Israel but to allow it an opportunity to explain itself on the international stage, and perhaps even work toward reconciliation in the region.
	However, that intention did not translate into the outcome Goldstone anticipated, the article stated, seen by both Israel's shunning of the report and the fact-finding mission who authored it, leading to the report's lopsided findings.

<title>Hamas distances itself from Palestinian statehood bid at UN</title>
<date>Mon Sep 12 19:39:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
The Palestinian Authority's push to achieve recognition of an independent Palestinian state in the United Nations has nothing to do with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, Hamas officials said on Monday, adding that the campaign was launched without consulting Hamas leaders.
Speaking to the Palestinian Ma'an news agency on Monday, the leaders of several Palestinian factions voiced differing opinions on the Palestinian statehood bid at the UN, with both Hamas and Islamic Jihad representatives distancing themselves from the planned vote.
Hamas Gaza strongman Mahmoud Zahar told the Palestinian news agency that the UN push did not represent the Hamas-ruled Strip, saying that no one "asked the people in Gaza to take to the streets showing solidarity with the so-called September bid."
"If the Palestinian Authority calls for that, we will oppose it because they detain people in the West Bank. How can I give them the right to demonstrate in Gaza, while they do not give us that right in the West Bank?" Zahar asked.
Another Hamas official, Mushir al-Masri, called the bid that an "individual step taken by [Palestinian] President [Mahmoud] Abbas without consulting any faction."
Last month, senior Fatah officials claimed that Abbas had chosen to cool off his recently signed unity deal with Hamas, citing Western opposition to the surprise turn in the factions' long-standing feud.
"President Abbas was surprised by the international opposition to the reconciliation with Hamas, so he decided to slow down at least until September," the Palestinian official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss official policy.
"Now, with all efforts focused on September, we want all voices to be with us," he said. "We are not giving the Americans or anyone else a reason to shun us because of the reconciliation or anything else."
The unity deal was struck in May after Palestinian youth, inspired by the revolts against entrenched Arab autocracies, took to the streets calling for unification of the dueling governments in the West Bank and Gaza.
Another dissenting voice to the PA's campaign speaking with Ma'an on Monday came from Islamic Jihad spokesman Dawood Shihab, who said the "move needs to be studied to make sure it will not ignore major issues such as the right of return, and the future of the Palestine Liberation Organization as a umbrella for the whole Palestinian people."
However, other Palestinian factions, such as The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and The Palestinian National Initiative, supported the PA-led move, saying it was the last chance for Palestinians to reach statehood with the failure of peace talks with Israel.
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine has announced its support for the UN campaign.
"We support the Palestinian leadership's plan to go to the UN because that is a natural right of the Palestinians and part of the political battle against Israeli occupation," Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine strongman Kayid al-Ghoul told Ma'an.
Al-Ghoul also said that he felt the UN statehood bid would mark the end of peace talks with Israel, instead urging the formation of an international Mideast peace process conference.
"Regardless of the outcome, this step should be part of the political battle we fight against occupation. It will also be an opportunity to enlarge the circle of solidarity with the Palestinian people's rights, and to expose Israel's policies and the supportive US policy,” al-Ghoul told Ma'an.
Mustafa Barghouti, leader of The Palestinian National Initiative called the UN push "the last option for two states," adding that the"time has come for an alternative. There is no space or place for talks."
"We won't be slaves to apartheid for the rest of our lives," Barghouti added, saying,  "If South Sudan could get statehood in 48 hours, then Palestinians should get it."

<title>Helen Thomas to address anti-Israel protests during Netanyahu's visit to U.S.</title>
<date>Sun Apr 17 00:50:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
WASHINGTON - A series of protests against Israeli policy and its support by AIPAC are planned in May to coincide with the AIPAC conference in the U.S. capital and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech there. The protests, under the heading "Move over AIPAC," will include demonstrations opposite the building where Netanyahu will speak and Congress, and a series of lectures and meetings with critics of Israel, including veteran journalist Helen Thomas who lost her place in the White House press room after saying Jews should leave Palestine and go back to Poland, Germany and the United States. Thomas will give the keynote address at the Move Over AIPAC conference, and will receive an award from the women's pacifist organization Code Pink, one of the hundred left-wing American organizations behind the conference.
On Friday night, a favorite cafe among progressives, Busboys and Poets, gathered letters to Gazans; the next aid flotilla in May will deliver the messages to the Gaza residents. A separate room in the cafe hosted a meeting of around 250 activists with Omar Barghouti, founder of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign. Barghouti, who recently released a book on BDS, was winding up a book tour that included Columbia, Harvard, Brandeis and other universities.
The evening began with a moment of silence for actor Juliano Mer-Khamis, murdered earlier this month in Jenin, and Italian journalist Vittorio Arrigoni, murdered in recent days in Gaza. Barghouti then quoted U.S. President Barack Obama's justification for the NATO attacks on Muammar Gadhafi's forces in Libya.
"Innocent people were targeted for killing. Hospitals and ambulances were attacked. Supplies of food and fuel were choked off. Water for hundreds of thousands of people was shut off. Cities and towns were shelled, mosques were destroyed and apartment buildings reduced to rubble," Barghouti said, reading out a statement.
"This is about Libya, but you would say the same logic should be applied to Gaza. Unfortunately, it is not. Revolutions are shaking the Middle East, and one big loser is Israel. As Arab governments become more democratic they will reflect peoples' opinions, which are very much opposed to the Israeli apartheid."
"Some people say BDS is not fair and not effective - Israel is a democracy. On almost every level, Israel is only a democracy for one ethnic group. The Palestinian-led BDS movement is calling Israel an apartheid state, and the main refutation of this is that Israel allows Palestinians to vote," Barghouti said.
"Apartheid is not defined according to whims of this or that scholar. Apartheid is when the discrimination is legalized. Now there are commissions to accept new residents into communities. Imagine an Irish white guy saying: 'We don't accept this Latino guy, his food smells funny, he doesn't fit.' But in Israel now it's legal."
"I think calling Israel a fascist state is an exaggeration, but there are fascist tendencies. When they get mad, Liberal Zionists tend to exaggerate," he added. "Israel is losing the battle for hearts and minds at the grassroots level. It maintains connections with the elite, but competes with Iran and North Korea as the most hated countries in the world."
Barghouti said it was impossible to predict what the Israelis would do in response to the next flotilla, saying they continue to shoot themselves in the foot, but highlighting Israel's reactions only helps raise awareness of the siege on Gaza. After the event, Barghouti recommended everyone, including Zionists, to read his book, but declined to be interviewed by Haaretz. "We're being very careful about giving interviews to the Israeli media," he said.

<title>Hollywood stars visit Israel and PA to learn about Mideast conflict</title>
<date>Thu Nov 17 01:25:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Two delegations from Hollywood are visiting Israel to learn about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one comprised of actors and another mainly featuring directors.
Today, both groups will meet with President Shimon Peres. The actors' delegation is also slated to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the coming days, after having met with Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad on Tuesday.
Both groups are here as guests of the Jewish Federation's Tel Aviv/Los Angeles Partnership, The Creative Coalition and the AIPAC-affiliated American Israel Education Foundation.
The actors' delegation, headed by Tim Daley, has 21 members, including Emmy award winner Joe Pantoliano  ("The Sopranos" ), Andrea Bowen  ("Desperate Housewives" ), Steven Weber  ("Brothers and Sisters" ) and Giancarlo Esposito  ("Once Upon a Time" ). The directors' delegation also includes scriptwriters and senior studio executives, inter alia, Marta Kauffman, one of the creators of "Friends," and Nina Tassler, who heads the CBS television network's entertainment division.
Last night, the actors held a press conference at the Dan Hotel in Tel Aviv in which they detailed their itinerary, which includes visits to Sderot and Ramallah, a tour of the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum and a visit to an absorption center for Ethiopian immigrants. Actress Patricia Arquette  ("Medium" ) said the goal of the trip was to learn about the "nuances" of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Actor Richard Schiff  ("The West Wing" ) added that when they return to the United States, they plan to share what they have learned with their friends and others.
Actor Rob Morrow  ("Northern Exposure" ) related that Fayyad had spoken of peace and reconciliation with Israel, but shortly after they left the meeting, they heard that Fatah and Hamas had agreed to form a unity government. That, he said, made them realize how fluid the situation here is.
Delegation members also said they were surprised to see how short a distance separates Jerusalem and Ramallah and likewise Sderot and the Gaza Strip.
CCH Pounder  ("Avatar" ) was the only member of the group who said she encountered opposition to her visit here - in her case, from South African friends. Schiff, for his part, was upset upon leaving the hotel to encounter a small group of demonstrators holding signs telling the actors they should be ashamed of themselves and denouncing Israel's "apartheid" policies.

<title>Israel can no longer pretend there's no Mideast conflict</title>
<date>Sun Mar 13 02:11:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
The murder of the Fogel family brought to an end the lull Israel has enjoyed over the past two years. Palestinian terrorism struck again, in the most sensitive spot of the West Bank: the mother of all isolated settlements, on a ridge over Nablus, its radical inhabitants infamous for their violent relations with their Palestinian neighbors. No spot is more emblematic of the conflict and friction in the territories than Itamar.
Whoever planned and carried out the attack sought to shake up the status quo, which has been working for Israel. The quiet allowed Israelis on both sides of the Green Line to live prosperously and pretend there simply was no conflict. The Palestinians and the settlers were perceived by Israelis as public-relations issues, nuisances in the relations with the United States and Europe, not key problems that needed to be taken care of. All this has changed.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  on Saturday tried using the murders as leverage to ease international  pressure on Israel. He accused the Palestinian Authority of incitement and the international community of hypocrisy, but his comments got nearly zero attention in a world consumed by the tsunami in Japan, the civil war in Libya and the skyrocketing oil prices.
Netanyahu seeks to isolate the attack and prevent it from igniting a third intifada, but his mission looks impossible. He is facing strong forces striving toward conflict. In many countries in the West, activists are holding Israel Apartheid Week, while calls are spreading on Facebook for mass protests in the territories and in front of Israeli embassies across the world this Tuesday. The organizers are trying to imitate the uprisings in the Arab world in recent months, and if they succeed, they are likely to encounter a much stronger Israeli response than they expect.
An attack on a settlement, especially Itamar, always invokes the fear of revenge attacks by settlers against Palestinians. The Israel Defense Forces would need to redouble its efforts to keep these sides apart.
But settlers and their supporters in government also have political goals. They will try to use the murders to minimize the stature of Defense Minister Ehud Barak, to force Netanyahu to renew construction in the bigger settlements, and to prevent the planned evacuation of illegal outposts. A degree of restraint by the settlers and the forgoing of blatant "price tag" attacks would help the government back their demands. Netanyahu has asked them to come down, but such requests come at a price.
The security coordination between Israel and the PA, which contributed much to the relative calm of recent years, is now in a crisis. Netanyahu accused the PA of incitement to the murder, while Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas refrained from condemning the attack as strongly as Netanyahu wanted him to.
In an atmosphere of mistrust and accusations at the top, the forces in the field will find it hard to trust each other. All these forces are pushing for a return to the violent conflict in the territories, with the international community busy elsewhere and indisposed to calm the situation down.

<title>Israel given one week to reply to petition against segregation at ultra-Orthodox schools</title>
<date>Fri Dec 09 01:40:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
The High Court of Justice Thursday instructed Education Minister Gideon Sa'ar, the Education Ministry and mayors of Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, Modi'in Ilit and Betar Ilit to reply in a week to a petition demanding an end to quotas restricting Sephardi girls' admission to state-funded ultra-Orthodox girls high schools.
The petitioners, Noar Kahalacha organization and social activist Yoav Laloum, sought to stop the "apartheid-like" ethnic segregation at ultra-Orthodox girls high schools. They also asked the court to issue an interim injunction forbidding the schools to start registration for the next school year until the court hears the petition.
The petitioners, who headed the fight against ethnic segregation at the Beit Yaakov school in the West Bank settlement Immanuel in 2008, are also demanding to revoke the licenses and state funding of all the schools that discriminate against Sephardi girls.
Justice Edna Arbel said in her ruling yesterday the court will hear the petition soon.
MK Chaim Amsellem  (Shas ) commended the petition. "The Education Ministry is collaborating with the schools' principals and Haredi parties to silence the problem and perpetuate the discrimination. Shas, which was formed to uproot this problem, does nothing...its leaders are afraid their children will be taken out of the Ashkenazi schools," he said.
Shas chairman MK Eli Yishai said "Shas acted and is acting to establish more high schools and other schools. Only this week the Knesset held a debate we initiated on a proposal to prevent discrimination in schools."
"The main problem is not the state funding but the moral turpitude this discriminative policy brands our society with," said prominent educator and public figure Rabbi Shai Piron, Director-General of Hakol Hinuch, the Movement for the Advancement of Education in Israel.

<title>Israeli students fly to South Africa to improve their country's image </title>
<date>Tue Jul 12 02:34:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
One of Israel's most serious image problems is how it is perceived on campuses around the world. Now, a group of 27 Israeli students are planning to tackle the issue head-on, funding their own trips to South African universities.
As part of the project, 150 students will be sent abroad in five delegations over the next six months.
The students receive no governmental aid, and are paying for the trip on their own and through contributions. As part of their fund-raising efforts, they will be holding a party in Tel Aviv next week.
On the first trip, scheduled to depart August 11, the participants will spend 10 days visiting universities in Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town and try to convince students there that Israel is not an apartheid state.
Pro-Palestinian activities are held almost daily on these campuses. The University of Johannesburg, a major focus of the trip, launched an academic boycott of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev a few months ago.
The trips are a private initiative by the students, said Roy Wolff, one of the organizers of the group, called What Is REAL. "We all agreed that we were willing to spend $1,000 each, the cost of travel, and hoped we could raise money to cover expenses."
Why take part in such a delegation?
"I can stay home and cry about Israel's lack of [positive] publicity, or I can get out of my chair, take my money and do something. If within six months we manage to send 150 people on five delegations, we can influence 5,000 students. In two months we have trained 27 students for the educational missions. There is no doubt that this is just a drop in the ocean. However, we could manage to influence a student who goes on to become Britain's prime minister."
The participants do not share an ideology. Its members include Wolff, a parliamentary aide to MK Arieh Eldad  (National Union ); and Lior Finkel, aide to MK Ilan Gilon  (Meretz ).
"We all agree that Israel is a Jewish and democratic state, and we all agree that Israel is not an apartheid state. This is what we want to show the students on campus," Wolff said.
Finkel said, "To me, [the trip] will be a success if I can sit with people and explain Israel's side, and if they are willing to listen to me. The delegation will create the most basic kind of human interaction: I meet people my age, who are exactly like me, and who don't always feel like hearing about Israel."
How important are the group's activities?
"Most people on campus don't really care," Wolff says. "But the fact that they hear slogans about Israel being an apartheid state every day means that this is the only thing they know about Israel. We have to create some doubt in their minds."
Talia Dekel, another group member, explains that the organizers prefer not to take government money so that they cannot be cast as official representatives.

<title>Israel Prize laureates join academic boycott of settlement university</title>
<date>Sun Jan 09 00:38:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Some 155 university and college faculty members have signed a petition calling for an academic boycott of the Ariel University Center.
In the petition, the lecturers state their "unwillingness to take part in any type of academic activity taking place in the college operating in the settlement of Ariel." Furthermore, the petition states that "Ariel is not part of the sovereign state of Israel, and therefore it is impossible to require us to appear there."
Among the signatories are three Israel Prize laureates - professors Yehoshua Kolodny of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Benjamin Isaac of Tel Aviv University and Itamar Procaccia of the Weizmann Institute of Science.
"We, academics from a variety of fields and from all the institutions of higher learning in Israel, herein express publicly our opposition to the continued occupation and the establishment of settlements," the petition states. "Ariel was built on occupied land. Only a few kilometers away from flourishing Ariel, Palestinians live in villages and refugee camps under unbearably harsh conditions and without basic human rights. Not only do they not have access to higher education, some do not even have running water. These are two different realities that create a policy of apartheid," the petition also says.
The signatories state that Ariel was an illegal settlement whose existence contravened international law and the Geneva Convention. "It was established for the sole purpose of preventing the Palestinians from creating an independent state and thus preventing us, citizens of Israel, from having the chance to ever live in peace in this region."
The petition was initiated and organized by Nir Gov of the Weizmann Institute's Department of Chemical Physics. Unlike other such initiatives, over a third of the list's signatories are from the natural and exact sciences.
Gov, who started organizing the petition a few weeks ago, said it was important to show that not only people known from other petitions support a boycott of Ariel, and therefore this petition has among its signatories many scholars who are not from the social sciences and the humanities.
"Israeli academia must differentiate itself from the 'settlement' academia," said Gov. "Only significant differentiation can help our supporters abroad who are working against an academic boycott of Israel. This assistance is important, but all in all it is secondary to the principled stand that the goal of the establishment of the college at Ariel was not teaching and academic research, but political. It may be too late, but we felt a need to state in the clearest language that Israeli academia must not be involved in the settlement project," Gov also said.
Gov said he encountered some colleagues who agreed with the message of the petition but were afraid to sign. He said such fear, "in the current atmosphere, is understandable, tangible. Even if there is no official action against the signatories, we may pay some sort of price."
About three weeks ago, the Council For Higher Education issued a public statement against calls by Israeli academics for an academic boycott of Israel. The council, which is headed by Education Minister Gideon Sa'ar, said such calls "undermine the foundations of the higher education system."
However, Gov said there is no contradiction between the council's statement and the petition. "The council says rightly that there is a danger of delegitimization of the academic system in Israel. We say the source of this danger is Ariel and the settlements."
Yigal Cohen-Orgad, chairman of the Ariel college's executive committee, said: "A tiny and bizarre minority of some 150 lecturers is behind the petition, out of 7,000 faculty members. The cooperation between the Ariel University Center and many hundreds of scholars from universities in Israel and many hundreds more from 40 universities abroad, is the response to this petition. We know the heads of the universities oppose the call for a boycott and all it entails. I am sure that academia will continue to cooperate with us."

<title>Israel UN envoy slams Falk over accusation of 'ethnic cleansing' </title>
<date>Mon Mar 21 22:46:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Israel's United Nations Envoy Aharon Leshno Yaar called Richard Falk an "embarrassment to the United Nations," after the academic charged Israel with ethnic cleansing on Monday.
Falk, who is also an investigator for the UN, said earlier in the day that Israel's expansion of settlements in East Jerusalem and eviction of Palestinians from their homes is a form of ethnic cleansing.
Speaking to Haaretz, Leshno Yaar said Falk is the man who "claims that it is unclear who stands behind the terror attacks of 9/11 and calls IDF soldiers Nazis."
Falk has been admonished in the past by UN Secretary General Ben Ki-moon for comments that he made about the 9/11 terror attacks.
"Israel doesn’t participate with Falk," Leshno Yaar said, adding that he leaves the room when he speaks.
Falk made the comments while speaking to the UN Human Rights Council as it prepared to pass resolutions condemning settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
The "continued pattern of settlement expansion in East Jerusalem combined with the forcible eviction of long-residing Palestinians are creating an intolerable situation" in the part of the city previously controlled by Jordan, he said.
This situation "can only be described in its cumulative impact as a form of ethnic cleansing," Falk declared.
In his speech, Falk said he would like the Human Rights Council to ask the International Court of Justice to look at Israeli behavior in the occupied territories.
This should focus on whether the prolonged occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem had elements of "colonialism, apartheid and ethnic cleansing inconsistent with international humanitarian law," the investigator declared.

<title>Jerusalem & Babylon / The new ally from within</title>
<date>Fri May 13 01:45:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Israel’s new ambassador to the United Kingdom − should Avigdor Lieberman ever get round to appointing one − will face an interesting dilemma after settling down in Thackeray’s old study in the elegant house on Palace Green. What is to be done about Yachad? It’s the British “Pro Israel, Pro Peace” organization that was officially launched yesterday.
It can be described as the British version of J Street, three-year-old American political lobby operating under the double-pro banner; J Street calls on both the American administration and the Israeli government to act more decisively for a two-state solution and encourages American Jews not to instinctively support the right-wing policies of the Israeli government.
And thus incurs the wrath of much of the local Jewish establishment.
The embassy in Washington, anxious not to seem out of step with the Jewish leadership, especially as J Street was almost immediately perceived as a rival to AIPAC, described some of J Street’s actions as “worrying,” and Ambassador Michael Oren snubbed an invite to its first national conference. In December 2009, he tried to ostracize J Street further, describing it as “a unique problem in that it not only opposes one policy of one Israeli government, it opposes all policies of all Israeli governments. It’s significantly out of the mainstream.”
Eventually, Oren had no choice but to meet with J Street’s leaders and agree on “ground rules” for engagement between the organization and Israel’s government. He had no choice. J Street quickly gained influential backers, thousands of supporters among the rank and file of Jewish America and − perhaps more significantly − was endorsed by the Obama White House, which made a point of inviting J Street to briefings of Jewish leaders.
Will Ron Prossor’s successor in London draw lessons from Oren’s embarrassing retreat and not pick a fight? It depends somewhat on the new ambassador’s political masters in Jerusalem. Lieberman and his deputy, Danny Ayalon, will certainly not warm to Yachad’s message, but I doubt either of them cares much about what Britain’s Jews have to say, so it will probably be the ambassador’s call.
Yachad at its launch made one significant decision that will make it more palatable to official Israel. Unlike J Street, it will concern itself mainly with working within the Jewish community, and not act as a political lobby in parliament and government circles. The new movement will try and educate British Jews on the reality of Israel and the region and serve as an outlet for those who hold its views and have not find a voice in existing organizations. Will this be enough to evade the inevitable “fifth columnist” slurs that will be hurled from the right wing?
Yachad’s backers take comfort in last year’s survey by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research that found that 78 percent of British Jews are in favor of achieving peace through a two-state solution; 74 percent are against expanding the settlements in the West Bank; and 67 percent are in favor of trading land for peace. If that’s not enough, 52 percent are apparently for negotiating with Hamas; in terms of Israel’s political spectrum that puts them to the left of Meretz. When the survey came out, I had reservations on its methodology and I still do, but the survey lends credence to Yachad’s claim that it represents the mainstream.
However, even if its views represent the majority, it is a largely silent one. The more voluble Jewish voices still tend to adhere to the policies of the Israeli government of the day, and those who do express critical views are often died-in-the-wool activists or card-carrying pro-Palestinian people who, for most of the community, are beyond the pale.
I think it’s safe to predict that Yachad’s launch and acceptance into the Jewish landscape in Britain will be relatively smooth, without much of the strife that accompanied J Street’s trajectory. It obviously has a place, and the communal discourse there tends to be more polite than in America. Will it achieve anything?
If the IJPR survey is to be trusted, most British Jews already hold Yachad’s views, and those who don’t are firmly entrenched on either the far right or the far left. By articulating that position, Yachad may help to engage a young generation who feels estranged from the Jewish establishment. That is one of the movement’s main aims and is certainly a worthy cause. What wider effect can Yachad have? For now, Yachad is not trying to influence British foreign policy; after all, successive Labor and Tory governments have firmly supported the two-state solution. Could it influence the Israeli public? Slim chance.
As I have often observed in this column, Israelis don’t care much about what their brothers overseas have to say, especially not criticism. Six months ago, one of the most senior British Jewish leaders, Mick Davis, chairman of both the UJIA and the Jewish Leadership Council, caused an uproar in London when he said at a public gathering that if Israel continues with its current policies, it risks becoming a “de facto apartheid state.” It did not cause even a stir in Israel. The Hebrew-language press barely reported his words on its back pages, no senior politician or significant columnist thought they warranted mention. The only responses I received from various spokespeople asked: “Mick who?”
British Jews hate to face the facts; they are a second-league community. Not only the United States, but France, Canada and Russia all outrank Britain in terms of Jewish world influence. This diminished standing reflects the community’s shrinking size, but mainly Britain’s increasingly puny stature on the global stage. Britain is still a world-power in only one sphere, the media. British news networks − the BBC, Sky − and The Economist, The Guardian and the Times not only compete as equals with their American counterparts, but they take an inordinate interest in Israel and its conflicts, often leading international coverage. Here is the real minefield for Yachad. Hannah Weisfeld, Yachad’s director, and until fund-raising picks up, its sole employee, tells me that she believes the public “can absorb a more nuanced take on Israel.”
Well, maybe British Jews can, but how will she fare once the news programs begin calling?
Weisfeld and anyone else speaking under Yachad’s banner on the BBC will come under the community’s microscope and have to perform an impossible tight-rope act between self-hating Jew and “shill for Israel.” There will be many waiting for her to fall.

<title>Jordan FM: Refusal of two-state vision exposes Israel as 'apartheid' state </title>
<date>Wed Jan 12 19:25:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
	Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh said Wednesday that Israel's refusal of the two-state solution would expose it to the world as an "apartheid" country.
	"His Majesty the king (Abdullah II) has made it clear that if we fail to achieve the two-state solution, then the alternative will be that the world will have eventually to view Israel as a state that practices racial policies," Judeh said.
	The foreign minister was testifying before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the upper house of parliament on the latest developments of the deadlocked direct peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel, the official Petra news agency said.
	Judeh said that the recent recognition of the Palestinian state by Latin American countries "will put pressure on Israel and remind it that the world will not accept its unilateral actions" in Jerusalem and the West Bank.
	He expected "more states" to follow in the steps of Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay and Paraguay in recognizing a Palestinian state.
	Judeh warned that the failure to come up with a solution for the Palestine question in accordance with the Arab peace initiative "will have dire consequences in terms of escalating tension and instability."
	The Arab peace initiative offers Israel full recognition by all Arab states if it pulls out from all Arab territories it occupied during the Six-Day War in 1967, including East Jerusalem.

<title>Judge Goldstone defends role, but feels distressed </title>
<date>Mon Apr 04 00:42:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Judge Richard Goldstone told associates several months ago that ever since publication of his report on Operation Cast Lead in Gaza, he has been in great distress and under duress.
He complained that close friends kept away from him and some family members even had reservations about his cooperation with the UN Human Rights Council.
Last year, a Johannesburg synagogue initially said it would not allow him to take part in his grandson's bar mitzvah.
Goldstone told Haaretz's Akiva Eldar at the time that the bar mitzvah was an event of joy "after much aggravation," and added that he was very upset by the witch hunt and accusations against him. He was particularly offended by a Yedioth Ahronoth article about verdicts he handed down to black defendants during the apartheid era in his native South Africa.
He said at the time that despite the attacks on him in Jewish communities, he does not regret agreeing to chair the investigative committee.
"I felt that because I was Jewish, it would be hypocritical not to get involved in the Middle East," he told Eldar, explaining that he was a Zionist, but did not intend to visit Israel any time soon, for reasons of personal security. He also said he was saddened by what he saw as recent attacks on Israel's democracy, including bills banning criticism of the Israel Defense Forces.
Goldstone observed that Israel has trouble taking criticism, but said he still hopes the government will conduct an open inquiry of the events in Gaza, adding that the country has distinguished justices and reputable lawyers who can lead such an effort and put an end to the affair.

<title>Live blog: Glenn Beck's 'Restoring Courage' rally in East Jerusalem</title>
<date>Wed Aug 24 16:46:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
15:45: Welcome to the live blog of the Glenn Beck Restoring Courage: Courage to Stand. We will be bringing you minute by minute coverage of the 'renegade' commentator's final event in his supportarama roadshow in Israel. The evening's glittering guests tonight apparently include Israeli singer Dudu Fisher, MK Danny Danon and Angelina Jolie's dad.
With half an hour to go, the sun is shining and the faithful are gathering in the Old City of Jerusalem.
Overheard in the warm-up act: “Israel has the right to protect its God-given land.” Glad we've got that cleared up.
16:52: MK Danny Danon has just graced the press pen with his presence: I support democracies everywhere, in Cairo and in Libya and Iran. I hope that one day we will see more democracies in the Middle East, but unfortunately I don't see that happening soon.16:53: Seven minutes to go, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin is back. Presumably to thank the mainly Christian crowd again for loving us despite our "otherness".
16:59: A rendition of what sounds like Careless Whisper arranged by Kenny G. Is this the play-on music for the man himself?
17:00: No, it's just the Jerusalem Great Synagogue Choir.17:04: And now, please be standing for the Israeli national anthem, Hatikva. 
17:06: And now, please be standing for the mayor of Jerusalem, Mayor Nir Barkat.
17:08: Overheard: Danny Danon talking to an international news  organization: We are very proud to have such committed friends coming  from all around the world to support Israel unconditionally. Ah.
Barkat: "Our present is also our past here today in Jerusalem." Not when it comes to rent prices it isn't.
17:15: Barkat: "Jerusalem is our destiny, and  we will not derail from our vision... building united, undivided  Jerusalem, there is room in Jerusalem for everyone... for Christians,  Muslims and Jews alike." I'm not sure he ran his speech by the event  organizers.
Barkat: "Tell people what you saw, tell people what you felt." In other words: TESTIFY!
My name is Nir Barkat. You've been a great audience. Try the chicken.
17:20: And now a musical interlude.  Apparently, Jerusalem is where man first walked the earth. "We always  come back to God, and we always come back to Jerusalem."
17:23: Heeeeeeeere's Glenn. It took a minute from the cheap seats at the  back to realise that the narrator of the history of the world currently  underway, to acoustic guitar/church bells/Hollywood trailer muzak, is the man himself.
He's lost the bum-fluff beard.
There are people here from Pakistan and Qatar? Cool.
17:33: Applause, music.
17:37: And now Matt Staber from something something to present the Restoring Courage awards. No James Franco and Catwoman?
17:42: The first award is given to the Fogel family. This would be funny if it weren't so terrible.
17:47: The next award goes to Maxim, the Jewish-Arab restaurant in Haifa devastated by a suicide bombing in 2003. 
17:48: The final award goes to supermarket magnate Rami Levy for his charity.
17:51: We've done a quick rough headcount.  There are many empty seats. Glenn is still talking. "What one generation  tolerates, the next generation tolerates. The grand councils of earth  condemn Israel, while across the border Syria is slaughtering their own  people. So-called diplomats are afraid, they're cowards. They only condemn  Israel because it's convenient, not because they actually believe it."
17:55: "I stand here to tell you this today,  fear is the pathway to surrender. To overcome fear we just need one  thing: Courage. Truth and courage." Er, that's two things.
17:57: Glenn is in full throttle here. "The  plotters plot and the schemers scheme. Sadly even the Israelis I have  met, some of the most courageous people on earth are beginning to  believe the lies and doubt themselves. The only message I have for  Israel and Israelis is this: my friends, do not lose hope. You must not  lose confidence in yourselves. You must draw comfort from the knowledge  that you were led to this place from God.... God is not a stranger to  the children of Abraham."
17:58: "Israel is here because the God of Abraham keeps his covenants." What about Ben-Gurion, Truman and Balfour?
18:01: Glenn's beginning to open up about his past life as a non-believer. I think this is the bit where he cries.
18:03: Woah. In 1999, he listened to Osama  bin Laden, and knew that he would attack New York again. He also knew  the housing crash was coming. But it doesn't take a prophet to see these  things. For a minute I thought that was where he was going.
18:04: And he also knew that there would be more terror attacks on Israel, and last week, he was proved right. Lucky for him.

18:40: Wait! There's a closing prayer. "We pray for the peace of Jerusalem... we have abused our positions and show no love for others. We are here to say, Israel, the Holy Land, you are not alone...
Today  is a new day, we will not. May God bless Israel, may God bless the  Palestinian people, may God bless the United States of America. Amen."
That's all. The faithful are filing out to strains of the "Sabbath Prayer" song from Fiddler on the Roof. This is not a joke. 
Thanks for reading. You can hear more from  Glenn on his website, TV channel, radio show and newsletter, or buy his  coffee table book of his trip to Israel, already in the shops. And if  you're in South Africa or South America this week, you can also see him  live.
One last thing: Herman Cain is shaking hands with people as they leave the arena. Thank you for flying Air Beck.

<title>Macy Gray asks Facebook fans: Should I boycott Israel? </title>
<date>Wed Jan 19 22:31:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Pop star Macy Gray wrote on her official Facebook page on Wednesday that she was deliberating whether or not she should perform in February in Israel, as she had received dozens of letters urging her to boycott the country.
"I'm getting a lot of letters from activists urging/begging me to boycott by NOT performing in protest of Apartheid against the Palestinians," Macy Gray wrote on her Wall.
"What the Israeli government is doing to the Palestinians is disgusting, but I wana go. I gotta lotta fans there I dont want to cancel on and I ...don't know how my NOT going changes anything. What do you think? Stay or go?" she asked her fans.
Gray is scheduled to perform two shows in Tel Aviv this February.
The star's Faceboook comment was answered by over 1,000 comments, some of which urged her to indeed heed to the call to boycott Israel. Some people identifying themselves as Israelis told her in response that she was not welcome in the country in any event.
Gray has performed in Israel several times over the past few years and has always been greeted by enthusiastic fans.
Earlier this week, French singer Vanessa Paradi, the wife of Hollywood mega star Johnny Depp, canceled her planned performance in Israel due to what she called professional problems. However reports that she had received threats from pro-Palestinian groups suggested that she cancelled the show because she did not want to get involved and decided to terminate her visit.

<title>Netanyahu realizes he needs a welfare minister after all </title>
<date>Thu Jan 20 01:42:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Heeding the howls of protest from fighters for social equality, the press and the political sphere, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reversed his decision less than a day after announcing he would retain the welfare portfolio. He's giving it to Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon.
After advising his coalition colleagues yesterday, Netanyahu called Kahlon to seal the appointment. Outgoing welfare minister Isaac Herzog met with Kahlon yesterday.
"I am glad the prime minister decided to leave the welfare and social services portfolio in Likud hands," Kahlon commented. He said he was glad to undertake this "important mission."
The protest made it clear to Netanyahu and his people they'd made a mistake. They would have difficulty explaining how a bloated cabinet with more than 30 ministers, many without portfolio, would lack a full-time welfare minister.
Shas had wanted the portfolio, a demand Netanyahu ignored.
Kahlon is popular by virtue of his reforms lowering the prices of cellular communications.
Meanwhile, Netanyahu and his ministers met yesterday for 15 minutes to swear in the new cabinet, with the prime minister heaping praise on the members of the newborn Atzmaut, formed by ex-Labor head Ehud Barak. "[Yitzhak] Rabin used to say that sometimes an anti-nausea pill is handy," one minister quipped.
At midday Atzmaut announced that the minorities portfolio, earmarked for Matan Vilnai, would be given to Shalom Simhon, who also received the industry portfolio. Perhaps Netanyahu and his people realized that giving the minorities job to a Defense Ministry personality might taste of military rule.
Some Likud members were disappointed at being left out in the cold by Netanyahu's largesse with Atzmaut. Ayoob Kara  (deputy minister for the development of the Negev portfolio ), who embarrassed Israel by meeting with far rightists in Austria last month, boiled at not being upgraded. Kara, a Druze, has been saying the last few days that failing to give him a ministry would boost Israel's image as an apartheid state. Kara summoned about 20 Druze dignitaries to the Knesset, where they stormed Netanyahu's office yesterday, demanding the deputy minister receive a ministerial post. It worked, to a degree. Netanyahu promised that in three months he would consider a rotation, and Kara would not be left behind.
Orit Noked received the agriculture portfolio on the grounds, Netanyahu explained, that her appointment would strengthen female power in government.
New leader for Labor?
Meanwhile, over in Labor, the party that Ehud Barak suddenly abandoned this week, its eight remaining Knesset members not to choose a new chairman from among themselves to avert tensions inside the faction. The eight will choose an external candidate, to be voted on by the party central leadership. Meanwhile, the octet will function as the collective leadership of the party, they decided.
One name raised yesterday as a potential temporary chairman was Micha Harish, former Labor secretary general and MK.
Benjamin Ben-Eliezer said at the eight-way meeting that he does not want the job of acting chairman: "Relax, it won't happen," he told his colleagues. Some of them had indicated they didn't like the idea.

<title>Norway may recognize Palestinian state if peace process remains stalled</title>
<date>Thu Mar 03 02:32:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store told Haaretz Wednesday that his country would reevaluate its position on recognizing a Palestinian state if no progress is made in the peace process by September 2011.
Speaking from Jerusalem, where he is on a state visit, Gahr said Israel runs the risk of being seen internationally as a "permanent occupier" if the stalemate in the peace process continues. He said he was worried such a view would lead to a further delegitimization of Israel and would harm its security.
"I speak as a friend of Israel and Israel has many friends in Norway," Store said. "Europe is watching for results and initiatives toward a settlement of this conflict. The major challenge for Israel in this century is that it stands out as an occupier in breach of international law. This to me is a big challenge to the quality of Israel - which is to be a democracy and a player in the first division in the world. I think that in key European capitals the hope to see that change is thinner than it used to be."
In the last few months the Palestinian Authority has launched a diplomatic campaign around the world to muster support for a Palestinian state with UN recognition by September.
"Norway is recognizing facts and not visions," Store said. "I would like to be the first to recognize the state of Palestine when negotiations have been completed. I say so as long as there is a prospect for those negotiations. If it is clear to people that there is no such prospect we will have to reevaluate."
Store met yesterday with his Israeli counterpart Avigdor Lieberman and Prime Minister Netanyahu.
Disappointed by Lieberman 
He said he came out of the meeting with Lieberman very disappointed. "His message is clear: Forget it," Store said.
"His message is that GDP differences between Palestinians and Israelis is $3,000 to $30,000 so forget about peace. To me that is a message that there is no genuine wish to move forward. Because if you make this dependent on GDP ratios we are completely on a different calendar," he said, referring to Lieberman's claim that the gap between rich and poor would make peace impossible.
In his talks with Netanyahu, Store tried to convince him about the urgent need to present an Israeli diplomatic initiative. His main message was that "the occupation is the reason for the delegitimization against Israel."
"As long as there is credible progress toward a two-state solution the world would back that process," Store said. "Then, we will be in a kind of diplomatic state of emergency waiting for an agreement that would end this. If it becomes obvious even to the most optimistic that there is no prospect to this negotiations and that the two-state solution will depend on GDP somewhere down the road then the occupation will stand out in more brute terms. Then it will no longer be the image of something which is temporary, it is what Israel presents itself as the permanent occupier. That will raise discussions about the character of the one state solution with rights of minorities. This will be a nasty development."
Store said he is very carful not to use the term "apartheid state" when talking about Israel.
"I have never [used] this word," he said. "But increasingly more Israelis are doing so in the media, and politicians. I am quoting them. In such a situation you will have one state with people with different rights. You can label it however you want but in my opinion it does not correspond with the ideals of the Israeli democracy."

<title>Palestinian pride: Israel protests influenced by Arab world</title>
<date>Sat Aug 06 07:54:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Palestinian social leaders believe the social protests that have erupted throughout Israel are largely influenced by the Arab Spring, contending Israelis must realize they too are suffering due to the occupation and money spent on settlements in the West Bank.
Israelis are imitating the Arab world, and West Bank Palestinians believe this to be a good thing.  According to the Ma’an news agency, 14,032 (nearly 75%) of the 18,722 readers who responded to their online survey, believe that what is happening in Israel’s streets is influenced by and imitating the “Arab Spring”.
“Israel is inadvertantly  becoming a part of the Middle East,” said sociologist Honaida Ghanim, who researches Israeli society, adding that“this is the power of bottom-up activity, when the country’s ideologists aren’t consulted.”
Ghanim wasn’t surprised when the protests began. As an Israeli citizen, born in Marja and General Director of “MADAR” the Palestinian Forum for Israeli Studies, the sociologist is well acquainted with Israeli polarization. However, she is certain that the recent events in Egypt and Tunisia had a large impact on the Israeli protest movement.
Sufian Abu Zaida is a member of Fatah and former prisoner, who currently teaches about Israeli society in the Birzeit University and the Al-Quds Open University. He was born in Jabaliya, a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, to a family of refugees from the town Burayr (today Bror Hayil).
The Palestinian teacher promises to remind his students next year that “this might be the first thing Israelis learnt from Arabs. They have always presented themselves as the only positive ray of light in a pitch black Middle East. Suddenly there is something to learn from these retards."
Ghanim cited additional sociological factors as part of the impetus for change in Israel, saying "on the one hand, there is neo-liberalism and globalization that have resulted in an unacceptable gap between the wealth of the state and individuals and the harshness of life for the masses. On the other hand, these are similar tools – online social networks, with Facebook heading the list, which had a far-reaching effect on the media.”
Despite this, there isn’t much interest among the Palestinians in the protest occupying Israel for over three weeks. “We are a people in perpetual struggle with the government, three weeks of protest are not long enough to seriously catch our attention,” said Nariman al-Tamimi, from Nabi Salih, and Afaf Ghatasha, a feminist activist and member of the Palestinian People’s Party.
However, they are both impressed – as are other Palestinians –that the Israeli movement is geared toward improving the already high level standard of living in Israel in comparison to that of most Palestinians. Israelis are making “demands that are luxuries,” according to Ghatasha.
“I know something about the housing crisis,” said Tamimi, who was wrongfully placed under arrest for eight days a year and six months ago, for the attack of a policeman with a sharp object. She was eventually convicted of “obstructing a police officer in the performance of his duties,” during a demonstration against the appropriation of town land and a well.
Her husband Bassam was arrested four months ago and is charged with organizing the demonstrations in their town. “For us Palestinians, it isn’t a housing crisis we are facing but a housing ban. Though the Israeli government being at fault is a common denominator,” she said.
The Civil Administration issued a demolition order for her house built in Area C. The original house, built in 1963, wasn’t large enough for the entire family, and they were forced to expand their house without a permit; a permit Israel doesn’t issue.
From their home, which could be destroyed any day, the family members can see the settlement of Halamish growing. “A few days ago, my daughter saw the Israeli protests with me as I was surfing the web,” Tamimi said, when we met at the al-Bireh Popular Resistance Committees offices.
“She asked me, are they also dispersed with tear gas, are they hit? I told her they weren’t. She couldn’t understand the difference; we are also fighting for social justice, are we not?” Tamimi said.
The main element missing in the Israeli wave of protests, according to Tamimi, is the disconnect between social struggle and the Israeli occupation.
Abu Zaida is the only who seems optimistic about the protests, saying“the public will start reckoning with its government on what it is spending on the settlements and settlers. It’s about to happen. Social justice means an equal distribution of the country’s resources. Everyone knows that this isn’t the case due to political and ideological reasons.”
Ghanim, however, believes the Israeli protest movement will fail because political correctness will prevent people from seeing the natural link to the occupation, with the government continuing to make settlements the highest priority and depriving the Palestinian people of their freedom.
“The movement is headed by the middle class and many intellectuals, as a social class that generates much knowledge in the sociological sense but not in the spiritual sense, Ghanim said, adding "they will eventually make the connection to the occupation. However, strategic processes take a long time historically, while the leadership will have the short-term in mind, not treating the root of the problem. And then the movement will collapse. Netanyahu will bring the West Bank to Tel Aviv, meaning he will upgrade apartheid, and that’s all.”
Tamimi and Ghatasha believe this is an opportunity for Israelis to understand that they too are victims of the occupation. “All the tear gas grenades thrown at us in demonstrations cost money which cannot be spent on improving social conditions for Israelis,” Tamimi said. However, said she heard that one of the protest leaders spoke out against the anarchists, because they demonstrate against soldiers.
“These are the activists standing by our side in recent years,” she said, “How can you demand social justice for only one group?”
Ghatasha , who was born in the al-Fawwar refugee camp, to a family from the depopulated Palestinian town Bayt Jibrin, also found herself hard pressed to see any difference made by the protests that have swept up the country.
This May she met with Israeli leftist activists, who came to a conference for Palestinian leftist parties in Hebron. At the conference she talked about two processes hindering feminist Palestinian activities and female participation in the struggle against the occupation.
On one hand, she claimed, NGO-ation (the channeling of activities to NGOs funded by different countries), reduces the influence of women groups. On the other hand, militarization of the second intifada pushed most of the population, including women, out of the struggle’s public sphere.
“What is it that makes some Israelis get it and others not?” she mused in her party’s Hebron offices. “I’d like to understand the rationality of the Israeli people,” she added. “On one hand there’s this selfishness, of a people living off another people’s misery, with no regret. On the other hand, it is obvious that they would be better off were they to live like a normal country, not squandering their money on upholding the occupation, Ghatasha said.
Despite their misgivings, all four agree the protest will allow the Palestinians – most of whom know Israelis only in the form of settlers and soldiers – to see that “Israeli society isn’t one-dimensional, that it is complex, that it shouldn’t be flattened, that it has struggles and oppressed classes of its own,” Ghanim said.
“The protest is shattering the Palestinians image of Israel as a perfect country, where all are full, own villas and trade in their cars every year," Abu Zaida added.

<title>Palestinians embark on civil disobedience protests against 'demographic segregation' </title>
<date>Wed Nov 16 00:48:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Quite a large number of people awaited the no. 148 Egged bus that stopped in Kokhav Ya'akov junction on Tuesday afternoon. One could immediately recognize that these weren't the regular passengers from the neighboring settlements.
"You can't believe what's going on here," whispered one religious man into his cellular phone, "it's unbelievable." The man was obviously referring to the mob of journalists - with their multi-sized cameras, microphones and notepads - surrounding five men and a woman who were waiting at the station.
These were six Palestinians who decided to ride to Jerusalem on an Egged bus, that usually carries mostly settlers, without the required permits, and through the Hizmeh checkpoint, which is altogether off-limits for West Bank Palestinians.
This was the first in a series of civil disobedience actions planned to protest what the organizers call "demographic segregation," which forbids Palestinians from reaching East Jerusalem, while allowing a two-tier transportation system in the West Bank: one for Israelis and one for Palestinians. The protestors were inspired by the American Civil Rights Movement's Freedom Riders, who boarded buses fifty years ago to protest segregation in the southern states.
"We're part of the common human history of struggling for freedom," said Basel al-Araj, a pharmacist from al-Wallaja. He was arrested six times during the demonstrations against the separation barrier which disconnects his village from its lands and neighboring Palestinian towns.
It seems that the security forces had no prior information about the event. A military jeep showed up after 20 minutes, before the Border Control, police and what seemed to be a settlement security vehicle arrived.
The Palestinian Freedom Riders assumed that the settlers would be violent. Badee' Dwak, a social worker from Hebron, was the first to express his bewilderment, claiming that "the settlers here [near Ramallah] are quiet, not like ours in Hebron."
Of the six, only Fadi Qurun - one of the Palestinian March 15th movement leaders - had never been arrested, except for a detention of several hours after a Nabi Saleh demonstration. "Being arrested is an integral part of our existence as Palestinians under Israeli occupation," they said as they boarded the bus followed by an army of reporters, "We're not special."
The 15-minute ride to the Hizmeh checkpoint passed quietly. After they revealed a flag and some placards, one of the passengers swore at them. Dwak retorted, "You're religious, you should be ashamed of yourself."
A foreign reporter asked a passenger from Ofra for his opinion. He answered that Arabs could ride anywhere in the country, but Jews can't drive to Ramallah. Other journalists explained to her that the speaker was Hagai Segal, who was part of the infamous Jewish Underground in the eighties.
At Hizmeh checkpoint policemen demanded that two of the riders get off the bus, but they refused. The next effort came after the settlers exited the bus, in a parking lot. A Policeman dragged Dwak to the steps of the bus, but then left without him. Police officers, of different ranks came and went. Some of them threatened the six, and others pleaded with them.
Huwaida Arraf, a lawyer and one of the six Freedom Riders on the bus, offered the officers the "honorary passport" she received from the Palestinians for taking part in the Gaza flotilla last year. They didn't know they were arresting an Israeli and U.S. citizen.
Up until they were arrested and dragged away, the Freedom Riders insisted: "We have the right to reach Jerusalem. Why doesn't a settler need an entry permit? We do not obey apartheid rules. We're Palestinian, and this is Palestine."

<title>Palestinians ram bulldozer into contested stretch of West Bank fence</title>
<date>Fri Jun 24 17:50:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Palestinian protesters rammed a bulldozer on Friday into a contested barrier near the village of Bil'in, days after the Israeli army said it would finally comply with a court order and reposition the fence.
Israel Defense Forces soldiers fired volleys of tear gas and jets of foul-smelling liquid to force the flag-waving demonstrators away from the metal fencing that keeps locals from their land.
Bil'in, which lies about 25 km (15 miles) east of Tel Aviv, has become the focal point of protests against the controversial Israeli network of walls and fences that separates much of the occupied West Bank from Israel.
The IDF tore down a watchtower overlooking Bil'in on Wednesday and said they were ready to dismantle part of the fence, four years after the high court ruled it should be re-routed to give Palestinians greater access to farmland.
Palestinian leaders and activists descended on Bil'in on Friday to celebrate the decision, but said the protests would continue because much of the land remained inaccessible.
"What the village of Bil'in has got back because of the changing of the course of the wall represents less than half of the lands that were confiscated," Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad told Reuters television.
"This represents a backing down, and therefore this event has an important meaning ... but this can only end with the ending of the occupation along with its injustice, its settlements and walls," he said after attending midday prayers.
TEAR GAS
Israel has built a concrete wall several hundred metres back from the fence, which will take the place of the old barrier. But the original metal fence still stands and a few dozen protesters tried to tear it down using a yellow bulldozer.
The Palestinians, including one man in a wheelchair, made their way along a dirt track amidst olive trees and used a bulldozer to rip up a metal gate before being forced back by soldiers.
The cabin of the bulldozer was thick with tear gas as the driver struggled to retreat.
Israel started building its barrier, which is a mix of metal fencing, barbed wire and concrete walls, in 2002 following a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings.
The Israeli government calls it a "security fence" and says it is vital to protect Israeli lives. The Palestinians refer to it as an "apartheid wall" and say it amounts to a land grab, swallowing up swathes of ancestral farmland.
The World Court in The Hague said in 2004 that the proposed 720-km (430-mile) barrier was illegal.
At Bil'in, the barrier curves 3 km (2 miles) inside the Green Line, established by a 1949 ceasefire, which divides Israel and the West Bank. It does so to ensure nearby settlements lie on the Israeli side of the barrier.

<title>Reporter tries to place Lieberman under citizens arrest</title>
<date>Tue Feb 22 23:22:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Foreign Minster Avigdor Lieberman was challenged by a reporter during his visit to the European Council, when the man told Lieberman that he was under citizens' arrest and demanded that Lieberman accompany him to the nearest police station.
David Cronin, a freelance reporter and author of the book "Europe's Alliance with Israel: Aiding the Occupation" was tackled by security officials only seconds after he began to address Lieberman and physically escorted from the room.
As Lieberman entered a press conference, Cronin stood up and declared, "Mr. Lieberman, this is a citizens' arrest. You are charged with the crime of apartheid. Please come with me to the nearest police station." As he was dragged away, he shouted, "Free Palestine! Free Palestine! Apartheid is a crime!"
This was not the first time that Cronin has tried to carry out a citizens' arrest of a high-ranked public official. Last year he tried to single-handedly arrest former British Prime Minister Tony Blair for what he said were crimes against the people of Iraq.
A member of the Israeli delegation to the European Union said, "This was entirely uncivilized, in bad taste. But Israel, like the EU, is very supportive of free speech. It's just a shame that some people take advantage of that freedom sometimes," according to the European Union Observer.
Foreign Minister Lieberman is in Brussels for the annual meeting of the decade-old EU-Israel Association Council. Earlier on Tuesday, Hungary's foreign minister Janos Martonyi, whose country currently chairs the EU, told Lieberman that growing instability in the Middle East makes it imperative to immediately resume the stalled peace process with the Palestinians.

<title>Report: London Philharmonic suspends musicians for anti-Israel remarks </title>
<date>Sat Sep 17 16:25:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
A report in UK daily The Guardian stated that the London Philharmonic Orchestra has suspended four of its musicians for nine months for adopting its name when they called for the cancellation of an Israeli orchestra’s concert at the Royal Albert Hall.
According to the Guardian, the orchestra suspended cellist Sue Sutherley, as well as violinists Tom Eisner, Nancy Elan and Sarah Streatfeild until June 2012, after they signed a letter as members of the LPO condemning the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra as an instrument of Israeli propaganda.
The musicians’ statement claimed that “denials of human rights and violations of international law are hidden behind a cultural smokescreen. The IPO is perhaps Israel's prime asset in this campaign”, and that Israel's policy toward the Palestinians “fits the UN definition of apartheid."
The Guardian’s report states that both Orchestra chief executive Tim Walker, as well as chairman Martin Hohmann released a statement regarding the suspensions, which were meant to send a “strong and clear message that their actions will not be tolerated … the orchestra would never restrict the right of its players to express themselves freely, however such expression has to be independent of the LPO itself.”
The statement also said that the Orchestra has no desire to “end the careers” of the musicians, but that “for the LPO, music and politics to not mix.”"
The move comes after protestors interrupted a performance by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra on September 1 during an annual BBC Proms concert series.
Several demonstrators in the venue shouted as Zubin Mehta stood to conduct Bruch's Violin Concerto, while other audience members booed in response to the protest.

<title>Report: Turkey shows support for Palestinian efforts to seek UN recognition</title>
<date>Sat Apr 23 09:55:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
In a report published Saturday in the Turkish daily, Today's Zaman, the Turkish Ambassador to the UN expressed his support for Palestinian statehood, urging the international community to follow suit.
"The time has come to show solidarity with the Palestinians and help them to live in peace and dignity," said the Turkish Ambassador to the UN Ertuğrul Apakan during a UN Security Council debate on the Middle East on Thursday.
According to the report in Today's Zaman, Apakan said that if the Palestinians prove they are ready to become a full UN member, instead of maintaining their current observer status, the international community should not "turn a blind eye to their just and legitimate appeal."
“Through their state building efforts, the Palestinian Authority has proven to all the skeptics that they deserve to attain their decades-long target of internationally recognized statehood, even though they continue to suffer under occupation,” said Apakan, according to the report.
In a New York Times editorial Thursday, Turkish President Abdullah Gul spoke of the importance of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. He said that a "dignified and viable Palestine," living side by side with Israel, would fortify Israel's security.
According to the report, Gul said that the plight of the Palestinians has been a cause of unrest and conflict in the Middle East and a pretext for extremism in other parts of the world. "Israel cannot afford to be perceived as an apartheid island surrounded by an Arab sea of anger and hostility," said the Turkish president.
He added that Turkey would benefit from a peaceful Middle East and is "therefore ready to use our full capacity to facilitate constructive negotiations."
Israel's relationship with Turkey, once a key Mideast ally, has severely deteriorated since the Gaza war of the winter of 2008-2009, after which Ankara had severely criticized Jerusalem for use of excessive force in a dense civilian population. 
The ties between the once stanch allies continued to worsen following Israel's raid on a Turkish Gaza aid flotilla in May of 2010, which resulted in the deaths of nine Turkish activists. 
Turkey has repeatedly urged Israel to apologize for its boarding of the Gaza flotilla, demanding that it compensate the families of those injured and killed in the incident, demands that were rejected by Israel. 
Recently, Turkish officials indicated they rejected a request from Israel to help stop activists sailing to Gaza on the first anniversary of an Israeli raid on a Turkish ship, saying flotilla plan was not Ankara's concern.
The Free Gaza Movement, a pro-Palestinian activist umbrella group, has said that a flotilla expected in late May would comprise 15 ships with international passengers including Europeans and Americans. 
Israel's ambassador to Turkey, Gaby Levy, asked the Turkish government this month to help stop the activists, saying sending humanitarian aide to Gaza outside legal channels was a "provocation," an Israeli diplomatic official told Reuters. 
According to the report in Today's Zaman, the Turkish ambassador the UN said, "It should also be borne in mind that the phenomenon of humanitarian convoys to Gaza cannot simply be explained away as unilateral provocations.”

<title>South African Jew who hid Nelson Mandela dies in Tel Aviv at 82</title>
<date>Thu May 26 02:51:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
It was an elaborate charade: A white South African family in the comfortable brick house on the northern edge of Johannesburg, a black farm worker in the tiny servant's quarters out back.
The farm worker was Nelson Mandela, hiding out in the 1960s soon after he founded the armed wing of the African National Congress. Arthur Goldreich, key to the ruse as head of the white family, died Tuesday in Tel Aviv, Mandela's office said Wednesday. Goldreich was 82.
Goldreich and his family pretended to be the owners of a farm on the outskirts of Johannesburg that was the ANC's underground headquarters in the 1960s. They played into the stereotypes of apartheid, trying to behave as masters and servant before the neighbors, who have spoken of seeing Mandela, known on the farm as David Motsamayi, in blue workers' overalls selling produce on the street outside.
But in private, they were comrades. Mandela once spoke of numerous political discussions with Goldreich, and of recommending he be recruited into Umkhonto we Sizwe, known as MK, the ANC's armed wing. In his autobiography, Mandela describes the South African-born Goldreich as having fought in the 1940s with the military wing of the Jewish National Movement in Palestine.
Mandela described Goldreich as a "flamboyant person  (who ) gave the farm a buoyant atmosphere.
Benjamin Pogrund, a former South African journalist who met Goldreich in Israel, told the Associated Press that "Goldreich was a romantic revolutionary."
"He had a great personality and was really fun to be with," Pogrund said. "He was a great narrator and did everything with tremendous flair."
Mandela wrote of close calls at the farm. One day Mandela's son, leafing through a magazine while playing with Golreich's son on a visit to the farm, came across a photo of Mandela before he went underground. Mandela's son told Goldreich's son the man pictured was his father, and identified him by his real name.
"I had the feeling that I had remained too long in one place," Mandela wrote.
Mandela was not at the farm when it was raided in 1963. He was already in prison in a separate case, but became a defendant in the so-called Rivonia treason trial that arose from the farm raid, leading to decades in prison.
Goldreich was among those arrested.  (Ian Deitch in Jerusalem contributed to this report. )

<title>South African school cuts ties with Ben-Gurion University </title>
<date>Fri Mar 25 02:04:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
A leading South African university is severing ties with Ben-Gurion University of the Negev after hundreds of South African professors called for an academic boycott.
The University of Johannesburg's vice chancellor Adam Habib said yesterday the university is ending a 25-year relationship with BGU on April 1. He said professors can continue to work individually with Ben-Gurion University should they decide to do so and should BGU agree to such an arrangement.
BGU President, Professor Rivka Carmi, said "the South African people will be the one to lose from this decision." She said the boycott was triggered by a report submitted to UJ, blasting BGU's cooperation with the IDF on a program for flight cadets.
The two universities have been working together on cleaning algae from South African drinking water, using innovative technologies developed in BGU, university officials said.
More than 400 South Africans signed a petition calling for the boycott, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The Congress of South African Trade Unions called it a landmark moment in the campaign to boycott Israel.
Habib said the university's senate committee discussed the issue for two hours on Wednesday then held a secret vote. Sixty percent voted to sever ties, outvoting the remainder who wanted relations with both Israeli and Palestinian universities.
"This is not a boycott of Ben-Gurion University," said UJ's executive director for advancement, Kerry Swift. "The formal relationship between the institutions is in a sense an obstacle, and the feeling is that we would encourage relationships on an individual basis."
BGU began its relations with UJ when the latter was the whites-only Rand Afrikaans University during the apartheid era. South Africa's post-apartheid government has been sharply critical of Israel's policies regarding the Palestinians.
The South African Jewish Board of Deputies criticized the decision, saying that it would be detrimental to "constructive intellectual engagement in South Africa."
"The UJ senate's decision to allow the formal relationship between UJ and BGU to lapse is playing to narrow-minded political prejudice and is a severe setback for constructive intellectual engagement in South Africa," SAJBD national chairperson Zev Krengel said in a statement published in the South African press.

<title>South African school cuts ties with Ben-Gurion University in Israel</title>
<date>Thu Mar 24 12:30:00 IST 2011</date>

JOHANNESBURG - A leading South African university is severing ties with Ben-Gurion University of the Negev after hundreds of South African professors called for an academic boycott.
Vice Chancellor Adam Habib said Thursday that the University of Johannesburg is ending a 25-year relationship on April 1. He said professors can continue to work individually with Ben-Gurion, should they decide to do so and should Ben-Gurion agree to it.
More than 400 South Africans signed a petition calling for the boycott, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The Congress of South African Trade Unions called it a landmark moment  in the campaign to boycott Israel.

"This is not a boycott of Ben-Gurion," said UJ's executive director for advancement, Kerry Swift. "The formal relationship between the institutions is in a sense an obstacle, and the feeling is that we would encourage relationships on an individual basis."
Relations with Ben-Gurion University began when UJ was the whites-only Rand Afrikaans University during the apartheid era. South Africa's post-apartheid government has been a sharp critic of Israel's policies regarding the Palestinians.

"The UJ senate's decision to allow the formal relationship between UJ and BGU to lapse is playing to narrow-minded political prejudice and is a severe setback for constructive intellectual engagement in South Africa,” SAJBD national chairperson Zev Krengel said in a statement published in the South African press.
Ben-Gurion and Johannesburg universities have been working together on cleaning algae from South African drinking water, Krengel was quoted as saying.
He said the decision showed that, "rather than availing itself of a scientific co-operative project in the  water purification field that has enormous potential benefits for South  Africa, UJ has chosen instead to further the agenda of a group of  anti-Israel agitators." 
Alana Baranov of SAJBD  said South Africans "should be serving to provide a tolerant and respectful place where complex problems can be resolved and we can share resources."
"Academic boycotts are anti-freedom of speech and anti-academic," she said.
Baranov said the joint research had been done to improve the lives of average South Africans.
Those fighting to end cooperation have argued that Ben-Gurion has ties to the Israel Defense Force and is complicit in the military's treatment of Palestinians.
"Israeli universities are an intimate part of the Israeli regime, by active choice," Tutu wrote in a recent essay. "While Palestinians are not able to access universities and schools, Israeli universities produce the research, technology, arguments and leaders for maintaining the occupation."

<title>Spoken-word musical pioneer Gil Scott-Heron dies at 62</title>
<date>Sun May 29 01:19:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
NEW YORK - Musician Gil Scott-Heron - who helped lay the groundwork for rap by fusing minimalistic percussion, political expression and spoken-word poetry with songs such as "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" - died Friday at age 62.
Scott-Heron died during the afternoon at St. Luke's Hospital after becoming sick upon his return from a trip to Europe, according to his friend Doris C. Nolan, who answered the telephone listed for his Manhattan recording company.
"We're all sort of shattered," Nolan said.
Scott-Heron's influence on rap was so great that he was sometimes referred to as the "Godfather of Rap," a title he rejected.
"If there was any individual initiative that I was responsible for it might have been that there was music in certain poems of mine, with complete progression and repeating 'hooks,' which made them more like songs than just recitations with percussion," Scott-Heron wrote in the introduction to his 1990 collection of poems "Now and Then."
He referred to his signature mix of percussion, politics and performed poetry as "bluesology" or "Third World music." Later he called it simply "black music or black American music," noting, "Black Americans are now a tremendously diverse essence of all the places we've come from and the music and rhythms we brought with us." Nevertheless, Scott-Heron's influence on generations of rappers has been demonstrated through sampling of his recordings by artists such as Kanye West.
Scott-Heron recorded the song that would make him famous, "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised," which critiqued mass media, for the album "125th and Lenox" in Harlem in the 1970s. He followed up that recording with more than a dozen albums, initially collaborating with musician Brian Jackson. His most recent album was "I'm New Here," which he began recording in 2007 and which was released in 2010.
Throughout his musical career, Scott-Heron took on the political issues of his time, including the apartheid in South Africa and nuclear arms. He was largely shaped by the politics of the 1960s and black literature, especially that of the Harlem Renaissance.
Last May, Scott-Heron was scheduled to perform in Tel Aviv, Israel, but canceled following pressure from the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel.
Scott-Heron was born in Chicago on April 1, 1949. He was raised in Jackson, Tenn., and New York before attending college at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania.
Before turning to music, he became a novelist at age 19 with the publication of "The Vulture," a murder mystery.
He also was the author of "The Nigger Factory," a social satire.

<title>Sweden-Israel handball game sparks anti-Israel protests</title>
<date>Mon Jun 13 01:13:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
A European Championship qualifier match between the Israeli and Swedish handball teams on Sunday sparked protests urging a boycott of Israel on the grounds that it is an "apartheid state."
Police say around 150 pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered outside a sports stadium in the town of Karlskrona in southern Sweden, where the match was held. One person was taking into custody three hours into the demonstration.
The rally was organized by an umbrella group called the “Network for Independence, Peace and Non-alignment,” which is comprised of various Swedish political parties. Organizers distributed a picture of a decapitated child lying between the legs of a soldier to attract protesters.
In an earlier message, protest organizers said that, “In Israel, Palestinians are denied the right to pursue sports on equal terms, just like the blacks were denied this right in South Africa during apartheid. Sports and politics are connected. The Israeli team represents the Apartheid state of Israel.”
Police spokesman Mats Trulsson said the protest had been peaceful and showed no sign of developing into the violent riots seen during a Davis Cup game between Sweden and Israel in the city of Malmo in 2009.
Trulsson also said that a pro-Israel demonstration attracted around 60 people to Karlskrona before the qualifier game for the European handball championship.
Police had been on high alert before the game, following the events in Malmo in 2009 when rock-throwing activists clashed with police and tried to storm the arena hosting the Davis Cup game.
The Simon Wiesenthal Center had earlier called for the International Handball Federation to cancel Sunday's game because of anti-Israel sentiments and preparations for the rally.

Approximately 2,000 Palestinians and Israelis took part in the "March for Independence" Friday, calling for the recognition of a Palestinian state.
Although the organizers of the march issued a statement saying the march was carried out peacefully, police had to intervene and separate right-wing and left-wing activists.
The event was coordinated with the police, and organizers had pledged to prevent any violence from breaking out, despite the expected right-wing counter-protests.
Participants in the march held signs quoting South African leader and anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela saying "only free men can negotiate", while others bore slogans calling for support of Palestinian independence.
Several MKs participated in the march, including Zehava Galon of Meretz and Dov Hanin of Hadash. Other prominent public figures took part as well, such as former Speaker of the Knesset Avraham Burg and former Attorney General Michael Ben Yair.
The march took a symbolic route, following the green line that used to divide East and West Jerusalem before the Six Day War in 1967. It began at Jaffa Gate and ended at the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, the opposite route taken by right-wing activists during Jerusalem Day last month.
Avner Inbar, Solidarity movement spokesman, said that the declaration of independence in September is "an act of people who crave freedom." He added that "Palestinian independence is not only the natural right of the Palestinian people. It is the only solution that can prevent another wave of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. This march proves that a joint, Jewish-Arab struggle is the way to end the occupation."

<title>Turkey: Israel-Palestinian peace will decide fate of Arab uprisings</title>
<date>Thu Apr 21 11:21:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Turkish President Abdullah Gul said in a New York Times editorial Thursday, that the fate of the Arab world uprisings will be determined by whether there is peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
"Whether these uprisings lead to democracy and peace or to tyranny and conflict will depend on forging a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and a broader Israeli-Arab peace," Gul said in the article.
The Turkish President said that Israel, more than any country, needs to adapt to the new political climate of the region. "But it need not fear," he said, "the emergence of a democratic neighborhood around Israel is the ultimate assurance of the country’s security."
Gul said that in the coming 50 years there will be an overwhelming majority of Arabs in the combined regions of Israel and the existing Palestinian territories, comprised of a generation of pro-democratic Arabs. As such, he said, "sticking to the unsustainable status quo will only place Israel in greater danger."
The New York Times editorial said that the plight of the Palestinians has been a cause of unrest and conflict in the region and a pretext for extremism in other parts of the world. "Israel cannot afford to be perceived as an apartheid island surrounded by an Arab sea of anger and hostility," said the Turkish president.
The article added that a dignified Palestine, living side by side with Israel, will fortify Israel's security, and that Turkey will benefit from a peaceful Middle East. "We are therefore ready to use our full capacity to facilitate constructive negotiations."
Israel's relationship with Turkey, once a key Mideast ally, has severely deteriorated since the Gaza war of the winter of 2008-2009, after which Ankara had severely criticized Jerusalem for use of excessive force in a dense civilian population.
The ties between the once stanch allies continued to worsen following Israel's raid on a Turkish Gaza aid flotilla in May of 2010, which resulted in the deaths of nine Turkish activists.
Turkey has repeatedly urged Israel to apologize for its boarding of the Gaza flotilla, demanding that it compensate the families of those injured and killed in the incident, demands that were rejected by Israel.
Recently, Turkish officials indicated they rejected a request from Israel to help stop activists sailing to Gaza on the first anniversary of an Israeli raid on a Turkish ship, saying flotilla plan was not Ankara's concern.The Free Gaza Movement, a pro-Palestinian activist umbrella group, has said that a flotilla expected in late May would comprise 15 ships with international passengers including Europeans and Americans.
Israel's ambassador to Turkey, Gaby Levy, asked the Turkish government this week to help stop the activists, saying sending humanitarian aide to Gaza outside legal channels was a "provocation," an Israeli diplomatic official told Reuters.
Asked about the request, a Turkish foreign ministry official told Reuters: "We listened to the message given by the Israeli side and told them this is an initiative by civil society."

<title>UN investigator: Israel engaged in ethnic cleansing with settlement expansion</title>
<date>Mon Mar 21 18:53:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
Israel's expansion of settlements in East Jerusalem and eviction of Palestinians from their homes there is a form of ethnic cleansing, a United Nations investigator said on Monday.United States academic Richard Falk was speaking to the UN Human Rights Council as it prepared to pass resolutions condemning settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.The "continued pattern of settlement expansion in East Jerusalem combined with the forcible eviction of long-residing Palestinians are creating an intolerable situation" in the part of the city previously controlled by Jordan, he said.This situation "can only be described in its cumulative impact as a form of ethnic cleansing," Falk declared.Israel declines to deal with Falk or even allow him into the country, accusing him of being biased.In a related discussion on Israeli policies towards the lands it seized in the 1967 war, Israeli and Palestinian delegates clashed over the recent killing of members of a Jewish settler family in the West Bank.
Israeli ambassador Aharon Leshno Yaar called on Palestinian leaders to condemn the March 11 murders of three children, including a baby, and their parents "without caveats or hedging" in Arabic to their own people.Almost as shocking as the killings, "in the days following the massacre many Palestinians took to the streets celebrating the deaths of this family," Leshno Yaar said.But Palestinian envoy Ibrahim Kraishi said the killings had already been condemned by the Palestinian Authority as "an act of terrorism" that was not part of his people's culture. "Rather, it is the culture of the occupying power," he added.In his speech, Falk said he would like the Human Rights Council to ask the International Court of Justice to look at Israeli behavior in the occupied territories.This should focus on whether the prolonged occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem had elements of "colonialism, apartheid and ethnic cleansing inconsistent with international humanitarian law," the investigator declared.

<title>Visiting South African artist rejects Israel boycott, opting to protest in Jerusalem instead</title>
<date>Mon Mar 07 03:32:00 IST 2011</date>
<content>
South African artist William Kentridge has come to Israel for a retrospective of his work that opened at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem last Friday.
Though Kentridge, who is known for his vocal political opinions, had been pressured not to come by advocates of boycotting Israel, he decided instead to express his opposition to Israeli policy by attending the weekly demonstration in East Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. He also met with author David Grossman.
In addition, he used a press conference yesterday to condemn Israel's actions. However, he added, he does not believe cultural boycotts are the right solution.
Despite certain characteristics in common, Kentridge continued, he does not think Israel's occupation of the Palestinians should be compared to South African apartheid. Nevertheless, he said, both apartheid and the occupation revolve around the same key question: How much should we rely on the past to justify our existence, and how much should we forget in order to move forward?
'Proud to host exhibition' 
Israel Museum director James Snyder told reporters that the museum, which has been collecting Kentridge works since the late 1990s, was "proud" to host such an important exhibition. The exhibition, a joint venture between the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Norton Museum of Art, is traveling to four other cities before ending in New York's Museum of Modern Art.
Kentridge, born in Johannesburg in 1954, gained fame in the late 1980s for a series of works harshly critical of South Africa's apartheid regime.

<title>Will Jello Biafra play in Tel Aviv after all?</title>
<date>Wed Jul 13 02:26:00 IDT 2011</date>
<content>
Despite a week spent touring the area to decide whether he was correct to cancel his much-heralded and controversial show in Tel Aviv, punk rocker Jello Biafra says he is none the wiser.
"To boycott or not to boycott is not a black-and-white issue," the former Dead Kennedy's frontman, 53, told Haaretz Thursday, shortly before heading back to the U.S. "The more you know, the more you know you don't know. I knew that was going to happen going in, but it's just gotten more intense since then."
Biafra originally resisted calls for him to cancel his July 2 Tel Aviv gig with his new band, the Gauntanamo School of Medicine, but caved a few days before the show, telling fans he doesn't support the boycott movement and the cancellation was meant to protect his bandmates.
The Colorado-born singer, whose given name is Eric Boucher, still came to Israel, saying he wanted to explore the situation for himself.
"I wish we'd have played but I think I made the right decision, for the sake of the members of my band," he said. "I had one and possibly two band members that were on the verge of cracking up, me being one of them," the San Francisco resident said about the pressure from pro-Palestinian activists. One group called Punks Against Apartheid was founded with the lone intention of harassing him into canceling, he added.
"I already put myself in the position that whatever decision I make, there will be a lot of unhappy people, including people within the band," Biafra said, wearing a wrinkled black shirt, hiking shoes and pink socks. "The toll that has taken on the fabric of the band is not good. Not to mention me now being responsible for airfares and changing plane tickets and having no idea how I'm going to pay my bills the rest of the year."
Biafra, whose Dead Kennedys hits "California Uber Alles" and "Holiday in Cambodia" were punk anthems in the 1970s and 80s, said the despair and hopelessness he witnessed in Israel and Palestinian Territories about there being no solution to the conflict were what sunk in the most.
"You can imagine the amount of emotional turmoil that's undercut my entire visit here in knowing how people felt who wanted to see us play, and how other people felt, and then experiencing the vibrant electricity of Tel Aviv, a 24-hour town with these amazing people. And then going to Ramallah and again there are great people there," he said. "It just makes me terribly sad that between the different peoples and cultures in such a special place there could be so much horrible violent conflict."
"Part of the reason this affected me so emotionally is that I've really had a good time on the surface here, but they call Tel Aviv the bubble for a reason," he added.
Biafra also had positive impressions of Jerusalem, where he went to restaurants and bars. "It's also a 24-hour town, even though people here [in Tel Aviv] told me Jerusalem is dead. No, it's not! But even Jerusalem can be a bubble when you tune out the human rights violations going on as close as the next visible hill."
The singer said he was jarred by Palestinians' hardships he witnessed in Hebron and elsewhere, and criticized Israel for not allowing cement into Gaza.
"There are these extreme petty gestures justified under the same excuse that all the Nixon, Reagan and Bush crimes were justified - national security. National security is a one-way ticket to a lot of government lawlessness."
On the other hand, Biafra said it would be wrong to only blame Israel for the perpetuation of the conflict. "People who say they do want peace and a two-state solution but are very wary of the '67 border because they worry about rocket attacks on Tel Aviv or something coming down from Golan Heights - because they say, look at what their fanatic fringe does - that view is not unfounded either," he said.
"I realize that Hamas and Hezbollah are no joke," he said. "But despite radicalism on both sides, it still seems more solvable than some of the other horrible conflicts in the world, in part because some of is just so petty, so tit-for-tat."

<title>Combating ‘Israeli apartheid’ or preaching to the converted?</title>
<date>Fri Mar 02 11:37:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	This week, I had the pleasure of meeting several bright and articulate students during an event staged by the pro-Israel campus group Hasbara Fellowship, “Israel Peace Week”. They tabled at a local university and distributed flyers about pro-Israel advocacy and events with the goal of combating Israeli Apartheid Week. Hasbara’s motto was that Israel wants peace and has made many large sacrifices in pursuit of that goal. Many of the students further explained that they sought to reach out to the broader campus community and attract students that only know about Israel “from what they watch on the news.”
	But while the students had the best of intentions, it seemed they were preaching to the converted - that is, only attracting students already intricately familiar with Israel.
	The students set up their table on a busy corner of the campus, colorfully decorated with an Israeli flag, an American flag and glossy brochures about everything from the Israel Defense Force’s humanitarian missions to Israel’s contribution to green technology. All the material was well written and persuasive. However, these are the same types of flyers I saw on my own college campus more than six years ago - which were woefully inadequate back then at persuading students - and seemed like “old news” to those familiar with pro-Israel marketing materials. Passing out flyers like these on a busy campus is often similar to passing out flyers outside a restaurant - some people take them, but most don’t.
	While the event set out to combat Israeli Apartheid Week, it seemed to fail to attract the same audience. Many of the students who approached the table were obviously already involved with pro-Israel organizations on campus – they knew the tabling students’ names and were familiar with the materials being presented. Others looked uncomfortable approaching the table, let alone taking a flyer. And while the few students who did approach the table inquiring as to the nature of the event were met with exuberant and patient responses by the tabling students, I couldn’t help but wonder how Israel Peace Week could fulfill its mission without attracting the same audience as Israeli Apartheid Week, in order to present the “other side of the story.”
	There were also points of conflict among the tabling groups. Several organizations were present, but were hesitant to release their affiliation with “Israel Peace Week” as they didn’t want to be seen as directly opposing Israeli Apartheid Week, which was going on at the same time. In addition, they had their own Israel events coming up in the next month and didn’t want to confuse students. The multiplicity of affiliations and their lack of desire to be named alongside “Israel Peace Week” added levels of complexity that were unnecessary. While it is noble that these students are ambitious and want to host many events, are they all truly effective?
	Two prominent pro-Israel speakers who are formally associated with one of the most famous Zionist organizations in the United States spoke at the campus I visited. I can't help but wonder whether an event with a staunch pro-Israel speaker would really attract new students who have had limited exposure to Israel. Wouldn’t it be far more effective to have a strong debate between two varied speakers?
	I understand that I am probably biased. For one, I have studied the Middle East for more than eight years as well as Arabic and Islam. I have seen many, many speakers and flipped through many, many flyers - there is little that surprises or challenges me anymore within the realm of Israel advocacy. But I still believe there is room for innovation and recruitment in the world of Israel activism, like challenging preconceptions of Israel by showing images of Israel old and new, describing historical facts in a non-political way, and hosting cultural events.
	As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in his impassioned speech to Congress in 2011: Israelis don’t need to persuade those who are already believers, rather, they need to convince the skeptics. Former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat’s historic visit to the Knesset was a prime example of this: show the unbelievers your truth, and it is possible to sway even the most strident of critics.
	But while I felt that Israel Peace Week was preaching to the converted, I couldn’t entirely dismiss the event as a failure. There were absolutely some bright spots too. Meeting the students associated with the event was a highlight. They espoused publicly the desire to be “non-reactionary” to events like Israeli Apartheid Week, and showed great initiative in arranging events outside the structure of Hillel, the main Jewish campus organization, in order to attract students from non-traditional Israel advocacy backgrounds. Many expressed their efforts in creating events with other groups on campus, including the Ethiopian students and the Martial Arts community, as well as having logistical difficulties arranging events with groups that are not pro-Israel.
	With such passionate and capable students, pro-Israel organizations need to go further. Innovative programming that brings together students with varied political opinions is the best way to prove that Israel is a democratic country where diverse opinions are appreciated and accepted.
	It’s time we look to alternative ways of wowing our audiences and showing them the capable democracy that Israel is. As Sadat said at the Knesset, “We opened our heart to the peoples of the entire world to make them understand our motivations and objectives and actually to convince them of the fact that we are advocates of justice and peacemakers.” It’s time our pro-Israel efforts do the same.

<title>Frankfurt ripped for honoring Jewish-American scholar who backs Israel boycott</title>
<date>Fri Sep 07 10:24:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Protests are mounting against plans by the city of Frankfurt to honor Jewish-American scholar Judith Butler, a staunch critic of Israel.
	The Central Council of Jews in Germany and the political activist group Scholars for Peace in the Middle East are among groups that have slammed the city for choosing to honor Butler with its Theodor W. Adorno Prize on Sept. 11. The $63,000 prize is awarded every three years for “outstanding performances in the fields of philosophy, music, theater and film.”
	Butler is a supporter of the United States Campaign for the Academic & Cultural Boycott of Israel and also participated in the Canadian Israeli Apartheid Week in 2011.
	Stephan Kramer, general secretary of the Central Council, reportedly called the choice of Butler, whom he said supports boycotts against Israel but considers Hamas and Hezbollah legitimate social movements, "outrageous."
	But Frankfurt Deputy Mayor in Charge of Cultural Affairs Felix Semmelroth, a member of the board that decided last week to honor Butler, said in a recent statement to JTA that the board of trustees at its May 30 meeting was "of the unanimous opinion that the Adorno Prize should go to Judith Butler for her comprehensive work on gender theory."
	Semmelroth wrote that "the incriminating statements that are now coming out were not the subject of discussion [by the trustees] and were clearly unknown to them; and they also don't change anything regarding the importance of the work of Judith Butler."
	Planners of a protest demonstration called for Sept. 11 in Frankfurt also circulated a petition in which they noted, among other things, that Butler boycotts universities in Tel Aviv - an official partner city with Frankfurt - "but has no problem delivering lectures at the Bir Zeit University, which evidence shows is dominated by supporters of Hamas and Hezbollah."
	Butler defended herself in a Sept. 1 editorial published in two German newspapers, saying that she did not take attacks from German Jewish leaders personally. Rather, she wrote, the attacks are "directed against everyone who is critical against Israel and its current policies."
	Frankfurt's mayor, Peter Feldmann, the city's first Jewish mayor since 1933 and a member of the Social Democratic Party, was not involved in the decision to honor Butler. His predecessor, Petra Roth, of the conservative Christian Democratic Union Party, was on the board that chose Butler.
	Theodor W. Adorno (1903-1969), for whom the prize is named, was the son of a Catholic mother and Jewish father. He survived the Third Reich in exile and returned to become one of Germany’s foremost sociologists, philosophers and art critics, particularly known for his criticism of fascism and for his writings on the Holocaust.

<title>IDF soldiers instructed to bar non-Jewish citizens from settlement</title>
<date>Wed Sep 19 18:22:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Soldiers guarding Bat Ayin were instructed by the West Bank settlement's military security coordinator not to allow any non-Jew – even ones with Israeli identity cards -- through the settlement gate.
	One of the soldiers stationed at the settlement said that the request from the coordinator, who is their professional superior, was clear and explicit:
	“It was specific -- only to allow entry to Jews with blue [Israeli] identity cards. Let’s say a Druze or a Bedouin with a blue ID [would try to enter], someone coming to clean the bathrooms – no.”
	The soldier said he had mixed feelings about the order. “It felt just like apartheid, or things that recall dark times and the Holocaust – that you allow someone entry to a specific place based only on his religion.”
	Following a Haaretz query to the army, it was made clear to the Bat Ayin security coordinator that forbidding entry to non-Jewish Israeli citizens is outside the guidelines for settlement security coordinators. Nevertheless, soldiers will be required to report to the local security coordinator any time a non-Jewish Israeli citizen is admitted, to ensure they be accompanied while they are in the settlement.
	Every IDF career army service officer is required to do a week of “securing communities” – a routine tour of duty to maintain security in communities on the West Bank, the Jordan Valley and the area around Kerem Shalom in the south. The local security coordinators, who are professionally subordinate to the IDF Central Command, draft the soldiers’ orders.
	The IDF issues guidelines – including those concerning orders to open fire -- on a regular basis to security coordinators in the West Bank and Jordan Valley.
	Regional defense brigades in these areas have a district defense officer, whose job is to maintain contact with settlement security coordinators. Salaries of the security coordinators are paid through local authorities and there is close cooperation between local officials.
	The IDF says that there are 265 security coordinators stationed along all the confrontation lines, including communities near the Gaza border and in the Kerem Shalom salient. The budget for training, equipping and paying the security coordinators comes to NIS 38 million.
	The local security coordinator has broad authority, including the right to ask a person to identify himself and to detain him if necessary until the arrival of army or police officers. There have been incidents in which security coordinators acted as local “sheriffs,” harassing and threatening Palestinians.
	The IDF Spokesman confirmed the instruction to bar non-Jews is illegal. “The IDF instructs the ongoing security coordinators in the communities in security procedures, and naturally there exists no instruction to forbid the entry of citizens who are not Jews.
	“In response to the query by the report, the incident was investigated, and indeed such an order was issued by the [Bat Ayin] security coordinator. As a result, it was clarified in the IDF that this is an illegal instruction.
	“Similarly, because at issue is a complex and sensitive issue, and to prevent possible confrontations, an order was issued to inform the security coordinators when non-Jewish Israeli citizens enter, so they can be accompanied during their entry to the community.”

<title>Is Batman the most Jewish superhero?</title>
<date>Sun Aug 05 13:32:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
In Batman Begins, the first of Christopher Nolan’s Batman films, a young Bruce Wayne falls into a well and is rescued by his father, Thomas. As Thomas carries Bruce to safety, he reassuringly tells him, “Why do we fall, Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.” Nolan’s films are, essentially, meditations on – and vindications of – this wisdom, that trauma can strengthen us, that falling can help us learn to rise.
Consider the story arc of Nolan’s Batman: a young boy’s parents are murdered in front of him. Years later, the boy, now grown up, becomes a vigilante so he can help rid the city of the corruption and crime that led not only to the death of his parents but also contributes to the suffering of millions. He believes that his combination of wealth, intelligence, and training uniquely positions him to redeem Gotham. In so doing, though, he suffers many additional traumas: a sociopath murders the love of his life; a terrorist physically and mentally tortures him. These devastate Bruce, and even incapacitate him for a time. But his response is always to rise again as Batman, each time a better, smarter, more connected, more emotionally mature iteration of himself. When he falls, Bruce reflects on the meaning of those setbacks; he seeks guidance from wise mentors; he meditates about his purpose; he believes, despite the darkness he faces, that things can be better.
According to psychologist Robin S. Rosenberg, Nolan’s Bruce Wayne exemplifies a phenomenon that University of North Carolina researchers have termed “Post-Traumatic Growth.” According to recent studies, some, after a major crisis or traumatic event, bounce back to “normal.” Others develop disorders (like PTSD) or even engage in antisocial or hostile behavior. But many experience positive change. These people grow to see new life opportunities, develop closer relationships, connect more deeply with others who suffer, feel stronger and more self-confident, appreciate life more fully, and/or become more spiritually awake. For example, when a cancer survivor vows to hold his loved ones closer and to live each day more fully, that’s PTG.
PTG can also be marked by a turn to social activism, a passion for saving the world. Candice Lightner, for instance, founded Mothers Against Drunk Driving after a drunk driver killed her daughter, and Nelson Mandela organized South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission after being brutalized under apartheid.
Interestingly, research shows that we can, in a sense, inoculate ourselves to grow after a trauma, train ourselves to rise from the ashes. Taking time to think and permitting oneself to be pained increases the likelihood of PTG. Additionally, it helps to confront one’s feelings with some process of self-disclosure (like writing, talking, or praying). Social support is also crucial. Finally, religious faith is a powerful tool. It can help cultivate a necessary optimism, a belief that life is worth living, and a hopeful conviction that things can be made better. Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania is currently helping American troops cultivate these skills to immunize them against PTSD. We can adopt them, too.
All of this should be fairly obvious to practicing Jews.
These inoculating practices are integral to the process of Jewish mourning. Shivah, the seven-day period following the death of a close relative, involves many of these components: the mourner is supposed to be free of mundane distractions like cooking and cleaning so they can focus on confronting and reflecting upon their pain. Community members are expected to visit the mourner, offering support, comfort, and an open ear to listen to the mourner’s self-disclosure. The mourner is given additional opportunities for self-disclosure through prayer, and is invited three times a day to recite the Kaddish, a prayer that optimistically reaffirms the orderliness and purposefulness of life.
Individuals renew this process several times a year during the Yizkor, or memorial service. Yizkor gives the mourner the opportunity to recall the pain of the loss, to ruminate over the emotions the loss elicits, and, ultimately, to pledge to give to charity in memory of the deceased. In Yizkor, we declare that the appropriate response to trauma is working to make the world a better, more just place.
We also do this communally. Take Tisha B’Av, the saddest day on the Jewish calendar, for example. We observe this day by fasting to confront and reflect upon our collective pain. We self-disclose by praying, chanting Lamentations, and singing dirges. We gather with community, offering each other support and comfort. And, most importantly, we annually reconstruct a narrative: Destruction results not because of physical weakness but because of moral decay; while devastation and exile makes the world appear bleak, such a state of affairs is only temporary, and a new dawn will rise; we can accelerate redemption by turning back to God. This narrative carries us from Tisha B’Av through the High Holy Days. During those seven weeks, we read selections from the prophets in synagogue that offer words of consolation and hope, reminding us that redemption will be at hand if only we would turn our lives around to invite it.
In recent weeks, the horrific bombing of Israeli tourists in Bulgaria, the massacre of civilians in Syria, and the tragic slaughter of innocent moviegoers in Colorado, have left many of us feeling traumatized. But scientific discovery and the Jewish tradition remind us that when we fall, we can learn to pick ourselves up. We can experience trauma, and, afterward, grow.

<title>Jewish students should take Israeli Apartheid Week with a pinch of salt</title>
<date>Mon Feb 27 10:49:48 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	As the eighth annual Israeli Apartheid Week is gearing up at colleges around the world, anti-Semitism on campuses is, once again, a hot topic. Every Jewish campus organization throws their lot in with Israeli Apartheid Week, using it to highlight what they see as the victimhood of Jewish students. They are, however, missing the point.
	That Israeli Apartheid week is hateful, ignorant and just plain stupid is beyond doubt. It's a gross exaggeration of the flaws of Israel with no regard paid to the good, and it alienates many students, polarizing campuses and, sometimes, causing confrontation. But isn't that what college is all about?
	College is the birthplace of exaggerated emotions and extreme ideologies. Thankfully, it is also normally their graveyard. It's the place where people go to learn that ideas exist, and it normally takes them nearly all of their time there to realize that most of those ideas are only any good if, like beer and whisky, they are taken in moderation. If not, then you just get drunk on them and do stupid things. Since getting drunk on beer and whisky and doing stupid things is pretty much the hallmark of most people's college experiences (especially in the progressive, predominantly liberal-arts schools where Israeli Apartheid Week takes place) then why do we get so upset when they do the same thing with their ideas as they do with their Bud Light?
	Sure, it creates a hostile environment for Jewish students, but college is a hostile environment for any student denomination, especially if you ask them. My work on college campuses as well as my own, admittedly scant, time studying on them, has shown me time and again that absolutely everybody feels discriminated against; Jewish students think everyone's an anti-Semite, Muslim students complain that everyone thinks they're terrorists, feminist students complain about patriarchy, while white male students complain that the “reverse racism” of affirmative action means they can't get ahead. A good friend of mine is still annoyed by his university's refusal to fund his “Students of Irish Heritage” club.
	"All we needed was $800 for Jameson, a Guinness keg and a dartboard," he told me, "but they denied our right to cultural self-expression."
	The thing is, they are all justified in what they say, except for my Irish friend, who (I hope) is joking, and the white males; they really do have it easy.
	Yes, Jews can have a tough time on campus, and Israeli Apartheid Week is a part of that. Students shouldn't be forced to feel uncomfortable about their ethnic origins and anti-Semitism is, on principle, unacceptable. However, everyone is discriminated against, racism is real, and it's alive and well on college campuses. It's not just aimed at Jews.
	Anyway, if it's that bad, why not just move to Israel? Sure there are quite a lot of wars and some terrorism, and the Iranians might bomb you at any given moment, but I promise you that you won't be made to feel uncomfortable by some ignorant and self-important student during Israeli Apartheid Week.

<title>Planned Upper Nazareth road would allow Jewish residents to avoid driving through Arab town of Kafr Kana </title>
<date>Wed Jul 11 03:52:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	The Transportation Ministry has begun planning a road to connect Upper Nazareth directly with the Golani Junction, so that residents no longer have to drive through the Arab town of Kafr Kana.
	The Upper Nazareth municipality has been trying for some time to persuade the ministry to build the road, which Mayor Shimon Gapso defines as an "existential issue" for the town's primarily Jewish residents. Now the ministry has agreed to have the Israel National Roads Company plan and build the road.
	The Golani Junction is a key intersection on Route 77, a major traffic artery in the Galilee. The new Route 6500 linking it to Upper Nazareth will be built mainly on state lands, but some land will have to be expropriated from Arab residents of the area. Gapso said the new road will not be accessible from Kafr Kana, but insisted its residents will benefit anyway. If Upper Nazareth residents use the new road, "that will reduce traffic in Kafr Kana," he said. The ministry said it hasn't yet decided whether to link the new road to Kafr Kana.
	Route 6500 also has "strategic importance," Gapso said, because Israeli-Palestinian violence frequently prompts demonstrations in Kafr Kana that result in the closure of the existing road. Now, he said, "Upper Nazareth won't be shut in" every time a demonstration occurs. "This isn't a road for Jews," he insisted, but as "the largest Jewish city in the Galilee," Upper Nazareth needs its own link to the rest of the region, he maintained.
	While admitting that the new road would be devastating for Kafr Kana's merchants, Gapso said this was outweighed by the time residents of his city would save. "It takes 20 minutes to drive two kilometers in Kafr Kana, and 30 to 35 minutes on weekends," he said.
	Prof. Rassem Khamaisi of Haifa University, in contrast, said the new road would create a system of "apartheid roads."
	"There will be one road for Jews and another for Arabs," said Khamaisi, past president of the Israel Geographical Society who himself lives in Kafr Kana. He termed the decision "harmful, tension-increasing and racist," but said it was also wrong from a strictly professional standpoint, as it would sever both Upper Nazareth and Kafr Kana from their respective neighbors.
	Kafr Kana currently has 20,000 residents, and is expected to grow to 35,000 by 2025. Its main road, Route 754, is indeed badly overcrowded, as all the region's residents - including Upper Nazareth's 50,000 people - currently use it to get to and from Route 77. During most of the day, it is one long traffic jam.
	Previous plans for solving the problem called for building a ring road around Kafr Kana to which multiple towns in the area would have access. A road that will instead help only one community, Khamaisi said, is "mistaken and outrageous."
	But Gapso said Route 6500 is needed primarily to keep his town from being besieged as it was during the Arab riots of October 2000, when rioters blocked major roads throughout the Galilee and assaulted and seriously wounded a Jewish driver at nearby Beit Rimon Junction.
	In 2010, Gapso noted, demonstrators commemorating the anniversary of those riots blocked Route 754, and some again stoned passing cars. That was when he decided the new road was an "existential issue."
	Ironically, the national road company is currently working on a different plan, Route 786, which would bypass Kafr Kana to the west, instead of to the east, as Route 6500 would. But Khamaisi doesn't like that plan, either. What is needed, he said, is a road to serve "all the region's residents," not one that would come "at Kafr Kana's expense" and could hurt its development.
	The company said it is currently examining nine possible routes for Route 786, which is meant to serve Jewish and Arab residents of the region alike, and is to be guided solely by professional considerations. But it stressed that Route 786 isn't an alternative to Route 6500 - the two serve different functions based on their different locations, it noted.

<title>Stevie Wonder to pull out of IDF fundraiser</title>
<date>Thu Nov 29 08:59:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Stevie Wonder is set to pull out of a performance at a fundraiser for the Israel Defense Forces, a source told JTA. 	Wonder's representatives will claim that he did not know the nature of the group, the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, and that he believes such a performance would be incongruent with his status as a UN "Messenger of Peace," according to a source who has read email exchanges between Wonder's representatives and organizers of the event. 	Wonder was scheduled to headline the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces annual gala in Los Angeles on Dec. 6. The event raises millions of dollars annually to support the Israeli military. 	An official of Friends of the IDF, reached at its Los Angeles office, had no comment. Wonder's agent at Creative Artists Agency did not return a request for comment. 	The spokesman for the UN Secretary General also had no comment on the matter. 	The United Nations does not impose restrictions on its goodwill representatives. Wonder most recently performed at a UN concert commemorating its 67th anniversary. Elie Wiesel, the Nobele Peace Laureate and Holocaust memoirist who is also a staunch defender of Israel is also a UN Messenger of Peace. 	Wonder had come under intense social media pressure to pull out of the event. An online petition calling on him to cancel his performance had garnered more than 3,600 signatures. 	The petition was launched more than a day ago on the change.org website. 	"You were arrested in 1985 protesting South African Apartheid, now we ask you: please remember that apartheid is apartheid, whether it comes from White Afrikaaner settlers of South Africa or from Jewish Israelis in Israel," the petition reads. "Desmond Tutu has recognized that Israel’s Apartheid is worse than South Africa’s -- will you stand with us against apartheid and cancel your performance at the IDF fundraiser." 	A second petition, launched by the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, calls on Wonder to "(p)lease continue your legacy of speaking out for the oppressed. Please be a 'full-time lover' of justice by standing on the right side of history and canceling your performance for the Israeli army." 	Wonder performed at a 1998 gala honoring Israel's 50th anniversary.

<title>U.S. Jews battle apartheid charges made against Israel</title>
<date>Thu Feb 16 03:38:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
This is a busy time in the calendar of an Israeli journalist in the United States. AIPAC and J Street are holding their annual conferences, Washington think tanks are discussing the Arab Spring, Iran and Syria. And then there is the 8th annual Israel Apartheid Week coming up  (February 26 - March 3) with the usual discussions, films and photo exhibitions, flashmobs and an apartheid poster contest offering a $400 dollar prize. For the most part, the pro-Israeli community hasn't yet figured out the best way to deal with this event, and so they opt to ignore it.
But there are a few exceptions. Among those who have chosen to confront the apartheid events are 75 universities across North America  (up from 50 last year) that are holding "the Israel peace week," where they will try to convey the message that "Israel wants peace and has demonstrated its willingness to make painful sacrifices for peace."
"You refer to 'pro-Palestinian activists' but most of those aggressive people are anti-Israel, not pro-Palestinian," says Natalie Menaged, education director of the independent NPO, the Hasbara Fellowships, which trained the Jewish student organizers of the "Israeli peace week."
"I have yet to see them organize a national campaign to teach about Palestinian culture or plans for peace. They are only interested in propagating hatred of Israel. Our campaign, Peace Week, is more pro-Palestinian than anything the anti-Israel organizers are doing because we are actually discussing solutions."
Menaged says the idea of "Israel peace week" - which will run from February 20 to March 9 - is "to engage the people in the middle, not the anti-Israel movement." The campus organizers vary, and in many instances, are a combination of Jewish and non-Jewish students, who developed the concepts of the event on their own. The organization, however, provided them with print materials, films and speakers, if requested. This year's materials include quotes of each Republican candidate, as well as President Obama, regarding their positions on Israel.
Menaged believes that this approach has proved successful. "At places like Berkeley or Rutgers University or Carleton University  (Ottawa ), which have a history of anti-Israel activity, supporters of Israel have been able to change the conversation to one about what needs to be done for peace. And at the majority of schools, which don't have a lot of anti-Israel activity - schools like Boston University, University of Illinois, Ohio State University, Johns Hopkins University - it is an excellent way to start the conversation", she says.

The J Street approach 
J Street executive director Jeremy Ben-Ami has a different approach to Israeli Apartheid Week. When asked what the activists of J Street U, the leftist lobby's campus network, are planning in response, he says: "I think there is more interest in it in media than on college campuses. We condemn it, but there is no purpose in organizing around something that is so marginal. A handful of students attend those Israel apartheid events.
"I think the majority of Jewish students want to support Israel in a way that allows them to ask questions or criticize Israeli or American policy when they feel it's appropriate, but to do it in a context of loving Israel. They don't relate to boycotts," says Ben-Ami. "We have over 750 students this year in our national conference, up from 500 a year ago, and we now have chapters in over 40 college campuses, which is double what we had last year. So we are seeing the formula of pro-Israeli and pro-peace as far more attractive for the Jewish American students than either the hard-line Israel right, or the "Israel is always wrong" approach of folks who organize the Israel apartheid week."
Ben-Ami says he regrets the near absence of talk about the peace process in the presidential campaign. "The U.S. presidential election year is not going to be a year for significant American leadership towards diplomacy and peace. It's J Street's hope that whether President Obama wins the reelection, or someone else wins the election, in 2013 we'll return to a serious discussion of what is actually in the best interest of the U.S. and the Middle East. In the campaign year, this is not a serious discussion. It's a deep shame for Israel and the U.S.
Who's pro-Israel? 
"There are certain Republican candidates", Ben-Ami continues,"Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, some of the others who dropped out, who are using the term 'pro-Israel,' but promoting policies that are clearly not in Israel's long-term interests. Most Israelis would agree that the annexation of the territories, the notion that the Palestinian people don't exist - these are policies that to my mind are simply outside the frame of the debate in Israel," he says. Ben-Ami draws a distinction between candidates like "Newt Gingrich who say the Palestinian people are an invented people" and President Obama who "talks about Israel's survival and long-term security as being dependent on the two-state solution.
"The president is very clearly committed to a two-state solution, and some of the Republicans are essentially abandoning decades of bipartisan American foreign policy, and moving in a completely different direction. I don't include Mitt Romney in that - I didn't hear him saying anything policy-wise on that."
Regarding the Arab Spring, Ben-Ami paraphrases a metaphor used by Ami Ayalon, a former MK, navy commander and Shin Bet security service chief."When you are a captain of the ship, and you see really bad weather rolling in, there is nothing you can do to change the weather. But you are in charge of the course of your ship. So the weather in the Middle East - whether it's the results of the elections in Egypt or Iran or the chaos generally - is not good. But decisions about what the Israeli policy should be, or the American policy should be, are in Israeli hands. And the wise thing for Israel and the U.S. would be to find a long-term peace and long-term acceptance into the region, by working towards diplomatic resolution of the conflict that results in two states. So the circumstances are not good, and the security situation is deteriorating, but this is the time to pursue serious diplomatic efforts with Iran. Military action is not necessarily going to be effective, and it only deepens the conflict."

<title>Wayne Firestone stepping down as CEO of Hillel</title>
<date>Sat Sep 22 15:54:46 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
After seven years as chief executive at Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life, Wayne Firestone will be stepping down from his post in June 2013.
Firestone, who has worked at Hillel for more than a decade and served as its CEO since 2005, spent Thursday and Friday informing the organization’s top board leaders and staffers about his decision to resign as the head of the international campus organization. He took over Hillel after the much-heralded tenure of Richard Joel, who left to become president of Yeshiva University, and Avram Infeld, who guided the organization through the transitional period after Joel's departure.
“The organization is poised to grow to a new scale, in order to accommodate the rapid growth in student participation in the United States that we have driven over the past several years (from 33 percent to 45 percent student involvement from 2005 to 2012, according to a formal study),” Firestone said in a statement to Hillel leaders and staff. “This effort will require strong senior leadership and new financial resources.”
Firestone said he is not sure what he will do next but that he wishes to remain active in Jewish affairs.
In recent years, Firestone has pushed for more programming aimed at Jewish students who don't venture into their campus Hillel buildings, with an emphasis on peer-to-peer outreach, and organizing and supporting activities at other venues.
Firestone’s tenure coincided with the rise of the pro-Palestinian campaign to get universities to divest from Israel and paint its government as an apartheid regime. Arguing that exposure to Israel and Israelis is the most effective response to efforts to demonize the Jewish state, Firestone has attempted to position Hillel as an unapologetic defender of Israel’s democratic character and of Israel's vital importance to the Jewish people. At the same time, he has argued for the need to provide students with space to engage in open and critical dialogue about Israel and Israeli policies, and warned that today’s students would reject efforts to indoctrinate them on how to think about Middle East issues.
Thomas Blumberg, chairman of Hillel's board of directors, praised Firestone’s support for innovative programs, but he said that this moment is an appropriate time for transition.
“By every measure, the innovative peer-to-peer approach he championed has resulted in higher student involvement with Hillel than we have seen in decades, and in many more students seeking to deepen their Jewish identity and skills,” Blumberg said in a statement.
“Wayne led Hillel during a period of extraordinary innovation. Now that much of that innovation has borne fruit, we will - following the roadmap in our recently passed five-year strategic plan - move to a phase of bringing the new engagement approaches to more campuses and students and deepening them where they have already succeeded,” he added.
Edgar Bronfman, a one of Hillel’s leading philanthropic supporters, was also quoted as praising Firestone. “He has led nothing less than a historic transformation,” Bronfman was quoted as saying in the Hillel statement.

<title>Absorption Minister: Ethiopian immigrants should be grateful to Israel</title>
<date>Wed Jan 11 15:44:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Immigration Absorption Minister Sofa Landver responded Wednesday to recent protests against discrimination of Ethiopian immigrants, and said that they should be grateful for what they have received from Israel.
About 2,000 people gathered on Tuesday to demonstrate against racism in Kiryat Malakhi, after members of the Ethiopian immigrant community said that local homeowners' committees refuse to sell them apartments. They were joined by hundreds of people who came from around the country to support them.
Knesset members from various parties gathered with representatives of the Ethiopian community on Wednesday for an emergency discussion on the topic.
After one of the Ethiopian representatives, Gadi Desta, told the MKs that "apartheid" was taking place, Landver said, "You need to be grateful for what you have received."
Earlier, Desta said that he has no complaints against the residents of Kiryat Malachi, but he does against the Knesset members, who he called "hypocritical."
"The gap between Ethiopian immigrants and the rest of the citizens is years apart – but the State of Israel is doing everything to absorb them in the best possible way – be grateful for what you received."
The Coalition Against Racism in Israel, which organized transportation to the Kiryat Malakhi protest from a few locations around the country, partnered with local residents who began planning the demonstration last week, along with organizations representing the Ethiopian community.
"Racism harms us all, and it is impossible to separate the discrimination against Ethiopians in Israel from the discrimination against Arabs or Russian-speakers," said Rabia Elsagir of Shfaram, a coordinator for CARI who came to the protest with a small number of Israeli Arabs.
The Association for Civil Rights in Israel issued a statement condemning discrimination against the Ethiopian community. The organization said the extraordinary session of the Knesset Committee for Immigration, Absorption and Diaspora Affairs convening tomorrow to discuss the issue should put forth legislation prohibiting discrimination in housing.
"The authorities must clearly state that they do not accept displays of racism and discrimination, and are taking clear and decisive steps to eradicate them," ACRI said in the statement. The organization is seeking a legal amendment that would give the Real Estate Registrar the authority to suspend or even cancel the license of a real estate agent who discriminates against clients on the basis of their ethnic origin.
The association said that real estate agencies in Kiryat Malakhi that allegedly engaged in discriminatory practices could face fines of up to NIS 150,600 for violating the law prohibiting discrimination in regard to goods and services.
"I'm tired of hearing all the time about such cases. This time it reached our door so we decided to raise our voices, but we're protesting on behalf of the entire society, not just the Ethiopian community," said Shay Wanda, 31, a captain in the army reserves who has lived in Kiryat Malakhi since 1994.
"It's the first time we young people are joining with the older people and going out together to protest against racism in Israeli society," Wanda said. "I was in the standing army for three years, I lost friends in military operations, and I am part of this country. At the end of the day we all have the same blood - skin color isn't what counts," he said.

<title>French parliament report accuses Israel of water 'apartheid' in West Bank </title>
<date>Tue Jan 17 01:20:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
The French parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee published an unprecedented report two weeks ago accusing Israel of implementing "apartheid" policies in its allocation of water resources in the West Bank.
Want updates on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Join Haaretz.com's official Facebook page
The Israeli Embassy in Paris had no foreknowledge of the report and thus did not refute it or work to moderate it. Foreign Ministry officials called the incident "a serious diplomatic mishap."
The report said that water has become "a weapon serving the new apartheid" and gave examples and statistics that ostensibly back this claim.
"Some 450,000 Israeli settlers on the West Bank use more water than the 2.3 million Palestinians that live there," the report said. "In times of drought, in contravention of international law, the settlers get priority for water."
The author of the report was Socialist Party MP Jean Glavany, who in the past served as agriculture minister under French President Lionel Jospin and as cabinet secretary for President Francois Mitterrand.
The Foreign Affairs Committee had assigned Glavany to report on the geopolitical impact of water in confrontation zones throughout the world. He visited Israel and the Palestinian territories on May 17-19 of last year and met with several senior government officials, including Energy and Water Resources Minister Uzi Landau and Water Commissioner Uri Shani.
Both the Foreign Ministry and the embassy in Paris were aware of the visit and knew that Glavany planned to write a report. But Israeli Ambassador to France Yossi Gal did not follow up on Glavany's work.
No one in the embassy attempted to get a draft copy of the report so as to ensure that its conclusions were not overly harsh. Nor were Israel's allies on the French Foreign Affairs Committee contacted to ascertain whether the report could be moderated.
The embassy only learned about the report a few days after it appeared on the French parliament's website, when the Foreign Ministry's European desk in Jerusalem, which heard about it from an outside source, informed the embassy.
The report states that water is not allocated fairly to West Bank Palestinians and that Palestinians have no access to the territory's underground aquifers. Glavany said Israel was perpetrating a "water occupation" against the Palestinians.
"Israel's territorial expansion is seen as a 'water occupation' of both streams and aquifers," the report said.
It also said that "the separation wall being built by Israel allows it to control access to underground water sources" and to "direct the flow of water westward."
The report accused Israel of "systematically destroying wells that were dug by Palestinians on the West Bank," as well as of deliberately bombing reservoirs in the Gaza Strip in 2008-09. It also claimed that "Many water purification facilities planned by the Palestinian Water Ministry are being 'blocked' by the Israeli administration."
Senior Foreign Ministry officials said the Paris embassy had been asleep at the switch.
"This report is a serious mishap that has caused diplomatic damage and has seriously damaged Israel's image in France," one senior official said.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said Glavany had inserted extreme terms into the report on his own, at the last minute, without consulting other members of the report's working group.
"These unacceptable remarks surprised his colleagues in the working group, who were shocked to find them in the final version after it was published, after Israeli diplomats called their attention to them," Palmor said.
The report, he continued, "was loaded with the language of vicious propaganda, far removed from any professional criticism with which one could argue intelligently." Moreover, the report's author omitted numerous facts and acted "with blatant tendentiousness."
"After embassy staffers pointed out the exceptional seriousness of the wording ... all the working group members disassociated themselves from [the report], including the chairman, who sent an official letter to the ambassador renouncing responsibility for the report's anti-Israel expressions," Palmor added.

<title>If there are no Palestinians, there's no Israeli occupation </title>
<date>Tue Jul 10 02:36:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	The Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits occupying powers from settling their own populations in occupied lands. But that's not a problem for Israel, according to the committee set up by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman to examine construction in the West Bank, because Israel is not a "military occupier" in the territories.
 The panel said it based its finding on the fact that the area was conquered from Jordan, which it said never had a solid legal claim and has since forfeited any interest in the land. In any case, the committee has decided that the Geneva Convention's prohibition is not relevant to Jewish settlement in the West Bank, given the Balfour Declaration and the British Mandate, whose documents referred to a national home for the Jews in Palestine and did not mention any national rights of the Arabs.
	In the eyes of the committee, headed by former Supreme Court Justice Edmond Levy, the West Bank is part of the area meant to serve as the Jewish national home; Israel never committed itself to observing the Geneva Convention in these lands and has allowed Israelis to live there. The reliance on the Balfour Declaration demonstrates that the Netanyahu-appointed committee appears to be living in colonial times, during which Britain had the authority to determine the future of a territory, and isn't aware that nowadays we recognize the rights of peoples to self-determination.
	These declarations, of course, ignore the existence of a Palestinian population in these areas and the fact that when we talk today about the occupation, we are speaking first and foremost about the occupied population, which is being denied its right to self-determination.
	It must be noted that the committee's declarations aren't exactly news. After 1967, Israel took the official position that since the territories had not been captured from a country that was sovereign there, they aren't exactly occupied territory, so the Geneva Convention doesn't apply to them. Moreover, the prohibition against an occupying country transferring its population to an occupied area is irrelevant if people move there of their own accord.
	Still, Israel had not categorically denied is status as occupier, and did agree to take on a different aspect of an occupier's legal obligations, as laid out in the Hague Convention. Practically speaking, the whole legal structure of Israeli control over the territories was based on this differentiation, backed by ostensibly formal arguments that distinguish between the two conventions.
	Thus, since 1967, Israel has been trying to have it both ways. On the one hand, it accepts the authority vested in the army that controls the conquered area, as per the Hague Convention, while on the other hand denying its obligations to the residents of the occupied area and denying their rights as laid out in the Geneva Convention. Thus there was a blurring of the legal status of the territories, as occupied or not occupied, that for all these years has been the heart of the occupation's legal structure.
	The Levy Committee seems to be taking this a step further, in that it says that these territories are not occupied territory at all, in order to reject the argument calling for application of the Geneva Convention. But in doing so, the committee totally ignores the ramifications of such a declaration on the legality of exercising the Israel Defense Forces' authority in the territories, which were based on the Hague Convention.
	In hundreds, if not thousands of rulings made by the High Court of Justice, the court accepted the state's position that the army is permitted to seize Palestinian lands for military purposes (for example, to build the security barrier ), based on the authority of the military commander in an area under belligerent occupation, or, in other words, military occupation.
	The Levy Committee's conclusions, therefore, are very helpful in piercing the veil of legal hypocrisy behind Israeli control in the territories: If it's an occupation, then the whole body of occupation law applies, making all the settlements - and here there is no distinction between "settlements" and "outposts" - illegal. On the other hand, if we're not talking about an occupation, then everything the military commanders have been doing all this time was unauthorized and it must thus return to the Palestinians any and all lands that were seized.
	What is left after the piercing of the veil? The Levy Committee does not give an answer.
	Unlike the committee's conclusions, the territories – as determined by Israel's High Court of Justice and the International Court of Justice – are occupied; however, it is true that for a long time now Israel does not rule them the way occupied territories should be ruled.
	What would you call an occupation where the occupying state inhabits its citizens while exploiting its ground, water and other natural resources? And what would you call a regime where two populations live under different law, applied according to their nationality? If any good could come out of the Levy committee, is the unveiling of the hypocrisy that under the perception of occupation lays a regime which better resembles a combination of colonialism and apartheid.

<title>Israeli parents urge minister to cancel school trips to West Bank</title>
<date>Wed Jan 04 01:28:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Hundreds of parents have signed a petition over the past two days refusing to allow their children to attend school field trips over the Green Line.
The petition, signed by 500 parents as of Tuesday night, was started after Education Minister Gideon Sa'ar announced recently that school trips would now visit the archaeological site of Shiloh in the northern West Bank. Some months ago, Sa'ar made the controversial decision that school children would be taken to visit the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron.
"Your political agenda is clear to us and it should be said in your favor that you do not bother to hide it. But your political positions are different and in fact in opposition to ours and therefore we cannot allow our sons and daughters to take a trip to Hebron, Shiloh or the rest of the sites and settlement beyond the agreed-on borders of Israel," the petition states.
The petition was signed "Concerned Mothers and Fathers throughout the country."
The petition also called on Sa'ar, as "education minister of all Israelis" to "direct school trips to areas that our children can visit. If you do not, our children will be excluded from an important social and educational experience."
Jerusalemite Tamar Verta started the petition. "If we don't inform the school administration that they must plan trips within the Green Line, we will find our children visiting Yitzhar and Havat Ma'on," she said, referring to two Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
One parent, Ehud Inbar of Modi'in, said he did not oppose trips to Hebron and the Tomb of the Patriarchs, "but only after a Palestinian state has been established with which we have a peace treaty. Then the children can visit there the way people visit Egypt or Jordan. I oppose holding trips like this under the current situation where there are citizens 'grade b or c' there."
Inbar also said he would consider changing his mind about the visit to Hebron, "if the Palestinians were at least allowed to present their side. But these trips are not innocent. They are intended to strengthen students' relationship to places that, to me at least, it's clear won't remain under Israeli control."
Rafi Getenyo, a father of two from Rishon Letzion, said he saw two problems with the trips.
"The first is security and the second is moral," he said. "I don't think a face of normalcy should be given to the occupation, and that is after all the intent of the organizers of these trips."
Getenyo said he thought the children were being cynically used for political purposes.
"I don't want my children to be taken on apartheid roads, with a jeep in front and a jeep behind, and for them to feel that this is totally normal," he said, referring to a military escort.
Getenyo said his children understood his position, but did not always agree. He said when other parents allow their children to go "with their eyes shut to institutional reasons, that places a bulldozer of pressure on me. They feel different and they don't like it," he said.

<title>Israeli society is tainted by racism</title>
<date>Fri Jan 20 01:18:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	I hate writing about racism. It is such a heavy and deadening word, though people seem to glibly toss it around. I feel that accusing a person of being a racist, or ascribing racism to entire groups and societies, is such a terrible charge that it does not allow us to carry on a rational debate once it has been made. It just taints everything and everyone, and the moment it is out there, we can't trust ourselves to say or even think freely, lest we be associated and tarred by the same brush.
	We don't think of ourselves or the ones we love as racists. If a friend or family member lets slip an ethnic slur or bigoted remark, we make up some kind of excuse in our mind. It was just a careless utterance, we say to ourselves; she's a bit old-fashioned and not entirely aware of today's sensibilities; he just expressed himself badly, that wasn't actually what he meant.
	Of course we can't be close to a racist. Even when it's not people we personally know, if they resemble us at all - not members of a closed and blinkered community or citizens of some other backward country, but just ordinary people - we don't want to believe they are racists. Racism is a heinous crime, like being a murderer. Only twisted and depraved individuals are capable of it, not people like you and me.
	The very idea that 120 homeowners in Kiryat Malakhi, ordinary mainstream Israelis, signed a secret undertaking not to sell or rent their apartments to Israeli-Ethiopian families - as reported by Channel 2 last week - is so awful that I really want to believe the denials, as faint as they are. A few residents who were prepared to voice crude and vulgar opinions on screen can be explained away as ill-educated misfits, but 120 of them? But the fact remains, not one Israeli-Ethiopian lives in those four new apartment towers, though some have tried to rent there. And this in a town with a sizable Ethiopian community that suffers housing shortages.
	What makes this story even more awful is that, since I can't fathom every one of those 120 owners being racist, I start making excuses for them in my mind. They are not to be blamed for the housing market, after all. Is it their fault that when large numbers of Israeli-Ethiopian families move into a neighborhood, the apartment prices are driven down? After all, these apartments are their main asset: If the value goes down by ten or twenty percent, or even more, is it their responsibility to suffer a severe financial penalty for the cold real-estate realities?
	How many of us can say without hesitation that we would jeopardize our property and fortunes so as not to be part of a racist agreement? Most of us live in neighborhoods where we will not be confronted with that dilemma. But does a racial current running through the property business mean that an entire society is racist? That depends on our definition of a racist. Does remaining silent qualify? What about the fact that hundreds of thousands of middle-class Israelis took to the streets last summer to protest against the tax burden and the high prices, but last week in Kiryat Malakhi only a couple of thousand protestors, mainly Israeli-Ethiopians, turned up. That doesn't make those who marched on Rothschild Boulevard racist, but they did not make the short drive down to support the protest in Kiryat Malakhi.
	Israelis are extremely sensitive to having their society branded as racist. And in many ways that sensitivity is justified. The state was founded by the survivors of the worst racist crime in history, and many of those who arrived from Arab lands were also the victims of a racist forced expulsion. The countries around us are much more sectarian, while many other western societies suffer from similar ills, yet the international media does single Israel out to a disproportionate degree.
	Israel frequently gets called an apartheid state, a comparison that is not only historically erroneous but also counterproductive when used to describe the situation of Israeli Arabs and Palestinians under occupation. Arabs are discriminated in Israel and the Palestinians should have their own state, instead of being occupied, but the racist tendencies on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are symptoms, not root causes. A state for the Jews in the historical land of Israel was a necessary creation and can still be a noble enterprise, not a racist concept.
	But while you can oppose the two-state solution for legitimate and nonracist reasons, discrimination of Israeli-Ethiopians has no political or national basis. It can stem only from racist feelings. And since almost none of us do anything about this, we are all at least tainted by racism.
 Tenuous connection 
	There are different theories and opinions regarding the actual historical connection of the Beta Israel to the Jewish people. From what I have read and seen, I think this was tenuous at best. After covering this issue closely, I don't think the Falashmura still in Ethiopia have any claim to Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return. And on a totally different level, after eating at Ethiopian restaurants in Israel, the United States and Ethiopia, I have to say that it is one of my least favorite cuisines.
	But while these opinions and culinary dislikes are based on my research and personal palate, I write them with trepidation because they resemble racist tropes that you can hear today around Israel. What if I am unwittingly giving succor to racists? And looking within myself, can I be totally certain that I am writing without a gram of racism of my own? It is, after all, a human emotion.
	Israel has adequate legislation against racist discrimination, and occasionally this is implemented effectively. But we must acknowledge that racism is prevalent on a local level - and not only in the low-income areas, where access to education, employment, decent housing and social services is relatively limited and Israeli-Ethiopians lose out to other communities with better connections and more resources. The indifference of ordinary Israelis to this situation may not make them racists themselves. But by hiding our heads in the utopian sand, we are willing accomplices to racism.

<title>Israel Police open probe into alleged racism against Ethiopian immigrants</title>
<date>Wed Jan 11 17:47:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Police have opened an investigation into suspected incitement to racism on the part of local homeowners' committees in Kiryat Malakhi that allegedly refused to rent apartments to members of the Ethiopian immigrant community.
In a letter sent by Attorney General Yehudah Weinstein to Minister Limor Livnat, Weinstein wrote that a police investigation into the alleged racist practices by the committees was opened several days ago.
"A democratic society cannot tolerate expressions of humiliation, resentment or hostility caused by a person's skin color or ethnicity," Weinstein wrote.
On Wednesday morning, Immigration Absorption Minister Sofa Landver responded to recent protests against discrimination against Ethiopian immigrants, and said that they should be grateful for what they have received from Israel.
About 2,000 people gathered on Tuesday to demonstrate against racism in Kiryat Malakhi. They were joined by hundreds of people who came from around the country to support them.
Knesset members from various parties gathered with representatives of the Ethiopian community on Wednesday for an emergency discussion on the topic.
After one of the Ethiopian representatives, Gadi Desta, told the MKs that "apartheid" was taking place, Landver said, "You need to be grateful for what you have received."
Earlier, Desta said that he has no complaints against the residents of Kiryat Malachi, but he does against the Knesset members, who he called "hypocritical."

<title>Jimmy Carter to visit Israel, Egypt</title>
<date>Thu Oct 18 22:18:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	Former United States President Jimmy Carter will travel to Egypt and Israel next week, where he will advocate for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
	A group of past heads of state that advocates for peace called The Elders announced the visit Thursday.
	Its news release says Carter will be joined by former Norway prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and ex-president of Ireland Mary Robinson. The three belong to The Elders.
	Carter wrote the 2006 book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid."
	He said, "Israel's continued control and colonization of Palestinian land have been the primary obstacles to a comprehensive peace agreement in the Middle East."
	This summer, Carter said publicly that U.S. government influence in the Middle East is as weak as it has been since Israel was established as a nation-state in 1948.

<title>Jordan's Abdullah: Israel realizes need to revive Mideast peace talks immediately</title>
<date>Tue Jan 17 09:11:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
The recent parliamentary vote in Egypt proved to Israel that it cannot afford to delay peace talks forever, Jordanian King Abdullah II told the Washington Post late Monday, adding that he was "cautiously optimistic" of the progress achieved in recent low-level talks.
Abdullah's comments came after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was ready to negotiate with the Palestinians immediately and has given the Palestinians a position paper earlier this month containing 21 points on which there is domestic political consensus, as a prelude to potential talks.
"I'm ready to get into my car at any time and go to Ramallah, even if it's more than a small headache for my security guards, but Abu Mazen isn't ready," said Netanyahu, referring to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.
Speaking with the Washington Post following his meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington on Tuesday, Abdullah spoke of "baby steps" taken toward a renewal of direct talks, adding that  he was “cautious about saying that I’m cautiously optimistic.”
According to the Jordanian king, talks between Netanyahu's envoy Yitzhak Molcho and top Palestinian negotiator discussions have been “both good and tough,” and that there was a change sides would "start throwing initial passes at each other” to setup direct talks.
The Jordanian king added that both sides were interested in moving things ahead, citing Egypt's recent parliamentary elections, in which Islamist parties won an overwhelming majority, as a measure against Israeli foot-dragging.
"The more the Israelis play with kicking this down the line, the more they are in danger of losing what they think is the ideal future Israel,” Abdullah told the Washington Post, adding that "waiting is the worst mistake the Israelis can make."
"It wasn’t until the elections in Egypt that suddenly Israel awoke. . . . Now I think there has been a big shift in the way the Israelis look at the issue, and it is imperative for them . . . [to] get the Israeli-Palestinian issue off the menu," Abdullah said.
The Jordanian king warned the two sides of the possible ramifications of missing the chance for peace, saying that if "we haven’t crossed that line, we’ll cross the line sooner or later where the two-state solution is no longer possible, at which point the only solution is the one-state solution."
"And then, are we talking about apartheid or democracy?" Abdullah asked.
Finally, the Jordanian king said he was aware the time was not right for a significant American peace talks push, adding all sides can’t expect for the Americans to wade in, full-weight, unless we have enough of a package where the outcome is somewhat predictable."
On Monday, British Prime Minister David Cameron told the visiting Palestinian Mahmoud Abbas that the United Kingdom would do everything in its power to promote Jordanian-backed efforts to restart the peace process, for which he said time was running out."We think that time, in some ways, is running out for the two-state solution unless we can push forwards now because otherwise the facts on the ground will make it more and more difficult, which is why the settlement issue remains so important," said Cameron.
Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg condemned Israeli settlements Monday as "deliberate vandalism" of efforts to establish a Palestinian state, some of Britain's strongest comments yet on the Israeli-Arab conflict.Israel criticized Clegg's remarks as "gratuitous bashing."

<title>Labor leader snubs Socialist International, leaving Palestinians to dominate </title>
<date>Mon Sep 03 00:46:47 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
 As a founding member of Socialist International, the Israeli Labor party has long been an active player at SI conventions. Those days, however, have passed. Not only did Labor Party leader MK Shelly Yacimovich not send a representative to SI's meeting in South Africa this past weekend, she even instructed former MK Colette Avital not to fly to Cape Town, despite Avital's willingness to cover her own expenses. 
  Because of Labor's absence, Meretz members were the only Israeli representatives at the convention, and could do little to soften a resolution highly critical of Israel's policies. 
  The Socialist International is an organization that unites parties with similar platforms, such as the British Labor Party, the French Socialist Party, the German SPD, and other western social democratic parties. The Cape Town convention was attended by 120 parties from 80 states. 
  A Labor Party source, who asked to remain anonymous due to the political sensitivity involved, told Haaretz that Yacimovich was invited, but, originally had no interest in attending the convention. Following pleas, she changed her mind and decided she would fly to Cape Town after all, only to make another U-turn, opting instead to visit Paris, where she met French President Francois Hollande. 
  Colette Avital, who serves on SI's Middle East committee, said she would fill in for Yacimovich. Avital agreed to help cut party expenses by paying for her own flight. Meanwhile, senior Foreign Ministry officials contacted various Labor officials to emphasize the importance of attending the convention, so that Palestinian and Arab representatives will not dominate. These officials also believed it would be an opportunity for Israeli representatives to meet South African President Jacob Zuma, who has not met with many Israelis recently. This could have been a good chance to ease some of the tension between the two states. 
  But for some as-yet unknown reason, Yacimovich opted to veto Avital's participation a mere 36 hours before her planned flight to South Africa. While in Paris, Yacimovich called Labor Party secretary general Hilik Bar and told him to instruct Avital not to board the plane. 
  Yacimovich's current stance continues a trend that began a decade ago, when the party stopped paying its membership fees to SI, which caused it to be demoted to observer status. Meretz, who opted to continue paying the fees, remains a full-fledged member. 
  In practice, Israel was represented at the convention by former Meretz MK Avshalom Vilan. Vilan said that Fatah's Nabil Sha'ath and Mustafa Barghouti of the Palestinian National Initiative led an extremist line, demanding that the Israeli-Palestinian resolution include the assertion that Israel is an apartheid state. The proposed resolution further supported Palestine's claim to be accepted as a UN member, and called for a boycott of all products of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. 
  "The Palestinians said that their condition in the West Bank is worse than what the blacks suffered under apartheid," Vilan said. "I told the participants that there is settler violence, and there is an occupation against which the Israeli peace camp is battling, but there is no apartheid. I said that categorically, this kind of talk cannot be accepted, even by Meretz people." 
  Vilan appealed to the SI chairman, former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou. "I told him that they're shooting themselves in the foot, and that we will leave the convention if the word apartheid is mentioned in the resolution." Since all decisions must be accepted unanimously, Papandreou began searching for a compromise. Eventually, the term was dropped, but the Palestinians insisted that the call to boycott settlement products remain in the resolution. 
 Vilan said the Labor Party abandoned the political arena. "Prime ministers and foreign secretaries arrived from all over the world, and they all asked me: 'Where is the [Israeli] Labor Party?'" 
  Foreign affairs, settlements and Palestinian-related issues are notably Yacimovich's weak point. She has almost no international experience, and shows little interest in these issues. Labor sources say she avoids meeting vising foreign officials and prefers to concentrate on social and economical issues. 
 Yacimovich's trip to Paris, held 10 days ago, was her first political meeting abroad. She prepared for it secretly, as if it was a military operation. Most of her party's MKs first heard about the meeting with Hollande in Paris when it was reported in the media. 
  Secretary general Bar denies that international affairs are foreign to Yacimovich. He said the Labor Party attaches immense importance to SI, and that Yacimovich has ordered that the party begin to repay past debts, to regain full membership status. He said that she "returned from an important convention of the French Socialist Party, and that in the near future, she will fly to Brussels, where she will meet senior officials from throughout the world. He also pointed to meetings she's had with Australian politicians and the chairman of the German SPD, Sigmar Gabriel." Hilik said Labor's absence from the convention was part of an attempt to cut costs.

<title>Landver: You should thank the state, not complain about it </title>
<date>Thu Jan 12 01:03:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Ethiopian immigrants should be grateful to the state for what it has given them instead of complaining, Immigrant Absorption Minister Sofa Landver told the Knesset Immigration Committee yesterday.
"The gap between people of Ethiopian origin and other Israelis is a gap measured in years, but the State of Israel has done everything to absorb them in the best possible manner," she said. "So say thank you for what you have received."
"In 2010, my ministry gave NIS 1 million for the needs of the Ethiopian community," she added.
Gadi Yeverkin, head of an advocacy organization for Ethiopian immigrants, accused the Knesset of hypocrisy: MKs lined up to denounce Haredi  (ultra-Orthodox ) discrimination against women, but "you've developed apartheid here, and no Knesset member has condemned that."
MK Moshe Gafni of the Haredi United Torah Judaism party responded: "I wish I were Ethiopian. If I were, I'd at least get some defense here. They attacked the Haredim for weeks in the media; did anyone convene a [Knesset] committee for them? Or utter a peep on their behalf?"
"We all condemn racism," Landver added.

 Authors from abroad are being asked to boycott an Israeli writers festival in May so as not to "partake in celebrating apartheid Jerusalem." The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel appealed on Saturday to nine confirmed participants in the Third International Writers Festival, scheduled to take place May 13-17 in the Mishkenot Sha'ananim conference center in Jerusalem. Mishekenot Sha'ananim director general Uri Dromi yesterday called for separating literature from politics and confirmed that some participants have told him they are being pressured to back out.

 About 20 social activists were removed from the audience of the Israeli version of "Big Brother" this week after interrupting a live broadcast. The protesters shouted "The people demand social justice" and other slogans, and waved signs reading "Social revolt." Many audience members joined in during the Sunday afternoon disturbance, but within a minute the protesters were hustled away by security guards and the broadcast went to a commercial break. Show producers said afterward that they were informed in advance of the protest plans and had set aside a place for them at a distance from the studio itself. They said the protesters were removed without violence.  (Emilie Grunzweig ) 
 Local filmmaker Avigail Sperber  ("The Hangman" ) will direct a new documentary series about the very varied worlds of her Orthodox parents and their 10 children, and her upbringing in the Old City of Jerusalem. Sperber is the founder of the religious lesbian organization Bat Kol, and her siblings include a settler, a sister who left Israel, a brother who left Orthodox Judaism and an adopted sister who is in prison. Their parents are Rabbi Daniel Sperber, a recipient of the Israel Prize in Talmud Studies, and Phyllis  (Hannah ) Magnus, a couples therapist originally from Highland Park, Illinois.

 Artist Gilad Ratman has been selected to represent Israel in the 2012 Venice Biennale, Haaretz has learned, in advance of the official announcement by The Culture and Sports Ministry. Ratman, who was born in 1975, will be one of the youngest artists to represent Israel at the prestigious event. He creates site-specific installation and video pieces that address social issues and the need for community. He has participated in dozens of group shows at venues such as MoMA PS1 in New York and Moscow's Garage Center for Contemporary Culture, and has received several prestigious Israeli awards.

 The first Israeli ambassador named to Egypt since Hosni Mubarak was toppled a year ago officially took office in Cairo yesterday, an Israeli official said, in a step suggesting continued normal ties between the two countries. The envoy, Yaacov Amitai, was named last year to replace Yitzhak Levanon, who left the Egyptian capital in September when rioters stormed the Israeli embassy in protest of a deadly border shooting incident. The Foreign Ministry said the Israeli national anthem was played at a Cairo ceremony at which Amitai met Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, head of the military council ruling Egypt.  (Reuters )  
 Thai police said yesterday they were questioning another Iranian in connection with explosions in Bangkok this month that have been linked to an attack on the wife of an Israeli diplomat in India. Iran has denied involvement but Israel has said the Quds Force, a covert arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, was behind the bombings. Thai immigration police told Reuters that Madani Seyed Mehrded, 33, had been arrested and was being questioned for links to the bombing. Police told Thai media they had discovered call logs showing Mehrded regularly communicating with two of the other suspects, both Iranian: Saeid Moradi, who lost his legs on February 14 when a bomb he was carrying exploded in Bangkok, and Mohammed Khazaei, who was arrested at Bangkok's main airport. Police also said Mehrded had been waiting in front of the building housing the Israeli embassy on the day of the blasts.  (Reuters )

 Record numbers tune in for swan song of Channel 10 anchorman
	Channel 10 anchorman Yaakov Eilon’s final broadcast set a viewing record on Sunday, with 750,000 people tuning in for his farewell appearance on the evening news. The figure represents a record for a news program − 17.3% of TV viewers watched Eilon, the largest share ever recorded by a news broadcast in Israel. Eilon anchored Channel 10’s news program for a decade, since the channel originally went on the air. Eilon’s former Channel 10 partner, Mickey Haimovich, had held the ratings record for a news presenter − her final broadcast, last June, snagged a 16.1% rating. (Gili Izikovich)

 Irish folk music group Dervish pulls out of concerts in Israel
	The popular Irish folk music group Dervish has canceled three performances scheduled for Jerusalem at the end of June. The producers said the show was canceled due to “an organized and venomous online campaign” in the past week by anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian activists in Ireland, urging the group to cancel concerts in “the apartheid state of Israel.” Dervish said in a statement on its Facebook page, “At the time we agreed to these performances, we were unaware there was a cultural boycott in place. We now feel we do not wish to break this boycott.” The producers said the group was also pressured by Irish musicians not to perform in Israel. ‏(Uri Zer Aviv‏)
 Bahrain orders retrial for hunger striker, protest leaders 
	A Bahraini court has ordered a retrial for jailed hunger striker Abdulhadi al-Khawaja and 20 other men convicted of leading an uprising last year, but an opposition leader said the gesture was not enough to defuse resurgent unrest. The turmoil threatens the stability of Bahrain, an ally of Saudi Arabia and the United States in their stand-off with Iran, and sparked Saudi calls for a union of oil-exporting Gulf Arab states to keep Tehran and regional protest movements at bay. Khawaja has been refusing food for nearly three months and is at risk of dying, according to his family. (Reuters )
 Bomb hits police convoy in eastern Nigeria, kills 11 
	A bomb blast struck a police chief's convoy in eastern Nigeria on Monday, killing 11 people, a witness and an official said, a day after attacks in other areas killed at least 19. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing in the town of Jalingo but Islamist sect Boko Haram, which wants to carve an Islamic state out of Nigeria, has been blamed for many such previous attacks. A string of bombings and shootings in the last five days has dampened hopes that arrests and killings of Boko Haram members by the military in recent weeks had stemmed its ability to carry out large-scale attacks in Africa's largest oil producer.

 Suu Kyi's party ends boycott of Burma's parliament 
	Burma's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi agreed on Monday to end her party's boycott of parliament, setting aside her first major dispute with the government since winning by-elections and clearing the way for what could be an acceleration of reforms. Suu Kyi and her party will make their historic debut in the assembly tomorrow backing down over the wording of an oath for new members of parliament. She agreed to swear to protect a constitution drafted under military control that she says is undemocratic and needs to be amended. (Reuters)

<title>November sweeps? How Roseanne Barr could sway the U.S. election</title>
<date>Sun Nov 04 01:34:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
	On October 23, the day after the foreign policy debate between President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and Mitt Romney, a Republican, an additional debate between the candidates for the presidency of the United States was held in Chicago. The participants were four candidates from smaller and less well-known parties, none of which has enough support to get into the White House.
	"These people deserve a lot of credit," said the moderator of the debate, veteran broadcaster Larry King. "They're the ones coming forward. It's easy to sit back and watch. These people stand up. They may not be counted on November 6, but they're counting today, and they deserve to be heard." The four candidates have divergent worldviews, but throughout the debate they agreed on one thing - the United States needs an alternative to Obama and Romney.
	The presidential election is not determined by the popular vote. Instead, there is an Electoral College process whereby the candidate who receives the most votes in a given state wins all its electors. This has led to the establishment of a system of two large parties - Democratic and Republican. representatives of third parties for the most part do not manage to present their candidacy in all the states. However, they are able to bring to the agenda issues the major parties ignore, and are sometimes able to tilt the outcome of an election in states where the race is particularly close. That was the case in 2000, when modest support for Green Party candidate Ralph Nader eroded support for Democrat Al Gore, assuring George W. Bush's victory. In Florida, where Nader won 97,000 votes, Gore lost to Bush by a mere 537 votes, leading some to say that this is what determined the national election.
	The best-remembered candidate in recent years who did not belong to either of the big parties was Ross Perot, who ran as an independent in 1992, and managed to win 19 percent of the popular vote - largely because of his money - but not a single elector.
 Johnson: Progressive social agenda, spendthrift economic platform
	The candidate who is causing the biggest headache for the Republican Party is Libertarian Gary Johnson, who won loud applause at the Chicago debate.
	Johnson, 60, served two terms as governor of New Mexico, during the course of which he vetoed 750 pieces of legislation, a national record, and left his state with a surplus of $1 billion. He ran initially in the Republican primaries and participated in two of the party's debates, but moved to the Libertarian Party after failing to garner enough support. Johnson supports cuts in taxes and government expenditures. According to him, "The biggest threat to our national security is the fact that we're bankrupt. He is opposed to American involvement in international conflicts - including the possibility of an attack on Iran - and he has called for the cessation of aid to foreign countries. Johnson promised that if he were elected he would cut military spending by 43 percent.
	He is a veteran supporter of the legalization of marijuana, pro-choice with respect to abortions, and in favor of gay marriage (he notes that the issue has to be resolved at the national level and attacked Obama for having passed this question along to the states ). Johnson also attacked the economic program of Romney and his candidate for vice president, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.
	"When Romney says we need to balance the federal budget but also need to spend money on military and hold Medicare in check, that doesn't add up," he said in an interview to Politico. "You can't balance the budget without cutting both."
	A CNN poll at the beginning of October gave Johnson 4 percent support among Americans who are expected to vote - and in some states it was as high as 6 percent. In recent weeks, it has been increasingly suggested that he might cause a "Ralph Nader effect" - especially in Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire.
	In poll conducted on October 14 by Suffolk University in New Hampshire, Johnson won 2 percent support - with Romney and Obama each at 47 percent. Another poll by Public Policy Polling in Nevada toward the end of October gave 3 percent to Johnson in that state, where Obama is ahead by 49 percent to Romney's 47 percent. In such a close race, 3 percent could be crucial. And indeed, in Pennsylvania, the Republicans have gone to court with the claim that 40 percent of the signatures he obtained were forged or duplicates.
	A press release issued by the Republican Party in Pennsylvania claimed that not only were the Libertarian Party's papers riddled with errors, duplicate signatures and blatant fraud, they raise concerns that President Obama and the Democratic Party are trying to add more candidates to the ballot because they know the vast majority of voters are looking for a new direction."
	Ultimately, Johnson is running in every state except Oklahoma and Michigan, where it will nevertheless be possible to vote for him even though his name is not on the ballot, because he submitted his candidacy forms three minutes late.
 Stein: End Israeli apartheid; create a green White House, cut defense spending in half
	A CNN poll at the beginning of September found that the small party candidates are more damaging to Romney than to Obama. The poll (which was conducted before the presidential debates ) gave Obama 52 percent of the vote and Romney 46 percent if they were the only candidates whose names are on the ballot.
	However, when the possibility of voting for Johnson or for Jill Stein's Green Party was added, support for Romney plummeted to 43 percent while Obama lost only 1 percent. Last week, pollster Scott Rasmussen told CNN that if the race is close enough, even 100 votes could be significant. This year, Dr. Jill Stein, a 62-year old Jewish doctor, tops the Green Party ticket, which ran Ralph Nader in 2000. A CNN poll from the beginning of October pegged support for her at 3 percent. Among her supporters are controversial linguist Noam Chomsky, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges. Stein will have her name on the ballot in 38 states, and it will be possible to vote for her in nine more.
	"We are all realizing that we, the people, have to take charge because the political parties that are serving the top 1 percent are not going to solve the problems that the rest of us face, we need people in Washington who will refuse to be bought by lobbyists and for whom change is not just a slogan," said Stein last year at the press conference launching her campaign.
	She and her candidate for vice president were arrested on October 6 outside Hofstra University, where the second debate between Obama and Romney took place, protesting against the absence of small-party candidates from the official debates (as of 2000, only candidates who have more than 15 percent support in national polls are able to participate in debates ). Stein ran against Romney in the race for governor of Massachusetts in 2002. She is calling for implementation of a "green New Deal," a plan that would create 25 million new jobs, along with the establishment of more environmental communities encouraging use of green energy and relying on local organic agriculture. She is also calling for cutting half the military budget and using the money to support free higher education. On her Internet site, Stein writes that the American government must take more meaningful steps to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She proposes conditioning future financial aid to Israel or the Palestinian authority on maintaining human rights, and supports the imposition of sanctions if these are violated. She calls for "an end to the discriminatory apartheid policies within the state of Israel, the removal of the Separation Wall, a ban on assassination, movement toward denuclearization, the release of all political prisoners and journalists from Israeli and Palestinian prisons, disarmament of non-state militias, and recognition of the right of self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians." According to her, "In this way, U.S. policy will begin to become consistent with its practices regarding other violators of human rights and international law in the region."
 Goode: No campaign contributions above $200; Anderson - opposes the Electoral College
	Another candidate who could be damaging to Mitt Romney is Virgil Goode, 66, running on the conservative Constitution Party ticket, who defines himself as a representative of the "ordinary people." He represented the 6th District of Virginia in the Unites States House of Representatives from 1997 to 2009 - first as a Democrat and later as a Republican. He says that Washington is ruled by the elite and big money - and has refused to accept contributions from political action committees or from individuals of more than $200.
	Goode's platform includes the immediate balancing of the budget and a total stop to immigration to the United States until such time as unemployment falls below 5 percent. The Republicans' big anxiety is that Goode will affect the results of the elections in his home state of Virginia, where he might win 1 to 2 percent of the votes, while most polls are predicating that the two mainstream candidates are neck in neck or a slight lead for Obama. The Republicans tried to disqualify Goode's candidacy in Virginia, but unsuccessfully. Goode's name will be on the ballot in 26 states and it wil be possible to vote for him in 10 others.
	The mayor of Salt Lake City from 2000 to 2008, former Democrat Rocky Anderson, is also running for president on the ticket of the Justice Party he founded a year ago. In the past he was an active human rights lawyer and a supporter of the Occupy Wall Street movement, and he is considered a vehement opponent of the American electoral system, which he says leads to too much involvement of economic considerations in Washington. He is calling for universal health insurance and believes that global warming is the greatest danger to humanity. According to Goode, American politicians are avoiding taking action in favor of a transition to green energy because of their indebtedness to the tycoons. "Our government is run by and for the benefit of monstrous corporations rather than in the interests of the people of this country," he said in the Chicago debate. "Obama and Romney have refused to discuss the corrupting influence of money, flowing from Wall Street banks, from the insurance companies, pharmaceutical industries or military contractors because they are the recipients of that corrupting money."
	And there are more than 10 other candidates for the presidency from very small parties for whom it will be possible to vote in a few states. The best-known of these candidates is television star Roseanne Barr, who did not get the Green Party nomination she wanted and is running as the nominee of the Peace and Freedom Party. There is also the American Independent Party founded 40 years ago, which is running Thomas Hoefling of Iowa, and there is the Party for Socialism and Liberation, which is running the youngest candidate in the race - 28-year-old Peta Lindsay, who, even if she were to win, would not be able to serve as president because the Constitution of the United States requires a minimum age of 35 for the position.

<title>Obama promises to consult Jordan on Israeli-Palestinian peace talk issues </title>
<date>Wed Jan 18 02:32:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
The United States will consult closely with Jordan to encourage Israel and the Palestinians to negotiate in a "serious fashion" to find peace, U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday.
Speaking in the Oval Office alongside Jordan's King Abdullah II, Obama said he appreciated Jordan's leadership on the stalled peace effort.
After the meeting Abdullah told reporters the talks were in their early stages and that "we have to keep our fingers crossed." Abdullah told the Washington Post in an interview that, because of the elections in the United States, "we can't expect for the Americans to wade in, full-weight, unless we have enough of a package where the outcome is somewhat predictable."
Abdullah also said that "the presidential card can only be played once, and we are nowhere near the position at this stage where the presidential card can be played. It is up to us to do the heavy lifting, not the president."
With regard to progress on the first three meetings that have been held since early January in Amman, Abdullah reported there had been "baby steps."
"Waiting is the worst mistake the Israelis can make. It wasn't until the elections in Egypt that suddenly Israel awoke ... Now I think there has been a big shift in the way the Israelis look at the issue, and it is imperative for them [to] get the Israeli-Palestinian issue off the menu."
Abdullah said that sooner or later a line would be crossed where the two-state solution is no longer possible - if it has not been crossed already, "at which point the only solution is the one-state solution. And then, are we talking about apartheid or democracy? The more the Israelis play with kicking this down the line, the more they are in danger of losing what they think is the ideal future Israel," the king said.
The next meeting between the parties is scheduled for January 25. Although the Quartet has set January 26 as the deadline for the presentation of concrete proposals on issues like borders and security, sources in the U.S. State Department said that focusing on the deadline will only sabotage the atmosphere of the talks and that what is important is that the parties are talking directly to each other.
Abdullah said in the short term the Jordanians were trying to get the Palestinians and Israelis to talk about security and borders, and added, "I think once you've defined the issue of borders, then you've solved the issue of settlements, and you can go straight into security talks."
Abdullah is scheduled to meet Wednesday with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Meanwhile, two issues are causing some tension in relations between Israel and the United States. Officials in Israel said they were unhappy with American leaks ahead of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman's expected visit in early February that some senior U.S. administration officials did not want to be photographed with Lieberman. "That is not an insult to Lieberman, it is an insult to Israel," an Israeli official said. Washington did not respond officially to reports from Israel but noted that arrangements such as joint photos were made shortly before meetings and that the visit was still under preparation.
The second issue was with regard to who specifically had canceled the joint U.S.-Israeli military exercise that was to have been the biggest in the history of ties between the two countries. The Israelis say the Americans canceled it, while according to The Atlantic Magazine, sources in the U.S. administration said Defense Minister Ehud Barak had called Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and asked to cancel the exercise, which worried the Americans as it could appear to the Iranians to signal preparations for an attack on Iran.
The Israeli Embassy responded that a joint decision was made to postpone the exercise to the latter part of this year. "The decision, taken jointly by the European Command (EUCOM) and by the IDF, stemmed solely from technical issues," Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren said in a statement Monday, adding, "Such postponements are routine and do not reflect political or strategic concerns."
"The United States and Israel remain committed to holding the exercise - code-named Austere Challenge 12 - the largest and most robust in their historic alliance," he said.

<title>Palestinians: Peace talks require halt to Israeli settlement construction </title>
<date>Mon Jan 02 13:09:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Monday that he believes his meeting with Israeli envoy Yitzhak Molcho on Tuesday will only bear fruit if Israel agrees to halt settlement construction.
Erekat and Molcho are set to meet in Jordan on Tuesday in a bid to get peace talks restarted. Negotiations have been stalled since September 2010.
Erekat told reporters in the West Bank on Monday that he does not expect any breakthroughs unless Israel agrees to halt settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. He also said Israel must accept its 1967 lines as the basis for a future border.

Israel took control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Six Day War. Israel rejects the Palestinian demands and says peace talks should resume without preconditions.
The meeting in Jordan comes as the Palestinians are preparing a diplomatic campaign that aims to put Israel under "a real international siege."
The diplomatic offensive the Palestinians are planning to launch later this month could include pushing the UN Security Council to pass a resolution condemning settlement construction and urging the International Criminal Court to try Israel for war crimes related to its 2008-2009 incursion into the Gaza Strip.
2012 "will be the start of an unprecedented diplomatic campaign on the part of the Palestinian leadership, and it will be a year of pressure on Israel that will put it under a real international siege," said Fatah Central Committee member Nabil Sha'ath, according to an Israeli Foreign Ministry document. "The campaign will be similar to the one waged against apartheid in South Africa."

<title>Palestinians plan diplomatic steps to put Israel under 'international siege'</title>
<date>Mon Jan 02 00:46:00 IST 2012</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's envoy Isaac Molho will meet with top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in Amman Tuesday for preliminary talks aimed at setting an agenda for peace negotiations, even as the Palestinians are preparing a diplomatic campaign that aims to put Israel under "a real international siege."
Among those who have been pushing hard for the meeting Tuesday, the first official meeting between Israeli and Palestinian representatives in several months, are Jordan's King Abdullah and Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh and the Quartet's Mideast envoy, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Senior Israeli officials said there was very little chance that the meeting would lead to the renewal of negotiations.
The diplomatic offensive the Palestinians are planning to launch later this month could include pushing the UN Security Council to pass a resolution condemning settlement construction and urging the International Criminal Court to try Israel for war crimes related to its 2008-2009 incursion into the Gaza Strip.
2012 "will be the start of an unprecedented diplomatic campaign on the part of the Palestinian leadership, and it will be a year of pressure on Israel that will put it under a real international siege," said Fatah Central Committee member Nabil Sha'ath, according to an Israeli Foreign Ministry document. "The campaign will be similar to the one waged against apartheid in South Africa."
According to information that has reached Israel, the Palestinians are considering several steps as part of their campaign:
* Asking the UN Security Council in February to pass a resolution that would condemn settlement construction and impose international sanctions on Israel. If a resolution were brought to a vote, all Security Council members other than the United States would be expected to vote in favor.
* Urging the International Criminal Court in The Hague to try Israel for war crimes related to Operation Cast Lead. If that fails, Palestinian officials are likely to encourage Palestinian citizens to file lawsuits against Israel in Western courts.
* Pushing for the implementation the articles of the Fourth Geneva Convention that ban the construction of communities and transfer of populations in occupied territory. The Palestinians have been trying for some time now to persuade the Swiss government to convene the signatories on the document for a special debate on the subject of applying the Geneva Convention in the West Bank.
* Asking the UN General Assembly or the UN Human Rights Council to send an international fact-finding committee to look into the settlement issue.
* Renewing efforts in the UN Security Council to secure full-membership status for Palestine, or asking the UN General Assembly for status as a nonmember state. A similar move was suspended last October after UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural agency, accepted Palestine as a member, in response to which Israel froze Palestinian tax revenues.
* Organizing mass rallies against Israel in the West Bank, as part of a non-violent popular uprising. In reconciliation talks between Hamas and Fatah, the head of the Hamas political bureau, Khaled Meshal, said the two movements would focus their activities on a popular uprising in an effort to draw international attention to the Israeli occupation.
The diplomatic campaign is expected to begin January 26, which marks the end of the three-month period the Quartet alloted to Israel and the Palestinian Authority for resuming talks and presenting substantive proposals on borders and security arrangements.
The Palestinians agreed not to take any unilateral steps in international forums before that date.
No breakthrough in Israeli-Palestinian talks is expected before then, according to an Israeli source who met recently with several senior Palestinian officials.
In an interview Saturday with Palestinian television, PA President Mahmoud Abbas said that if the Quartet failed in its efforts to renew talks between Israel and the Palestinians before January 26, "all options will be open" as far as the Palestinian Authority is concerned.
Speaking about tomorrow's meeting between Molho and Erekat, senior Israeli officials said there is a deep mistrust on both sides and that the Israelis and Palestinians are each trying to convince the Quartet to hold the other side responsible for the failure to resume peace talks.
The meeting does not mark the resumption of negotiations, just a run-up to them that involves deciding on the agenda for future peace talks and the principles on which they would be based.
"We're talking about negotiations on holding negotiations," said a senior Israeli source.
Blair and Judeh will sit in on the first part of tomorrow's meeting between Molho and Erekat, as will representatives of all the parties that make up the Quartet: the United States, United Nations, Russia and the European Union. In the second part of the meeting, Judeh will hold discussions with Molho and Erekat.
In a statement from the Prime Minister's Bureau, Israel thanked Abdullah and Judeh "for their initiative in convening the sides in keeping with the Quartet guidelines."

<title>Pro-Palestinian protests mar Israel celebration in Melbourne</title>
<date>Thu Jun 07 16:31:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	SYDNEY, Australia (JTA) – A crowd of angry pro-Palestinian demonstrators in Melbourne marred the annual celebration of Israel's independence.
	Attendees at Tuesday night's high-profile gathering of politicians, diplomats, bureaucrats and Jewish leaders were forced to walk past the 100-strong crowd who were held back by police, the Australian Jewish News reported.
	Among the banners brandished by the protesters were "Israel – an apartheid state" and "Free Palestine." At one point the protesters burned an effigy of Victorian Premier Ted Baillieu.
	Inside the hotel, Victoria's leader defended the protesters' right to express their views, but retorted by saying: "The wonderful thing in this country is that you can have your view. The even better thing is I can stand here and say, 'You're wrong'."
	BDS, an acronym for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign, should be re-named "Bigoted, Dangerous and Shameful," the newspaper quoted Baillieu as saying.
	His counterpart, Labor's Daniel Andrews, said of the protests outside: "If we have to come through those scenes again [next year], then we'll all do it with pride."
	In his address, Israeli Ambassador Yuval Rotem offered an olive branch to the Palestinians: "We want to live with you and not die with you," he said. "We want to respect you as good neighbors and not fear you as a dreaded enemy."

<title>Soccer / Euro Women / Anti-Israel protesters ejected from Wales match </title>
<date>Thu Jun 21 06:24:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	The Israeli women's soccer team played its Welsh counterpart last night amid protests from both pro-Palestinian and Zionist activists. Wales beat Israel 5-0 in the Group 4 Euro Women qualification match held at the Racecourse Stadium in Wrexham, Wales.
	Several activists were ejected from the stadium, and many were not allowed to enter at all, Liam Randall, a local journalist, told Haaretz, based on information he gathered on the ground.
	The protest was part of an ongoing campaign by pro-Palestinian groups against Israel's hosting next year of the UEFA under-21s tournament - protesters also demonstrated at the Israel-Scotland match on Saturday night.
	Demonstrators, including the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, have been protesting claims that Palestinian athletes and teams from the West Bank and Gaza Strip are not granted visas by Israel. They also drew attention last night to the plight of Palestinian soccer player Mahmoud Sarsak, who has been detained in Israel without charge or trial. Israeli authorities say Sarsak, who has been on a hunger strike since March 19, will be released next month.
	The Zionist Central Council of Manchester also called on Israel's supporters to rally in a counter-demonstration outside the game, sending a bus full of activists to the event. The council urged supporters "to head to the Racecourse 'with Israeli flags to show your support for the Israeli women's football team,'" and to "'send the Palestine Solidarity Campaign a message that Israel is not an apartheid country, but rather a country that has brought major advancements in technology and health care to the rest of the world,'" the local website Wrexham.com reported.
 Better than in Scotland 
	Diana Redman, a member of Israel's soccer team, told Haaretz last night: "They did a great job of not letting in anyone that was related to the protest, and if anyone tried to pull out a flag or start chanting they were immediately thrown out of the stadium. Much better than Scotland. As a player, I really appreciate the effort by the Welsh organization."
	There have been warnings that Israeli participants in next month's London Olympics will face protests and potential disturbances. However, embassy officials this week said that security arrangements around the Olympic village and the games would not allow for any disruption whatsoever.
	A spokesman for the Israeli embassy in London said: "It is shocking that in the homeland of football, there are those whose hatred for the Jewish state is greater than the love for the game. On the eve of the Olympic games, every sports fan should condemn deluded protests against guest athletes."

<title>The man who turned opportunism into an art form</title>
<date>Tue Jul 24 03:35:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Tzachi Hanegbi, who is leading an exodus of Kadima MKs to Likud, has been working overtime the last few years to get rid of his image as the hooligan of Israeli politics. On his slick website, he wrote that his experience, the positions he filled and the wisdom that comes with age contributed to the changes he has undergone since his days as the "vocal student protester on top of the monument in Yamit railing against the government's decision to evacuate the communities in the Sinai." Indeed, Tzachi has adopted a quiet manner of speech and a broad smile. He dropped the extreme right-wing talk he learned from his mother, Geula Cohen, and replaced it with a song of praise for peace.
	In exchange for the big prize he had been given as an opposition Kadima MK - the chairmanship of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee - Hanegbi adopted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's version of events according to which President Mahmoud Abbas is the one sabotaging the peace negotiations. "Abu Mazen's [Abbas'] rejectionism is surprising," Hanegbi said on the London and Kirshenbaum program in February 2010. His removal from the committee chairmanship and ejection from the Knesset following a conviction for giving false testimony turned Hanegbi into the new hero of the Zionist left. Together with the opposition leader at the time, Tzipi Livni, he advocated a permanent arrangement with the Palestinians, urging Netanyahu to include Kadima in the government and entrust the negotiations to Livni.
	Last August, Hanegbi went all the way to the University of Pittsburgh to attend a closed meeting with Palestinian activists. He sat next to diehard leftists, including former cabinet minister Ophir Pines, Brig. Gen. (res. ) Yisraela Oron (from the Geneva Initiative ) and Boaz Karni (from the Economic Cooperation Fund, established by Yossi Beilin ), in sessions on a permanent arrangement based on the 1967 borders and the division of Jerusalem.
	In November 2011, Hanegbi went with Livni to Amman to meet and be photographed with Abbas (and here it should be noted that outgoing opposition leader Shelly Yacimovich did not ask to meet with the Palestinian leader ). Suddenly, Netanyahu became for Hanegbi someone who opposes negotiations; in an article published in The Jerusalem Post in May in response to the uproar sparked by Yuval Diskin three months ago, Hanegbi wrote that the Shin Bet head was right - that the government has no interest in talking to the Palestinians and that if Israel does not try to promote dialogue with the pragmatic camp headed by Abu Mazen, the alternatives will be a lot worse.
	The problem is not that Hanegbi is jumping from the ranks of one party into the government of its rival. A politician, just like anyone else, can change his outlook and adopt a new one and join a party that reflects this. The problem is that the outlook remains where it was and only the backside changes places. The other problem is that Hanegbi is not alone. The diplomatic-security cabinet has for the last three years included two ministers whose ideologies are totally unconnected to the government's policies (or lack thereof ). Ehud Barak said in 1999 that if we continue holding onto the territories and allow the Palestinians to vote, Israel will turn into a binational state. He said in 2010 that if we do not allow them to vote, it will be an apartheid state. What has changed since then?
	Dan Meridor said a decade ago that of all the questions - security, economic policy and others - the demographic-democratic issue is the imminent threat we will be unable to evade. What has changed since then?
	And what has changed since spring, when Hanegbi argued that Netanyahu has no interest in conducting negotiations with the Palestinians?
	Ron Prosor, Israel's ambassador to the UN, will have to take time away in the coming months from his much-covered campaign against the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA ), which dares expose Israel's actions in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority leadership is determined to ask the UN General Assembly to upgrade the status of Palestine. The only question is whether to do this before the U.S. elections or on a symbolic date - November 27, the 65th anniversary of the UN vote on partition. As a prelude to the storm, the UN Committee Against Torture recently presented Israel with a list of 57 incidents involving suspected violations of the international Convention Against Torture.
	Thirty-seven of the questions asked of Israel were raised in the joint report presented to the UN committee by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, Adalah - the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and Physicians for Human Rights in Israel (New Israel Fund, get ready to be attacked ).
	The report of the Israeli organizations presents a harsh picture of the policy of torture, abuse and humiliating treatment in security interrogations, at detention facilities and in the occupied territories in general, which include arrests without trial; difficult incarceration conditions; trials based on improperly submitted evidence; granting of immunity to interrogators; and no investigation or review of complaints about torture.
	The UN committee is asking for information on several Palestinian detainees who have been questioned since 2002 under the "ticking bomb" designation; there have been some 700 complaints of abuse during Shin Bet questioning. The committee noted that even though Israel is among about 150 countries that have signed the Convention Against Torture, and committed to take every possible step to prevent torture from taking place in its sovereign territory, it is refraining from including torture in the legal code, as the convention requires.
	The questions raised by the committee address, among other things, the travel restrictions that prevent Gaza Strip residents from having access to health services. In any case, it would be worthwhile for the committee to ask the Hamas government in Gaza if the dispute with the government in Ramallah should bar critically ill persons from seeking treatment in hospitals in Israel and occasionally sentence them to death by torture.

<title>The top 8 headlines you may have missed / Haaretz Newsline, June 19</title>

	The military wing of Hamas fired rockets toward Israel overnight Monday and on Tuesday. There were no reported casualties or damage. The rocket fire marks an unusual move for the group, which has been avoiding launching rockets toward Israel for many months now. Following the attack, communities near the Gaza border were put on heightened alert.
	Sephardic Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar sent a letter to hundreds of Orthodox rabbis in Israel calling on them to object to the state's intention to recognize and fund Reform and Conservative rabbis in towns around the country. Amar's goal is to persuade Israel's political leaders to foil implementation of the High Court's ruling on the matter.
	Iran warned on Tuesday that Western sanctions against the country's oil exports must be lifted and that their right to a civilian nuclear program recognized, or else Tehran could break off negotiations. Iran's delegation to the nuclear talks said a negative response would mean "the end of the negotiations in its current configuration." 	Syria's government said Tuesday it was ready to act on a UN call to evacuate civilians who are trapped in the rebellious central city of Homs for over a week, but blamed rebels for obstructing efforts to do so. Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, chief of the UN observer mission in Syria, asked both sides to allow safe passage to women, children and sick people.
	Author of “The Color Purple” Alice Walker refused to authorize a Hebrew translation of her prize-winning work, calling Israel an "apartheid state." Walker said she supported the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement and offered her hope that the BDS movement “will have enough of an impact on Israeli civilian society to change the situation.”
	A mosque in the West Bank village of Jab'a, located south of Ramallah, was set on fire and vandalize in a suspected "price tag" attack early Tuesday morning. A joint investigation by Shin Bet, Israel Police and the IDF had begun. 	The National Building and Planning Council will consider exempting the construction of refugee camps in the south from almost all planning regulations. The Defense Ministry says the move, together with other proposed changes in the plans, are intended "to meet the tight schedule to implement the cabinet's decision" to build the camp for African refugees crossing the Egyptian border into Israel.
	A Palestinian prisoner who has been on hunger strike for 88 days ended his fast Monday, after the Israeli authorities agreed to release him on July 10, Palestinian Minister of Prisoners Affairs Issa Qaraqi said.

<title>U.S. Presbyterian Church committee votes in favor of Israel divestment resolution</title>
<date>Tue Jul 03 21:23:00 IDT 2012</date>
<content>
	Following a lengthy and heated debate, committee 15 of the 220th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States voted in favor of a motion calling for divestment from three companies that "profit from nonpeaceful pursuits" in Israel.
	Whether or not the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israel is gaining traction is one of the hottest questions being asked among the most politically active members of the Jewish community – as many people take the issue to heart.
	Israel supporters claim that the numbers of participants in the annual "Israel apartheid" week have not grown significantly, and that the American Methodist and Presbyterian Churches, despite regularly raising the topic of divesting from companies that "profit from Israeli occupation," generally end up voting against it.  The discourse is shifting – and not in Israel’s favor.
	In 2008, the United Methodist Church (UMC) rejected an Israel divestment resolution. On May 2, the UMC general conference did it again, rejecting a resolution calling for divestment from three companies doing business with Israel (although the conference did adopt a measure recommending a boycott of products made in Israeli settlement).
	This week, the topic was raised again in Pittsburgh, at the general assembly of the Presbyterian Church. Last time, the resolution didn't even pass the committee level, let alone the general vote.
	This time, something different happened. Committee 15 of the 220th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church voted in favor of a motion calling for divestment from  Motorola, for providing surveillance equipment for Israeli settlements, Caterpillar, for providing bulldozers used for demolishing Palestinian houses, and Hewlett-Packard, for selling hardware used by Israel in its naval blockade of Gaza.
	The motion also called for the church to increase investments in companies promoting peaceful pursuits. The final vote is expected at the general assembly later this week.
	Rev. Dr. Walt Davis, Co-Chair of the Israel/Palestine Mission Network, called the decision "an encouraging step".
	 "We hope plenary voters will follow the lead of Committee 15 and the recommendations of the Mission Responsibility Through Investing committee and support divestment from these companies that are profiting from Israel's violations of Palestinian human rights. It’s been a long and thorough process and it’s finally time for the church to stop profiting from the suffering the peoples of the Holy Land,” said Davis.
	But during Monday evening's debate, there were also concerns expressed over the possible impact of the decision on the relations with the Jewish community - and other sectors of the American Christian community.
	Weeks before the general assembly opened on June 30, the proposal drew sharp criticism and warnings from Jewish American organizations, with the exception of those on the far left, such as the Jewish Voice for Peace. Over 1,300 Rabbis and over 12,000 American Jews signed letters to delegates of the biennial Presbyterian Church General Assembly, calling them to reject the "counterproductive" resolution.
	In response, the Anti-Defamation League warned of the negative effect on the Jewish and American Christian relations. The American Jewish Committee called the resolutions generally put to votes every two years at the Presbyterian Church gatherings "an unfortunate tradition" meant to vilify Israel and adopt positions of “non-representative" Palestinian leaders.
	Even Jeremy Ben-Ami, President of the leftist pro-Israeli lobby JStreet, wrote an article titled “Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Put Allies at Odds."
	"In our view, the one-sided, extreme rhetoric that accompanies the global BDS movement makes a mutually agreeable solution more difficult to achieve, not less" wrote Ben-Ami, stressing that he hopes that PCUSA "will avoid this unproductive path,"
	Ben-Ami added, "even the limited divestment approach under consideration by PCUSA falls under the rubric of larger BDS efforts to place blame entirely on one side of the conflict. Such an approach encourages not reconciliation, but polarization.”
	Some members of the general assembly committee that discussed the motion in Pittsburg said they do not understand why the resolution is interpreted as a threat - they insisted it's a moral issue, certainly not an anti-Semitic one, to stop pouring resources “into hurting people in another country."
	"There's violence happening here. Someone is profiting from it. And we need to not be a part of that," said one of the Committee members.
	It's not that Israel is running short of supporters among the American Christian community; in about two weeks, Christians United for Israel, a large Evangelical pro-Israel organization, will run its annual gathering in Washington DC. It's likely that the Presbyterian divestment motion will draw quite a bit of criticism there.
	Dr. Nahida Halaby Gordon, moderator of the National Middle Eastern Presbyterian Caucus, told "Haaretz" she feels there is a good chance for the vote to pass.
	"Sometimes the plenary votes contrary to the vote in the committee, but the numbers in the committee vote in favor of the divestment were high in favor of the divestment (36 members of the committee voted in favor, 11 against NM) - almost three to one, I feel there is a big support for this." If the vote fails, she says, she intends to come with other activists with the same message to the next GA. She stressed the decision "is not intended to demonize or delegitimize either Israel or Jewish community in this country."
	As for the possible result of the divestment decision - she says it's not the hope it will seriously hurt these companies profits, but the message it sends.
	"We are a small church, we don't own that many stocks and the divestment will probably occur over a year or two - it's not that we'll sell tomorrow all our stocks. But it's a moral message to these companies that you should not profit from the occupation."

<title>YouTube removes video calling on Alicia Keys to cancel Israel concert</title>
<date>Fri Jun 28 12:33:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
YouTube has removed a video calling on Alicia Keys to cancel a concert in Tel Aviv.
Set to Keys’ popular song “This Girl is on Fire,” the video was removed on Monday, according to the U.S. Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel.
The video, “Alicia Keys, Come Together with Your Sisters, Boycott Apartheid,” was removed, a notification by YouTube said, due to a copyright infringement claim by “Alicia Keys c/o Ziffren Brittenheim LLP.”
It showed Palestinian performance and visual artist Rana Hamadeh standing on an Israeli military vehicle waving a Palestinian flag.
“It is enough that we face physical and emotional violence and restrictions on our daily lives. But now we are also being silenced on the internet,” Hamadeh said in a statement distributed by the U.S. Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel. “I think if Alicia Keys understood the call to boycott, she would agree to honor it.”
Keys affirmed her decision to play in Israel in an interview published last month in The New York Times. She has been under pressure to cancel the July 4 concert.
The appeal to Keys to boycott Israel came first from Alice Walker in an open letter posted on the Pulitzer Prize-winning author’s website. Calls also came from Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and numerous pro-Palestinian organizations.

<title>British lawmaker suspended from party over 'Apartheid Israel’ tweet</title>
<date>Thu Jul 18 18:29:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
David Ward, a British lawmaker who made negative generalizations about “the Jews” and referred to Israel as an apartheid state, was suspended temporarily from the Liberal Democratic Party.
Following a meeting with party leaders on Wednesday, Ward was suspended until September 13, during which time he will serve in parliament as an independent. No parliamentary votes are scheduled between now and September 13, according to reports.
Ward met with party leader Nick Clegg and chief whip Alistair Carmichael in the wake of a July 13 tweet sent by Ward that read, “Am I wrong or are am I right? At long last the 
Zionists are losing the battle - how long can the 
apartheid State of 
Israel last?”
In January, on International Holocaust Memorial Day, Ward said he was “saddened that the Jews, who suffered unbelievable levels of persecution during the Holocaust, could, within a few years of liberation, be inflicting atrocities on the Palestinians in the new State of Israel - and continue to do so.”
The controversy was renewed when reports emerged that Ward asked his staff if replacing “the Jews” with “the Jewish community” would mollify his critics, leading to another round of complaint, and sanctions including a requirement that he attend language classes.
In a letter obtained by the BBC that was sent to Ward following the meeting, Carmichael praised Ward for his progress since February, including his appreciation of “the need to use language in this debate that was proportionate and precise.” But in reference to the tweet, he added, “We were in unanimous agreement that questioning the continued existence of the State of Israel fails the test of language that is ‘proportionate and precise.’”
Jonathan Arkush, vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said in response to the suspension of Ward, “We note that the Liberal Democrats have at last taken some action to address the completely inappropriate and offensive comments that he has made. However, suspension of the whip for just two months when Parliament is not sitting is too little, too late. It is a token and frankly an empty gesture.”

<title>Roger Waters concert features Nazi-like uniform, pig balloon with Jewish symbol </title>
<date>Thu Jul 25 19:10:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Roger Waters, a rock musician critical of Israel, used a giant, pig-shaped balloon emblazoned with a Star of David and symbols of dictatorial regimes during a recent concert in Belgium.
Waters, who recently urged other performers to boycott Israel and compared Israel to apartheid South Africa, was singing on stage on July 20 under the balloon while toting a machine gun replica and wearing a long black leather jacket with a red-and-white arm band, reminiscent of a Nazi uniform.
The former Pink Floyd member was singing “get him up against the wall, that one looks Jewish and that one’s a coon, who let all of this riff-raff into the room” – the lyrics of the song “In the Flesh.”
Thousands of fans shouted his name and applauded as he stood on stage pretending to fire the replica.
Michael Freilich, editor-in-chief of the Belgian Jewish monthly Joods Actueel, called on the government to issue a statement condemning what he called “an anti-Semitic display” at the concert.

<title>Roger Waters: I'm not anti-Semitic, I'm anti-apartheid</title>
<date>Mon Aug 05 15:18:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Former Pink Floyd star Roger Waters attempted to deflect accusations of anti-Semitism and defend his decision to use a pig-shaped balloon emblazoned with the Star of David, among other symbols, during a concert in Belgium.
Waters, who last year voiced support for the boycott of Israeli goods, came under fire for the use of the inflatable pig, which was destroyed by the audience at the end of the show. Apart from anti-Semitism claims, some accused him of being a Jew hater and Nazi supporter.
In a response posted on Facebook, Waters denied the allegations and said the Star of David represents Israel and its policies, and not Judaism.
"[I]n a functioning theocracy it is almost inevitable that the symbol of the religion becomes confused with the symbol of the state, in this case the State of Israel, a state that operates apartheid both within its own borders and also in the territories it has occupied and colonized since 1967," wrote Waters. "Like it or not, the Star of David represents Israel and its policies."
The statement said Waters is regularly criticized by pro-Israel groups for his support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.
As for the inflatable pig, the musician argued that it represents "the evil of errant government." Waters said the balloon was used in 193 shows since 2010 and that it was destroyed by the audience at the end of each one.
Waters noted that the show also uses other religious and commercial symbols such as the Crucifix, the Crescent and Star, the Shell Oil logo, the McDonald’s sign and a dollar sign.
The show, Waters concluded, "is many things. It is thoughtful, life affirming, ecumenical, humane, loving, anti-war, anti-colonial, pro universal access to the law, pro liberty, pro collaboration, pro dialogue, pro peace, anti-authoritarian, anti-fascist, anti-apartheid, anti-dogma, international in spirit, musical and satirical. It is not anti-Semitic or pro-Nazi." 
Waters pointed out that the Anti-Defamation League said it does not believe he had anti-Semitic intent, although it did regret the use of the Star of David.
This is not the first time Waters has come under fire for using Jewish symbols. In 2010, the ADL criticized the musician for using imagery associated with perpetuating Jewish stereotypes.

<title>UC Berkley anti-Semitism complaint dismissed</title>
<date>Wed Aug 28 20:58:38 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The U.S. Department of Education has dismissed a complaint against the University of California, Berkeley that had accused the university of allowing a hostile environment for Jewish students to exist on campus.
In a letter dated August 19 and released August 27 by UC Berkeley, the education department’s Office for Civil Rights indicates that it is closing its year-long investigation after concluding that events that took place on campus — such as mock military checkpoint demonstrations held during Israeli Apartheid Week by Students for Justice in Palestine — constitute “expression on matters of public concern directed to the University community.”

<title>Spanish festival bans jazz player for attending pro-Israel event</title>
<date>Wed Sep 11 16:25:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Organizers of a music festival near Barcelona prevented a local jazz musician from performing because of his support for Israel.
The organizers of the Fiesta Major Alternativa told Eric Herrera that he could not play with his band, Amusic Skazz Band, on Aug. 29 after photos surfaced of him attending an event marking Israel’s 65th anniversary in Barcelona earlier this year, band members told the news site Dialogo Libre.
The band canceled its performance in Manreza, where anti-Israel activists reportedly handed out posters of Herrera posing next to the Israeli flag at the celebration. The same photos were circulated among some festival goers ahead of the event.
Reports in Spanish media did not say whether Herrera is Jewish.
“Obviously, we decided not to play at all,” the band wrote in a news release issued last week. The statement also said that organizers told the band they “could not guarantee their safety.”
The organizers wrote in a statement that the cancellation was “due to unease generated among various groups and organizers [over] the fact that members [of Amusic Skazz Band] actively participate in demonstrations of support for the Zionist state of Israel.” This “political stance clashed head-on with the ideals defended by the majority of groups present,” the statement read.
Organizers also wrote that they reject claims “that were made in media” that the campaign against Herrera was anti-Semitic.
“We believe this campaign of denunciation of Zionism is not an anti-Semitic campaign,” the organizers wrote, adding that “Zionism is the ideology that justified the creation of the State of Israel, a state formed through colonization, war and military occupation, and has established an apartheid regime based on institutionalized racism.”
Jolanda Estede of the cultural department of the municipality of Manreza told JTA that the city did not wish to comment on the incident because the festival was “an independent event not organized by the municipality.”
She added, however, that the city provided security for the festival.

<title>Once prominent in South African politics, Jews take a back seat</title>
<date>Tue Dec 03 19:02:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
A forum of young Jewish adults in South Africa recently invited the country's anti-corruption crusader, Thuli Madonsela, to meet with them at the Sydenham Synagogue in Johannesburg. For the most part, South Africa's Jews are cheering on Madonsela, who, in her role as Public Protector (equivalent to ombudsman in other countries,) has doggedly investigated the misspending of public funds on upgrades to President Jacob Zuma’s private homestead, Nkandla.
South Africa’s most celebrated political cartoonist Zapiro (real name Jonathan Shapiro) portrayed her recently as a knight galloping on her horse towards Nkandla, past bumbling officials trying to stop her.
Though Madonsela is not a politician per se, her actions in making the government squirm remind older South Africans of a “knight” from a previous era, sharp-tongued Jewish Member of Parliament Helen Suzman of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party. As the party’s sole MP for 13 years in the race-based parliament, she often made the government squirm with questions to ministers about racial laws which degraded and humiliated black South Africans. When a minister accused her of posing questions to embarrass South Africa, she replied: “It is not my questions that embarrass South Africa; it is your answers.” Jews voted overwhelmingly for her and her party.
Jews were once prolific in South African politics at every level. In addition to Suzman, the Progressive Party was represented by former-leader Tony Leon, as well as Selma Browde and Harry Schwarz. The African National Congress, the liberation movement that became the governing party in 1994, also had a full complement of Jews, including Joe Slovo, Ronnie Kasrils and Denis Goldberg. Jews were also prominent in municipal politics. Over Johannesburg's 120-year history, 22 of its 94 mayors have been Jewish, according to the city’s website. Cape Town has had 13 Jewish mayors since 1907.
Today, however, Jews are largely absent from formal politics. Of the few remaining, most are in their twilight years, such as 86-year-old ANC parliamentarian Ben Turok, who was one of several Jews (the late Lionel Bernstein was another) involved in drawing up the 1955 Freedom Charter – the key document of the liberation struggle. A few, younger Jewish politicians can be found here and there, such as Jack Bloom, a veteran of the liberal Democratic Alliance and leader of the Opposition in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature.
Bloom says Jews played a key role in ensuring that the ANC remained multi-racial during the apartheid years. For example, fully half of the white defendants in the Treason Trial of 1956 were Jewish, as were all five of the white defendants in the infamous Rivonia Trial.
Says Bloom: “If they had not been there among the mainly-black accused, there would have been few whites at all, the racial atmosphere would have been harsher and the ANC’s ideology might not have stayed on such a firmly non-racial track. Another example is Jewish lawyer Lazar Sidelsky, who gave Nelson Mandela his first job as a legal clerk when no-one else would. Activist Walter Sisulu, who spent many years in jail on Robben Island with Mandela, commented that if he had not done so Mandela might have gone back to his rural birthplace in the Transkei, become a tribal chief and remained there.”
South Africa's Jews will vote in next year’s elections, but their presence in the top ranks of the political parties will be negligible. Recent incidents in the ANC have been labelled by angry Jews as anti-Semitic and anti-Israel, such as the party’s Western Cape leader's wooing of Muslim voters by equating the DA with support for Israel, and saying it gives business to Jews in preference to Muslims. Jewish sentiments veer mostly towards the DA.
When only the country's five million-strong white population was eligible to vote, Jews stood out prominently; but they are a lot less visible today, with 50 million, predominantly black voters. In addition to which, the SA Jewish population is roughly half what it was in the 1960s and ‘70s. Another dampener is white fears of accusations of racism if they criticize the black government. Mainstream SA Jewry has also become more religious and inward-looking. The Jewish influence today is felt mainly in business, the arts and the professions.
Given their history of distinguished politicians, will SA Jews continue to stay out of direct political roles? It’s not as if they are without strong views. But despite inviting people like Madonsela to meet them, they still feel a little like outsiders, unlike the days when their own Helen Suzman led the charge in parliament. Many of the country’s new, black political elite regard liberals like Suzman as historical footnotes. In an interview a few years before she died in 2009, she said she had been “airbrushed” out of South African history.
Bloom says the absence of Jews is part of the general white withdrawal from formal politics. “But the Jewish energy has been rechanneled into social and civic activism. For example, in creating ambulance services, development projects in needy communities, and so on.” Jewish NGOs like Ma’Afrika Tikkun - of which Mandela is a patron - run numerous upliftment projects in disadvantaged black communities countrywide. Jewish companies and private benefactors give widely to such causes.
“As another example of Jewish involvement in the country,” says Bloom, “we have people like Gill Marcus, Governor of the SA Reserve Bank, whose signature appears on the banknotes.”
For the time being, however, there are few signs of South Africa's Jews taking the plunge and re-entering formal politics.

<title>Nelson Mandela’s rabbi is waiting to greet him</title>
<date>Fri Dec 06 19:37:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
Since the news of Nelson Mandela's passing, individuals and organizations in the South African Jewish community have been flooding phones and inboxes with messages. Jewish prayer services are being organized everywhere. Most South African Jews never met him personally, but they felt as though he was a friend they knew.
South African music icon Johnny Clegg, whose songs celebrated Mandela at a time when doing so was dangerous in South Africa, said in a message: “Nelson Mandela will always define a deep part of what and who we are as individuals and as a nation. It is difficult to separate the great journey to secure a democratic and non-racial South Africa from his personal qualities and character. For all South Africans he was the face and form of that voyage, particularly in the crucial decade of 1990-2000.
“In the defining and tempestuous years of 1990 through to April 27th 1994 his leadership never gave the impression that he was overwhelmed by events, even in the darkest hours of Boipatong and other atrocities that were meant to derail the negotiations. When at times we felt doubt or fear, his strong resonant voice rolled out over the radio or TV and, like a tide going out, our reservations about the future receded. We took immense nourishment and succour from his fearless and positive attitude. His charismatic openness, straight aim, direct but respectful communication with his opponents was a singularly rare quality in a time of racist and right wing demagoguery. A country in turmoil needs to feel that the Ship of State, riding the storm, is in good hands and he never gave us cause to doubt that the storm would pass and the country would be free. It is the qualities of tolerance and forgiveness however which stand out as his lasting legacy as well as the way he used these to unite the country both during and after his presidency.
“With all our fellow South Africans we acknowledge with deep gratitude the debt we owe to this Man from Qunu, who bequeathed us this great country of promise. Today, although we grieve, we also proudly rejoice in his remarkable life, which we were privileged to share through extraordinary times.”
South African Chief Rabbi Warren Goldstein stressed Mandela's relationship with South African Jewry. “South African Jews have had a long, close and meaningful relationship with former President Nelson Mandela… that involved every stage of Mandela’s life," he said. "And so we mourn his loss together with fellow-South Africans… The greatest tribute we can pay is to live with the values he practiced and taught… human dignity, forgiveness, kindness, courage, tenacity, strength, honesty and integrity.”
One of Mandela’s strongest supporters during his presidency was the late former South African chief rabbi, Cyril Harris, who led South African Jewry through the transformation to democracy. On sighting Harris during his trip to Israel in 1999, Mandela proclaimed: “My rabbi has come!”
Mandela and Harris, together with Harris’ wife Ann, cooperated on projects such as the creation of the organization for upliftment of needy black communities, Ma’Afrika Tikkun, of which Mandela was a patron. Ann Harris recalled Friday morning Mandela's closeness with her late husband, saying: “Well, I am sure his rabbi is waiting to greet him…”
Harris was equally warm to Mandela and when he was being treated by a Jewish doctor for eye problems from working in lime quarries on Robben Island during his imprisonment Harris declared: “We’re sorry you are having trouble with your eyes, but we want you to know that there is nothing wrong with your vision.”
Ann Harris said Friday that Mandela's most important quality was dignity. "An innate dignity and nobility, this quality of royalty… statesmanship, leadership," she said, and recalled a story from 1994.
 “On the first day of Rosh Hashanah, soon after he became president, he rang up to say happy New Year to myself and Cyril. Our domestic worker Constance Balintaba answered and said: “It’s the Jewish New Year, they are at the synagogue, and they don’t answer the phone because of the Jewish holiday." Mandela asked if she would pass on the message. “Of course," she said. Then he asked where she came from. She answered Lusikisiki, and in an animated tone he said “Ah! We are neighbors, I come from a village nearby, not far from you," and they had a long chat about it. She was absolutely over the moon.”
 One of Mandela's earliest encounters with South Africa's Jews was in 1941 when, as a young man, he came to Johannesburg seeking work, and was given his first job by Jewish attorney Lazar Sidelsky. This act – both unusual and brave – made a lasting impression. Later, many white comrades with whom he formed close bonds were leftist Jews. Of the 156 accused in the Treason Trial of 1956, 23 were whites – more than half of them Jews. The 17 activists arrested at Liliesleaf, Rivonia in July 1963, included five whites – all of them Jews.
At Wits University where he studied law, he made some Jewish friends who later defended him in the above trials. The defense in the Treason Trial was headed by advocate Isie Maisels, and Sydney Kentridge was his counsel. Kentridge said later: “I could somehow tell from the many talks I had with him that this man was a leader – of course I couldn’t have guessed he would become the leader he, in fact, became.”
His Jewish connections then were primarily with individuals – friends, activists, lawyers and journalists. With the Jewish majority, he had little contact. Although most Jews, along with almost all white South Africans, went along with apartheid, they voted consistently for liberal opposition parties and backed Parliamentarians like anti-apartheid Helen Suzman. Jewish women’s groups and others worked to alleviate the effects of apartheid on blacks.
After President FW de Klerk announced in February 1990 that the ban on the ANC was lifted and Mandela would be released after 27 years in prison, a new period began in which he engaged with mainstream Jewish organizations, philanthropists and businessmen, such as the South Africa Jewish Board of Deputies, at whose National Conference in 1993 he was keynote speaker.
In 1985, a movement, Jews for Social Justice, was started for action against apartheid, supported by Rabbis Norman Bernhard and Ady Assabi. Shortly after his release from prison Mandela attended a Shabbat service at Temple Shalom in Johannesburg, at Rabbi Assabi’s invitation. Some congregants protested, since just prior to it Mandela appeared on television embracing PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat at an event in another African country.
Mandela displayed profound loyalty to friends and comrades such as Helen Suzman. During apartheid, when she was the sole MP of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, she was the first Parliamentarian to visit Mandela on Robben Island. He remained close to her even after she was marginalized by the new black political elite. “I have been airbrushed out of history by the new regime – but my friend Mandela still comes to see me," Suzman said.
The Israeli-Palestinian question inevitably came up with Zionist South African Jews. Instinctively, he was sympathetic to Palestinians, given the links during apartheid between the ANC and PLO. However, he attended a ceremony at Oxford Synagogue in Johannesburg in 1995 to honor assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
His trip to Israel in 1999 with Jewish leaders aimed to repair negative feelings caused by Israeli links with apartheid South Africa, in which it cooperated on military matters. Mandela proposed a Mideast peace plan in which the Arabs would recognize Israel within 1967 borders, and Israel would relinquish captured territory. In Gaza, he met Arafat and in Israel visited Rabin’s grave and Yad Vashem.
His positive attitude after his release from prison reassured nervous whites, Jews among them, that after living with “packed suitcases under the bed” during apartheid, they had a future here. Most people always knew apartheid couldn’t last. It seemed likely to end in a racial bloodbath. Under Mandela, however, there would be no bloodbath. He encouraged all South Africans to build a “rainbow nation." He invited one of his warders from Robben Island to his presidential inauguration and had lunch with Percy Yutar, a state prosecutor in the Rivonia Trial.
On Friday morning, the South Africa Jewish Board of Deputies announced it is working with Chief Rabbi Goldstein to arrange special prayer services, and issued the following statement: “The sad day has arrived that our dear Madiba has left us… We join with all the peoples of the world in paying tribute to the life of a true giant of humanity… A man of unflinching courage and unswerving principle, of boundless compassion and the profoundest humility, Nelson Mandela epitomized the miracle of South Africa’s democratic transformation. Many heroic men and women played their part in bringing about the triumph of justice and democracy in South Africa, but the name of Nelson Mandela towers above them all.”
The South African Holocaust and Genocide Centre released a statement: “Tata Madiba, your legacy will never be forgotten. [We will] continue to honor your memory by striving to build a more caring and just society in which human rights and diversity are valued and respected.”
One thing that is gratifying to South Africans across the board is that Mandela, contrary to freedom fighters in so many other places, lived to see his dream of a democratic South Africa come true.

<title>Alan Dershowitz retiring from Harvard Law School</title>
<date>Mon Dec 16 14:48:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
Alan Dershowitz, one of the country’s most prominent lawyers and a passionate, sometimes controversial, advocate for Israel, is retiring from Harvard Law School.
The 75-year-old lawyer, who is known for taking on high profile and often unpopular causes and clients, has taught at Harvard Law for half a century. His retirement is official at the end of the week.
In 1967, he became the youngest full professor in the school’s history. An expert in criminal and constitutional law, Dershowitz has served on the defense team of celebrities including O.J. Simpson and Claus von Bulow and, more recently, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.
Dershowitz, speaking from a conference in Israel, said last week according to the Boston Globe: “Yeah, I’m really retiring. …My retirement consists of reducing my schedule down to only about 10 things at any given time.”
Dershowitz, a Brooklyn native who has written and spoken often on his Orthodox Jewish upbringing and education, has used his prominence to defend Israel over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Among his harshest critics is Noam Chomsky, the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology linguist with whom he has had a long-running public feud over Israel.
In 2006, Dershowitz publicly challenged former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, for the views he expressed in his book “Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid,” calling the book biased.
While “proud to be Jewish and engaged with Israel’s future,” Dershowitz also assisted Palestinian students when they sought inclusion of the Palestinian flag in a campus display, Harvard Law School dean Martha Minow told JTA.
Minow described Dershowitz as a devoted teacher of 50 years. “We look forward to his continuing vibrancy, wit, and wisdom,” she said in an email to JTA.

<title>ADL: Hawking's Israel boycott a 'slap in face of academic freedom'</title>
<date>Thu May 09 17:53:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The New York-based Anti-Defamation League has slammed British physicist Stephen Hawking for pulling out of an Israeli conference because of pressure from pro-Palestinian activists.
Hawking "has delivered a slap in the face to academic freedom," the ADL said in a statement Wednesday. The boycott campaign "relies on an abhorrent and false comparison of Israeli democracy to Apartheid," charged the group, which fights against defamation of Israel and Jews.
The renowned physicist canceled his planned appearance at next month's Presidential Conference in Jerusalem, apparently in response to the urging of Palestinian activists and academics.
Hawking informed President Shimon Peres of his decision last weekend, but decided not to make it public. Thus it became public knowledge only on Wednesday, when it was reported on the website of the British Committee for the Universities of Palestine and picked up by the British daily The Guardian.
According to the statement published with Hawking's approval by BRICUP, a group that works to promote an academic boycott of Israel, the cancellation was "his independent decision to respect the boycott, based upon his knowledge of Palestine, and on the unanimous advice of his own academic contacts there." The group didn't publish Hawking's letter to Peres, but said it would do so if it received his permission.
Conference chairman Israel Maimon told the Guardian that Hawking's decision was "outrageous and wrong."
"The use of an academic boycott against Israel is outrageous and improper, particularly for those to whom the spirit of liberty is the basis of the human and academic mission," he continued. "Israel is a democracy in which everyone can express their opinion, whatever it may be. A boycott decision is incompatible with open democratic discourse."
In a subsequent conversation with Haaretz, Maimon noted that Hawking was being more Palestinian than the Palestinians: While he was boycotting the conference, other Palestinians had agreed to attend it as speakers.
"Hawking's stance strengthens the extremists," Maimon added. "After all, extremists don't talk; moderates talk. This boycott isn't a path that encourages dialogue, it only encourages the extremists."
The three-day conference, which will open on June 18 at Jerusalem's International Convention Center (Binyanei Ha'uma), is being cosponsored by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It will bring together people from the fields of government, economics, technology, science and entertainment to discuss the question of how to shape a better future for the world, the Jewish people and Israel.
Among the guests who have confirmed their attendance are singer and actress Barbra Streisand, who will sing at the opening event in honor of Peres' 90th birthday; former U.S. President Bill Clinton; former President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev; actress Sharon Stone; Prince Albert of Monaco; Daniel Kahneman, winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in economics; and a number of senior executives from the high-tech world.

<title>One of Canada’s largest student association endorses BDS against Israel</title>
<date>Sun Mar 31 13:43:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
One of the largest student association in Canada passed a resolution endorsing the global boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign against Israel.With the passage late last week of the resolution, York University's student association joins two others in Canada - the University of Toronto and Concordia University graduate student associations - in endorsing the BDS campaign, according to the York University Excalibur.The campaign calls for universities to divest from holdings in companies that do business with Israel and to cut ties with Israeli academics.The vote by the council of the York Federation of Students was 18-2 in favor and was advocated for by the Students Against Israeli Apartheid at York.Jewish student groups at York complained that they were not given advance notice of the vote and had little time to prepare an argument against the resolution.In comments to the Excalibur, Safiyah Husein, a vice president of the York Federation of Students, portrayed the resolution as uncontroversial. "Indeed, not everyone supports reduced tuition fees, equity campaigns, or sustainability work, but we know the majority of our members believe this work is vital and important," Husein said.Chaim Lax, president of Hasbara@York, said his group was disappointed and called the resolution “fundamentally racist, and a possible violation of [York’s] anti-discrimination codes.”The York Federation of Students resolution will have no actual bearing on the university's investment portfolio."York University uses best practices in developing its policy on investments, and this is built on advice from major investment consulting firms," York spokeswoman Janice Walls told the Canadian Jewish News.The student federation represents over 52,000 undergraduate students at York, Canada's third-largest university.

<title>Oxford University Students Union expected to reject Israel boycott motion, Jewish union says </title>
<date>Wed Feb 27 14:00:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
	Oxford University Student Union is expected to reject a controversial motion Wednesday evening calling for a boycott of Israeli institutions, goods and produce, according to the U.K.'s Union of Jewish Students.
                
	Along with the boycott, the motion proposed by student Emily Cousens also calls for the prestigious university's students union, and for Britain's National Union of Students, to join the international campaign for boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against Israel.
                
	"Many students have already voted against it and the likely outcome is that it will be rejected this evening," a spokesperson from the Union of Jewish Students, an umbrella organization for Jewish students in the U.K. "We eagerly await the results."
                
	The motion, which will be voted on at 5:30 P.M. local time, reads: “We [the Oxford University Student's Union and the National Union of Students] have a moral responsibility to fight injustice,” and demands that Israel “end its occupation of all Arab lands.”
                
	It also calls on the union to “conduct research into higher education institutions’ contacts, relations, investment and commercial relationships that may be implicated in violating Palestinian human rights as stated by the BDS movement.”
                
	The vote follows tensions on the Oxford campus last week, after far-left British Member of Parliament George Galloway caused a storm by walking out of a debate on Israel's presence in the West Bank when he discovered that the speaker debating him was an Israeli citizen.
                
	In a statement after the event, Galloway said, "I refused this evening to debate with an Israeli, a supporter of the Apartheid state of Israel. The reason is simple; No recognition, no normalization. Just boycott, divestment and sanctions, until the Apartheid state is defeated."
                
	The student arguing against the motion, Eylon Aslan-Levy, accused Galloway of "pure racism." Galloway's walk-out was greeted by cries of surprise and the word "racism" from the students in the hall who applauded Aslan-Levy.

<title>Pulitzer Prize-winner Anthony Lewis dies at 85 - Jewish World News</title>
<date>Tue Mar 26 00:48:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
Two-time Pulitzer winner Anthony Lewis, whose New York Times column championed liberal causes for three decades, died Monday. He was 85.
                
Lewis worked for 32 years as a columnist for the Times, taking up such causes as free speech, human rights and constitutional law. He won his first Pulitzer in 1955 as a reporter defending a Navy civilian falsely accused of being a communist sympathizer, and he won again in 1963 for reporting on the Supreme Court.
                
His acclaimed 1964 book, "Gideon's Trumpet," told the story of a petty thief whose fight for legal representation led to a landmark Supreme Court decision.
                
The legal world this month marked the 50th anniversary of that landmark decision but noted that many in the U.S. still face a judge without the help of a lawyer.
                
Lewis' wife, Margaret Marshall, confirmed his death from complications from heart and renal failure.
                
Lewis saw himself as a defender of decency, respect for law and reason against a tide of religious fundamentalism and extreme nationalism. His columns criticized the Vietnam War, Watergate, apartheid in South Africa and Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
                
He wrote his final "Abroad at Home" column for The Times on Dec. 15, 2001, warning against the U.S. fearfully surrendering its civil liberties in the wake of the terrorist attacks three months earlier.
                
"The hard question is whether our commitment to law will survive the new sense of vulnerability that is with us all after Sept. 11," he wrote. "It is easy to tolerate dissent when we feel safe."
                
Gail Collins, then the editorial page editor of the Times, said when Lewis resigned that he had been an inspiration.
                
"His fearlessness, the clarity of his writing and his commitment to human rights and civil liberties are legendary," Collins said. "And he's also one of the kindest people I have ever known."
                
"Gideon's Trumpet" became a legal classic, telling the story of Clarence Earl Gideon, whose case resulted in the creation of the public defender systems across the nation. In Gideon v. Wainwright, the high court ruled that criminal defendants are entitled to a lawyer even if they cannot afford one.
                
Gideon's victory, Lewis wrote, "shows that even the poorest and least powerful of men — a convict with not even a friend to visit him in prison — can take his cause to the highest court in the land and bring about a fundamental change in the law."
                
The best-selling book was later made into a television movie starring Henry Fonda.
                
Lewis was known for his skill at interpreting and writing clearly about the decisions of the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950s and '60s. The court was instrumental in groundbreaking decisions that helped break down persistent racial segregation.
                
"One cannot talk about the Warren court without talking about Anthony Lewis," said Ronald K. L. Collins, a scholar at the University of Washington School of Law who put together a bibliography of Lewis' expansive writings on free speech. "He was almost the 10th justice of the Warren court. He was careful in his journalism, but his ethos was clearly the same as the Warren court."
                
Fighting for the underdog was a theme for Lewis. He won his first Pulitzer Prize at the age of 28 for a series of articles in the Washington Daily News that were judged responsible for clearing a civilian employee of the U.S. Navy from McCarthy-era allegations that he was a security risk.
                
Lewis said Abraham Chasanow was a middle-class man, uninterested in politics, who was terrorized by the federal loyalty-security program of the 1950s when unnamed informants alleged Chasanow was a radical communist sympathizer. The Navy ultimately apologized to Chasanow.
                
"We need to celebrate and understand our unique freedom, and it is unique in this country this freedom of speech and press," Lewis told the Times in 2007. "And I don't actually think we understand it well."
                
Joseph Anthony Lewis was born in New York City on March 27, 1927.
                
He joined the Times in 1948 and spent most of his career there.
                
He studied law for a year at Harvard in the 1950s so he could go on to cover the Supreme Court for the Times. He began his twice-weekly "Abroad at Home" column from London in 1969.
                
Marshall said Lewis was a humble man who loved vegetable gardening, opera and musicals, and wrote on a manual typewriter until the day he died.
                
"He loved people," she said. "He was enthusiastic about so much. Most of all, he loved the rule of law. He was really passionate about that. He had a very high regard for judges and the judicial system. He really thought that was the core value that made the United States so different."
                
When Lewis retired, he told the Times that his career as a columnist had led him to two conclusions.
                
"One is that certainty is the enemy of decency and humanity in people who are sure they are right, like Osama bin Laden and (then-Attorney General) John Ashcroft," he said. "And secondly that for this country at least, given the kind of obstreperous, populous, diverse country we are, law is the absolute essential. And when governments short-cut the law, it's extremely dangerous."

<title>U.K. union passes resolution banning member visits to Israel </title>
<date>Sat Jun 08 19:33:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The congress of one of the U.K.'s largest trade unions, the GMB, has ordered its members to refrain from visiting Israel and the Palestinian territories on trips organized by the Trade Union Friends of Israel (TUFI), the Jewish Chronicle reported earlier this week.
TUFI is an organization aimed at the promotion of Israeli-Palestinian trade union co-operation and the strengthening of links between Israeli, Palestinian and British trade union movements.
The motion stated that funding for participants of TUFI trips must be stopped since the organization opposes attempts to boycott Israel.
The GMB represents over half a million members, from various sectors.
According to the report, a TUFI spokesman expressed disappointment at the outcome of the vote.
The Jewish Chronicle also reported that in Northern Ireland, a motion to boycott Israel that was put before the its largest union was dropped after the discovery that language used to justify it was misleading. The motion stated that legislation was passed in Israel that would sanction segregation between Jews and Arabs on buses. 
In April, the Teachers Union of Ireland adopted a resolution in support of an academic and cultural boycott of Israel, which the union called an “apartheid state.”

<title>Retired South African diplomat: Israel repeating apartheid</title>
<date>Tue Jun 18 17:05:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The recently retired South African ambassador to Israel has taken a parting shot at the country's treatment of Palestinians, calling it a "replication of apartheid."
Ismail Coovadia made the statement in a letter to pro-Palestinian activists.
In it, Coovadia explained his decision to reject a symbolic gift from the Israeli government — planting trees in his honor in a national park named after South Africa.
He said Israeli policies that discriminate against Palestinians appeared to be reminiscent of his experiences under South Africa's apartheid system. South Africa's post-apartheid government frequently identifies with the Palestinians.
Coovadia, who completed his four-year term in January, confirmed the letter's contents on Tuesday.
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said Coovadia did not made such complaints during his term. Israel routinely rejects the apartheid comparison.

Pet Shop Boys singer defends playing Tel Aviv
Pet Shop Boys singer Neil Tennant defended his band’s decision to play in Israel amid pressure to cancel the June 23 concert. On the British duo’s official website, Tennant wrote on Sunday: “I don’t agree with this comparison of Israel to apartheid-era South Africa. It’s a caricature. Israel has ‏(in my opinion‏) some crude and cruel policies based on defense; it also has universal suffrage and equality of rights for all its citizens both Jewish and Arab. In apartheid-era South Africa, artists could only play to segregated audiences; in Israel anyone who buys a ticket can attend a concert.” The statement came after the British-based pro-Palestinian group Innovative Minds released a poster urging the Pet Shop Boys to boycott Israel by canceling their Tel Aviv show. Headlined “Open your eyes to the reality of apartheid Israel,” the poster showed a photo of the duo wearing sunglasses stamped with the captions “1 child killed every three days” and “2 kids caged every day.”
Anti-Defamation League blasts Alice Walker over ‘fervently anti-Jewish’ book
The Anti-Defamation League on Tuesday issued a statement condemning the Pultizer Prize-winning American author Alice Walker over the “fervently anti-Jewish ideas” it said she expressed in “The Cushion in the Road: Meditation and Wandering as the Whole World Awakens to Being in Harm’s Way,” an essay collection. “Alice Walker has sunk to new lows with essays that remove the gloss of her anti-Israel activism to reveal someone who is unabashedly infected with anti-Semitism,” ADL National Director Abraham Foxman said in the statement. Last year Walker refused to authorize a new Hebrew translation of “The Color Purple,” to protest Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. ‏(Haaretz Staff‏)

<title>Culture Fop / This article is not about Barbra Streisand, Alicia Keys or the Pet Shop Boys</title>
<date>Tue Jun 25 21:04:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Yes, it’s very exciting when big international music stars come to visit. And it’s nail-biting when others exert pressure on them to cancel their shows as a political statement. Then it’s even more thrilling when they publically defend their decision to come anyway.
But this article is not about a certain Funny Girl who did her own little rendition of “Happy Birthday, Mr. President” last week in Jerusalem for a certain nonagenarian.
Neither is this article about a certain Girl on Fire who defied an open letter from a certain Lady in Purple and still plans to come to Tel Aviv in July to sing of a certain “concrete jungle where dreams are made of.”
Nor is this an article about a certain animal- and gay-friendly electronic pop duo that rocked Nokia Stadium on Sunday night and definitively stated that they disagree with the comparison of Israel to apartheid-era South Africa.
This is an article about what’s big in Israeli music news these days, including an epic head-to-head battle of reality TV singing competitions and two legendary bands that dusted off the guitars for a pair of reunion tours.
A pitch-perfect primetime face-off
For nine seasons, the only game in town for reality-TV singing shows was “Kohav Nolad” (“A Star is Born”), the Israeli version of “American Idol.” In the first few years, it produced some actual stars among its winners and runners-up that are still popular today. But, like its American cousin, recent seasons have suffered in the ratings and failed to produce artists that could succeed on their own without the show’s spotlight.
Enter “The Voice,” based on the Dutch format (also adopted in America), which gave “Kohav Nolad’s” 10th season some serious competition and almost single-handedly saved the struggling TV network, Reshet. The second season of “The Voice” just concluded in March.
Now a new kid on the block by the name of “X-Factor” (again, a foreign import) is arriving this summer to duke it out with “Kohav Nolad," setting the stage for an epic battle for viewers that could deal the final blow to the nearly decade-old franchise.
It’s a face-off that also has implications beyond bragging rights: Keshet, the network franchisee behind “Kohav Nolad," and Reshet, which produces the aforementioned “The Voice” and the new “X-Factor," are both dueling on the same channel. This may seem strange to Americans who are used to one channel owning and controlling all of its own programming, but that’s how it works here.
Both Reshet (“Network”) and Keshet (“Rainbow”) share time on Channel 2 – alternating days, in fact – and both are positioning to be the dominant concessionaire. The belters that each put before the microphone in July are singing for more than their supper: they’re soldiers in a fight for the future of Israeli TV.
Blast from the past
Meanwhile, Israeli music lovers are also getting a visit from the 1970s and 1980s, respectively, with reunion tours from the beloved rock groups Kaveret and Mashina.
Kaveret, which is often considered Israel’s first homegrown rock group, launched its first tour in 15 years last week with sold-out shows in front of 8,000 fans at the Israel Festival. It has been 40 years since the release of their first album. Kaveret (“beehive” in Hebrew, though the group is known abroad as “Poogy”), is made up of seven members and was birthed, in its earlier form, in the Israeli Defense Forces.
Mashina, whose brand of rock is a bit harder, as their name suggests and as a band of the '80s and early '90s ought to be, is one of Israel’s most successful and influential bands. They haven’t been away for quite as long a Kaveret but their series of shows in May and June constituted a type of reunion nonetheless.
Naturally, the TV war and the band reboots are related: front-men from each have served as judges on both shows. Like Israeli politics, it seems, nobody ever really disappears from the public eye.
Gidi Gov, the lead singer of Kaveret and one of Israel’s most popular voices, was a judge on “Kohav Nolad” last season, and thus went head-to-head with Mashina members Yuval Banai and Shlomi Braha, who were judges on Season 2 of “The Voice." From battling for viewers on the screen, they’re now trying to edge each other out for bums in the seats.
Back on the boob tube, Keshet and Reshet have been scrambling to get the biggest names in Israeli music behind the judges’ bench of their respective shows.
Gov won’t be returning to judge “Kohav Nolad” this season: He’s been replaced by one of Israel’s top female vocalists, Rita, who joins Mizrahi singer Eyal Golan (who also recently had his own singing competition), “Kohav Nolad’s” former host Zvika Hadar and publicist Rani Rahav.
They’ll rumble against an all-star cast at the ”X-Factor” which includes rocker Ivri Lider, Mizrahi singer Moshe Peretz, “Kohav Nolad” runner-up and apparent defector Shiri Maimon and punk rock pioneer Rami Fortis.
Giving a major boost to that show’s prospects is the addition of MC Bar Refaeli. That’s sure to inspire the troops.

Peace negotiations with the Palestinians will not be easy, Netanyahu told the cabinet on Sunday, but added that he intends to enter the talks honestly and assured them that he won’t compromise on Israel’s security needs.
The timing of the publication of the new EU guidelines to the Israeli settlements enabled Abbas and the Palestinian leadership to return to the negotiations table with Israel, writes Haaretz’s Amira Hass.
The spokeswoman of human rights group B'Tselem was injured during a Friday demonstration at Nabi Saleh after a Border Policeman shot her with a rubber bullet at close range.
Award-winning Indian director Mira Nair has turned down an invitation to be guest of honor at the Haifa Film Festival for political reasons, saying that she would not visit Israel until "Apartheid is over."
Arab members of Knesset are boycotting the formal Iftar dinner at Israel’s parliament to mark the end of the Ramadan fast over the Bedouin relocation plan, which was approved last month.
In hope to start a dialogue with the Arab world, Israel’s Foreign Ministry opened a “virtual embassy” to Gulf states.
Netanyahu’s candidate for Bank of Israel governor, Jacob Frenkel, tries to counter allegations that he stole items from the Hong Kong International Airport duty-free shop in 2006. Frenkel, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase International and former vice chairman of insurer AIG, was already BOI governor until 2000.
Israelis are flocking back to Antalya, the Turkish Mediterranean resort town, after staying away for two years due to soured diplomatic relations between Ankara and Jerusalem following the Gaza flotilla affair, in which nine Turkish citizens died.

<title>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas </title>
<date>Sat Aug 03 13:21:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said last fall that he did not want the “right of return” to Safed, where he was born in 1935 when it was a mixed city in British Mandatory Palestine. “It's my right to see it, but not to live there,” Abbas, whose family fled to Syria in the 1948 war, said in an interview aired on Israeli television in early November.
Many Palestinians were outraged – in Hamas-controlled Gaza, they burned pictures of him. Abbas had to backtrack and explain that these remarks were an expression of his personal feelings and not the position of the Palestinian Authority.
The minor uproar was a window into the quality that makes Abbas, known to most Palestinians as Abu Mazen, an appropriate person for the task of making peace with Israel: pragmatism. At the same time, many say he lacks that hard-to-define quality that Palestinians found in his predecessor, Yasser Arafat: magnetism. Lacking the qualities of a charismatic leader, many Palestinians wonder if will be able to sell his people on the compromises necessary for reaching a permanent solution with Israel. And many Israelis charge that the last time he had an opportunity to move forward with Israel, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a 10-month settlement freeze in 2009, the Palestinian leader simply marched in place.
But Abbas has made it clear on more than one occasion that he thinks the Palestinians should negotiate an end to the conflict, whether directly with Israel or by convincing the UN to recognize Palestine as a state. In December 2004, he called for an end to the violence of the Second Intifada and a return to “peaceful resistance” instead, telling the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that "the use of arms has been damaging and should end." In points of low or no-hope in recent years, he has tried to dampen talk of a third intifada by saying that it is not in the Palestinian interest.
 
"I do not support a return to armed struggle at this point in time. But, at a later date, this could be an option for the Palestinian people," Abbas told the Jordanian newspaper Ad-Dustour in a 2008 interview.  
Leaving the door open for a return to militancy – or terrorism, as the Israeli hawks would have it – is a stance that makes sense to most Arabs, but to most Jews sounds like a threat. In their mistrust of him, Israel’s rightists often point to Abbas’ doctoral dissertation, which he wrote in Soviet Russia. The paper underscores links between the pre-state Zionists and the Nazis. Some argue the paper is form of Holocaust denial, a claim he has flatly rejected. 
Unlike Arafat, who chose for himself the nom de guerre Abu Ammar and wore a handgun on the hip of his paramilitary suit, Abbas has always been viewed as a suit-wearing moderate whose jobs in the PLO involved fundraising and intelligence. (His own nickname, Abu Mazen, simply means father of Mazen, his first son).
Abbas is less adept with short quotes and spin, saving his strength for big oratories like the one he delivered at the United Nations last November, a speech which disappointed Israelis and showed the extent of his despondency with the erstwhile peace process: Nearly every mention of Israel was followed by words such as aggression, bombs, occupation, apartheid or threats. Netanyahu’s office said in a statement following the speech that Abbas' words were "full of dripping venom and false propaganda against the IDF and Israeli citizens,” adding, “This is not how someone who wants peace speaks."
In one part of the speech, however, Abbas declared that his goal was not to put an end to the state of Israel, but to carve out a state for Palestine. “We did not come here seeking to delegitimize a state established years ago, and that is Israel; rather we came to affirm the legitimacy of the State that must now achieve its independence, and that is Palestine,” he said in the speech.
Five years ago this summer, Abbas got into nitty-gritty negotiations with then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who reportedly suggested that Israel would annex about 10 percent of the West Bank – leaving the rest to the Palestinians and compensating them with a land swap, i.e. empty territory inside Israel proper.
According to the Palestine Papers, a series of leaked documents that surfaced in 2011, Olmert presented Abbas with a map but then refused to let him keep it, so Abbas sketched it out on a napkin. This so-called napkin map, the Clinton parameters, and the long-since forgotten “Abu Mazen-Yossi Beilin Document,” an unofficial paper worked out between Abbas and Beilin in October 1995, are among the key chips of institutional memory that the Palestinian president keeps in mind while he waits to see if his negotiators come back from Washington with a promising progress report.

<title>Roger Waters calls on fellow musicians to boycott Israel</title>
<date>Tue Aug 20 14:19:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
British rocker Roger Waters published an open letter calling on fellow musicians to join a boycott of Israel.
The letter, which condemns Israel for apartheid and ethnic cleansing, has been expected for several months, according to the Electronic Intifada, which first reported on its existence.
“I write to you now, my brothers and sisters in the family of Rock and Roll, to ask you to join with me, and thousands of other artists around the world, to declare a cultural boycott on Israel,” Waters wrote in the letter dated Aug. 18. The letter was previously drafted in July.
The former Pink Floyd front man said he was inspired to release the letter after British violinist Nigel Kennedy at a recent promenade concert at the Albert Hall in London called Israel an apartheid state. The BBC said it would remove his remarks in rebroadcasts of the concert.
Waters had told Electronic Intifada in March that he was drafting the letter.
Waters, who has been active in the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, or BDS, movement for at least seven years, referred to the boycott of apartheid South Africa, saying that first a trickle of artists refused to play there, leading to a “flood.”
He singled out Stevie Wonder’s canceling of a performance for the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces as a recent success story. Wonder quit his participation in the December fundraiser at the last minute under pressure from many corners.
“Please join me and all our brothers and sisters in global civil society in proclaiming our rejection of Apartheid in Israel and occupied Palestine, by pledging not to perform or exhibit in Israel or accept any award or funding from any institution linked to the government of Israel, until such time as Israel complies with international law and universal principles of human rights,” Waters wrote.
Waters recently came under fire for using at in his concerts a huge inflated balloon in the shape of a wild boar with a prominently visible Star of David, as well as a hammer and sickle, crosses and a dollar sign, among other symbols. It is a gimmick he has used for several years.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday accused Israel of being responsible for the military takeover in Egypt, saying that he has "evidence" that points to Israel's involvement.
British rocker and Pink Floyd founder Roger Waters published an open letter calling on fellow musicians to join a boycott of Israel, condemning the country for apartheid and ethnic cleansing.
A Palestinian was shot and killed overnight Tuesday during clashes with Israel Defense Forces soldiers and Border Patrol officers in the West Bank city of Jenin. Two other Palestinians were wounded.
The chairman of the Yesh Atid faction in the Knesset, MK Ofer Shelah, said on Monday that as part of a peace agreement, East Jerusalem would become the capital of the Palestinian state.
Israel issued a formal apology to Japan over disparaging comments made by the outgoing director-general of the Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs Ministry, Daniel Seaman, on his Facebook page. Earlier this month, Seaman condemned the memorial ceremonies for the victims of the World War II atom bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, saying, “I am sick of the Japanese."
Israeli intelligence says 15 radical groups, some affiliated with al-Qaida, have amassed in the Sinai Peninsula, driving the Shin Bet to form a new unit to thwart attacks on Israel.Israel’s first monument to homosexuals persecuted by the Nazis will be built in central Tel Aviv’s Meir Park (Gan Meir) later this year, near the headquarters of the Gay Center.
The Daily Beast reported Tuesday that the Obama administration has temporarily halted aid to the Egyptian government "while it conducts a broad review of the relationship" between the two countries.

<title>Ahead of Israel show, Tom Jones gets the BDS treatment</title>
<date>Wed Aug 28 04:18:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Tom Jones, who is scheduled to perform in Israel on October 27, is the latest singer to feel the pressure of the BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanction) movement, the Telegraph reported on Tuesday.
Getting the 73-year-old Welsh singer to cancel his scheduled Tel Aviv performance is the aim of a petition titled 'It's Not Unusual To Boycott Apartheid,' which was put together by 'The Cardiff Palestine Solidarity Campaign,' the paper reported, adding that according to its organizers, the petition has attracted over 1,000 signatures.
"People in Wales know you care about human rights and social justice," the letter directed at Jones reads. "We ask you to reconsider and to cancel your performance in Israel, especially as you signed a pledge not to play in South Africa during its apartheid era."
Israel's consulate in New York, in turn, chose to also pun on the singer's signature song in their retort to the effort - a mass email campaign titled "It's Not Unusual To Love Israel," in which pro-Israel activists are urged to besiege Jones with letters supporting his trip, the Telegraph added.
"Over the past few weeks, Tom Jones has become the latest victim of a fringe campaign pushing for a boycott of Israel, which bullies artists and academics from coming to Israel," read the statement, according to the Telegraph. "It is time to tell Tom Jones that no music fan should be punished because of the agenda of online bullies."
Ahead of her July concert in Israel, singer Alicia Keys was similarly urged to cancel. In addition to various pro-Palestinian groups who set up Facebook pages and petitions, reknown American author Alice Walker, a vocal proponent of the BDS movement, published an open letter calling on the singer to cancel her trip. Keys played the concert as planned.

<title>Roger Waters compares Israeli policy to Nazi Germany, slams 'powerful Jewish lobby'</title>
<date>Mon Dec 09 15:13:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
Roger Waters, the legendary former front man of Pink Floyd and outspoken supporter of the BDS movement, has equated Israeli policies to those of Nazi Germany and slammed the "extraordinary" power of the Jewish lobby in the United States.
"The Jewish lobby is extraordinary powerful here and particularly in the industry that I work in, the music industry and in rock’n roll as they say," Waters said in an interview published in the online magazine counterpunch. "I’ve spoken to people who are terrified that if they stand shoulder to shoulder with me they are going to get f-cked."
Waters also said that the Israeli religious establishment's treatment of non-Jews is reminiscent of Germany in the 1930s. Calling the rabbinate "bizarre" and outlandish to the point of disbelief, Waters stated that in their eyes all non-Jews exist "to serve them… they believe that the Indigenous people of the region that they kicked off the land in 1948 and have continued to kick off the land ever since are sub-human."
The growth of the BDS movement should come as no surprise, said Waters, when one realizes "the parallels with what went on in the 30’s in Germany are so crushingly obvious."
Waters explained his calls for a cultural boycott of Israel as a reasonable method of fighting for Palestinian independence. "[T]he occupation, the ethnic cleansing and the systematic racist apartheid Israeli regime is unacceptable… I would not have played for the Vichy government in occupied France in WWII, would not have played in Berlin either during this time. Many people did, back in the day. There were many people that pretended that the oppression of the Jews was not going on. From 1933 until 1946. So this is not a new scenario. Except that this time it’s the Palestinians being murdered."
When asked why many anti-war musicians "do not touch the issue of Palestine," Waters responded by describing the effects of Israel's ''propaganda machine" on the American public opinion. "Netanyahu’s bluster is poured all over the United States, not just Fox but also CNN and in fact in all the mainstream media. It’s like a huge bucket of crap that they are pouring into the mouth of a gullible public in my view, when they say “we are afraid of Iran, it is going to get nuclear weapons…” It’s a diversionary tactic."
The reasoning behind Israel's settlement construction policy, said Waters, "is so transparent that you’d have to have an IQ above room temperature not to understand what is going on."
"The fact of the matter is no Israeli government has been serious about creating a Palestinian state since 1948… They’ve always had the Ben Gurion agenda of kicking all the Arabs out of the country and becoming greater Israel."
In August, the British rocker published an open letter calling on fellow musicians to join a boycott of Israel.
“I write to you now, my brothers and sisters in the family of Rock and Roll, to ask you to join with me, and thousands of other artists around the world, to declare a cultural boycott on Israel.”
In case you were wondering, Waters won't be joining Lady Gaga or Justin Bieber in their upcoming tours to the Holy Land.

<title>How South Africa's apartheid regime saved Israel's defense industry</title>
<date>Tue Dec 10 23:30:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
South Africa under apartheid was the Israeli defense industry’s biggest customer and funded its most ambitious projects. The South Africans were in effect a “captive customer”: The South African army had huge funds at its disposal, but due to the sanctions regime, the West refused to supply it with advanced military systems. Israel, which was cash-starved and suffered international isolation of its own, had no such limitations.
The cooperation reached its peak in the 1980s, which turned out to be apartheid’s dying days. Israel shared with South Africa its technologically advanced systems. Senior officials in the Defense Ministry and Israel Defense Forces had excellent ties with their South African counterparts, led by Defense Minister Magnus Malan, mililtary chief of staff Constand Viljoen and heads of the South African state defense industry.
The largest deal was reportedly signed in the summer of 1988. Israel sold South Africa 60 Kfir combat planes that were no longer in use by the Israel Air Force. These were substantially upgraded and put to use by South Africa’s air force and renamed the Atlas Cheetah. The deal was worth $1.7 billion, an unprecedented sum.
The Atlas Cheetah was portrayed as a project of South Africa’s air force, which was presented as the chief contractor. Israel’s involvement was played down, even though some details were published here and there. In reality, much of the work was carried out in the Lod plant of Israel Aircraft Industries, now known as Israel Aerospace Industries. Work was also done by Israeli firms that supplied subsystems and components.
The deal helped IAI overcome a crisis following the aborted Lavi jet project in the summer of 1987. An IAI facility was converted from a plant that built new aircraft to a plant that upgraded outdated aircraft.
Israeli defense suppliers had already developed a line of products for the Lavi, like radar and electronics systems. After the IDF canceled its orders, these companies hoped to export their products. Two customers were quick to place orders. China bought Israeli technology for its J-10, which was nicknamed the Chinese Lavi. South Africa’s air force opted to purchase the old Kfir combat planes and upgrade them with Lavi systems.
The Kfir was an Israeli version of the French Mirage with a U.S.-made engine. The U.S. administration had the right to veto exports of Kfirs, since selling the engines to a third party required the Americans’ consent. Some 200 Kfir fighters were produced, but they were outdated soon enough, and the IAF wanted to offload them. The South Africans, who feared Soviet and Cuban intervention in the civil war in neighboring Angola, seized the chance to strengthen their air force.
According to foreign sources, the deal with South Africa posed a problem: The United States joined the sanctions regime on apartheid, so there was no chance it would approve the sale of Kfirs with the original engine. IAI and the South Africans found a solution by purchasing French engines that were fitted to the South African version of the Kfir. This completed the circle. The Mirage, which was designed in France and copied by Israel, regained its original engine.
Israel joined the international sanctions in 1987 but announced that it would honor existing arms deals. The Kfir deal was therefore presented as an existing deal. It seems the French, who supplied the engines, used the same excuse.
The most plausible scenario is that the deal was promoted on the Israeli side by then-Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Defense Ministry director general David Ivry, IAI director Moshe Keret, the deputy director of the minstry’s foreign department, Haim Carmon, and the head of the military delegation to Pretoria, Brig. Gen. Hagai Regev.
It’s unclear whether Rabin was present at the signing of the deal in South Africa, or if all meetings were held by lower-level officials. The Defense Ministry celebrated the signing of the agreement but concealed its details, fearing that U.S. pressure would get the deal canceled.
Several weeks after the Kfir deal was signed, IAI boasted another achievement with the launching of the first  Ofek reconnaissance satellite. South African participation in this project was crucial; without funding from the apartheid regime, the project, which was almost shelved for financial reasons, would never have happened.
But these huge projects didn’t save the apartheid regime. In 1991, U.S. pressure forced Israel to halt deals with South Africa, and Yitzhak Shamir’s government was forced to sign a commitment not to export short and midrange missiles. Still, the United States didn’t interfere with the Kfir-Cheetah deal and the jets were made operative by South Africa’s air force until they were replaced several years later.
Ecuador’s air force, which bought some of Israel’s Kfirs, later purchased 10 Cheetahs after South Africa’s air force stopped using them. This was the last roll of the dice in this huge arms deal.

<title>Alice Walker urges singer Alicia Keys to cancel July concert in Israel</title>
<date>Wed May 29 23:25:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Alice Walker, renowned American author of “The Color Purple” who made headlines in Israel last year after refusing to authorize a Hebrew translation of her prize-winning book, has published an open letter urging singer Alicia Keys to cancel her scheduled July concert in Israel.
Walker, who is a proponent of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel and participated in the 2011 Gaza Flotilla, says in her letter that although she has never met her, "It would grieve me to know you are putting yourself in danger (soul danger) by performing in an apartheid country that is being boycotted by many global conscious artists."
Invoking the civil rights movement she fought in that the 33-year R&B star is too young to have known personally, Walker calls a boycott of Israel "our only nonviolent option and, as we learned from our own struggle in America, nonviolence is the only path to a peaceful future."
Just days after Alicia Keys confirmed her summer performance in March, the BDS campaign began to kick into gear, and websites, Facebook pages, and petitions urging Keys to cancel her plans to play Tel Aviv started popping up.
In her letter, Walker specifically holds Obama and his administration accountable for Palestinian suffering, and ends the letter by urging Keys to visit Gaza.
"This is actually a wonderful opportunity for you to learn about something sorrowful, and amazing: that our government (Obama in particular) supports a system that is cruel, unjust, and unbelievably evil….Please, if you can manage it, go to visit the children in Gaza, and sing to them of our mutual love of all children, and of their right not to be harmed simply because they exist."

<date>Fri May 31 21:02:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Alicia Keys said Friday that she plans on going forward with her scheduled July concert in Israel, despite pressure from activists to drop the gig, the New York Times reported.
                
Just days after Alicia Keys confirmed her summer performance in March, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign began to kick into gear, and websites, Facebook pages, and petitions urging Keys to cancel her plans to play Tel Aviv started popping up.
                
Alice Walker, the renowned American author of "The Color Purple" and a proponent of the BDS movement against Israel, has published an open letter urging Keys to cancel the concert.
                
She said in her letter that although she has never met Keys, "It would grieve me to know you are putting yourself in danger (soul danger) by performing in an apartheid country that is being boycotted by many global conscious artists."

Responding to the calls to boycott Israel, Keys said Friday to the New York Times:“I look forward to my first visit to Israel. Music is a universal language that is meant to unify audiences in peace and love, and that is the spirit of our show.”

<title>Chief Palestinian negotiator: Two-state solution has a chance under Kerry's efforts</title>
<date>Mon May 20 23:26:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The top Palestinian negotiator with Israel on Monday threw his weight behind U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's bid to revive stalled peace talks, while describing the situation in the West Bank as apartheid worse than that suffered in South Africa.
Kerry is due to visit Jerusalem and Ramallah on Thursday and Friday. U.S.-brokered peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel broke down in 2010 in a dispute over continuing Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank. Israeli President Shimon Peres is expected to meet Kerry, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and Jordanian King Abdullah II in the Jordanian Dead Sea on Sunday, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Haaretz has learned..Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told a UN committee in New York on Monday that a settlement freeze and the release of Palestinian prisoners were not conditions for returning to negotiations, but rather obligations that Israel must fulfill.
"We have no conditions to resume negotiations," Erekat told the committee on rights of the Palestinian people, which was created by the UN General Assembly in 1975.
"Make no mistake we are exerting every possible effort in order to see that Mr. Kerry succeeds. No one benefits more from the success of Secretary Kerry than Palestinians and no one loses more from his failure than Palestinians," Erekat said.
He said that in the past two months Kerry had met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas five times, Erekat three times and that the three spoke by phone almost weekly.
"Mr. Kerry is keeping things (close to) his chest. He likes to work very, very, very below the radar and grow things like mushrooms," Erekat said. "We did everything ... in order to enable him to succeed. He is not going to wait for years or months actually, he's working very hard."
Palestinians seek to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza, where about 2.7 million Palestinians live, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Some 500,000 Israelis have settled in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Chance for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected any Israeli return to the lines that existed before Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, calling those boundaries indefensible.
"Today in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem ... I can sum up the situation with one word - apartheid. Worse than that which existed in South Africa," Erekat said. "Today Israel justifies its apartheid by the term security."
Israel's UN mission was not immediately available for comment on Erekat's briefing to the UN committee.
Erekat said the Palestinians had finished preparation to join a raft of international bodies, such as the International Criminal Court, but would not act yet in order to give Kerry and President Barack Obama "a chance" to pursue Middle East peace.
"We want to give a chance to all nations who have a common denominator of achieving two states on the 1967 lines," Erekat said. "There is a chance, there is a good opportunity now."
If the Palestinians were to join the ICC, they could file complaints with the court accusing Israel of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious crimes.
The Palestinians are able to apply to join the ICC and other international bodies after the 193-nation UN General Assembly approved the de facto recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine on Nov. 29.
It was a diplomatic setback for the United States and Israel, which were joined by only a handful of countries in voting against upgrading the Palestinian Authority's observer status to "non-member state" from "entity," like the Vatican.

<title>Desmond Tutu urges UEFA to strip Israel of Under-21 championship games</title>
<date>Wed May 29 14:43:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
South African anti-apartheid campaigner Desmond Tutu has joined calls for UEFA to move the Under-21 European soccer championship from Israel because of the the state's treatment of Palestinian sport.
UEFA has resisted the requests but Tutu's letter, to Britain's Guardian newspaper, which was also signed by ex-Mali striker Frederic Kanoute and a number of prominent sympathizers of the Palestinian cause, is aimed at increasing the pressure.
Last week UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino, speaking after the UEFA Congress in London, refused to condemn Israel or accept that the competition, which runs from June 5-18, should be moved.
Infantino told a news conference: "UEFA and the Israeli FA is responsible for football, it cannot be held responsible for the politics of a national government.
"And we have no plans to move the tournament, which is being held legitimately in a UEFA member association."
After last week's Congress, pro-Palestine demonstrators broke into a banquet being held for UEFA delegates, interrupting proceedings, but were removed by security officers.
Palestinians complain that Israeli authorities restrict the movement of their athletes between the Gaza Strip, which is ruled by the Islamist Hamas faction that calls for Israel's destruction, and the Israeli-occupied West Bank in which Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah group exercises limited civilian rule.
Israel limits the movement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to the West Bank citing security concerns but says it has eased travel for athletes.
UEFA, European soccer's governing body, last week agreed tougher sanctions to combat racism among players and officials and the authors of the letter feel the same standards should be applied to Israel.
Tutu's letter read: "On Friday, delegates from European football associations gathered in a London hotel for UEFA's annual congress. They agreed new, strict guidelines to deal with racism, suggesting a commendable determination to combat discrimination in the sport.
"We find it shocking that this same organization shows total insensitivity to the blatant and entrenched discrimination inflicted on Palestinian sportsmen and women by Israel.
"We call on UEFA, even at this late stage, to reverse the choice of Israel as a venue."
The Israeli FA has consistently said that UEFA will not bring political issues into the soccer arena.
Tutu, 81, the former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for standing up against white-minority rule in South Africa.
He played a pivotal role in the downfall of apartheid and subsequently worked to heal wounds in South Africa's traumatized society.

<title>Ireland teachers' union brands Israel 'apartheid state,' calls for boycott </title>
<date>Sun Apr 07 18:45:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
The Teachers Union of Ireland has adopted a resolution in support of an academic and cultural boycott of Israel, which the union called an “apartheid state.”
The motion, passed unanimously on April 4 during the union’s annual congress, calls for “all members to cease all cultural and academic collaboration with Israel, including the exchange of scientists, students and academic personalities, as well as all cooperation in research programs,” according to a report on the website of the Center for Research of Globalization.
Gerry Quinn, the union’s vice president, seconded the motion for a call to boycott Israel.
David Harris, the executive director of the American Jewish Committee, said in a statement that the Irish teachers’ action “undermines the cause of Israeli-Palestinian peace by singling out, unfairly and without reference to the facts, one side in the conflict for targeting and isolation.”

<title>Opposition slams 'draconian restrictions' on marriage rights //Israel extends law restricting unification of citizens with spouses from 'enemy states' - National</title>
<date>Sun Apr 14 16:37:00 IDT 2013</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet decided unanimously on Sunday to extend the Citizenship Law restricting the "family reunification" of Israeli citizens with certain foreign partners for an additional year.
                
The law denies entry or living permits to partners who are considered a security threat, among them Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, and citizens of enemy countries or from areas involved in long-term conflict with Israel. The law affects mainly Israeli Arab citizens and their families from the West Bank and Gaza.
                
The proposal brought before the cabinet on Sunday was submitted by Interior Minister Gideon Sa'ar, and was formulated based on a Shin Bet opinion regarding the volatility of partners from the Gaza Strip.
                
Meretz party head Zahava Gal-On slammed the decision as placing "draconian restrictions on Israeli Arab citizens' right to marry," calling the designation of all Palestinians as a security threat "racist" and discriminatory.
                
Gal-On, who petitioned the High Court against the Citizenship Law, said that "the only correct way is to individually evaluate everyone asking for family unification." She added that the government's approach was preventing thousands of people who live in Israel from attaining citizenship and achieving social rights.
                
Palestinian official Saeb Erekat called the law "racist" and an attempt to "distort the Palestinian social fabric and force the displacement of Palestinian families." He called on the international community to “seriously examine the pattern of Israeli policies contributing to a situation of apartheid and to look into the wider effects and implications of the Israeli government’s precondition of being recognized as a Jewish State.”
                
Israel generally grants citizenship to spouses of Israelis in a gradual process. In the spirit of this process, a similar process was instituted for the naturalization of spouses of permanent residents, though the process is a little longer. A 2002 temporary order excluded Palestinian spouses from these processes and barred them from becoming Israeli citizens.
                
In May 2006, the High Court rejected numerous petitions asking to overturn the Citizenship Law. However, most of the justices wrote that the law constitutes a violation of basic rights, mainly the right to a family life.
                
In March 2007, in a hearing surrounding later petitions against the law, the state said that an amended version of the temporary order was expected to be approved by the Knesset, and the court consequently ruled that the petitioners would have to revise their petitions in accordance with the amended orders after they were made public. After the hearing, the amended law was made public, and the petitioners maintained that the new version not only extended the validity of the law until July 2008, it also expanded the geographic jurisdiction of the law, making it applicable to spouses from Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq as well as other areas on which the government was free to decide.
                
Arabs make up about 20 percent of Israel's population of 7 million. About 3 million Palestinians live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Many families were divided by cease-fire lines after wars, and over the years, marriage between the two groups has been common.
                
Since 1993, more than 100,000 Palestinians have obtained Israeli permits in this manner and some Israelis see this as a security threat.

<title>Israeli security forces brace for Palestinian protests</title>
<date>Fri Mar 01 07:15:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
	Palestinian protests, mainly over the issue of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, are expected to resume on Friday with both organized and spontaneous marches throughout the West Bank and Jerusalem.
	In Jerusalem, demonstrations in support of the prisoners are slated to take place Friday morning at the Old City’s Damascus Gate and the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound on the Temple Mount. On Thursday, messages went sent to Palestinians’ cell phones urging all of them, and especially young people, to participate in the protests.
	In the West Bank, the main focus of activity will be the weekly march in Bili’in. Hundreds of people are also expected to demonstrate near the village of Salfit. Confrontations with Israeli soldiers may erupt at checkpoints, especially the Qalandiyah checkpoint near Jerusalem and the checkpoint near the Ofer army base.
	A demonstration is also planned in Hebron to commemorate the anniversary of Baruch Goldstein’s massacre of 29 Muslim worshippers at the Cave of the Patriarchs in 1994. The demonstration was organized by the Committee to Protect Hebron, the Popular Campaign Against the Fence and the city’s left-wing politicians. The Palestinians will be joined by Jewish and Arab activists from the left-wing group Hithabrut-Tarabut.
	“Hebron isn’t only subject to foreign occupation, but also to a racist regime of separation in the service of the settlers,” said Johayna Saifi of Hithabrut-Tarabut. “This separation regime expanded following the massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs and became even more severe after the outbreak of the second intifada [in 2000]. It makes the residents’ lives a living hell and paralyzes the heart of the city. At the same time, the city of Hebron – one of the most important economic centers in the territories – is strangled by a system of checkpoints that cuts it off from all its surroundings. In Hebron, apartheid rules, and we’re coming to the city in order to fight it.”
	“It’s clear to us,” said Hisham Sharabati of the Committee to Protect Hebron, “that the settlers are the long arm of the occupation, and cooperation with them by the army and police isn’t accidental, it’s part of the process of settlement and dispossession.”
	Over the past week, discontent in the West Bank had simmered into violence after a Palestinian detainee, Arafat Jaradat, died in Megiddo Prison on Saturday. According to Israel Jaradat died of a heart attack, but the Palestinians allege that he died of torture in the hand of Israeli security personnel.

<title>Palestinians warn of 'apartheid state' if Netanyahu wins Israeli election </title>
<date>Sat Jan 19 18:53:00 IST 2013</date>
<content>
	The Palestinian president warned on Friday that Benjamin Netanyahu's expected victory in next week's election could lead to an Arab-majority country that will eventually replace what is now Israel – unless he pursues a more moderate path of a two-state solution to the conflict.
	Mohammed Ishtayeh, a top aide to Abbas, said that the president has been warning that Israel could end up with "an apartheid-style state, similar to the one of former South Africa."
	Israeli backers of creation of a Palestinian state say relinquishing control of the Palestinian territories and its residents is the only way to ensure Israel's future as a democracy with a Jewish majority.
	If that does not happen, Ishtayeh said, "we Palestinians will be the majority and will struggle for equality. He added that Abbas has told the Israelis that "there are Palestinians who are now calling for the one-state solution, because they no longer [consider] the two-state solution viable."
	President Abbas has been careful not to intervene in Tuesday's Israeli election, but it is no secret that the Palestinians hope that Netanyahu will either be ousted or at least soften his position in a new term. He has shown no sign of doing so, and opinion polls showing hardline, pro-settlement parties well ahead days ahead of the vote have led to a sense of despair among the Palestinians.
	During Netanyahu's current term, the Israeli leader has pressed forward with construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The international community considers settlement construction illegal or illegitimate. And the Palestinians have refused to negotiate with Netanyahu while he continues to allow settlements to be built, saying it is a sign of bad faith.
	Abbas's office said the Palestinian president spoke with multiple leaders in 2012 from Israel's centrist opposition, including lawmakers from the Labor, Kadima and Meretz parties, along with mayors, university professors and social activists. He said a mayor from Netanyahu's Likud Party was among them.
	Labor parliamentarian Daniel Ben-Simon told the AP he met with Abbas in Ramallah recently and was warned that time is running out for a two-state solution.	"Abbas said the two-state solution benefits both nations but he warned that if there is no two-state solution within the next two or three years then it won't be practical anymore," Ben-Simon said. "Abbas told me explicitly ... the idea of a one-state solution is escalating among Palestinians."
	Palestinian officials have been closely following the Israeli election campaign, fearing Netanyahu's ambitious plans for settlement construction over the next four years could prove lethal to their dreams of a state, Ishtayeh said. More than 500,000 Israelis already live in settlements that dot the West Bank and ring east Jerusalem, the Palestinians' hoped-for capital.
	Some in Abbas' circle are holding out hope that U.S. President Barack Obama will re-engage in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and, freed from domestic electoral considerations in his second term, get tougher with Netanyahu on settlements. Another aide, Nabil Shaath, suggested Europe is ready to jump in with its own peace plan if Washington is not.
	But short of trying to rally international opinion, it seems Abbas can do little if Netanyahu wins Tuesday.
	Israeli polls indicate that a majority of seats in Israel's 120-member parliament will go to right-wing, pro-settler or Jewish ultra-Orthodox religious parties. Likud is the largest among them. Netanyahu could comfortably form a coalition government with these parties, seen as his natural ideological allies. Likud's new slate of candidates is headed by hard-line lawmakers who oppose territorial concessions to the Palestinians, and a likely coalition partner, the pro-settler Jewish Home, even advocates annexing large chunks of the West Bank. Even if Netanyahu adds a centrist party to the mix, he's unlikely to shift course from the pro-settler policies of his current government.
	Under Netanyahu, construction reportedly began on nearly 6,900 settlement homes in the West Bank.
	That's a bit less than what was started by Netanyahu's predecessor Ehud Olmert, but many of the new homes are deeper in the West Bank, the Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now said this week. Thousands more apartments are in various stages of planning, Peace Now said, predicting an "explosion" of settlement construction in coming years.
	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his position on settlements Friday in an interview with Channel 1 TV.
	"I don't believe that settlements are the root of the conflict, I don't believe that territorial dimensions are the root of the conflict; the root of the conflict was and remains the refusal to recognize the Jewish state within any border," Netanyahu said. "I am not in favor of a binational state. We need to reach a solution. I don't want to rule the Palestinians and I don't want them to rule us and threaten our existence."
	"We believe the two-state solution is still possible, but Netanyahu and his current and upcoming coalition are killing this solution, they ... will be intensifying the buildings in the settlements, and they have no peace platform," Ishtayeh said.	The conflict with the Palestinians has largely been missing from Israeli political discourse this campaign season in Israel. The centrist Labor Party, which led peace talks with the Palestinians in the past, has shifted almost exclusively to domestic concerns, such as growing income gaps.
	Just one party, Hatnuah, led by former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, has focused on peace talks. Livni has warned that Israel's existence could be threatened without a peace accord, yet her message has not gained much traction.
	Palestinians believe hopes for their state are slipping further away with each new settlement home, and that partition of the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River may soon no longer be possible.
	Settlements are at the core of the paralysis in peace efforts talks since late 2008. Netanyahu refuses to freeze construction, rebuffing Abbas who says there is no point in negotiating while settlements steadily gobble up more of the occupied lands.	The standoff is likely to continue, though the Palestinians believe their diplomatic leverage has improved.
	In November, the UN General Assembly recognized a state of Palestine in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem. The vote, while largely symbolic, affirmed the 1967 frontier which the Palestinians want to be the base line for future border talks. Netanyahu, while willing to negotiate, won't accept the 1967 lines as a point of reference and wants to keep all of Jerusalem and parts of the West Bank.	Some Palestinian officials hope Obama will now be tougher with Netanyahu after what they considered a disappointing first term.
	The Americans "keep talking about negotiations and the need to restart the negotiations," Shaath said. "But what is needed is for the U.S. to pressure Israel to stop settlement activities and to go to real negotiations, to reach an agreement within six months."

<title>South African government woos voters living in Israel</title>
<date>Thu Jan 30 20:13:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
The South African government is encouraging South African-born Israelis to take advantage of an amendment to the country’s electoral law that allows them to vote from abroad in the upcoming national election, but some immigrants have expressed doubts about the prospects of the campaign's success.
Under the terms of a law passed in November, all South African citizens who live overseas and register at their local South African embassy or consulate by February 7 will be eligible to vote. This marks a change from the last election, in 2009, when only those South Africans who had already registered in South Africa or were traveling abroad on business could cast overseas ballots.
The South African Embassy in Israel opened on two consecutive Saturdays this month to process applications, in addition to its regular weekday hours. The umbrella organization representing South African Jewry has also jumped on the bandwagon, with the South African Jewish Board of Deputies targeting South African-born Israelis through social media as part of its “Make Us Count” voter awareness campaign.
“I’m really surprised at how much the government has invested to promote registration overseas,” said Dave Bloom, the director of Telfed, Israel's South African Zionist Federation. “I’ve spoken to a number of South Africans who find it strange that they think there’s a significant number of people here who would vote.”
Yesterday morning, Telfed announced on its website that a delegation of officials from the ANC would visit Israel next week to meet with South African-born Israelis and drum up support for the party. But by the afternoon, Wendy Kahn, the national director of the Jewish Board of Deputies and one of the trip’s organizers, told Haaretz that the ANC delegation had backed out of the trip for unspecified reasons.
However, a member of the ANC who was involved in planning the trip said there is still “a good chance” that the delegation will come. “We are just working through the logistics,” said the member, who was not authorized to speak publicly.
The visit would come at a time of heightened tension between the Israeli government and the ANC, South Africa’s ruling party since the end of apartheid in 1994. At the last ANC National Congress in 2012, the party passed a resolution calling on South Africans to support the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign against Israel. In the past two years, the country’s deputy minister of international relations announced that South Africans should avoid visiting Israel because of its treatment of the Palestinians, and the minister of trade pressured importers to label all products produced in the West Bank. Meanwhile, in what many perceived to be a politically motivated snub, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled his plans to attend last month’s memorial service for the late South African president and ANC leader Nelson Mandela, citing the high cost of the trip.
Darryl Egnal, a native of Johannesburg who has lived in Israel for four and a half years, said she was surprised to hear the ANC may be sending a delegation to the country she says it has consistently demonized.
“I think South Africans will have a lot of really pertinent questions to ask them because the community is very upset about the one–sided stance that South Africa is taking on Israel,” Egnal said.
Earlier this month, Byron Gerber registered to vote at the embassy in Ramat Gan. Gerber, who immigrated to Israel five years ago, said he planned to vote (“not for the ANC”) because most of his family still lives in South Africa.
“The future of South Africa is quite important for me,” he said. “I just feel that there’s too much chaos happening in the country and it can do much better.”
But Gerber may be in the minority. Several of his South African-born friends told him that they were not interested in taking part in the election. “They feel that whatever happens in South Africa, we should just let it be,” Gerber said.
There are approximately 25,000 South Africans living in Israel, according to the South African Embassy, yet the number of prospective voters is thought to be small. Community members said in interviews that many of the immigrants left South Africa during the apartheid era and do not have the necessary documentation to register, or are no longer tied emotionally or politically to their native country.
According to a report issued by the country’s electoral commission, 9,857 South Africans voted from abroad in the 2009 election. The committee did not release the number of votes cast from Israel, but indicated it was fewer than the 374 cast from the Netherlands.
The only other election in which South African expatriates could vote was in 1994, when turnout was relatively high in Israel due to the excitement surrounding the country’s first democratic election. Several people recalled standing in long lines at the Tel Aviv Fairgrounds to cast their ballots.
The date of the upcoming election has yet to be declared by South African President Jacob Zuma, but is expected to be some time in the spring. The leading candidates for president are Zuma, of the African National Congress, and anti-apartheid activist Mamphela Ramphele of the Democratic Alliance, which has led the opposition since 1999.

<title>Israel is losing its grip on evangelical Christians </title>
<date>Tue Mar 11 16:40:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
Support for Israel is weakening among evangelical Christians, prompting a new struggle for the hearts and minds of younger members of America’s largest pro-Israel demographic group.
While hard numbers are not available, evangelical leaders on both sides of the divide on Israel agree that members of the millennial generation do not share their parents’ passion for the Jewish state; many are seeking some form of evenhandedness when approaching the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“What is happening is that the hard line of Christian Zionists was not successfully passed forward to the next generation, because it was based on theological themes that are now being questioned by younger evangelicals,” said David Gushee, professor of Christian ethics and director of the Center for Theology and Public Life at Mercer University in Atlanta.
The grip of Christian Zionists over young evangelicals has been loosening for several years, according to observers within the community. But in recent weeks, the leading evangelical pro-Israel organization, Christians United for Israel, has set off alarm bells in articles and interviews decrying the inroads made by pro-Palestinian activists into the evangelical community. CUFI’s leaders are calling for a new strategy to block them.
“The only way of solving a problem is when people know about it,” said CUFI’s executive director, David Brog, who has been leading the effort to win back millennial evangelicals. “This is the best way to rally our troops.”
Brog penned a lengthy article, published in the spring edition of Middle East Quarterly, in which he detailed what he views as a growing phenomenon and the reasons behind it. Titled “The End of Evangelical Support for Israel?” the article laments that “questioning Christian support for the Jewish state is fast becoming a key way for millennials to demonstrate Christian compassion and bona fides.” Brog argues that younger evangelicals are now “in play” and their support for Israel can no longer be taken for granted.
This conclusion is based primarily on gut feelings and anecdotal data. In June 2011, the Pew Research Center conducted a survey among evangelical leaders convened in Cape Town, South Africa, for the third Lausanne Congress of World Evangelization. The findings indicated lower support for Israel than previously believed. A majority of American evangelical leaders (49%) expressed neutrality when asked if they sympathize more with Israelis or with Palestinians. Thirty percent expressed support for Israelis, 13% for the Palestinians.
The survey polled only leaders who participated in this international conference and did not offer insight into the views of rank-and-file evangelicals. But it highlighted the fact that only a minority within the evangelical leadership today hold strong pro-Israel views when it comes to Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and attendant conflict with the Palestinians.
Still, Christian Zionism is by far the largest organized voice on Middle East issues among evangelicals. CUFI, led by the Rev. John Hagee, founder of Cornerstone Church, in San Antonio, has 1.6 million registered supporters and a staff of 25 full-time employees. With an operating budget of more than $7 million, CUFI organizes dozens of pro-Israel events throughout the country and an annual Washington conference that brings together evangelical activists and politicians.
CUFI’s leaders are now trying to mobilize funders and supporters to confront the shift among younger members of their community. The challenge they face is made up of individuals, campus activists and professors, small organizations and even documentary films that depict Israel as encroaching on Christian freedom of faith in the Holy Land.
On university campuses, pro-Palestinian Christians have seen some success in the face of CUFI’s more established 120-chapter campus operation. Activists in Illinois’s Wheaton College, a leading Christian school, protested a planned CUFI event on campus in 2009; in Tulsa, Okla., Oral Roberts University has appointed a harsh critic of Israel to its board of trustees, and at Bethel University, in Minnesota, President Jay Barnes visited Israel and the Palestinian territories on a trip that changed participants’ views on the conflict. Barnes’s wife, Barbara Barnes, published a poem after the trip, in which she wrote: “Apartheid has become a way of life. I believe God mourns.”
American evangelicals sympathetic to the Palestinians are also bringing co-religionists to Israel and the West Bank for tours and conferences. This week, Bethlehem Bible College and the Bethlehem-based Holy Land Trust are hosting their third “Christ at the Checkpoint” conference. Speakers at the gathering, which presents a Palestinian perspective on Israel’s occupation of the West Bank for Christians, include Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish, the Gaza physician who worked closely with both Arabs and Israeli Jews until his three daughters were killed in their home by Israeli tank fire during the 2008 Gaza military campaign; William Wilson, the president of Oral Roberts University; and Gary Burge, a theology professor at Wheaton College and author of the book, “Whose Promise? What Christians Are Not Being Told About Israel and the Palestinians.”
The conference’s 12-point “manifesto” strongly condemns “all forms of violence” and warns against the “stereotyping of all faith forms that betray God’s commandment to love our neighbors and enemies.” It also rejects “any exclusive claim to the land of the Bible in the name of God” and states that “racial ethnicity alone does not guarantee the benefits of the Abrahamic Covenant.”
For some on Christian college campuses, the appeal of pro-Palestinian views may be part of a general trend among young evangelicals to question the conservative ways of their parents’ generation. Some students are pursuing a theological understanding of their religion that is more progressive on social issues. Polls conducted in recent years indicate that young white evangelicals are less conservative on issues of same-sex marriage, abortion and contraception. They are also less aligned with the Republican Party. This same trend of political diversification may be taking place on international issues.
CUFI’s concern, as voiced by Brog in his article, is about the younger generation of evangelical leaders; unlike such figures as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, they are not vocal about the issue of Israel. He describes the new generation of evangelical opinion makers as a “largely well-coiffed and fashionably dressed bunch dedicated to marketing Christianity to a skeptical generation by making it cool, compassionate, and less overtly political.”
One of the organizations gaining the most attention on this issue is the Telos Group, a Washington-based not-for-profit set up five years ago that describes itself as “pro-Israeli, pro-Palestinian, pro-American, and pro-peace.” In an interview on Glenn Beck’s “TheBlaze TV,” Brog singled out Telos, saying: “This is not your parents’ anti-Israel group. These guys are savvy, these guys are smart.”
Telos, which focuses a significant part of its work on faith communities, has to date taken 43 groups on tours of Israel and the Palestinian territories. President and co-founder Gregory Khalil said the group intentionally engages with a variety of Israelis and Palestinians on their trips. “I actually think David Brog could learn a lot about Israel if he would join one of our trips,” Khalil said, arguing that Brog mischaracterized the work of Telos.
But while the budding debate in the evangelical world over Israel is real, its proportions may be overstated. “We’re a tiny organization,” Khalil said of his group, which has only two staff members. Other publications and groups cited by CUFI as pro-Palestinian are also much smaller than CUFI’s own pro-Israel operation.
CUFI is not waiting for them to grow larger. In January, at a Jewish fundraising event, the group presented its plan to take two groups a year of young evangelical opinion leaders to Israel. “We need to use the same tool to fight back,” CUFI declared in its pitch for Jewish donor support. The group is also launching speaking tours on campuses, and intends to invest in videos and social media activity that will monitor Christian influencers and “confront them when they cross the line.”
The glaring precedent that pro-Israel evangelicals cite to justify their approach is the path taken by the mainline Protestant churches. In the past, many were sympathetic to Israel, or at worst neutral. But some have since become a stronghold of pro-Palestinian views in the American Christian world. A few groups, such as the Presbyterians, have been leading the way in calls for divestment and boycott against Israel.
But Gushee argued that evangelicals are unlikely to take this path. The mainline Protestant churches today may be aggressively anti-Israel, he said, but the shift among evangelicals “is not from pro-Israel to anti-Israel, but from pro-Israel to a more balanced approach.”

<title>Israel leaving U.S. Jews bitterly divided</title>
<date>Mon Jun 09 21:41:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Once a unifying cause for generations of American Jews, Israel is now bitterly dividing Jewish communities.
Jewish organizations are withdrawing invitations to Jewish speakers or performers considered too critical of Israel, in what opponents have denounced as an ideological litmus test meant to squelch debate. Some Jewish activists have formed watchdog groups, such as Citizens Opposed to Propaganda Masquerading as Art, or COPMA, and JCC Watch, to monitor programming for perceived anti-Israel bias. They argue Jewish groups that take donations for strengthening the community shouldn't be giving a platform to Israel's critics.
American campuses have become ideological battle zones over Israeli policy in the Palestinian territories, with national Jewish groups sometimes caught up on opposing sides of the internal debate among Jewish students. The "Open Hillel" movement of Jewish students is challenging speaker guidelines developed by Hillel, the major Jewish campus group, which bars speakers who "delegitimize" or "demonize" Israel. Open Hillel is planning its first national conference in October.
And in a vote testing the parameters of Jewish debate over Israel, the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, a national coalition that for decades has represented the American Jewish community, denied membership in April to J Street, the 6-year-old lobby group that describes itself as pro-Israel and pro-peace and has sometimes criticized the Israeli government. Opponents of J Street have been showing a documentary called "The J Street Challenge," in synagogues and at Jewish gatherings around the country, characterizing the group as a threat from within.
"I believe this has reached a level of absurdity now," said Rabbi Sharon Brous, founder of the IKAR-LA Jewish community in California, which is considered a national model for reinvigorating religious life. "Even where people are acting from a place of love and deep commitment that Israel remains a vital and vibrant state, they are considered outside the realm. It's seen as incredibly threatening and not aligned with the script the American Jewish community expects."
In 2012, when Israel carried out an offensive in Gaza after an upsurge in rocket fire, Brous wrote an email to IKAR members that was published in The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles. She supported Israel's right to defend itself, while also urging recognition of Palestinian suffering.
The result? She was overwhelmed with hate mail, and inspired competing op-eds and letters in the Journal from Jewish clergy and others until a prominent rabbi called for an end to the recriminations and name-calling.
American Jews have always vigorously debated Israeli policy, but mostly within the community and with an understanding that differences would be set aside if the Jewish state faced an existential threat. But the discussion within the U.S. has become more reflective of the very broad debate within Israel.
"It's a very old issue that many countries face and now Israel faces: to what extent should domestic debate carry over when you're abroad?" said Jonathan Sarna, a Brandeis University scholar of American Jewish history. "The critics of J Street and the like say, 'Of course, it's fine in Israel because the minute they call up the reserves, all politics disappear. Moreover, they have to live with the results of their decision.' Their argument is that there should be a great difference between what you can do and say in Israel and what you can do or say in America. There are all sorts of enemies who make use of the words in America differently than they do in Israel."
Internal American Jewish conflict has worsened as many Israel advocates have come to feel under siege in the U.S. The international boycott movement against Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians has gained some momentum in the U.S., and critics increasingly draw analogies between Israeli policies and South African apartheid.
The clashes among American Jews are partly colored by the sharp tone of overall left-right debate within the U.S. Earlier this year, the Brandeis chapter of J Street and one of its most vocal antagonists on campus, Daniel Mael, accused each other of harassment and made complaints to campus police. Mael, a 21-year-old Orthodox Jew, wrote a series of posts for the conservative site truthrevolt.org accusing J Street of bringing "Israel bashers" on campus.
J Street has said its opponents often distort the group's statements. The liberal lobby created a "Myths & Facts" page on its website challenging the claims.
Many leaders of the older, more-established organizations say the divisions are not as broad or deep as some claim. Defenders of the presidents' conference argue their 50-member association includes liberal organizations with similar views to J Street, and they blame the lobby group for whipping up a backlash to the vote.
The presidents' conference was formed in the 1950s in response to what was considered a failure of U.S. Jewish leaders during World War II to speak to American policy makers with one voice. Members were expected to keep internal discussion and voting private.
Among the 17 conference members who voted for J Street in April were the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, and the Conservative and Reform Jewish movements. Twenty-two conference members voted no and three others abstained. The remaining member groups did not send a representative to vote.
Farley Weiss, president of the National Council of Young Israel, an association for Orthodox synagogues, dismissed J Street's members as students with a skewed understanding of Mideast history because of the "one-sided, left view" on U.S. college campuses. Weiss was among the few members of the Conference of Presidents who campaigned publicly to block J Street's admission to the group.
"Their views are not part of what I consider the mainstream of the Jewish community," Weiss said.
"I wouldn't characterize them as enemies of Israel," Weiss said. "I would characterize it that their self-avowed statement that they are pro-Israel is not accurate."
The split among U.S. Jews has its roots in the Jewish settlement building in the occupied territories after the 1967 Six Day War, which sparked debate in the U.S. and in Israel over whether the settlements helped or hurt Israeli security.
At the same time, American Judaism was splintering. The strictly traditional Orthodox population grew, but so did the number of Jews who left organized religious life. Jews were marrying outside the faith at a high rate, and their families were generally less involved in the Jewish community and less tied to Israel.
"We now have more people who care deeply about Israel and more people who care very little about Israel," said Steven M. Cohen, a professor at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute on Religion who specializes in research on the American Jewish community.
Meanwhile, liberal Reform Judaism, which has worked for years to underscore its deep commitment to the Jewish state, grew to become the largest movement in American Judaism. The result: a pro-Israel American Jewish community largely split between conservatives and liberals, both emotionally attached to Israel but with conflicting outlooks on many Israeli policies.
At Temple Sharey Tefilo-Israel, a Reform Jewish synagogue in South Orange, New Jersey, Rabbi Daniel Cohen struggles to hold the ever-shrinking common ground among his congregants over Israel. Before Cohen delivers a sermon on the subject, he re-reads what he wrote and asks himself, "How are they going to hear it?"
From the pulpit, he tries to weave together the views of doves and hawks among the 850 families in his congregation, comparing Israel to a flawed friend who nonetheless should be defended against slander. Still, he hears complaints — about his personal involvement with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the long-established lobbying group, and his simultaneous support for congregants active in J Street.
"I'm very, very careful to focus on the importance of Israel and the American Jewish community and being involved in activism. I'm not proscriptive about how people should get involved," said Cohen, the temple's senior rabbi for 16 years.
A Pew Research Center survey conducted last year found more than two-thirds of American Jews feel somewhat or very attached to Israel, but only 38 percent believe the Israeli government is sincerely pursuing peace with the Palestinians and 44 percent said settlement construction hurts Israeli national security. (In the same poll, just 12 percent of U.S. Jews said Palestinian leaders were making a sincere effort to resolve the conflict.)
Many Jewish leaders worry the infighting could not only undermine U.S. support for Israel, but also drive away the younger American Jews who are pressing for a broader definition of what it means to be pro-Israel.
"The attacks are stronger and more vicious sometimes ...," said Cohen. "If you're not hearing other perspectives, I don't know how you can have an honest, open debate."

<title>Queers Against Israeli Apartheid to march in Toronto's Pride parade: this time, unopposed</title>
<date>Wed Jun 25 17:51:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Queers Against Israeli Apartheid will march in Toronto's Pride parade unhindered this year, as its opponents decided their campaigns against the group have only given it free publicity.
“This year, we decided that we were not going to provide [QuAIA] with the gift of free publicity,” Howard English, a spokesperson for Toronto's Center for Israel and Jewish Affairs, told the Canadian National Post.
Queers Against Israeli Apartheid, formed "in solidarity with queers in Palestine" (according to its website), has marched in Toronto's parade since 2010, despite opposition from some members of the city council and Mayor Rob Ford, who threatened to cut the parade's funding unless the group was booted out.
However, a 2012 municipal report concluded that despite their opponents' claims, the phrase "Israeli Apartheid" does not violate Toronto's anti-discrimination policy, and a further committee ruled the group's participation in the parade does not constitute discrimination against Jews, either.
“Their message needs to be opposed because it’s clearly a lie,” English told the Post. However, he said that the efforts against QuAIA have only aided it to get its message out. English said that though they are opposed to the group, they no longer want to be "upset by it."
"We want to demonstrate to all those who are participating in Pride and who are watching Pride that Israeli society is totally unlike any portrait provided by [QuAIA],” he told the Post.
His approach was echoed by Justine Apple, executive director of Jewish LGBT group Kulanu Toronto, who said they will focus on promoting Israel as a champion of LGBT rights.
“We’re not allowing ourselves to be distracted and consumed by QuAIA. Just like Kulanu Toronto, Pride has always stood for respect, tolerance and integrity,” she told the Post.
But James Pasternak, a member of the city council and an opponent of QuAIA, said he was surprised with the group's lack of opposition this year, and expressed his belief that that it had less to do with a conscious strategy on the opponents' part and more to do with exhaustion with the issue.
"In past years, there were hours of deputations at executive committee in which both sides of the debate would come and argue their case,” he told the Post. “That didn’t occur this year. I think there may be some fatigue on the issue. Some of the players felt, I would assume, that we’ll try a year of ignoring it and see if it goes away.”
On its part, QuAIA welcomed the notion of an unopposed march on June 29's Pride parade, though its spokesperson admitted the public debate in previous years has raised interest in the group.
“Criticism we can take because this is a debate," spokesperson Tim McCaskell told the Post. "The problem has been the attempt to actually ban us, to stop that debate. The fact that these attempts to ban us have finally sort of run out of steam means that we can focus on our real message."
According to McCaskell, QuAIA aims to expose what he termed as "Israel's pinkwashing campaign," defined on the group's website as the cultivation of an image of Israel "as an oasis of gay tolerance in the Middle East" in attempt to distract the critics of its human rights violations.

<title>Stones hurled at home of Netherlands chief rabbi</title>
<date>Thu Jul 17 19:57:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
A chief rabbi of the Netherlands said unidentified individuals hurled stones at his home in what he described as the second anti-Semitic attack on him in a week.
Rabbi Binyomin Jacobs said the latest attack took place at 5:00 A.M. Thursday, when two stones were hurled through a window of his home in Amersfoort.
An earlier incident outside his home on July 10 ended without damage, he said. Jacobs’ home has been targeted five times in recent years, he told JTA.
“The fact that these attacks are recurrent shows the depth of hatred that exists against Jews,” he added.
On Thursday, the pro-Israel organization CIDI prepared for a support rally to express solidarity with Israel for its military operation against Hamas and other terrorists in Gaza. Israel launched the operation last week amid ongoing rocket fire on Israeli cities and towns.
One Israeli and more than 200 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting, which triggered a wave of anti-Semitic incidents across Western Europe and especially France.
Anti-Israel protesters said they would hold a counterdemonstration opposite the CIDI rally at Amsterdam’s Dam Square.
Khalid Sinouh, a goalkeeper for Rotterdam’s Sparta soccer team, called CIDI “a criminal organization” and a “pro-apartheid organization” on Twitter on Thursday, the Telegraaf daily reported.
A wave of anti-Semitic attacks in Western Europe has coincided with Israel's operation in Gaza, including calls to slaughter Jews at a protest in Antwerp on Saturday. On Sunday in Paris, approximately 200 Jews were besieged inside a Paris synagogue by dozens of young men who confronted police and Jewish guards outside in what turned into a street brawl before police reinforcements dispersed the crowd.

<title>Israeli ship unloads cargo in California despite pro-Palestinian protest</title>
<date>Thu Aug 21 11:39:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Officials say an Israeli-owned commercial ship has unloaded its cargo at a port in Northern California after being delayed for days by a group of pro-Palestinian protesters.
International Longshore and Warehouse Union spokeswoman Jennifer Sargent said about 30 workers unloaded cargo from the Piraeus, a ship from Zim Integrated Shipping Services, Israel’s international maritime cargo company, at the Port of Oakland starting Tuesday night, despite the presence of a small number of protesters.
"All the work was completed" before the ship set out from the port at 8:45 A.M. for Vostochnyy, Russia, the San Francisco Chronicle cited Craig Merrilees, a spokesman for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, as saying.
According to Sargent, workers had refused to unload the ship after it arrived on Saturday because of safety concerns raised by the presence of protesters and police. The protesters were demonstrating in response to recent Israel's military operation in the Gaza Strip.
The protesters gathered Sunday at the port to stop the ship from docking and unloading, but it docked at the port Sunday evening The demonstration was under the auspices of the Block the Boat coalition organized by the San Francisco-based Arab Resource and Organizing Center.
Unionized dockworkers at the port on Sunday honored the picket line and refused to unload the ship.
“Workers honored our picket and stood on the side of justice, as they historically have,” the center said in a statement on its website. “Oakland said no to Zionism and blocked the boat for an entire weekend. This is the first time in history that this has happened. Israeli apartheid is falling one port at a time.”
"Zim has undoubtedly suffered significant economic losses, and we have set a powerful precedent for what international solidarity with Palestine, through boycott, divestment and sanctions, can look like," Reem Assil of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center, said.
Similar actions are expected to take place at ports in Seattle and Tacoma, Wash., this week and later in Vancouver.

<title>Mining mogul who warned Israel may become apartheid state named U.K.'s no. 1 Jew</title>
<date>Thu Sep 11 11:55:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
A mining magnate who has warned that Israel may be treading down the path to apartheid has been chosen as Britain's most influential Jew out of a list of 100 (mostly) Jewish figures.
Mick "The Miner" Davis, the 56-year-old chairman of the trustees of the Jewish Leadership Council, made his fortune after he built up the Xstrata mining company from a firm valued at a mere $500 million into a $44 billion giant. He has appeared "almost everywhere" on the donor lists of Jewish charities, the Jewish Chronicle noted in its "Power 100" list.
Davis, an ardent Tory, has also made considerable donations to the British Conservative Party. In 2012, Prime Minister David Cameron appointed him the chairman of the Holocaust Memorial Commission, a position reflecting "his unrivaled access and influence," the Jewish Chronicle wrote.
But his position in the crème of British Jewish society did not deter him from slamming the Israeli government, a course of action rarely if ever taken by Jewish Diaspora leaders.
In a panel discussion in London in 2010 with Peter Beinart, Davis caused an uproar in the Jewish Diaspora when he broke the taboo by publicly criticizing Benjamin Netanyahu for "lacking the courage" to pursue the peace process.
According to him, his concern that without the two-state solution Israel will become an apartheid regime was shared by many Jewish leaders, though he admitted that he was "out of step with the majority in this country that have the view that what you do and say should be done quietly, behind closed doors," the Jewish Chronicle reported at the time.
His statements put him at loggerheads with major Diaspora figures, including from Abe Foxman, then national director of the Anti-Defamation League, who accused him of "intellectual arrogance." But Davis did not keep mum. In a 2013 opinion piece for Haaretz titled "Defending Israel with one hand tied behind our back," Davis argued that Netanyahu's lack of vision over the peace process is aiding movements seeking to delegitimize Israel, among them the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction Movement. Indeed, Davis said, even the younger generation of British Jews is "increasingly disenchanted" with Israel, and drifts, "wittingly or unwittingly, into the fringes of the BDS space."
Despite his criticism, Davis has voiced unqualified support for Israel during the last clash with Hamas, and has been a committed campaigner for the antiboycott movement.
Occupying the eighth position on the Jewish Chronicle's list is Labor leader Ed Miliband, who, the judges noted, could either top the list a year from now or disappear from it altogether, depending on his success next May in becoming Britain's first Jewish prime minister since Disraeli.
According to the judges, Miliband's relationship with his religion, as well as with his community, has been "somewhat tortuous," and noted that his criticism of Israel over the Gaza war has threatened to alienate him and his party from British Jews "for years to come."
Also on the list, Harry Styles - the decidedly non-Jewish star of Brit boy band One Direction - claims 73rd place. Despite not being a member of the tribe, the judges noted 20-year-old Styles' affinity to the Jewish lifestyle, including his frequent tweets on Jewish life, his love of kosher food and his picture wearing a silver Star of David at the Teen Choice awards.

<title>Jewish candidates to watch in U.S. midterm elections</title>
<date>Wed Oct 15 15:35:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
	With midterm elections just around the corner, four races for the House of Representatives in particular are catching our Jewish eyes.
 1. In California, succeeding Waxman: Ted Lieu vs. Elan Carr
	California’s 33rd Congressional District, stretching along the Pacific Coast and extending into the west side of Los Angeles, is one of the wealthiest districts in Congress and encompasses some of the most glamorous real estate in the country: Malibu, Beverly Hills, Bel Air. When incumbent liberal stalwart Rep. Henry Waxman announced his retirement, the 18-candidate primary for the seat turned into a national punchline, attracting a Kardashian-endorsed spiritual guru, an NPR host and a hard-partying former NBC executive.
	But as befits the successor to Waxman, a legislative workhorse, the two candidates who emerged — State Sen. Ted Lieu, a 45-year-old Democrat, and Los Angeles deputy district attorney Elan Carr, a 46-year-old Republican — are decidedly low-key figures who share a number of similarities. Both are serving members of the military’s JAG corps (Lieu for the Air Force, Carr for the Army), both belonged to Jewish-founded fraternities (Lieu to Sigma Alpha Mu, Carr to Alpha Epsilon Pi), and both are pitching themselves as relative moderates – socially liberal, pro-Israel and business friendly.
	Carr’s mother emigrated as a child from Iraq to Israel and subsequently to the United States. Carr himself grew up in New York speaking Hebrew and Arabic with his family, and he put the latter skill to use when he served in an anti-terrorism unit in Iraq. He argues that his Iraq experiences will serve him well as a “shaper of opinion” on foreign policy, and particularly on Iran and Israel – key issues in the seventh-most Jewish district in the country.
	Carr’s interest in Israel, in particular, is something he shares with supporter Sheldon Adelson, whom the candidate describes as a “close personal friend.” Adelson has donated to the Carr campaign and hosted a fundraiser for him.

	Lieu is an immigrant himself, having arrived in the United States from Taiwan at age 3 with his parents. He has authored bills on everything from greenhouse gas reductions to indoor tanning salons, and he touts his legislative experience as one of his strengths.
	Voters, Lieu says, are “very aware that they’re losing a phenomenal legislator” in Waxman, who has endorsed Lieu. “With me, you have a track record.”
	Registered Democrats in the district substantially outnumber Republicans, 43.4 percent to 26.8 percent. Raphael Sonenshein, the executive director of California State University, Los Angeles’ Pat Brown Institute — a nonpartisan public policy institute — says that Carr has the right profile for a Republican to be successful here, but given the partisan tilt of the district, he is “a substantial underdog.”	— Anthony Weiss
 2. In NY, eyeing a new Republican Jew in Congress: Lee Zeldin vs. Tim Bishop
	State Sen. Lee Zeldin is adding a new pitch in his second bid to unseat Democratic Rep. Tim Bishop in New York’s 1st Congressional District: Congress needs a Jewish Republican. Zeldin’s religion, and its scarcity among Republican politicos, is by no means his main focus. Local bread-and-butter issues and the economy have dominated the campaign of this 34-year-old Iraq War vet who has served in the state Senate for four years.
	But replacing former Rep. Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader, as the only Republican Jewish lawmaker in the Congress has been part of Zeldin’s outreach both in his eastern Long Island district and in making his case to donors nationally.
	Zeldin, who met with Cantor after Cantor resigned following his primary loss in Virginia in June, called the former majority leader an “important voice in reaching out to the Jewish community here in the United States to encourage them to be more open-minded toward supporting Republican candidates.”
 
 Lee Zeldin (Credit: JTA Photo Archive)
	Top conservative Jewish figures, including National Review publisher Bill Kristol, former George W. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer and Republican Jewish Coalition executive director Matt Brooks, have traveled to New York to help make Zeldin’s case.
	Bishop, who acknowledges facing a tough challenge from Zeldin, told JTA that he did not think Zeldin’s religion would be a factor in the vote. “My understanding is now that Eric Cantor has left the Congress, he is telling others he will fill that void,” Bishop said in an interview. “This is not a race about electing someone Jewish.”
	Bishop noted that both he and his opponent have strong pro-Israel voting records. “One thing we are almost unanimous on is the importance of a strong U.S.-Israel relationship and that our posture towards Israel will be protective,” Bishop said. This is the fourth time Bishop has faced a Jewish challenger. He defeated Zeldin in 2008, and in 2010 and 2012 he edged Randy Altschuler, an investment banker. Bishop says he is a more natural fit for Jewish voters, who tend to vote Democratic and hold liberal positions on such issues as immigration, health care and education reform.
	On each of those issues, Zeldin and Bishop stake out opposing views. Bishop favors a path to citizenship for undocumented migrants; Zeldin says securing the borders must be a primary priority. Zeldin wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, while preserving elements like mandating coverage for people with pre-existing conditions; Bishop wants to keep it but tweak it. Zeldin wants to toss out the federal Common Core standards for schools; Bishop wants to reform them.
	Bishop says he backs continued congressional oversight of any Iran deal. Zeldin says Congress needs more aggressive oversight of the nuclear talks.
	“We need to be much stronger and more consistent with our messaging to actually stop Iran’s efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon,” Zeldin told JTA, calling for increased sanctions. 
	Ben Chouake, the president of NORPAC, the pre-eminent pro-Israel political action committee in the Northeast, said pro-Israel donors are not focusing on the Zeldin-Bishop race because they are not so impressed with Bishop and Zeldin has been slipping in the polls.
	“It’s OK to have a good voting record on our issues if you’re from Anchorage, but if you’re from Long Island, people expect more of you than a voting record,” Chouake said. “They expect leadership.” — Ron Kampeas
 3. In Colorado, tight race in a changing state: Mike Coffman vs. Andrew Romanoff
	Colorado has spent the past two years in political upheaval, and perhaps no district embodies its contradictions better than the 6th Congressional District. The site of the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting, the 6th wraps around the east side of Denver, encompassing upscale suburbs, multiracial working-class communities and old-line conservative Colorado natives.
	The two candidates — Rep. Mike Coffman, a 59-year-old Republican, and former Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, a 48-year-old Democrat — embody that split nature perfectly.
	Coffman is a Coloradan since childhood and a former Marine who has represented the district since 2008. His maternal grandfather was an Iraqi Jew who moved to the French concession in Shanghai, where his mother grew up until she met his father, a U.S. soldier doing demilitarization in the area at the end of World War II.
	Long a conservative, Coffman has been forced to moderate his rhetoric since redistricting turned the 6th from a conservative redoubt into a swing district.	Coffman has worked to paint the Washington-born, Ohio-raised Romanoff as a snooty outsider, sneering in a September debate, “You went to a private prep school, Harvard, Yale.” A former Wexner fellow, Romanoff presents his career in public service and education — ranging from teaching at the Community College of Aurora to working at the Southern Poverty Law Center to serving in the statehouse — as springing from his Jewish upbringing.
	“I think it’s shaped who I am in almost every way,” he told JTA. “I take seriously the obligation we call tikkun olam.”
	Romanoff and Coffman have focused heavily on domestic issues, particularly economic. Romanoff has also played up his refusal to take money from political action committees, or PACs, as freeing him from special interests. It certainly hasn’t prevented Romanoff from bringing in the big money, as both candidates had raised well over $3 million by the end of the second quarter. However, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced recently that it was cutting off its television advertising in the district — a move that some analysts took as a sign that Romanoff’s chances might be slipping. Nonetheless, the result will likely remain in doubt to the very end.
		 
		“It’s obviously a very close race,” said Seth Masket, an associate professor of political science at the University of Denver. “Coffman probably maintains a very slight lead, but both are very strong candidates.”
		Masket says Romanoff may be saved, ironically, by the difficulties of his fellow Colorado Democrats running for re-election as senator and governor. Their close races have caused the state and national parties to pour millions into voter turnout efforts across the state, which might mitigate the greater tendency of Democratic voters to ignore non-presidential elections.
		That could be a godsend for Romanoff. Asked what would make the ultimate difference in the election, Romanoff bluntly responded, “Turnout.”		– Anthony Weiss
 4. In Illinois, who’s the favorite in Chicago? Brad Schneider vs. Robert Dold
		Brad Schneider and Robert Dold, locked in a neck-and-neck race for a Chicago-area congressional seat, present a dilemma for some Jewish voters.
		Dold, 45, is a Republican social moderate in the tradition of now-Sen. Mark Kirk, his predecessor in the 10th Congressional District. Dold, who held the seat for one two-year term before losing narrowly to Schneider in 2012, represents what many Jewish community leaders have said they long to see: a pro-Israel hawk who strives to keep a national party that has tilted rightward since 2010 on a more even keel.
		Schneider, the 53-year-old incumbent, represents a prototype Jewish Democrats want to preserve: a young, liberal Jewish lawmaker who makes Israel a central focus and casts it as a natural issue for Democrats.
		Jewish voters “are looking for a fiscal conservative and social moderate, someone who can be in the tradition of Mark Kirk,” Dold said in an interview. “People are tired of excuses and they want Washington to work. I have a track record of working with the other side.”
		Schneider, almost echoing Dold, pitched himself in an interview as a “fiscally moderate, socially progressive” candidate, and in making his case slips into the Hebrew he learned on multiple visits to Israel. “Two things I talk about is tikkun olam,” he said, using the phrase for repairing the world, and “l’dor v’dor,” from generation to generation. “We can’t leave an environment beyond repair.”
		On issues like the Affordable Care Act and Israel, the candidates sound similar notes: Each favors tweaks to Obamacare but not repeal, and each says he will stand up to the administration if it gives too much away in nuclear talks between Iran and the major powers. The candidates, digging deep into their opponent’s record, score each other on these issues.
		Dold says “there’s no question” that Schneider is pro-Israel, but chides him for not speaking out more against the administration — for instance, when Secretary of State John Kerry warned earlier this year that Israel one day could become an apartheid state.
		Schneider notes that this year he initiated a bipartisan letter pressing the administration to increase Iran sanctions at a time when it was resisting such calls. He also points out that Dold voted to repeal Obamacare during his term in Congress; Dold says he now favors bipartisan fixes for Obamacare.
		Jewish officials say Schneider has the edge in part because, with a background as an activist with the American Jewish Committee and with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, he is so steeped in the community.
		“You couldn’t ask for a better friend to Israel,” said Marcia Balonick, the director of JACPAC, a political action committee with a focus on Israel, abortion rights and church-state separation. “In his former life he was an active member of the Jewish community, he speaks fluent Hebrew, he’s already taken several missions to Israel.”
		JACPAC in the past has sought out moderate Republicans to endorse, including Kirk, in part to help preserve that wing of the party. Dold has told the group that he would resist attempts to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling enshrining a woman’s right to an abortion, but will not vote for funding for abortions for poor women, which is a non-starter.
		NORPAC, a leading New Jersey-based pro-Israel political action committee, endorsed Schneider under the “friendly incumbent” rule for pro-Israel givers: Do not alienate the lawmaker in office.

<title>Pig's head among kosher food in South African anti-Israel protest</title>
<date>Sat Oct 25 16:30:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
	South Africa's Jewish community is up in arms after anti-Israel students placed a pig's head in the kosher food section of a Cape Town supermarket on Friday, according to local media. 	The incident, at on outlet of the national Woolworths chain, was intended as a protest against Woolworths for stocking Israeli products, according to the Congress of South African Students (Cosas), which organized the protest. 	Cosas "will not allow people who will not eat pork to pretend that they are eating clean meat, when it is sold by hands dripping with the blood of Palestinian children," COSAS Western Cape chairperson Siphakamise Ngxowa declared in a statement. 	The South African Jewish Board of Deputies, the representative body of South African Jewry, described the action as "disregarding all standards of basic decency." 	"We have seen 'Shoot the Jew' being chanted at public gatherings and explicit threats made to carry out revenge attacks against the Jewish community for events taking place in Israel and Palestine," the board said in a statement. "Now we have been presented with yet another case of anti-Israel activism crossing over into blatant anti-Semitism." 	Woolworths said it was appalled by the action. "Placing a pig’s head in our store is unacceptable and offensive to our employees and customers, including Jewish and Muslim employees and customers,” Paula Disberry, Woolworths group director of retail operations said in a statement. 	“We are investigating this incident and we will consider our options to prevent such distasteful protests in our stores." 	Even the local branch of BDS (the international boycott movement), which has been boycotting Woolworths since the summer war in Gaza due to its stocking of Israeli products, condemned the Cosas action. 	In a statement released Friday, BDS South Africa said it had not “supported, endorsed or encouraged” the action, which it described as “very controversial … form of militant human rights action” that “may not have been properly thought through.”
	“We do not believe that taking pigs heads to Woolworths is correct; we also do not believe that Woolworths supporting Israeli Apartheid is correct. We will try our best to discourage both,” it said.
	BDS South Africa said it hoped the incident would not be used as a distraction from its 
BoycottWoolworths campaign.
	The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement has held more than 40 protests at Woolworths stores throughout the country in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the retailer said it may take the BDS lobby to court for threatening its staff and customers.

<title>WATCH: Cape Town, home to sub-Saharan Africa's oldest Jewish community</title>
<date>Tue Nov 04 13:49:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
		On the to-do list for the visitor to Cape Town: Two oceans converging at the Cape Point, spectacular sunsets at Chapman’s Peak, imaginative culinary experiences in the nearby wineries in French Hook and Stellenbosch. Add to your checklist a visit to the Jewish Center of Cape Town.
		There, nestled under iconic Table Mountain, you will have an engaging day exploring South Africa’s Jewish heritage.  The campus, named after the late philanthropist Mendel Kaplan, contains a museum, showcasing the history of South Africa’s Jews, the Great Synagogue, affectionately known as “The Gardens Shul,” alongside the country’s first synagogue, and a Holocaust museum.
		The South African Jewish Museum tells the story of an immigrant community, almost entirely from Lithuania, who arrived as peddlers working the mining towns, and grew into a prosperous, vibrant, and strongly Zionist, population.  The museum also addresses the moral and political issues faced by South African Jews during the apartheid era.
		The Gardens Shul is an architectural gem, with its vaulted ceilings and stained glass windows.  The services, as with most South African synagogues, are Orthodox, although it seems that most of the community, now about 15, 000 people, are not so observant.
		“We are a completely self-sustaining community”, says Michael Bagraim, a former President of the South Africa Jewish Board of Deputies. “Small though we are, we take pride in seeing that our children receive a Jewish education, and the elderly are taken care of”.
		Nearby the campus is the Herzlia Jewish School, with over 2000 students K-12.  Not far away are Coffee Time, a kosher dairy restaurant and gift shop that are staffed by, and provide funding for people with mental illnesses and special needs.

		For the nostalgic, there is Muizenberg beach, once the social meeting point for Jews from throughout South Africa, particularly from Johannesburg during the South African winter.   No longer. There remain the colorful bungalows and the Muizenberg Shul, and a few diehards who come for the bathing. But the scene, such as it is for South African Jews, has moved on.
		Sea Point, a coastal enclave, has the largest concentration of Cape Jews. Mostly living in Miami-beach style condominiums, there is a kosher deli, synagogue, and multiple social clubs, bringing together locals with Jews who emigrated but often return for family and holidays.
		Something of an urban revival is taking place, spurred by the World Cup 2010, with boutique hotels, restaurants, galleries and shops. While the apartheid system has long been dismantled, there remain huge social and economic gaps between the black and white populations, most evident in the poverty-riddled townships on the city’s outskirts.

		There is an unmistakable sense of a diminished Jewish community, resulting from emigration during and after the apartheid era. The Jewish population is about half its population some 30 years ago. But for those who take the time, they will find the experience well worthwhile. “We are a warm, inviting community, “ says Michael Bagraim, “We have achieved quite a lot, in culture, science, medicine, and business.  And above all, we have a strong commitment to our heritage, Israel and the Jewish people. We encourage visitors to Cape Time to take time to learn about our experience. ” It’s well worth taking him up on the invitation.

<title>Mervyn Smith, South African Jewish community leader, dies at 77</title>
<date>Sun Nov 16 10:29:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	Mervyn Smith, president of the South African Jewish Congress, died on Saturday, at the age of 77.
	Smith's passing after a prolonged illness "is a loss not only to his family, but to our whole community since he was such a driving force in so many communal organizations," announced Ann Harris, the Congress's vice president. "Mervyn’s passion and commitment for the communities of Southern Africa was beyond the call of duty and kept our interests firmly on the agenda of the World Jewish Congress. We will all miss his wisdom and leadership.”
	According to J-Wire, Smith had an innate knowledge of the Jewish community, Jewish history and Israel that few could match. J-Wire credited Smith, an attorney, with playing a pivotal role in getting the Board to condemn apartheid at its 1985 national conference, describing him as a "visionary, orator and intellectual." He was considered an expert on anti-Semitism and active in Holocaust studies.
	Over his lifetime he held several communal leadership positions, often simultaneously. Besides being president of the African Jewish Congress, he served as vice president of the World Jewish Congress and was an honorary life vice president of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies. He was also chairman of the Board of Trustees of the South Africa Holocaust Foundation, president of the Law Societies of South Africa and chairman of both the Performing Arts Council of South Africa as well as the Cape Performing Arts Board.
	“I have always been skilled in time management, so I manage,” he liked to say, according to J-Wire.
	Mervyn Smith was born the town of Vereeninging, near the Vaal River, to a firmly Zionist family, J-Wire reported. He grew up in Vosburg, in the Karoo, before his family moved to Bellville, Cape Town, where he would later practice law. He was active in Habonim and later in the Students Jewish Association when he studied at the University of Cape Town, eventually serving as chairman of the Cape Town branch.
	He was first elected to the Cape Board of Deputies in the 1970s. He served two terms as chairman of the Cape Council of the Board between 1983 and 1987 while serving as the Board's senior national vice chairman.
	Smith, who played cricket for 25 years, was also life president of the Bellville Cricket Club.
	Smith was predeceased by his wife Tamar, a teacher who headed the Board's Religious Instruction Department, and his daughter Rinah, who died as a young child. He is survived by his children Paul, Deborah, Raphael and Abigail as well as grandchildren and a brother.

<title>Pittsburgh pro-Israelis answer 'one-sided' Conflict Kitchen</title>
<date>Sun Nov 16 16:19:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
A group of Pennsylvania students are planning to counter what they describe as "one-sided dialogue" at a local kitchen with a food project of their own to promote dialogue on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, The Jewish Chronicle reported on Wednesday.
In response to Conflict Kitchen, an initiative by a Carnegie Mellon University professor and a student of his, the new project, "CoExistence Kitchen," is set to appear at Carnegie Mellon on November 19 and at Pittsburgh University on November 20, according to Naomi Sternstein, who is president of student group Tartans4Israel. The Carnegie Mellon-based group is co-sponsoring the restaurant together with Panthers for Israel at Pitt, according to the report.
The kitchen offers complementary Middle Eastern food, which is both kosher and halal, and provides diners with trivia questions about the Middle East, according to organizers, who say they are trying to "give context for how people are coexisting every day throughout the Middle East" in even-handed fashion, the Chronicle Reported. The Hillel Jewish University Center is to fund CoExistence Kitchen.
“Part of the reason for CoExistence Kitchen is to start up a dialogue,” Sternstein said. “We want to spark a conversation.”
Conflict Kitchen was founded by Jon Rubin, a Carnegie Mellon art professor, and Dawn Weleski, one of his former students. The kitchen serves food from countries that are in conflict with the United States, one at a time, along with information about those nations, such as North Korea and Iran. The kitchen began serving Palestinian-related food at the end of September, but closed down temporarily in early November in the wake of death threats, according to the project's Facebook page.
Conflict Kitchen announced on its Facebook Page last week that it will serve a Palestinian potluck on Tuesday.
The Chronicle quoted Pitt senior Lauren Barney, who said she felt "unsafe" at the first panel discussion sponsored by Conflict Kitchen, in which Professor Ken Boas, one of the speakers, equated Israel with South African apartheid, called for an academic and economic boycott of Israel and failed to condemn Palestinian terror attacks.
“I thought it was really biased and one-sided,” said Barney, a Pittsburgh native. “They were applying double standards and were delegitimizing Israel and the Jewish community here as well. I didn’t feel it was OK for me to ask my questions.”
Boas countered that “balance” was unnecessary in the context of a discussion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Chronicle reported.
“You’re having trouble hearing one side to the story, but for a lifetime we’ve been hearing one side, from The Jewish Chronicle to The New York Times,” Boas said. “Why do we continually have to have balance and get into debates and have discussions?”
Haley Chizever, another Pitt senior at Pitt, also described the first Conflict Kitchen event as “one-sided.” She said that other events sponsored by Conflict Kitchen, such as one on Venezuela, had been more balanced, leaving her "disappointed" with the Palestine-themed discussion.
“At the other ones, the issues were presented as being very complex,” she said. “But [the Palestinian iteration] is being presented as there are no other sides to the story.”
Chizever said she went to another Conflict Kitchen event featuring Chicago rapper Jasiri X, who equated recent riots in Ferguson, Missouri, with the situation in Gaza. Students for Justice in Palestine and the Pittsburgh Palestine Solidarity Committee co-sponsored the event, distributing flyers that supported boycotting Israel and called to "abolish apartheid," according to the Chronicle.
Conflict Kitchen has also reportedly distributed pamphlets called "wrappers" that are covered with quotes from Palestinians. They have come under fire for being inflammatory, the Chronicle reported, such as: "Palestinians are not going to just let you in and drop their arms. No, they're going to kill and they are going to die."

<title>Australian parliament debates recognition of Palestine</title>
<date>Wed Dec 03 22:54:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	SYDNEY – A bipartisan motion calling for the recognition of Palestine was tabled in Australia’s federal parliament this week, sparking criticism from Jewish leaders who described it as “an exercise in empty symbolism.”
	Labor MP Maria Vamvakinou, a co-convener of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine group, tabled the private members’ bill in Canberra on Monday calling on the Liberal government of Tony Abbott, one of Israel’s staunchest allies, to recognize a Palestinian state.
	“I want to remind the House that it has been 67 years since the partition of Palestine and the occupation, which continues until today — an occupation that is devastating, demoralizing and damaging for all involved,” Vamvakinou said.
	“The time has now come for this to end. Australia, and indeed this parliament, must now recognize the state of Palestine. Australia must vote yes at the UN for Palestinian statehood. Fifty six per cent of Australians are in favor of this and 135 countries have already done so.”
	The debate, timed to coincide with the UN’s international day of solidarity with the Palestinian people,was adjourned; no resolution was passed.
	It came as France this week joined a growing number of countries to recognize a Palestinian state, including Sweden. Spain, Britain and Ireland have backed non-binding resolutions in favor of recognizing Palestine. And the European Parliament will vote in the next couple of weeks on the recognition of a Palestinian state, after a vote was postponed last week.
	Liberal MP Craig Laundy, the co-convener of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine group, seconded the motion. “The people of Palestine, for the last almost 60 years, haven’t had a fair go,” he said. “Imagine if you will, coming home this afternoon to your home, going to put your key in the door and it didn’t fit.
	“You knock on the door. Someone you don’t know opens the door and they’re in your home. That’s what happened here, that’s what happened all those years ago. And a people have been displaced and fighting for an identity ever since.”
	Laundy also accused lobbyists of hijacking the debate. “The things we discuss in this chamber should not be influenced by the lobby,” he said. “They should be influenced by what’s right.”
	Robert Goot, the president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told Haaretz the motion was “an exercise in empty symbolism.”
	He added: “Until the Palestinians actually have a functioning state with a government that is capable of enforcing its authority over the West Bank and Gaza, and delivering on its obligations under signed agreements, then there is no ‘state’ capable of being recognized.
	“The only way that the Palestinians will ever have a real state and government is via a negotiated peace agreement with Israel which will end the conflict on the basis of the UN-endorsed principle of two states for two peoples, a principle their leaders still refuse to accept after 67 years.”
	Dr Colin Rubenstein, executive director of the Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council, described it as “an annual ritual for the usual suspects, part of a small minority of MPs to use the UN’s international day of solidarity with the Palestinian people to make one-sided speeches demonizing Israel.”
	Kelly O’Dwyer, one of many pro-Israel MPs in the governing Liberal Party, told the chamber: “I am very concerned about the way in which Israel and the Jewish people are portrayed in Palestinian schools and on television shows — an education which encourages continued hatred and denial of Israel’s very right to exist. It is my view that the continued hatred of Israel, encouraged by the Palestinian leadership, is one of the real obstacles to the ongoing peace process.”
	Michael Danby, a staunch pro-Israel MP and one of two Jews in the Labor Party, said the proponents of the motion were “individuals who do not speak for either party.”
	“No one has paid attention to this private members’ motion which was ostensibly about the international year of solidarity with the Palestinians and not about the Palestinian state.”
	The motion comes a month after Bob Carr, the foreign minister in the previous Labor government, revealed he was accepting the post of patron of the Labor Friends of Palestine group.
	Carr, a co-founder of the Labor Friends of Israel group several decades ago, incensed Jewish leaders, citing as a trigger for his backflip the “takeover of Zionism by the fanatics” and its lurch toward an “apartheid” state.

<title>ADL: Pro-Palestinian Facebook group is 'an affront to humanity'</title>
<date>Thu Dec 04 12:18:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	The Anti-Defamation League has called a pro-Palestinian Facebook group "an affront to humanity" for posting Photoshopped images of Nazi concentration camp prisoners holding anti-Israel signs.
	The Facebook page "I Acknowledge Apartheid Exists" was founded in March 2013 to "promote the narrative that Palestinians deserve the same rights and liberties that Israeli's enjoy."
	It says that, "Membership of this group constitutes an awareness that Israel's occupation of and actions in Palestine constitute Apartheid; It's recognition that Palestinians are subject to different laws and standards than Israelis."
	A recent image shows concentration camp prisoners behind barbed wire with the words "I can't breathe…" Photoshopped onto it and the hashtag "From Palestine to Ferguson." It was posted on the group's Facebook page with the status "The Jewish people understand 'I can't breathe.' From Palestine to Auschwitz."
	A previous image posted on the page shows emaciated survivors of Austria’s Ebensee concentration camp, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The photo was altered to show survivors holding signs that read “Break the Silence on Gaza,” “Stop the Holocaust in Gaza,” “Israel Assassins,” and “Stop US Aid to Israel.” Also imposed on the photo was “Whatever happened to ‘Never again'?”
	“Anti-Israel activists have shown the true depth of their malice by sharing this horrific image on social media,” said Abraham H. Foxman, outgoing national director of the ADL and a Holocaust survivor, on Tuesday. “Whatever their perspective is about the conflict in the Middle East or the experience of the Palestinian people, taking an image of Holocaust survivors and defacing it in this way is sick and an affront to humanity.”
	“While it is reassuring that the majority of Facebook users who have commented on the image expressed disgust and outrage, the silence from the vast majority of organizations that sympathize with the Palestinian people have effectively sanctioned this tactic," Foxman continued. "We call upon these organizations to condemn the use of this offensive imagery, and urge Facebook to remove this photo under their community standards prohibiting use of their platform for malicious purposes.”

<title>In Johannesburg, the end of a Jewish community?</title>
<date>Sun Dec 07 04:15:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	On a sunny November afternoon in downtown Johannesburg, Samuel Radebe, a pastor and self-proclaimed prophet, sat on a chair draped in a leopard skin and exorcised demons.
	One man, rail thin in a tattered yellow shirt, writhed violently in front of Radebe on the floor as his wife shakily explained into a microphone that he had been possessed by a snake. A few minutes later, assistants carried forward a convulsing woman, eyes rolled back and head lolling as she began to yell in a raspy bass voice.
	“They say that Jesus performed miracles in the Bible, so why can’t we perform miracles here and now?” Radebe boomed as he walked through the crowd of thousands that packed the building and spilled into the surrounding courtyards and streets.
	As Radebe lay his hands on the sick and led the congregation in spirited hymns, there were few signs that the church was once Johannesburg’s largest and most powerful synagogue: Yet there is a Star of David atop the building’s rusted dome, and the house across the street, which is filled with fast food restaurants and cell phone repair shops, still has “Hebrew High School” etched into the stone of its entranceway.
	Indeed, for eight decades, from 1914 to 1994, the Great Park Synagogue was the crown jewel of Orthodox Judaism in South Africa, and its physical witness to Johannesburg’s breathless evolution across the course of the 20th century.
	The synagogue — and others scattered across the inner city — were founded in the early 20th century just as Johannesburg was morphing from a scrappy gold mining boomtown on the fringes of the British empire to what is today Africa’s richest city.
	“Johannesburg is quite unique from other major world cities in that Jews were here from the beginning,” says David Sacks, the associate director of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, an advocacy organization that promotes the social and political interests of the Jewish community. “Most other places they were newcomers, but here we were co-pioneers.”
	The synagogues built by those early pioneers stood witness to the rise — and then to the slow and violent unraveling — of South Africa’s infamous system of segregation, apartheid. And in the first two decades of democracy, these buildings have watched the neighborhoods around them shift once again. Throughout the apartheid era, which began in 1948, the inner city, which encompasses the central business district and its surrounds, was legally segregated and mostly white. The advent of democracy in 1994 transformed it into a bustling meeting point for newly arrived black migrants from across the country and the continent.
	Johannesburg’s Jews, meanwhile, have mostly moved on — to new neighborhoods, new congregations and, for many, since the end of apartheid, new countries. Great Park, for instance, has moved to a synagogue four miles north of its original location. And for most of the 50,000 Jews who remain in Johannesburg (after a steady decline since the 1970s, which was stabilized in the early 2000s), the working class inner city is today a no-go zone, a world away from the gated northern suburbs they now call home. In this sprawling city of seven million, segregation has reassembled itself along class lines, and they are rarely crossed.
	But the inner city synagogue buildings that once defined the prominent Jewish community here have found a variety of ways to survive. Some, like Great Park, are now churches. Others are storefronts or bars. But at least two — Temple Israel in the Hillbrow area, just north of the city center, and the Lions Shul, in Doornfontein, east of downtown — still open every Friday and Saturday to Jewish worshippers, calling a dwindling band of the faithful back to the places that once defined them.
	On an icily blue Rosh Hashanah morning, yellow police tape is strung along the sidewalk in front of Temple Israel, its perimeter patrolled by a couple of bored looking cops with folded arms. But this isn’t a crime scene.
	“We’ve brought police here today so our congregants feel safe coming to worship,” says Reeva Forman, a businesswoman who has been the synagogue’s chairperson for the past two decades.
	While levels of violent crime are high across Johannesburg, however, the police patrol is largely symbolic, meant to offset how conspicuous the synagogue appears here, as though cut and pasted from some distant suburb.
	All around the building, vendors chat loudly in Zulu while selling socks and bags of neon orange cheese puffs to passersby. House music pumps from muffled speakers in the apartment blocks above.
	On the side of the synagogue, someone has plastered a row of identical fliers advertising the services of one Prophet Sithole. “Bring back lost lover,” it blares in bright red lettering. “See your enemy on mirror. Remove bad luck & etc, FREE FREE FREE.” Two taxi drivers are rinsing suds from their cars and listening to a soccer game on the radio.
	These weren’t always the textures of the neighborhood around South Africa’s first Reform synagogue. When the temple opened its doors in 1936, it was huddled in what was then the northern corner of Johannesburg, where many of the better-off Jewish immigrants to the city had recently begun to settle in leafy hillside suburbs. The area, Hillbrow, became the inner city in the 1960s and ’70s as the city sprawled northward. A building boom crowded the streets around the temple with concrete high-rise apartment buildings. Drawn by cheap rents and proximity to the city center, Hillbrow turned into a transit point for white urban newcomers — young families, university students, and European immigrants.
	The neighborhood quickly became a thorn in the side of the segregationist government, a bohemian enclave known for its late night cafes, European bakeries and alternative bookstores. And many of those who rented its apartments and frequented its bars and record shops were Jewish.
	“When I moved here, restaurants stayed open until 1 a.m. and we would walk about all night long,” said Bill Hoffman, a shoe cobbler who has lived in the neighborhood for 35 years, and has been a congregant at Temple Israel since the 1950s, during which “you had to battle to get a seat,” he said.
	But at some point, he says, the ground beneath him began to shift.
	Fed up with the conditions in the overcrowded black neighborhoods on Johannesburg’s fringes, small numbers of Africans, Indians and mixed race South Africans began illegally settling in flats near Hoffman’s, which were zoned for white occupation only, in the 1980s.
	Many landlords proved all too willing to turn a blind eye to the breaking of segregation laws, which confined black South Africans to townships miles from the city center, provided tenants didn’t complain about issues like rent gouging or poor maintenance. The result was a slow decay of building conditions, followed by a white exodus. By the time segregation was formally lifted in the early 1990s, the neighborhood around Temple Israel was mostly black.
	“We thought when blacks moved in it was going to be uplifted, but instead they’ve brought it down to their level,” Hoffman said, referring to the area’s decaying infrastructure.
	The wave of white emigration in the 1980s and ’90s took with it most of the inner city’s Jews, and forced many of the area’s synagogues — like Great Park — to shut their doors. In the early ’90s, Temple Israel nearly met the same fate, until Forman stepped in to block the sale of the building.
	“As long as there are Jews who come to us, we need to stay open,” she says. “That’s the true purpose of Judaism — to live out our values by reaching out to those in need.”
	But the going is difficult. The synagogue can’t afford to hire a full-time rabbi, for instance, and its location makes the temple a hard sell for Jews in the suburbs.
	The 40 congregants gathered for this Rosh Hashanah hold a mirror to the inner city’s changing demographics. Aging white inhabitants of the neighborhood, like Hoffman, stand shoulder-to-shoulder with suburban Jews with family or community ties to the synagogue, and a spattering of black African Jews. One is Uwem Ekpo, a Nigerian immigrant who came to Temple Israel after being turned away from an Orthodox synagogue elsewhere in the city.
	“They said I was not properly Jewish, that I couldn’t worship there,” he said, adjusting his yarmulke. But Temple Israel welcomed him, he explained.
	On a typical Saturday, the temple has less than half the number of worshippers that come for High Holiday celebrations. And Friday night prayers routinely draw just one or two people, Forman said.
	Meanwhile, two miles away in the gritty industrial neighborhood of Doornfontein, the energetic young rabbi Ilan Herman has developed his own simple pitch for luring worshippers to his aging synagogue.
	“Our services are very early in the morning, and some people prefer that, it’s better for their schedule,” he said with a shrug. Known informally as Lions Shul for the two feline busts flanking its entrance, Herman’s synagogue is the oldest in Johannesburg, completed in 1905.
	Walking along the cracked sidewalks near Herman’s shul, past sour-smelling taverns and men turning over chicken feet on tiny grills, it is difficult to imagine that until the 1950s this neighborhood was packed with kosher butcheries and Yiddish cultural societies.
	The march of prosperity took Jews from Doornfontein northward even faster than those in Hillbrow, and over the years, the rabbi says, the synagogue has repeatedly been elbowed to close its doors or move its congregation north.
	“But there’s something about being here, where it started, that you just can’t replicate,” Herman said. “It wouldn’t be Lions Shul anymore.”
	Today not a single one of his congregants — or the rabbi himself — lives in the neighborhood around the synagogue, where services are held on Wednesday evening and Saturday morning. On Shabbat he sleeps in a tiny room tucked above the worship space, and his congregants, though Orthodox, drive in from the suburbs.
	There is little sentimentality to the architecture in Johannesburg. A young and wealthy city that seems to be in a process of perpetual reinvention, its buildings go up, come down, and change purpose with brusque pragmatism. Today even the loudest advocates of the inner city’s synagogues, like Ilan Herman, admit the buildings are unlikely to stay open indefinitely.
	But in many ways, the changes over the past century are only surface deep. The basic character of the inner city and its buildings remains largely unchanged.
	At Radebe’s church in the old Great Park Synagogue, most of the congregation members have come to Johannesburg from far-flung corners of the country and the continent harboring a dream to build a better life for themselves and their families. Working as shopkeepers and clerks, domestic workers and taxi drivers, they live modest lives. Their demons are those of South Africa’s young democracy writ large: unemployment, xenophobia and poor social services.
	A century ago, many of those facing the same struggles were immigrants from Western Europe, Lithuania and other parts of Tsarist Russia. The synagogues the Jews who came to Johannesburg built were their paperweights, holding steady the pieces of their new lives at the tip of the African continent.

<title>Ad in New York Times sparks debate over Israeli 'pinkwashing' - Jewish World News</title>
<date>Thu Dec 25 01:00:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	Should the rights Israel affords its gay citizens be a reason to speak up for the country or "to love the only democracy in the Middle East"?
                
	That's what a full-page ad running this week in The New York Times is arguing.
                
	"Hamas, ISIS and Iran kill gays like me," the advertisement proclaims in bold type beneath a photograph of Rennick Remley, who describes himself in the ad as "a gay American" who supports Israel.
                
	"If I lived in Gaza or Israel's neighboring states, I would be thrown in jail, mutilated or killed," Remley says in the ad, which is sponsored by Israel advocacy group Stand With Us and celebrity rabbi Shmuley Boteach's This World: The Values Network.
                
	"Though I am not Jewish, Israel is the only country in the Middle East where I can live without fear," the ad continues. "I am free to adopt children, serve openly in the military, advocate for my community's rights and be accepted as a human being."
                
	It ends: "In Israel, I am free."
                
	Some commenters on Boteach's Facebook page, where he posted an image of the ad, objected to his use of gay rights as a way to promote support for Israel – a practice some have called "pinkwashing," referring to an emphasis on the country's friendliness to gays in contrast to many Muslim countries, while downplaying Israel's treatment of Palestinians.
                
	"
Pinkwashing israeli apartheid," commenter Cindy Newman wrote on Boteach's Facebook page. "What kind of 'man of god' uses other peoples struggles to promote ethnic cleansing and apartheid?"
                
	Leslie Strickland, whose Facebook page describes her as a family medicine  physician in Philadelphia, wrote: "This is called pinkwashing. Trying to paint over the blood on Israel's hands with pink paint. Using the LGBT community in this way is patronizing and despicable. And by the way Israel, it's not working, I can still seethe blood."
                
	A Tel Aviv resident from Poughkeepsie, New York, used sarcasm to object to the term "pinkwashing." "I love when progressives have to create terms like 'pink washing' to cover up their hypocritical lack of support for oppressed people who don't fit their narrative," wrote Aaron Scheer.

<title>Amid bitter debate, MLA academics condemn Israel's entry policies</title>
<date>Sun Jan 12 20:20:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
By a vote of 60-53, the Modern Language Association delegate assembly has approved the contentious Resolution 2014-1, which censures Israel for “ denials of entry to the West Bank by U.S. academics who have been invited to teach, confer, or do research at Palestinian universities.”
This measure presents a watershed moment for the humanities organization, which has long debated whether to enter the political arena.
The controversial resolution, proposed by Richard Ohmann, Professor Emertius of English of Wesleyan University and English Professor Bruce Robbins of Columbia University, brings increased academic attention to the Israeli Palestinian conflict, and remains especially divisive. It also demonstrates the extent to which humanities professors are willing to risk controversy to debate the political problems Israel faces in the occupation.
Although Robbins and Ohmann had no plans to time the resolution with discussions of the Israel boycott and the ASA vote, the coincidence made for provocative discussions of Israel, the occupation and the fate of the Palestinians, and media attention.
Remarking on the intense media interest, veteran delegate assembly member Lutz Koepnick, Professor of German and Film Studies at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, could not think of a comparable event in recent MLA history. “As a delegate assembly member, I’ve never seen anything like this, the barrage of emails, news media queries, and anger from all sides was overwhelming.”
Resolution 2014-1, according to Omar Barghouti, a founding committee member of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel and a graduate student from Tel-Aviv University, merely brings to the fore a “long overdue” conversation about the “regime of occupation, colonialism and apartheid,” which has prevented the mobility of Palestinians as well as anyone hoping to teach at Palestinian institutions.
University of California, Riverside English Professor David Lloyd spoke in favor of the resolution, read from the State Department advisory pamphlet and criticized such official recommendations as “based on ethnic discrimination. It's racial profiling.”
Those against the resolution objected that it “mischaracterizes freedom of movement for academics entering Palestinians territories, overlooks key facts and contexts” and lacks clear reasoning why travel problems to Israel and Palestine were any worse than entry into many countries on the globe. Telospress published a list of detailed objections to the data here: http://www.telospress.com/academicfreedom/
Beyond the contested data, Ilan Troen, director of Israel Studies at Brandeis University and professor at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, expressed his incredulity of the need for such a resolution in the first place “The chance of an Israeli being refused by the American authorities for getting a visa is 200 times greater than that of an American trying to enter Israel.”
Most outspoken against the resolution was Cary Nelson, Professor of English at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and most recent president of the American Association of University Professors, an American organization that defends academic freedom and tenure, advocates collegial governance, and develops policies ensuring due process. Nelson decried the vote on Israel’s travel policy was “false, insulting, damaging to our professional reputations” because it was so allegedly “poorly researched, emotionally motivated and biased.”
Richard Ohmann defended the resolution, claiming supporters agreed it was a “no-brainer” and “narrow in scope,” demanded an apology from Nelson for his words. The latter responded, “not in this life.”
Clearly indignant, Nelson took it upon himself not only to oppose the resolution most vociferously, and also to provide the most colorful language of the afternoon, as he attacked the chair of the meeting, calling the chair’s struggles to keep the procedure organized “ludicrous.”
Such bitter exchanges characterize academic debates on Israel and Palestine, which proved remarkable above and beyond the usual factious fighting. In fact, the MLA parliamentary protocols are organized to reduce tensions and cushion the impact any too extreme measure. On January 11, partisans for and against the resolutions fidgeted in their seats while, as per official procedure, the delegate assembly lumbered through a slew of comparatively uncontroversial and quotidian, but in fact important questions for humanities professors: How to address issues of pedagogy, student learning, the much discussed “decline of the humanities” and the problems of contingent faculty. Many observers in the room maintained these questions were in fact the “real” business of the MLA.
In hushed tones the newly initiated observers wondered whether this lengthy procedure was some sort of “filibuster” designed to lower the likelihood of the required quorum of 10% to conduct a vote.
As the debate dragged on, David Pan, professor of German at the University of California, Irvine proposed a substitute resolution he hoped would be more “inclusive and less partisan.” This resolution resembled the earlier MLA resolution 2002-1 that more globally rejected “deplorable acts of bigotry at North American colleges and universities” and condemned “boycotts and blacklists against scholars or students on the basis of nationality, ethnic origins, and religious background as unfair, divisive, and inconsistent with academic freedom.”
This surprise attempt to replace the resolution altogether, however, was ultimately ruled out of order, on the grounds that it was too similar to past MLA resolutions.
Audience attention came roaring back when the voting started and ended with close vote.
But another controversial resolution remained. 2013-3, the emergency resolution introduced by the Radical Caucus to condemn the “attacks on the ASA and supports the right of academic organization and individuals, free of intimidation to take positions in solidarity with the Palestinian struggle against racism.”
As exhausted delegates and observers fled the room, members called for a quorum count. At this point in the afternoon, even the announcer had grown giddy from the proceedings and remarked cheekily during the head count: “If you are here press 1 for yes, if you have ontological doubts and press 2 for no, you will still be counted as here."
The count came back: 85 yes--present. 6 no--not present.
Whether or not delegate assembly members felt unsure of their mental presence by that time in the afternoon, they voted 59-41 against considering resolution 2014-3. Such interest in the emergency resolution, even so late in an exhausting debate, attests to the keen investment American academic have in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.
This interest proved fascinating for a new delegate assembly member like Derrick Miller of University of North Carolina Wilmington, who remained undecided whether the MLA was “the appropriate forum to decide whether Israel ought to be censored or not.” Reminded that the MLA has long had an interest in politics since the Vietnam War, Miller nevertheless wondered whether the volatility of the conflict “requires more neutral and inclusive measures.”
Meanwhile, resolution co-author Bruce Robbins demurred and affirmed his duty to speak up against injustice “as an American because we're paying for it and as a Jew because it's being done in my name.”

<title>'Don't issue visas to Israeli dance troupe,' BDS supporters urge New Zealand</title>
<date>Fri Jan 31 17:41:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
Pro-Palestinian activists in New Zealand have called on the government there not to issue visas to members of Israel's Batsheva Dance Company, which is scheduled to perform at next month's New Zealand Festival of the Arts.
In letters to New Zealand's immigration and foreign ministers, activists from several different pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel boycott groups expressed their "concern" about the scheduled Batsheva performance, according to J-Wire, a Jewish news source from Australia and New Zealand.
The letters claim that the Israeli troupe is "largely funded by the Israeli Ministry of Culture & Sport, the City of Tel Aviv and the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs who praise the troupe as “ambassadors of Israeli culture."
In an effort to provide "practical solidarity to the Palestinian struggle" the activists have asked that their government "refuse visas to this dance group to enter New Zealand."
The letter goes on to detail what the activists call Israel's "unashamedly racist treatment of its Arab-Israeli citizens" and other offenses for which it is being targeted by the international boycott, divestment and sanctions movement.
The activists said that New Zealand should take step toward fulfilling its "obligations" to the Palestinians under international law.
"For the same reasons New Zealanders called for the end to rugby links with apartheid South Africa we are calling for the cutting of ties with apartheid Israel," their letter reads.
"Such a decision would be welcomed by Palestinians as part of the international pressure to bring change to the policies of the Israeli apartheid state as well as by those countries thinking of supporting New Zealand’s bid for a UN Security Council seat," the letter continues.
It ends by quoting the late Nelson Mandela, who said, “We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians.”
As of Thursday, the activists had not received a reply from New Zealand government officials.
In response, the dance troupe's artistic director Ohad Naharin said he was disappointed "to see a group of intelligent people wasting their money and their energy on something that won't result in anything. I have experienced this impotent activity for years."  
"The situation in the West Bank is tragic and indeed every effort must be made to change it. If I believed that boycotting our performances could bring any progress in ending the occupation, I would boycott myself," Naharin said.

<title>Habayit Hayehudi MK proposes one state with full Palestinian equality</title>
<date>Wed Feb 12 22:43:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
MK Zvulun Kalfa (Habayit Hayehudi) believes in a one-state solution in which Palestinians would have full citizenship, according to Israel Hayom newspaper.Habayit Hayehudi Chairman Naftali Bennett is the only coalition party leader who opposes a two-state solution, but he proposes limited autonomy, rather than full integration, for Palestinians.Kalfa's proposal goes a lot further: "We should grant Palestinians full citizenship, equality, invest in their local infrastructure and [give them] voting rights in the Knesset," the MK said in an interview.He believes that the state should draft a law claiming all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea as an undivided Israel, and making all residents within its borders Israeli.Such a move will put an end to claims of Israeli apartheid or maltreatment of its Arab residents, Kalfa believes."It is obvious that we cannot go the way of a two-state solution," Kalfa said. "I am in favor of one country for everyone. Palestinians? There has never been and there currently is no [Palestinian] nation."Kalfa, who was once a resident of the Gaza settlement of Atzmona, rejected the claim that Israel would no longer be a Jewish state if his proposal was implemented. "One way or another, the Jews will remain the majority in the state," he said.

<title>Protesters in New Zealand face off over BDS outside Batsheva show</title>
<date>Sun Feb 23 16:44:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protesters reportedly faced off outside Wellington's St James theater over the weekend, where the Israeli dance company Batsheva performed as part of an arts festival.
On the pro-Palestinian side, according to a report by APNZ News Service, was a 40-strong group led by veteran left-wing activist John Minto, who sought to dissuade the public from attending the Friday night show.
Minto had previously called on the government of New Zealand to deny the Israeli dancers visas, as part of a campaign to boycott Israeli individuals, groups and products. The government did not heed this call, telling Haaretz that “The New Zealand government has long pursued a balanced and constructive approach to the Israel-Palestinian issue.”
David Zwartz, a former honorary Israeli consul in Wellington and member of the capital's Jewish community, led a counter-protest in favor of Israel, APNZ said, adding that his group comprised some 40 Israel supporters.
"Police asked us to stand on one side, and the Minto crowd stood on the other side of the entranceway,'' he said, according to APNZ.
According to Minto, the protest prompted five people – a family of three and two others – to avoid the show, APNZ reported.
Minto has deplored what he calls Israel’s “unashamedly racist treatment” of its Arab citizens, its “brutal military occupation” of the West Bank and its “vicious blockade” of the Gaza Strip.
Zwartz, the chairman of the Wellington Regional Jewish Council, has told Haaretz that “The BDS (boycott, divestment and sanctions) movement, fronted by Mr. Minto, is hiding its real agenda, which is the destruction of the State of Israel.”
“Playing on Mr Minto’s anti-apartheid past, they make dishonest comparisons with the former South African regime to defame Israel,” said Zwartz. “Wellington and New Zealand dance lovers deserve to have the opportunity to see one of the world’s leading dance companies regardless of where they come from.”

<title>UN rights envoy denounces Israeli 'apartheid' in Palestinian areas</title>
<date>Mon Feb 24 18:50:01 IST 2014</date>
<content>
Israel's policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip appear to amount to apartheid due to its systematic oppression of the Palestinian people and de facto expropriation of their land, a United Nations investigator said in a report.
Richard Falk, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, said that Palestinian rights are being violated by Israel's prolonged occupation of Palestinian territory and "ethnic cleansing" of East Jerusalem.
Gaza, despite the disengagement of Israel in 2005, remains "occupied" under an unlawful Israeli blockade that controls borders, airspace and coastal waters, and especially hurts farmers and fishermen, he said. The humanitarian situation in the Hamas-ruled enclave is dire amid fuel shortages, he added.
U.N. member states should consider imposing a ban on imports of produce from Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Falk said in his final report to the U.N. Human Rights Council after serving six years in the independent post.
In a section entitled "acts potentially amounting to segregation and apartheid", he analysed Israeli policies, including "continuing excessive use of force by Israeli security forces" and unlawful killings that he said are "part of acts carried out in order to maintain dominance over Palestinians".
Palestinians in the West Bank are subject to military laws, while Jewish settlers face a civil law system, he said. Israel also violates their rights to work and education, freedoms of movement and residence, and of expression and assembly, he said.
Ten years ago the U.N.'s International Court of Justice ruled that Israel's separation wall inside the West Bank is illegal, he noted. Israel says it is a security barrier.
"It seems incontestable that Israeli measures do divide the population of the Occupied Palestinian Territory along racial lines, create separate reserves for Palestinians and expropriate their land," Falk wrote in his 22-page report.
"The combined effect of the measures designed to ensure security for Israeli citizens, to facilitate and expand settlements, and, it would appear, to annex land is hafrada (the Hebrew word for separation), discrimination and systematic oppression of, and domination over, the Palestinian people."
There was no immediate reaction from Israel, which boycotted the council it accuses of bias for 19 months, returning in October 2013. Israel left after accusing the forum of bias when it set up a fact-finding mission on the settlements.
Controversy
Falk, a Jewish American law professor, has long been a controversial figure. After taking up the post in May 2008, he compared Israeli forces' actions in the Gaza Strip to those of the Nazis in wartime Europe.
Months later, he was detained at Ben Gurion airport and deported by Israeli authorities after being barred from crossing into Palestinian areas to carry out his investigation.
Last June he said he would not resign and accused critics of calling him anti-Semitic to divert attention from his scrutiny of Israeli policies. U.N. Watch, an activist group that Falk labels as a 'pro-Israel lobbying organisation', and the United States had called for him to quit.
Falk said in his latest report that businesses and countries should examine who profits from the "settlements of Israel and other unlawful Israeli activities" and take appropriate steps.
"Considering the fact that the European Union remains one of the most important trading partners for the settlements, with annual exports worth $300 million, a ban on settlement produce would have a significant impact," he said.
His previous appeals for divestment have brought results and have encouraged governments to be more vigilant, he said.
Royal HaskoningDHV, a Dutch company, ended a contract with Jerusalem's municipality to build a wastewater treatment plant in East Jerusalem and a Swedish-Norwegian bank Nordea excluded Cemex from its investment portfolio due to its extraction of non-renewable natural resources from Palestine, according to Falk.

<title>Canadian university students launch Sabra hummus boycott</title>
<date>Sun Mar 09 23:45:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
Pro-Palestinian student groups at the University of Ottawa have launched a campaign to ban Sabra hummus from campus.
Sabra is partly owned by the Strauss Group, a foods manufacturer that the students allege financially supports the Golani Brigade of the Israel Defense Forces, according to The New York Times. The students say the Golani Brigade has been accused of human rights violations by numerous organizations.
Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights and the Palestinian Student Association are among the student groups involved in the campaign, according to the university newspaper, The Fulcrum, along with the community group Young Jews for Social Justice.
“We will be raising awareness amongst the student population, collecting signatures for a petition and encouraging students to individually boycott the product,” Assma Basmalah, a representative of Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights, told the paper.
The campaign coincided with the 10th annual Israeli Apartheid Week, which ended earlier this month.
Caroline Milliard, manager of media relations for the university in east-central Canada, told The Fulcrum that the main objective of the institution’s food services department is to provide healthy options at fair and competitive prices.
“The purchasing policy of our service provider is apolitical,” she said.
In an email to The Fulcrum, Susan Spronk, an associate professor at the university’s School of International Development and Global Studies, said she supports the campaign because “the struggle to liberate Palestine is this generation’s struggle against apartheid.”

<title>Tutu: Israel's humiliation of Palestinians 'familiar to black South Africans'</title>
<date>Mon Mar 10 10:38:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu said Sunday that Israel's treatment of Palestinians reminds him of South African apartheid, and reiterated his support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.
"I have witnessed the systemic humiliation of Palestinian men, women and children by members of the Israeli security forces," he said in a statement. "Their humiliation is familiar to all black South Africans who were corralled and harassed and insulted and assaulted by the security forces of the apartheid government."
The former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town made the statement as the 10th annual Israel Apartheid Week opened Sunday in South Africa. The initiative, part of the international boycott, divestment and sanctions movement’s campaign against Israel, is being marked in 87 cities this year. Tutu visited Israel in 1989.
International pressure similar to the BDS movement led to the end of apartheid in South Africa, the statement said.
"In South Africa, we could not have achieved our democracy without the help of people around the world, who through the use of non-violent means, such as boycotts and divestment, encouraged their governments and other corporate actors to reverse decades-long support for the apartheid regime.
The same issues of inequality and injustice today motivate the divestment movement trying to end Israel's decades long occupation of Palestinian territory and the unfair and prejudicial treatment of the Palestinian people by the Israeli government ruling over them."
Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for standing up against white-minority rule in South Africa, added that people who don't act against injustice are complicit in it.
''Those who turn a blind eye to injustice actually perpetuate injustice. If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor," he said. "It doesn't matter where we worship or live. We are members of one family, the human family, God's family."
Last May, the retired archbishop joined calls for UEFA to move the Under-21 European soccer championship from Israel because of the state's treatment of Palestinian sport.

<title>UN rights investigator accuses Israel of 'ethnic cleansing'</title>
<date>Fri Mar 21 19:35:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
A UN human rights investigator accused Israel on Friday of "ethnic cleansing" in pushing Palestinians out of East Jerusalem and cast doubt that the Israeli government could accept a Palestinian state in the current climate.
He spoke against a backdrop of deadlocked peace talks and accelerating Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem which Palestinians say is dimming their hope of establishing a viable state on contiguous territory.
Israel says Palestinian refusal to recognize it as a Jewish state is the main obstacle. U.S. President Barack Obama this week pressed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to help break the impasse, saying both sides must take political risks before the April 29 deadline for a framework deal.
Richard Falk, United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, told a news conference that Israeli policies bore "unacceptable characteristics of colonialism, apartheid and ethnic cleansing".
"Every increment of enlarging the settlements or every incident of house demolition is a way of worsening the situation confronting the Palestinian people and reducing what prospects they might have as the outcome of supposed peace negotiations."
Asked about his accusation of ethnic cleansing, Falk said that more than 11,000 Palestinians had lost their right to live in Jerusalem since 1996 due to Israel imposing residency laws favoring Jews and revoking Palestinian residence permits.
"The 11,000 is just the tip of the iceberg because many more are faced with possible challenges to their residency rights."
This compounded the "ordeal of this extended, prolonged occupation", according to Falk, an international law expert and professor emeritus at Princeton University in the United States.
Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed the latter, declaring it part of its eternal, indivisible capital, a move never recognized internationally.
Palestinians seek a state in the West Bank and Gaza with East Jerusalem as their capital. In 2005 Israel quit Gaza, now run by Hamas Islamists opposed to Abbas' peace efforts, but settlement growth continues in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Falk said that Israel had made a systematic effort to "change the ethnic composition" of East Jerusalem by making it more difficult for Palestinians to reside there while encouraging the spread of settlements, which are considered illegal under international law.
In a report last month, Falk said Israeli policies in the West Bank appeared to amount to "apartheid and segregation" with a de facto annexation of parts of the territory, denying the Palestinian right to self-determination.
There was no immediate Israeli response to his remarks on Friday. Israel has not responded officially to Falk's February report via the president of the UN Human Rights Council, the usual channel, U.N. officials in Geneva said.
In the past Israel has strongly denied accusations of persecuting Palestinians, accusing them of inciting anti-Israeli violence and being unwilling to make permanent peace with the Jewish state.
"Drift to the right"
Direct peace negotiations usually coincide with intensified Israeli settlement activity, he told reporters.
The U.S.-brokered peace process seemed to be primarily a project of Secretary of State John Kerry who had received only "minimal support from Obama himself", Falk said.
"There are other reasons for encouraging the idea that it's still possible to negotiate a settlement based on the two-state model, even though most informed observers regard it as highly implausible given the changes that have taken place during the period of occupation and given the outlook of the Netanyahu government," he said, making clear he was among the sceptics.
Even entering negotiations, he said, is seen as a "betrayal" by Israeli political factions and parties that are to the right of the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
"A few years ago it would be hard to imagine that there was something to the right of Netanyahu. But gradually this drift to the right has created a whole new sense of the political debate within Israel," Falk said. "And there is a strong internal Israeli opposition to any sense that the Palestinian people in any diminished way deserve a state of their own."
Falk, an American law professor who is Jewish, has come to the end of a six-year term in the independent post and the U.N. Human Rights Council is expected to name a successor soon.
He has long drawn controversy in Israel, in 2008 comparing Israeli military strikes against Hamas in Gaza - during which 1,400 Palestinians were killed and there was widespread destruction in densely populated areas - to those of the Nazis.
Last June he said critics who called him anti-Semitic sought to divert attention from his scrutiny of Israeli policies.
He is to address the UN Human Rights Council on Monday, but it was not clear whether Israeli delegates would attend due to an ongoing strike by Israeli foreign ministry staff.

<title>Israeli architects face suspension by international body</title>
<date>Sun Mar 23 14:56:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) is the latest professional organization to boycott Israel, the Guardian reports.
The RIBA council decided last week to call for the suspension of its Israeli counterpart, the Israeli Association of United Architects, by the global architectural body – the International Union of Architects.
The motion was passed by 23 votes to 16, with 10 abstentions.
Addressing council members before the vote, former RIBA head Angela Brady said that failure to back the motion “would send a clear message to the world that we as an institution turn a blind eye or by inaction support what’s going on – land grabs, forced removals, killing the state and human rights, and reinforcement of apartheid.”
But other council members pointed to human rights violations in other parts of the world, such as North Korea, which is a member of RIBA. "Don't you think architects are designing prison camps and torture chambers there?" asked one council member, Francesca Weal.
Prof Baruch Baruch of the IAUA said the decision was "astonishing." He added "I don't think architects can be blamed for government policies. I don't think boycotts will help to solve any of the problems in the Middle East."
His organization, which includes Israeli-Arab architects, was not complicit in settlement construction. "A lot of members are against settlements and building in the West Bank. They won't be helped by a boycott."
The vote follows a similar motion earlier in the week by the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland.

<title>U.S. welcomes departure of 'noxious' UN Palestine envoy Falk</title>
<date>Tue Mar 25 13:53:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
The United States on Monday welcomed the imminent departure of Richard Falk, a UN human rights investigator for the Palestinian territories whom Washington accused of being biased against Israel and spreading conspiracy theories about the September 11, 2001 attacks.
Falk, the outgoing United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, told a news conference as recently as last week that Israeli policies bore "unacceptable characteristics of colonialism, apartheid and ethnic cleansing.
In a statement to Reuters, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power condemned what she described as "Falk's relentless anti-Israeli bias, his noxious and outrageous perpetuation of 9/11 conspiracy theories."
"His publication of bizarre and insulting material has tarnished the UN's reputation and undermined the effectiveness of the Human Rights Council," she said. "The United States welcomes Mr. Falk's departure, which is long overdue."
Falk has long been a controversial figure. In 2011, he wrote on his blog that there had been an "apparent cover-up" by U.S. authorities over the September 11 attacks. Last year he suggested the Boston Marathon bombings were a response to U.S. foreign policy.
Falk, an American law professor who is Jewish, has come to the end of a six-year term in the independent post and the Human Rights Council in Geneva is expected to name a successor soon.
A UN official in Geneva, Kiyohiko Hasegawa, said Falk's successor, who has not been named, would be expected to take over the post on May 1.
During his tenure, Falk was criticized by Power's predecessor Susan Rice, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and UN Watch, an activist group that Falk has branded a "pro-Israel lobbying organization."
Falk could not be reached for comment on a UN email address that UN officials said he should be receiving messages on.
Despite the intense criticism of Falk, he repeatedly refused to step down. "I don't intend to resign and there doesn't seem to be any formal initiative that is seeking my dismissal," he told reporters last year.
"My role of trying to speak honestly about the situation that Palestinians are facing under this condition of prolonged occupation generates this sort of reaction that tries to paint anti-Israeli criticism as a form of anti-Semitism," he said.
Power broadened her criticism of Falk to include the 47-nation Human Rights Council as a whole, which she said unfairly singled out Israel - a criticism the U.S. government has made repeatedly.
"It is beyond absurd that the only country that has a standing place on the Human Rights Council's agenda is not Syria, not North Korea, and not Iran, but Israel," she said.
The administration of former U.S. President George W. Bush boycotted the Human Rights Council, but his successor Barack Obama decided it would be better to join the council in an attempt to reform it from within. The United States has been elected twice to the council since Obama took office in 2009.
A U.S. official said Washington's presence on the rights council has been beneficial. "U.S. engagement has helped the council become more credible, but we have a long way to go," a U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
The official cited U.S. work in helping to create UN commissions of inquiry on Syria and North Korea and its work to keep a focus on "particularly egregious human rights situations in Syria, Sri Lanka, Belarus, Iran, and Burma (Myanmar)."

<title>BDS campaigners call on Rolling Stones to cancel Israel concert </title>
<date>Wed Mar 26 21:19:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
A day after producers officially announced that the Rolling Stones will be performing in Israel for the first time ever on June 4, Palestinian campaigners have launched an appeal urging the British rock group to cancel the event.
"We are writing to urge you to refrain from playing in apartheid Israel and not to condone Israel’s violations of international law and human rights against the Palestinian people," the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) said in a statement. "We wrote you previously, in 2007, after hearing of similar plans, and back then you did not play in Israel.  We hope you will heed our call once again."
"Why would you accept to perform in a country that is so deeply involved in war crimes and human rights violations?" the campaigners ask. "Performing in Israel at this time is morally equivalent to performing in South Africa during the apartheid era."
Tickets for the Tel Aviv concert officially go on sale at 9 A.M. on March 30, but customers of the cell phone company Pelephone can get in early during a presale that starts March 27 at 9 A.M.
The legendary rock group fronted by Mick Jagger kicked off its tour in Abu Dhabi on February 21. The Stones then set off across Asia and Australia, before postponing some scheduled Australian and New Zealand shows following the death of Jagger's longtime girlfriend, fashion designer L'Wren Scott.

<title>Palestinians submit official bid to join 15 international conventions</title>
<date>Wed Apr 02 17:10:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The Palestinian Authority officially asked Wednesday that the state of Palestine become a signatory to 15 international conventions.
The request was made by Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Maliki, who met with Robert Serry, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, and Swiss and Dutch envoys to the Palestinian Authority.
Maliki told the diplomats that the Palestinian requests came in response to Israel's failure to free the fourth batch of prisoners it said it would free if peace talks progressed. The Palestinian Authority said it now considers itself released from its commitment not to seek recognition from international institutions.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas signed the requests on Tuesday, in a meeting of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Executive Committee, which was broadcast live on television.
A senior Palestinian official said the Palestinians realize that this isn't an effective step in the short term, but said the ultimate goal is to become a member state of the International Criminal Court at The Hague.
"We hope that by then Israel will gain its composure and won't ignore its responsibility to release prisoners," the official said.
Maliki told the three diplomats to who he submitted the request that the Palestinian move was a response to Israel's failure to carry out the fourth stage of a prisoner release to which it committed as the negotiations opened in July 2013. Israel's decision not to follow through with its end of the deal has prompted the Palestinians to feel freed from their own promise not to appeal to international institutions, Maliki said.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday that none of the conventions are connected to the United Nations, but the list released by the Palestinians indicates that nine are UN conventions, including international treaties against torture, corruption and genocide.
The Palestinians were also seeking to become signatories to the international conventions on the elimination of racial discrimination and discrimination against women, both of which were approved by the UN General Assembly.
They have also asked Switzerland for permission to join the Fourth Geneva Convention, which governs the protection of civilians in wartime, and asked the Netherlands for permission to join the Hague II treaty on the laws of war.
Below is the full list of conventions the Palestinians want to sign:
■ Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1979
■ International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1966
■ International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1966
■ Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2006
■ International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1965
■ United Nations Convention Against Torture, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1984
■ United Nations Convention Against Corruption, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2003
■ UN Genocide Convention, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948
■ Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1974
■ Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989
■ Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (Fourth Geneva Convention)
■ Convention with Respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague II)
■ Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
■ Vienna Convention on Consular Relations
■ Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations

<title>Israeli websites attacked by pro-Palestinian 'hacktivist' collective</title>
<date>Mon Apr 07 12:11:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Exactly one year after its last major cyber attack, AnonymousOpIsrael hacked Israeli websites on Monday.
The pro-Palestinian "hacktivist' collective broke into the Education Ministry's website, as well as the websites of the Israel Postal Service and the Central Bureau of Statistics, Ynet reported.
Anonymous struck first in November 2012 after Israel's Operation Pillar of Defense assault on Gaza, and again on April 7, 2013. It issued a warning message on Sunday that stated:
"This is a message from Anonymous Operation Israel, Anonymous Special Operations, Pillars of Anonymous, the Anonymous Collective of the cyber warriors from across the planet: on April 7, 2014, we call upon our brothers and sisters to hack, deface, hijack, database leak, admin takeover, and DNS terminate the Israeli Cyberspace by any means necessary," read a robotic-sounding narrator on a YouTube video the group posted on Sunday.
The cyberattack a year ago took down scores of Israeli websites, as Anonymous claimed to have hacked into the websites of the Prime Minister's Office, Defense Ministry, Shin Bet and other state agencies. The group also published a long list of Israeli email addresses and credit card numbers reportedly taken from the site of a business that sells equipment to the Israel Defense Forces.
However, Israeli authorities said at the time that Anonymous had not caused significant damage to state or civilian Internet operations.
The YouTube video said the group was acting in retaliation for Israel's "crimes against humanity" visited on the Palestinians.
"You can NOT hide a demolished home. You can NOT hide the barrage of bullets you use to kill and maim Palestinians. You can NOT hide apartheid roads. The further assault on the people of Gaza, who have been flooded by your sewage, terrorized by your military apparatus, and left to die at the border while waiting for medical attention will NOT be tolerated anymore. Your vicious campaigns to attack Palestinian solidarity groups worldwide through censorship and legal wrangling has also NOT gone unnoticed."

<title>South Africa Muslim leader accuses rival party of paid-for pro-Israel stance</title>
<date>Thu Apr 17 14:36:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
A month ahead of national elections, a question is being asked: Does the Democratic Alliance, South Africa's second largest political party, smile on Israel because it's funded by pro-Israel sources?
That's the question asked by the leader of a rival party, Al Jama-ah, a shopkeeper named Imraahn Ismail-Mukaddam, according to Independant Online, which aggregates the websites of the country's largest media group.
The DA for its part said it doesn't have to answer his questions, and didn't comment on his allegations.
Ismail-Mukaddam wrote an open letter to James Selfe, chairman of the DA's federal executive, asking directly whether the party's pro-Israel position was based on donations, and saying it was "within my rights" to assume that to be the case.
He qualified that the letter was personal, not written in his capacity as party representative, and threw down the legal gauntlet: if he was wrong, let the DA sue, he wrote.
Selfe said the DA does not disclose its donors, who are free to do so if they wish.
It cannot be said that the parties coexist in blissful peace. Last month, the DA also fielded lawyers, urging Al Jama-ah to stop disseminating leaflets prohibiting Muslims from voting for the DA. Ismail-Mukaddam said the party yanked the leaflets but also sent questions to the DA that it never answered, iol reports.
Those questions, said Ismail-Mukaddam, include whether the DA intended to include a Star of David in the new Cape Town logo, and clarifications on its positions regarding Israel and the Palestinians.
He also specifically asked whether the DA receives money "from people who support Israel’s occupation of Palestine" - or from a specific person, the property magnate Nathan Kirsh.
Among Kirsh's holdings are a stake in the Israeli defense systems maker Magal Security Systems, which has had quite the wild ride on Wall Street over years, becoming the flavor of the month around 2004. The stock spiked to more than $20 on huge volume before declining and settling back to its present level, around $4.
Selfe rebutted that the DA didn't have to answer Al Jama-Ah's questions.The Democratic Alliance has been the official opposition since 1999 and the  governing party of the Western Cape province since 2009. Once overwhelmingly white, though less so today, It is considered centrist.
Al Jama-ah was founded in 2007, with the explicit agenda of supporting Muslim interests and in getting South Africa to uphold Muslim (sharia) law.
Never mind relations with specific political parties: Relations between South Africa and Israel had known their ups and downs. Jerusalem and Johannesburg maintained close ties as the world grouped against apartheid South Africa, but after the ANC took power following the end of apartheid, a chill set in.
At an ANC National Congress in 2012, the party passed a resolution calling on South Africans to support the boycott against Israel because of its treatment of Palestinians. While the ANC waxed frosty, the Democratic Alliance formally advocated a two-state solution recognizing both the Palestinian right to self-determination and the Israeli right to exist within safe borders.
That said, in February, DA reps voted in favor of decisions unfavorable to Israel and condemned Israel's conduct.
Among the resolutions the DA representatives supported was the establishment in South Africa of a war-crimes court that would address Israel’s conduct and South Africans serving in the Israeli army.

<title>Kerry: Israel risks turning into an 'apartheid state'</title>
<date>Mon Apr 28 05:54:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
If a two-state solution isn't agreed upon soon, Israel will risk becoming "an apartheid state," U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday while speaking before a closed forum.
Kerry used the term while speaking at the Trilateral Commission before senior officials from the United States, Europe, Russia and Japan, The Daily Beast reported.
It is the first time a U.S. official of Kerry's importance has used the contentious term "apartheid" in the context of Israel, even if only as a warning for the future. 
“A two-state solution," Kerry said, "will be clearly underscored as the only real alternative. Because a unitary state winds up either being an apartheid state with second class citizens—or it ends up being a state that destroys the capacity of Israel to be a Jewish state.
“Once you put that frame in your mind, that reality, which is the bottom line, you understand how imperative it is to get to the two-state solution, which both leaders, even yesterday, said they remain deeply committed to.”
Kerry also warned that a freeze in the peace talks could bring about a violent conflagration in the West Bank. "People grow so frustrated with their lot in life that they begin to take other choices and go to dark places they’ve been before, which forces confrontation,” he said.
During his talk, a recording of which was procured by The Daily Beast, Kerry also suggested that a change in the leadership of either Israel or the Palestinians could make a breakthrough more feasable. He also reiterated his conviction that both sides share the blame for the negotiations' dead end.
Kerry harshly criticized Israel for plans to build 14 thousand new housing units in the settlements advanced during the past nine months of negotiations.
Kerry also said that at some point he might unveil his own peace proposal, and tell both sides to either “take it or leave it.”
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in response to the tape that Kerry was simply expressing his position, which is shared by many others, and that the two-state solution is the only way Israel could remain a Jewish state that lives in peace with the Palestinians. She added that similar positions have been expressed by Israeli leaders such as Ehud Barak, Ehud Olmert and Tzipi Livni.

<title>ADL 'startled and disappointed' over Kerry's 'apartheid' comment</title>
<date>Mon Apr 28 17:45:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The Anti-Defamation League said on Monday it was "disappointed" by remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who cautioned that Israel risks becoming an apartheid state if a two-state solution isn’t agreed upon in the near future.
"It is startling and deeply disappointing that a diplomat so knowledgeable and experienced about democratic Israel chose to use such an inaccurate and incendiary term," wrote ADL National Director Abe Foxman in a statement.
According to Foxman, while the ADL appreciates Kerry's commitment to a peaceful solution in the Middle East, his comments "used the repugnant language of Israel's adversaries and accusers" and were "undiplomatic, unwise and unfair."
"Such references," wrote Foxman, "are not seen as expressions of friendship and support."
On Monday, the Daily Beast reported on Kerry's statements, which he made last Friday at a closed meeting in Washington before senior officials from the U.S., Europe, Russia and Japan.
“A two-state solution," Kerry said, "will be clearly underscored as the only real alternative. Because a unitary state winds up either being an apartheid state with second class citizens—or it ends up being a state that destroys the capacity of Israel to be a Jewish state.
“Once you put that frame in your mind, that reality, which is the bottom line, you understand how imperative it is to get to the two-state solution, which both leaders, even yesterday, said they remain deeply committed to.”

<title>U.S., Jewish groups slam Kerry over 'apartheid' comment</title>
<date>Tue Apr 29 02:59:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Jewish groups slammed Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday over his warning that without a two-state solution, Israel risks becoming an apartheid state.The pro-Israel lobby AIPAC released a statement saying it was "deeply troubled" by Kerry's comments. "Any suggestion that Israel is, or is at risk of becoming, an apartheid state is offensive and inappropriate. The Jewish state is a shining light for freedom and opportunity in a region plagued by terror, hate and oppression," the statement read.Earlier on Monday, the Daily Beast reported on Kerry's statements, which he made last Friday at a closed meeting in Washington before senior officials from the U.S., Europe, Russia and Japan.AIPAC also said that is "shares President Obama’s perspective that while there is a political conflict between Israel and the Palestinians that needs to be resolved, the use of the term “apartheid” to characterize Israel is inaccurate and unhelpful."State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that Kerry was simply expressing his position, which is shared by many others, and that the two-state solution is the only way Israel could remain a Jewish state that lives in peace with the Palestinians. She added that similar positions have been expressed by Israeli leaders such as Ehud Barak, Ehud Olmert and Tzipi Livni. Kerry believes Israel "is a vibrant democracy with equal right to all it citizens," she said.  
House majority leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., called on Kerry to apologize for his statements. "The use of the word apartheid has routinely been dismissed as both offensive and inaccurate, and Secretary Kerry's use of it makes peace even harder to achieve," said Cantor, who is Jewish, according to Fox News.
Senator Ted Cruz (Texas,) a leading Republican, called on Kerry to resign, saying that "there is no place for [the word Apartheid] in the context of the State of Israel.
"Every member of this body has expressed our commitment for the United States to stand resolutely with our friend and ally the nation of Israel," Cruz said. "It was therefore with great sadness that I read this morning about [Kerry's] comments."Also on Monday, the Anti-Defamation League said it was "disappointed" by Kerry's remarks. "It is startling and deeply disappointing that a diplomat so knowledgeable and experienced about democratic Israel chose to use such an inaccurate and incendiary term," wrote ADL National Director Abe Foxman in a statement.AIPAC's liberal counterpart, J Street, defended Kerry's comments, saying his critics were attacking the wrong target. "Instead of putting energy into attacking Secretary Kerry, those who are upset with the Secretary’s use of the term should put their energy into opposing and changing the policies that are leading Israel down this road,” said J Street President Jeremy Ben Ami, according to BuzzFeed Politics.“Israel today is not an apartheid state, and that’s not what John Kerry is saying,” said Ben Ami. “For over a year now, Kerry has argued that, without a two-state solution, Israel is risking its future and its values as it moves toward permanent rule over millions of Palestinians without equal rights. Former Prime Ministers Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert have used the ‘apartheid’ term as well to describe this possible future."

<title>UN envoy: Israel and Palestinians must choose, one-state reality or two-state solution</title>
<date>Wed Apr 30 07:53:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The United Nation's top Mideast envoy said Tuesday that Israel and the Palestinians must decide whether to entrench the current "one-state reality" or find a way to salvage the two-state solution following their failure to reach a peace agreement during a nine-month negotiating period.
Robert Serry, the coordinator for the Middle East peace process, told the UN Security Council on Tuesday that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon firmly believes there is a window for a two-state solution.
But he said the parties must reflect whether they want to live up to their stated commitment to the two-state solution, or whether they will let it slip further away by default.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had envisioned brokering a final peace agreement when he brought the sides together last July with an April 29 deadline for restarting official talks, but the negotiations made no progress.

<title>Israeli official: Kerry's apartheid comment calls U.S. role as honest broker into question</title>
<date>Wed Apr 30 12:51:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
John Kerry's statement that Israel will risk becoming an apartheid state if a two-state solution isn't reached soon is one of a series of statements that call into question the Obama administration's "ability to act as an honest broker," Deputy Defense Minister Danny Danon wrote in an opinion piece for Politico.
"Time and again, Secretary Kerry’s erroneous declarations have come dangerously close to suggesting moral equivalency between Israel and its adversaries," wrote Danon. "They call into question his administration’s ability to act as an honest broker in our region."
Danon said Kerry's apartheid comment, which he made while speaking at the Trilateral Commission before senior officials from the United States, Europe, Russia and Japan, was just the latest in a series of destructive statements.
Kerry, who has since clarified that he in no way considers Israel to be an apartheid state, responded to a question in July about why the peace talks were so important by asking whether Israel wants a third intifada. "By insinuating that if we do not give in to every Palestinian demand to ensure a successful end to the talks, we would return to the era of suicide bombers murdering hundreds of civilians in Israeli city centers, the secretary basically asked the state of Israel to negotiate with a loaded gun to our heads," wrote Danon.
Kerry's remark in February that the risks of failed peace talks were high for Israel because "people are talking about boycott" was "another veiled threat at Israel" that "attempted to scare the Israeli public into capitulation," wrote Danon.
The suggestion that "the Jewish people would ever establish an apartheid regime" was "particularly hurtful," wrote Danon, because it was made public on Holocaust Remembrance Day, "the solemn day when we remember the more than six million victims of our people murdered in the Holocaust last century in Europe."

<title>Netanyahu pushing Basic Law defining Israel as Jewish state</title>
<date>Thu May 01 19:00:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday during a visit to Independence Hall in Tel Aviv that he planned to push forward a new Basic Law to "legally anchor" Israel's status as "the nation-state of the Jewish people."
Netanyahu said he believed that the most "basic ingredient in our national lives will win legal status just as other central ingredients that constitute our fundamental core that have already been ruled into the Basic Law of Knesset."
"Unfortunately, as we have seen recently, there are those who do not recognize this natural right and who seek to appeal the historical, legal and moral justification for the existence of the state of Israel as the nation-state of our people," he added. "I see it as one of my basic missions as prime minister to fortify the state of Israel as the nation-state of our people."
Justice Minister Tzipi Livni came out verhemently against Netanyahu's plan, with her office saying she "will not allow the damaging, weakening or subjugating of [Israel's] democratic values to its Jewish values – this is the substance of the Declaration of Independence and the basis of our existence."
Livni has opposed such legislation before and will do so "even if its author is the prime minister," her office added.
Netanyahu continued: "Israel will always preserve full equal rights, both personal and civil, of all citizens of the state of Israel, Jews and non-Jews as one, in the Jewish and democratic state," Netanyahu said. "Indeed, in Israel, individual rights and civil rights are guaranteed to all – something which makes us unique in the Middle East and beyond it."
"It is hard for me to understand that among those calling on Israel to make concessions in Judea and Samaria due to their understandable desire to avoid a bi-national state are those who oppose defining Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people," he added.
"It is impossible to speak out in favor of a Palestinian nation-state just to preserve the Jewish character of the State of Israel, and at the same time, to oppose recognizing that the State of Israel is the nation-state of Jewish people,  Supporting the creation of a Palestinian nation-state and opposing the recognition of a Jewish nation-state undermines in the long run the principle of the State of Israel's right to exist," he said.
In lieu of a formal constitution, a series of Basic Laws adopted by parliament since Israel's founding in 1948 define governmental, legislative and judicial powers, protect civil rights and codify Jerusalem's internationally disputed status as the country's capital.

A women’s football match between Malta and Israel was disrupted on Wednesday by Palestinian protestors carrying a banner that read "Stop Israeli Apartheid," Malta Today newspaper reported.The match continued after police dispersed the protestors and arrested one person. The man, an Italian photographer, was later released after police confirmed that he had Maltese residency.The match was a football World Cup Tournament qualifier.
The protest was organized by the Network for Palestinian Solidarity and supported by Moviment Graffitti, a Maltese NGO which describes itself as being "active against oppression and exploitation of people, environment and animals; with a vision of freedom and radical democracy."The NGO said in a statement that "the Palestine Solidarity Network felt compelled to hold such action as it believes that the current situation of systematic terror, segregation and ethnic cleansing being pursued by the Israeli state merits global denunciation."The NGO said that sport was "one of those areas exposing the condition of systematic oppression" under which Israel was keeping the Palestinians.

<title>Leno: Anyone who's not Kerry is welcome in Israel right now</title>
<date>Fri May 09 20:18:00 IDT 2014</date>

Late night legend Jay Leno, set to host an awards ceremony in Jerusalem later this month, took a jab at the faltering U.S.-Israel relations in an interview with Fox News on Friday, saying "I guess any American that's not John Kerry is more than welcome there right now."
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry recently said Israel could become an "apartheid regime" in a closed meeting. Kerry later apologized for the faux-pas, but it nevertheless put additional strain on the already tense atmosphere between Washington and Jerusalem following the collapse of the peace talks with the Palestinians.
Leno, who will take his first trip to Israel to host the Genesis Prize awards in Jerusalem on May 22, told Fox News he has no problem with visiting the country despite calls by pro-Palestinian groups to boycott Israel.
Leno, who isn't Jewish, said he sees both sides of the conflict, but that he is "very pro-Jewish, very pro-Israeli."
"At some point in your life, you have to sort of take sides. I tend to side with the Jewish point of view on many things, especially issues like this one. I realize how important Israel is," he said.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be among the 400 dignitaries to attend the ceremony, and Leno said the PM can definitely expect to be the target of some jokes.

<title>Trying to be apolitical, Israeli architects wall themselves into boycott</title>
<date>Mon May 12 17:29:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
South Africa during the apartheid era was the only country to be thrown out of the International Union of Architects. Will Israel be the second? This issue is now on the union’s agenda.
Last month, the Royal Institute of British Architects resolved to ask the IUA to expel the Israel Association of United Architects from its ranks until the latter organization expressed opposition to illegal construction in the occupied territories, and took action against those Israeli professionals involved in construction and planning there. RIBA called upon the IAUA to abide by the international union's resolutions from 2005 and 2009, which condemn any act that violates the Fourth Geneva Convention (which protects civilian populations in occupied lands), including construction or development involving ethnic discrimination in illegally conquered territories.
The UIA’s upcoming congress will take place in August in Durban, South Africa, which in itself is quite symbolic. While the UIA’s agencies considered bringing up for a vote at that international event the RIBA demand to ban the Israeli architect's association – the UIA has now decided not to do so. But even if the vote is not taking place, the damage to the IAUA – and perhaps to Israeli architects in general, regardless of their individual political leanings – has been done. The mere threat of expulsion from the UIA, an organization that's more respected than important, constitutes yet another link in the chain of efforts to isolate Israeli society from the community of nations.
Since the call was issued by the British group to ban the Israelis – at the initiative of an organization called Architects and Planners for Justice in Palestine, whose members are active in RIBA – the IAUA's leadership had been working feverishly to thwart the vote, which would have had negative consequences. But, the Israeli association came by this situation honestly: Its insistence on claiming that it is an exclusively professional organization with no political agenda has led it to this point. Its statement that it does not concern itself with political issues, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and that each of its members behaves according to his own world view, sounds hollow in the international arena.
The mantra “I personally do not build in the territories” is no longer a solid defense. After all, being apolitical does not mean being neutral; rather, it is tantamount to taking a stance supporting the status quo. Since architecture is a tool through which political policy is implemented, even if not all the members of the IAUA are involved in planning and construction in the territories, the local organization representing them is now being asked to take a moral stance and use the profession as a tool for implementing it – with or without a decision by RIBA or other agencies.
The RIBA’s call to expel the IAUA from the international club sparked a lively debate in the professional and public international arenas, but no such discussion took place in Israel. The subject stayed in the corridors of the IAUA, which has adopted the stance of the innocent, apolitical victim against the political, scheming, anti-Israel world. The view is that "the whole world is against us."
From that point of departure, the IAUA has been waging a public relations campaign, lobbying and calling upon its members to mobilize “for a mission on Israel’s behalf” instead of looking in the mirror, as they ought to be doing. Among other things, IAUA officials sent a letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron, reminding him that he promised to fight anti-Israel boycotts in the United Kingdom during his visit to the Knesset several months ago. Did anyone mention politics?
Itzhak Lipovetzky-Lir, a past president of the IAUA and its coordinator of international relations, had asked Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman to work against the possible boycott. In a supposedly apolitical context, Lir’s request is ironic in itself: Lir, who accompanied the foreign minister during an official trip to Bulgaria in March, asked for his intervention while they were together. Lieberman said that “because of the many boycotts, Israel’s trade relations and foreign relations are only getting better.” But during a formal event in Sofia, he promised that his office would assist in the matter. If that is not political, what is?
The only local, public response relating to this issue came from Israeli Arab architect Abed Badran, a member of the IAUA’s national board, who is completing his doctorate in architecture in the United Kingdom. In a letter to the IAUA and in a conversation, Badran said that while he saw the proposed ban as unfair collective punishment, he was utterly opposed to asking for the intervention of the Foreign Ministry and Lieberman “because of whom we are dealing with injustice,” and being “linked up to aggressive politics.”
The way to deal with such a situation, Badran suggested, was “direct dialogue with RIBA.” He added that he has now announced his resignation from the IAUA board and had expressed his disappointment that he was “unable to lead [the association members] anywhere.”
Advocates of different views have spoken out about the proposed international boycott. Architects Richard Meier and Daniel Libeskind, both of whom work in Israel, condemned the call by RIBA. “Until now, I had thought that it was a highly respectable organization,” Meier said.
For his part, Libeskind said he was “disappointed” with the British group's call for a ban on the Israelis, adding that it was an “attempt to simplify an extremely complex situation.” The British education minister, Michael Gove, condemned RIBA’s “selective outrage,” asking why it was harassing Israel, of all countries, while it had not taken a similar stance against architects from countries such as Syria or China.
The comparison to countries with worse human-rights records is quite persuasive, but definitely leads to a dead end.
Paul Finch, the editorial director of Architects Journal and a respected left-wing architectural critic, wrote that while he did not support Israeli construction in the territories, he found himself agreeing with Gove for the first time, agreeing that Israel was being judged more harshly than other countries in the region and adding that he had never heard anyone complain to architects such as Rem Koolhaas, Zaha Hadid or others who worked with repressive regimes.
“As for those few professionals engaged in the occupied territories, when signing a contract they should have been asking themselves not whether they had professional sanction to do so, but what involvement in the program said about them as citizens of the world,” Finch wrote.
On the other side of the barricade are dozens of British architects, artists and intellectuals, Jewish and non-Jews alike, who see the decision as a courageous act that draws a red line. Prominent among them is the reasoned response of Eyal Weizman, an Israeli architect who lives in the UK. He pointed out the injustices that Israeli architecture perpetrates in the service of the occupation policy, and says they must be stopped. He added that from a professional perspective, it would be appropriate for architects in Israel to be pained by the damage to the beautiful and fragile landscape of the West Bank, which was destroyed by architecture that was both negligent and criminal. In this context, he said, nonintervention is a political position that has supported violence as a default choice.
Weizman is something of a red flag for the IAUA. In 2002, he and architect Rafi Segal (who also expressed support for RIBA’s decision) curated the exhibition catalog entitled "A Civilian Occupation: The Politics of Israeli Architecture." The IAUA, which had commissioned the exhibition, chose to silence this critical voice regarding local architecture throughout the country’s history. The exhibition was supposed to have been sent to a conference of the UIA, the same organization that was asked to expel the IAUA, but it was cancelled.
In light of the IAUA’s response to the threat of a boycott, and regarding its claim that RIBA’s intention was to “embarrass the State of Israel and cause it harm” – it would appear that the denial and silencing are continuing.
It is doubtful whether IAUA’s officials will relax now that the RIBA’s proposal was rejected. The affair has already opened a door to turmoil even if, as Lir said, “We cannot issue a statement because tomorrow morning there will be no association.”

<title>Netanyahu seeks alternative diplomatic plan in light of failed peace talks</title>
<date>Thu May 15 03:30:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
After he returns from Japan on Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to explore with government and security officials alternative diplomatic options in the wake of the breakdown in negotiations with the Palestinians. This, according to a senior figure in Jerusalem who asked to remain anonymous.
Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting two weeks ago that he wanted ideas from ministers on what steps Israel might take in the new situation created by the end of negotiations and by the recent reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas.
During his visit in Japan Netanyahu told the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun that he was troubled by the standstill in the talks with the Palestinians and its repercussions on Israel.
“I don’t think the status quo is desirable, I don’t want it and I’m engaging in consultations with my own coalition partners and with others, to see if we have other alternatives, because I think the status quo is not a good idea, because I don’t want a binational state,” Netanyahu is cited in an interview to the newspaper.
But a number of Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested that Netanyahu may be more interested in placating coalition partners Justice Minister Tzipi Livni and Finance Minister Yair Lapid than in genuine movement on the conflict with the Palestinians.
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met in London on Wednesday, their first meeting since the peace talks ended and the announcement of the Fatah-Hamas reconciliation. Kerry told the Associated Press he was only talking informally with Abbas before other meetings he’s having today on Syria and Ukraine.
Abbas was expected to tell Kerry he is willing to continue the talks in keeping with the principles agreed on before the end of the nine-month term: Israel’s release of the fourth and final group of Palestinian prisoners and allocating three months to discussing the border issues, while freezing construction in the settlements.
Livni will also be in London in the next few days, but it was not clear yet whether she will meet with Kerry.
In the days immediately following the cabinet resolution to suspend the peace talks, some ministers said alternative strategies must be considered. Livni, in an interview she gave to Israel Channel 2 television on the night of the cabinet resolution, hinted that Israel must consider unilateral measures vis-a-vis the Palestinians.
A few days later Livni had a long talk with leaders of the movement Atid Kahol-Lavan (A Blue and White Future), Gilead Sher and Orni Petrushka, who call for unilateral steps to relax the occupation in the West Bank. They propose suspending construction outside the main settlement blocs in the West Bank and passing laws mandating compensation for settlers who voluntarily agree to move to Israel proper or from outlying settlements to the large settlement blocs.
Over the past two weeks, in closed forums Lapid has also spoken of the need for Israel to consider its options, without elaborating. Economy Minister Naftali Bennett also spoke of an alternative plan, from the right-wing perspective. He believes the state must annex the large settlement blocs – Ariel, Ma’aleh Adumim, Gush Etzion and Alfei Menashe – applying Israeli law to them and grant Israeli citizenship to the Palestinians living in them.
Abbas said Wednesday that the Israeli government is still running on an “old mentality” and blocking the two-state solution that the world and international community have adopted.
Israel is opening the road to one of two options – a binational state or an apartheid state, Abbas said in a recorded speech for Nakba Day, marked annually on May 15.
“It’s time for Israeli leaders to internalize and understand that it’s time to end the longest occupation in history and that the Palestinians have no other homeland but Palestine,” he said.
Abbas reiterated the Palestinian principles that there will be no state and no peace agreement without East Jerusalem and a just solution to the refugees problem in keeping with the Arab peace initiative.

<title>Q&A with Chemi Shalev</title>
<date>Tue May 20 17:00:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Chemi Shalev, Haaretz's U.S. correspondent and senior editor answered readers' questions – on everything from U.S.-Israeli relations to the North American Jewish community.
In his most recent columns, Shalev has written about the ADL's global anti-Semitism survey, how the settlements are ruining any chance of implementing the two-state solution and the role of J Street in American-Jewish life.
Click here to read Chemi Shalev's blog, 'West of Eden.'
------------------------------
Since the "Arab-Jewish conflict" had its name changed to the "Palestinian-Israeli conflict," Israelis being citizens of Israel in spite of religion or place of origin, why is it that only Jews are called settlers instead of any Israelis? Isn't that anti-Semitism practiced by anti-Israel organizations and Haaretz since it is a fact that Arab Jews are not Israeli of origin just like Saudi Arabs are not Israeli of origin?
‫Fred KorrOakland, CA
I’ve never heard the term “Arab-Jewish” conflict used since Israel was established. It’s always been the Arab-Israeli conflict. After Jordan and Egypt signed peace agreements with Israel, I assume it seemed more logical to use the term Israeli-Palestinian conflict or vice versa.
In any case, describing Haaretz as “anti-Semitic” is no way to conduct a dialogue. And I assure you that it isn’t.
--------------------------------------------
If Israel could elect the next U.S. president, who would it pick?
U.S. voter
That’s a tough one. Given that no one knows who the candidates are going to be, it’s also unanswerable. In a very general sense it’s probably true to say that as in recent years, Israelis would probably prefer a Republican candidate. If Jeb Bush runs, I assume his brother’s reputation as a trusted supporter of Israel will work in his favor. But if it is, say, Hillary Clinton against Rand Paul, I would take a wild guess and say that Israelis might tilt the other way, and that might be true even if her opponent is a more mainstream Republican, because many of the potential rivals are unknown to most Israelis.
So? We have to wait, like everyone else, before trying to make an intelligent guess.
---------------------------------
What's your take on the recent killings of Palestinians on Nakba Day? 
Don’t have a take yet. Film is very disturbing, but one must wait to see how it bears up under criticism. And while I am not blind to possibility that Palestinians may inflate Israeli “atrocities” at times, I am also quite certain that many Israeli denials of misdeeds would not withstand the eye of a camera. Heroes and villains live on both sides of the fence.
---------------------------------
Do you think Israel will ever be at peace with its Arab neighbors?
N.J. Jew
Israel is at peace with two of its Arab neighbors – Egypt and Jordan – and is cultivating extraordinarily close ties with Saudi Arabia and Gulf countries because of shared concerns about Iran.
But Israel won’t truly be at peace with the Arab world unless and until the Palestinian problem is solved. 
---------------------------------
Why today's Zionism totally disconnected from the founders main principles and values?
Zeru Tige
That’s a question worthy of a doctoral thesis, but the answer, in any case, is in the eye of the beholder. Also, I don’t know in what why you feel that “today’s Zionism is disconnected from the founders' main principles and values.” The Jewish settlers, for example, seem to view themselves as the direct heirs to the Zionism of yesteryear, while their critics view them as anything but.
---------------------------------
Can you envision a one-state solution where constitutional guarantees allow for freedom of worship in all places; where a safe haven for Jews worldwide is guaranteed; where Palestinian refugees are guaranteed the right of return or compensated? 
Does the Israeli public understand the momentum in the BDS Movement and that the denial that apartheid exits in Israel is a fate well known in South Africa?
Fadi Zanayed
I can certainly “envision” a one-state solution and I know that it is picking up momentum. Nonetheless, I continue to believe that a two-state solution is preferable. I think that the thought that Israelis and Palestinians, given their temperament and history, can get along in one state is a pipe dream.
Do Israelis understand the lurking dangers of BDS and the apartheid label: they are aware of its existence for sure, and many are apprehensive. Nonetheless, a popular Israeli saying is “we survived Pharaoh, we’ll survive this as well” and I suspect that this is the prevailing sentiment regarding BDS as well.
---------------------------------
What happened to the Haaretz apostrophe?
Grammar Nazi
It went the way of the Dodo.
------------------------------
How do you think Jewish candidates will do in the upcoming U.S. midterms? Who are the major Jewish candidates?
Ha! Caught me flat footed on that one. Haven't looked closely at "Jewish candidates" yet.
I think most interesting right now is to follow Eric Cantor's primary race in Virginia: he's expected to win, of course, but he's having a harder time than people expected. If elected, Cantor could become the first ever Jewish Speaker of the House of Representatives. And of course all 21 Jewish Democrats in the House will be competing (except for those like Henry Waxman of California) who have announced their retirement. Senator Al Franken is expected to be easily reelected in Minnesota.
And there are several new Jewish candidates, who I'm sure will get a lot of scrutiny from Jewish media outlets. But other than pride in successful Jews, by the way, the fact that a candidate is Jewish doesn't say much about his views on issues pertaining to Israel and the Palestinians.
------------------------------
What do you think of Foreign Policy's David Rothkopf's statement that the religious garrison state has passed its sell by date? In the face of current resistance to two states by the Israeli settlers, what do you think will be the fate of Palestinians living in the occupied territories?
Sam Siddiqui
I was very much disturbed by Rothkopf’s statement in the sense that I think it reflected the growing disillusionment of American elites, Jewish and otherwise, with Israel and its policies. I think there will be no reversal to this trend unless a two-state solution is somehow resuscitated and achieved. It is now less fashionable than ever before to cling to a belief that such a solution is possible, but nonetheless, I personally can see no other solution. All the other scenarios, to my mind, will end in tragedy for both sides and, on the way, will also cause a complete disconnect with the same American elites.
------------------------------
Don't you think Obama's Mideast policy is a failure? I mean, by now, after Egypt, Syria, and the peace process its clear that he isn't exactly on the same page with his allies, why should Israel trust him on Iran?
Do I think Obama's Middle East policy is a failure? That's too general.
Remember, Obama was elected in 2008 based on his pledge to withdraw American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan - by that measure, his policy is a a success, even if situation in both countries is far from ideal.
On other fronts, it's a mixed bag: Syria is a failure in my books, despite chemical weapons deal, because Obama lost a lot of credibility there and did very little to prevent the horrific killings; in Egypt it is neither here nor there - at least from Israel's point of view - Egyptian regime is still peace partner and now in conflict with Hamas.
In the Gulf, no doubt U.S. lost prestige.
As for Iran, I think that: 1) Even if he has failed to inspire trust and confidence among Israelis, Obama has proven that he is genuinely committed to Israel's security. 2) Not sure there is any other option - that is, not sure Israel can decide that it doesn't trust Obama and go on its own. 3) Don't forget that an overwhelming majority of the U.S. public supports diplomacy with Iran and opposes armed conflict. And Obama, first and foremost, is the president of the Americans, not the Middle Easterners.
------------------------------
How would you compare the state of press freedom in Israel of 2014 with that of the U.S. and Canada?
In "The J Street Confrontation" (8 May 2014) you wrote: 
"Finally it should be noted that the J-Street brouhaha hardly caused a stir in Israel and was largely ignored by its media, either as a reflection of the distance between the two communities or of a lack of interest in what may have seemed like yet another squabble between Jewish askanim (functionaries). But the debate could have long-term consequences for the unity of the American Jewish community and for the clarity of its support for Israel. This danger is amplified, of course, in the absence of a viable peace process that both sides can support, albeit with hesitation and reservations."
So it appears that while American Jews are furiously debating whether it is appropriate to "criticize Israel" — a core issue concerning J Street — the Israelis seemingly could care less. Is that so? If not, then why the lack of media coverage? If so, then perhaps someone should inform the diaspora.
Jonathan BlankAtlanta, Georgia
Though perhaps it has changed in recent years, I think there was, is and possibly will be a great emotional and psychological gap between Israeli and American Jews. In certain ways, the relationship has always been one-sided: many American Jews take a great interest in Israel, but the other way round? Not so much.
Israelis are grappling with same questions of who can say what and where and unfortunately, I believe, are growing less tolerant of dissent as time goes by. But even if the J-Street issue mirrors that in some way, it has not caused any great stir among Israeli, who, like most nations, are mostly interested in themselves. Being largely uniformed, many Israelis I think do not grasp how critical American Jews are to their welfare.
------------------------------
If all the Jews leave America and go live in Israel – which is what Zionists want – who will be left to look out for Israel in Washington?
Yaakov
I don’t think we need to lose any sleep at this point. I don’t see more than a trickle of American Jews coming to Israel any time in the near future. The real issue is distance of younger Jews from Israel, diminishment of drawing power of Holocaust, establishment of state and Six-Day War. And the occupation that is gnawing away at the attachment of many liberal minded American Jews.
That’s something that Israelis should worry about, though I’m not sure they do.
------------------------------
Thanks for your excellent articles, which combine wit and humor with great insight and analysis. Do you ever get discouraged writing about Israel and the Middle East (not to mention U.S. politics), and want to write angry and despairing columns?
Jon Katz
Thank you for that (sure we're not related?).
I often want to write angry and despairing columns (and sometimes do) but I don't always assume that I have anything to contribute to the reader with my anger and despair, which is my main criteria for writing an article or not. Also, anger and despair are quite common these days, no?
Definitely more prevalent than optimism and hope (which I admit are getting harder to justify) both in relation to Israel and the Middle East and internal strife in the American Jewish community. I must admit that I was moved by the scene I witnessed this Sunday, which I wrote about, in which actor Sean Penn received a warm welcome from a decidedly right wing audience in a fundraiser in Manhattan. Don't think it will last or that it is necessarily meaningful for other circumstances, but it at least showed that moments of reconciliation and goodwill have not perished altogether.
------------------------------
Do you believe that cooperation and friendship among Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel is an important aspect of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Have the trends been favorable in recent years for increasing cooperation and connectedness among Jewish and Arab communities within the Green Line? Of course there have been terrible price tag attacks, but I am wondering if day-to-day connectedness has been improving among the majority of citizens despite the terrible actions of a small number of extremists.
Ronald Wilkins
Very good and complex question.
Of course, relations between Israel and its Arab citizens (or Palestinian, as they prefer) can and should be a critical element in relations between Israel and Palestinians. Unfortunately, not all Israeli politicians understand or agree with this and have succeeded in alienating Arab Israelis and signaling that they are not welcome (re Lieberman's offer to "secede" Arab populations inside Green Line to future Palestinian state).
I also think that Netanyahu's emphasis on Israel being a Jewish state has alienated many Israeli Arabs. I often think that the political leadership of Israeli Arabs could be much more constructive if it tried to serve as a bridge between Israelis and Palestinians, but they seem to be gravitating more and more to complete identification with Palestinian positions (and not necessarily moderate ones).
On the other hand (there always is in our area) life goes on, Arabs are integrating more and more in the Israeli economy. Just this week polls were released showing that the attachment of Israeli Arabs to their Israeli citizenship is growing, as is their wish for this to stay in place. One can well understand that despite the conflict and the fact that they are often the victims of discrimination, when they look around at neighboring Lebanon, Syria, Egypt or Gaza, Israeli Arabs can confidently tell themselves that things could be much worse.
------------------------------
Thanks for all your great coverage of news both from Israel and the North American Jewish community.
We know that the West Bank settlement activities are hindering the confidence of the Palestinians in negotiating a two-state resolution, especially with the younger settlers radicalism making reconciliation a more difficult challenge. But let's say the Israeli government has a handle on these radical groups and would retain the major settlement blocs in a peace agreement with the PA. However, is not the continued Hamas negation of the Quartet's conditions, holding everything up with an impasse in negotiations? How can Israel be confident that these Palestinian radical groups of Hamas and Islamic Jihad give up their modus operandi? Israel wants to make peace with a democratic Palestinian nation, not a theocracy which wants to eliminate its existence.
Smadar
Of course you are right and the concerns that you raise are shared, I believe, by most Israelis. I think that in the current context of the government that may be set up, President Abbas seeks to finesse the issue of Hamas non-recognition by establishing a so-called “technocratic” cabinet that would have no declared members of Hamas and that could thus accept the Quartet conditions. This is a position that seems to be acceptable for the U.S. government. Israel, on the other hand, has rejected such a government, even if it technically abides by the conditions, claiming that it is but a façade.
More importantly, there is the age old question of the chicken and the egg: Is there any chance of moderating Palestinian public opinion as long as the conflict continues and the occupation ensues? Some people seem to believe so. I personally don’t. Therefore, even though one cannot dismiss your concerns, the alternative is worse because it promises that the conflict will continue to nurture extremists who won’t recognize Israel. And so on.
------------------------------
Do you see BDS as a legitimate form of non-violent protest?
SamanthaBerkley
That one is a minefield for people like me who consider themselves to be: 1. Israeli patriots; 2. Committed to a two-state solution; 3. Opposed to settlements – especially beyond settlement blocs, and; 4. Despairing of leadership and public opinion that doesn't realize that time is running out.
So if you want my personal position, it is that I do not support BDS but I also do not automatically condemn BDS supporters as anti-Semitic or opponents of Israel's existence (though there are many BDS leaders who are at least one of those). I will say that I think that Israelis are far too complacent about the danger that, absent a peace process, BDS will reach a tipping point one day and suddenly catch on like wildfire.
------------------------------
Who do you regard as Israel's finest leader Israel and who would you like to see lead the country over the coming years?
HannahBerkley
My personal favorites among Israeli leaders are (in chronological order)
1. Ben Gurion (of course)2. Levi Eshkol (a sign of age, I think, but also as symbol of how one can be a good leader despite an appalling lack of charisma)3. Yitzhak Shamir (I detested his politics but admired his commitment and ideology and iron will)4. Yitzhak Rabin (for his authenticity and quintessential Israeli-ness)
As for whom would I like to see, I'll have to get back to you, as soon as I locate a potential candidate....
------------------------------
What do you think are the biggest misapprehensions between Israelis and American Jews?
Rochelle,London
That is worthy of a book. I think both sides have distorted images of each other, based mainly on stereotypes, but I have to say that I think that Israelis are much more ignorant about American Jews than vice versa, by the very nature of their relationship. Israel a focal point for many if not most American Jews, while Israelis barely take an interest in American Jews (see recent flap with acceptance of J-Street into Conference of Presidents, which was barely mentioned in Israeli media). I think there is slightly more awareness now in Israel that we need to listen more to American Jews, but I don't want to exaggerate the importance of this.
------------------------------
Why the hell should I pay for Haaretz when I can get the same news for free elsewhere???
Non-subscriber
I’m not sure news should be free. It’s a service provided by many hardworking people who expect to be paid for doing their job. It’s true that the internet has burst the former business model of providing news and that there is an enormous output of free news, but I think that pattern is changing as more and more quality news outlets begin to put up paywalls.
I would agree with you if it was true that Haaretz provides the same news that you can get for free elsewhere. But I don’t think that is the case: I think (I’m biased, of course) that the news and views provided by Haaretz are better, deeper, more interesting, more accurate, more pertinent etc. We’re not perfect, of course, but if you really want to know what there is to know about Israel and the Middle East, I think that a subscription to Haaretz is essential – whatever your point of view.
------------------------------
Why is the U.S. pointing the finger to Israel on the Peace process collapse when it is clear that Abbas is the Rejectionist?
Jane McDowell
I'm not sure that "it's clear that Abbas is the rejectionist", as you say, but I can cite a few reasons why the Obama Administration might be emphasizing Israel's role in the breakdown of Kerry's efforts:
1. This Administration has viewed settlements from the outset as main obstacle to peace, as seen in first term insistence on freezing them.
2. Lingering ill will between two governments and two leaders.
3. View of Abbas as weaker party who needs more support.
4. Wish to avoid repetition of Clinton pinning the blame exclusively on Palestinians, move which some view as having escalated violence and Second intifada.
5. Reaction to Israeli efforts to pin blame exclusively on other side.
6. Effort to ostracize settler leaders and proponents who have been singled out for blame by Administration officials in order to weaken their position in Israeli public opinion.
------------------------------
Will Israel ever qualify for another World Cup – and is it worth making peace with the Arabs just to get back into the much easier Asian qualifying groups?Geordie
First of all, as a nation that believes in miracles, we should never say never (and I say this as someone who is old enough to remember the thrill of 1970, the last time we played). Secondly, yes, that's a very good reason for making peace with the Arabs. And third, the only way to ensure that we will get into World Cup is to demand that qualifiers be held on religious basis. We'll take on any other Jewish team in the world (and hopefully stand a fighting chance(!
------------------------------
When is Israel going to admit what it did to the Palestinians in 1948 and publicly apologize for its ethnic cleansing of Palestine?
I think the word “ethnic cleansing” is used out of the context that existed in 1948. I think there is growing public scrutiny of the events in the 1948 war but I think most Israelis are light years away from thinking of apologizing. It is a very complex psychological question (see how long it took for Australians to apologize for their treatment of Aborigines, and I think Native Americans are still waiting for their apology and I believe that both those cases were far more severe than what happened in Palestine).
Also: 1. I believe that Israelis should be made aware of what happened and should accept that the creation of Israel entailed a great tragedy for the Palestinians for which Israelis were partially responsible 2) I don’t think the Palestinians are more advanced in scrutinizing their own past and coming to terms with their own failures, omissions and sins in this century old conflict. 3) I think that if there will ever be a two-state solution, it would be good for both sides to acknowledge the others’ most basic core beliefs (Jewish claim on Palestine vs recognition of Nakba, for example(.
------------------------------
The ADL survey was a worthless effort because it avoided key questions and doesn't target those who influence opinion. 500 randoms for Australia (example) doesn't prove squat. The questions to ask need to be centered around how opinion is cemented. As I read it this survey was only a measure of anti-Semitism and a shallow one at that. Without detailed demographics it is difficult to interpret. Indeed to be useful one needs the dataset and not a document. So, my questions are...
1. How does Jewish behavior and Israel impact on anti-Semitism? Clearly anti-Semitism, unlike this report which seems to claim some total disconnect, is generated by JEWISH BEHAVIOURS. Indeed if my Jewish friends were surveyed using those questions, their anti-Semitism would be off the scale. Reason—They lived in Israel and know how foul it can be.
2. Will the Jewish community stand up and deal with those in its ranks that create anti-Semitism?Yani
I apologize but I’m not sure I’m following you completely. If you’re saying that anti-Semitism is the fault of the Jews themselves, than give me a break and leave me alone. If you’re saying that the situation in Israel and the Middle East may be a contributing factor to anti-Jewish sentiments, then that is a more formidable claim which probably has some merit, especially in countries in which there are no Jews and which see themselves as being in a state of conflict with Israel.
The ADL survey has come under a lot of criticism, but they did not claim that it is unconnected to views on Israel. They just said there not enough conclusive date one way or another.
And by the way, as far as I know, the surveys were carried out in scientific manner: a sample of 500 is considered representative in many polls.
------------------------------
Before I ask the question I'll explain my connection to Israel. In 2004 I started a year of volunteering service in AKIM Ashdod working as an art-teacher for disabled kids and adults. After 10 years, I defended MA thesis on Israeli cinema and started publishing short stories and articles about contemporary Israel, all based on my personal experience. So far I found it hard to be made to explain the Europeans that Israel in neither a "racists state" nor a paradise and that there is no obvious way to make judgments once You lived there.
I know it might be a wish rather than a question, but I dare to address it as a Polish journalist to an Israeli journalist: Here's my question: How can I, as a journalist and a writer, help Israelis achieve peace?Jakub Wydrzynski
If I could give you a hint how to make peace, I would have done so long ago. I think it is important however not to give up hope and to believe that peace is possible. I’m assuming that this is your point of view, so expressing would of course be helpful.
And if you happen to come upon the secret formula, don’t be a stranger…
------------------------------
What is your input on all the recent Newsweek espionage reports: who's in charge of this anti-Israel briefing?
I have no real information. Some of the stories I find incredible (women and drugs for visitors to Israel? give me a break), others I think define legitimate information gathering for business reasons as espionage. There's a clash of mentalities, with Israelis' cut to the chase improvisation probably grating on nerves of many strait-laced American officials. I also think that Israelis would be nuts to pursue out and out spying activities in light of Pollard fallout. But to tell you that despite the smoke there is absolutely no fire? Can't do that either.
------------------------------
Why were so many reports on the ADL survey so quick to conclude that 25 percent of the people in the world "hate" Jews? Hate is a very strong, inciteful, word and in the absence of any opportunity to quantify the degree to which one agreed with the ADL's "Jewish stereotypes", how could anyone objectively conclude that these people harbor hatred of Jews?Lou Arpino
Actually, ADL did not use the word “hate”. Their survey says 26 percent of surveyed population “harbor anti-Semitic views”. And even that statement, as you probably know, has been the subject of heated discussion in recent weeks. If, for one, am not sure that attitude towards Jews in Arab countries, especially Palestinian territories, that view themselves as being in a conflict with Israel, are comparable to attitudes in other parts of the world. And in other parts, as survey shows, there is a big difference between countries that have sizeable Jewish populations and in which anti-Semitism is relatively low, and those that don’t, where it is higher.
Which can lead one to the [optimistic] conclusion that the less people know about Jews, the less they like them – and vice versa.
------------------------------
From reading Haaretz, it's fair to assume that there are no significant Jewish-Palestinian groups that work jointly towards a two state solution. There does not appear to be any cooperation on a common, mutually respectful and honest historical narrative. There is little said about Israeli-Palestinian joint business ventures. There's little press about joint cultural groups, medical facilities, or educational institutions (outside of the "Seeds of Peace" type articles here and there). There is no coordination between Jews and Palestinians concerning Palestinian refugees who flee Syria or Iraq and end up in weird places like Bangkok. Do Jews within the Green Line really live in a different universe than Palestinians in Ramallah? Is the distance between Tel Aviv and Nablus really about the same as between Earth and Mars, or is this primarily a reporting biasCharles Rich
There are several groups devoted to fostering Israeli-Palestinian collaboration (One Voice comes to mind) but the answer is yes, the psychological and emotional gaps between Israelis and Palestinians are enormous, despite their physical proximity.
I think this is true of all nations that have endured such a long conflict (Think of French and Germans till end of war).  Nonetheless, consider this: If you were to take 100 people, each from a different country, and put them in the same room, I have no doubt that Israelis and Palestinians would have more in common, and feel more comfortable with each other, than with anyone else. They will like the same food, enjoy the same scenery, understand each other’s gestures and allusions and – don’t tell anyone – probably see that, in many ways, they are more alike than different.
------------------------------
I have two questions:
Question 1: Why is Bernard Lewis's opinion that for the Iranian mullahs "mutually assured destruction (MAD) is not a deterrent, it's an inducement" completely ignored by the U.S. media and Haaretz?
Question 2:On April 27, Pres. Obama said: “On this Yom HaShoah, let us recommit ourselves to the task of remembrance, and to always oppose anti-Semitism wherever it takes root. Together, we must give enduring meaning to the words 'Never Again'." Yet President Obama continues to support the Muslim Brotherhood, the virulently anti-Semitic organization. How do American Jews resolve this dichotomy?
I don’t think the view that Iranian leadership is guided by apocalyptic beliefs is being completely ignored in Israel, though I admit it is submerged in the day to day reporting on negotiations with Iran. I think Israelis are well aware of this line of thought. However you must also take into account that a great many people in the know, including those in the highest echelons of Israeli and U.S. intelligence, believe that the Iranian regime is completely rational and is focused mainly on its own survival. And I pray that they are right.
And I doubt whether Obama “supports the Muslim Brotherhood.” He supported the Morsi regime in Egypt for a while, as did many other governments in the world, as a matter of realpolitik.

How would you rate the present level of relations between the U.S. and Israel?JI
Hmmm, name sounds familiar. Very complex question: public support for Israel is as high as ever, security collaboration is deep and wide and Congress is solidly pro-Israel. BUT: Unrepairable levels of distrust and actual dislike between leaderships of both countries (though they are able to pretend otherwise) and growing disaffection with Israel in liberal circles, both Jewish and otherwise, especially academia. At this point, Israel is not a burning issue in American mindset so I don't see any change in immediate future (note how few articles there were in American op-ed pages about breakdown of Kerry initiative). But future has ominous warning signs, especially if Palestinian arena flares up or if agreement is reached with Iran. If I were running things, I would not take American support for granted and I would be very concerned about potential split in Jewish support.

<title>Q&A with Haaretz diplomatic correspondent Barak Ravid</title>
<date>Tue May 27 17:28:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Haaretz's diplomatic correspondent, Barak Ravid, answered your questions on Tuesday - on everything from the Israeli-Palestinian peace process to Jerusalem's often fraught relations with its allies.
In his most recent articles, Ravid has reported on the Obama Administration's plans for Mideast peace, the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs ' involvement in Israel's campaign against Iran's nuclear program and the mysterious guest list from the seder meal hosted by Israel's Ambassador in Washington, Ron Dermer.

----------
Q: Since everyone knows how peace is supposed to look like why won't Israel agree to withdraw to the '67 lines? Isn't it obvious by their settlement expansion literally all over the West Bank and Jordan Valley believe their BS about desiring two states? The US is really the only country that believes Israel. Stephanie Jaber
A: The answer to this question is simple – the current Israeli government is completely dominated by the settler lobby in the Knesset. The ministry of housing that is in charge of many of the building tenders in the settlements is being held by the Jewish Home party that opposes the 2 state solution and support further expansion of settlements. As long as they are part of the coalition there will be no possibility for any real movement towards a peace agreement.
----------
Q: As hard as it is to predict Israeli politics, as well as near-future events, how do you imagine the geopolitical picture one year from now (status-quo, changes on the ground)? And what about the Israeli political scene – do you see Netanyahu completing his current term in office? Simon Luling
A: It is not only hard to predict that – it is impossible. At the end of the day it is Israel we are talking about. A country in which one day's news cycle is equivalent to the news cycle of one month in almost any other western country. What I think we will see in the next few months is a vector of deterioration in the relations between Israel and the Palestinians and a more confrontational reality – whether diplomatically or on the ground. If things start to escalate it will be very hard to stop it and the risk of violence will grow.
---------
Q: Prime Minister Netanyahu recently told Jeffrey Goldberg that Israel is considering unilateral steps in the wake of the collapse of the Kerry effort. Do you believe he would risk the composition of the current coalition to implement a unilateral withdrawal plan? Abe Silberstein
A: Netanyahu still does not have a "Plan B". He knows he will have to find an alternative to the "peace talks" that were taking place in the last 9 months and to the US led process – now that President Obama announced a "pause" in US engagement on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Netanyahu knows that without such an alternative – even if it's just for show – the international pressure on Israel will rise immensely. So Netanyahu is looking for something to fill the vacuum that was created in order to prevent it from being filled by international initiatives that will be hard for him to swallow. For now I don’t see Netanyahu going for a unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank or from parts of it, but the fact he started hinting at such a possibility need not be written off right away.
----------
Q:When I read various Israeli media a picture of fragmentation emerges. Around Israel countries are instable. Within Israel a broad coalition is needed to govern the nation. This gives a coalition with large gaps in ideology and political aim. Various bills in Knesset aim at restricting future governments to act at important dossiers. Various groups within Israeli society are resisting change (like enlistment, secular civil procedures etc..) Any Palestinian state might end up like Syria.
Given all these observations, are we looking from abroad in an over simplifying attitude? What should improve to really co-operate with Israel and its neighbors?
Writsaert van den Born, The Netherlands
A: I think that Israel and many of its neighbors have a huge interest to cooperate and work together these days. The Syria crisis, terrorism in Sinai, the Iranian nuclear crisis – those are all issues that are important for Israel and for countries like Egypt, Jordan. Saudi Arabia. The UAE and many others. Behind the scenes – especially in intelligence channels – there are contacts between Israel and those countries, but Israel is still being perceived as "the mistress" that should be kept discreetly. Like it or not – but the key for taking this relationship to the next level and put it out in the open is progress towards an independent Palestinian state. The best tool for that is the Arab peace initiative. Unfortunately until today no Israeli government really used the Arab peace initiative as a basis for greater engagement with the Arab world.
----------
Q: Israel has a great future. What should be done to protect it? Bob, US
A: Israel's future is first and foremost connected to its international legitimacy. Therefore two things are critical for Israel – having final and internationally recognized borders and strengthening Israel's democratic institutions.
----------
Q: Is the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu the worst in U.S.-Israeli history?
A: I don’t know if you can determine it is the worst in history. What is obvious us that the Obama-Netanyahu relationship is very bad. The two are coming from a very different political background. Obama is a liberal Democrat and Netanyahu is a conservative Republican. Although they did manage to work together on certain issues, they couldn’t develop the intimacy which is required for such a sensitive relationship. Most of their meetings were full of disagreements and confrontations. Both of them would like to see the other guy out of office. I don’t see that changing in the next 2.5 years.
----------
Q: Will Livni ever be prime minister?
A: I will make this answer short: No
----------
Q: Do you agree with John Kerry that Israel is on its way to becoming an apartheid state?
A: I think that we are already at the beginning of this process in the West Bank. The situation in the West Bank has some elements of apartheid. Jewish settlers have far more rights than the Palestinian citizens of the West Bank that are living under occupation. But I think the right comparison is not South African Apartheid but French occupation of Algeria, especially when it comes to the political power the settlers have over the government decision making.
----------
Q: What do you think will be the Israeli reaction if an agreement is reached in the P5+1 talks with Iran and what are the chances of an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities occurring before or after such an agreement?
A: I think there is a good chance we will see a comprehensive agreement between Iran and the six world powers – if not by July 20th, then in the next 3-6 months. The Iranians have a huge interest in getting such an agreement – much more than the P5+1. In a case of an agreement Israel would have to 'swallow the frog'. I don’t see any possibility of an Israeli military strike in Iran as long as talks are ongoing or after an agreement is reached. The question will be what might happen if there is no agreement and if the nuclear talks collapse. In this case, it is a whole new ball game and the Israeli threat of bombing the Iranian nuclear facilities will come back to table – front and center.
----------
Q: Reading many of your articles in the past, is your responsibility the PM's office? I frequently feel your reporting is spouting Netanyahu's hasbara verbatim. I'm interested in the truth and not his version of it.
A: As part of my job I need to cover the PM's office and report its version of things. This does not mean it is all I do. If you read my articles you must know that very well. You use the term "the truth" – it is a very complex term – who decides what the "truth" is. Many times I encountered people who claim my articles are correct when they liked the content and claimed they were a bunch of lies when they didn’t like it.
----------
Q: Peres said he reached agreement w/Abbas but Bibi nixed it. Now he's going to Rome. Has the president's office gained prestige? @theyoshasit 
Q: Do you support the BDS movement?
A: In general I am against boycotting people and I do not see myself as a supporter of the BDS movement. I support ending the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, stopping settlement activity, ending all Israeli government investment and spending on the settlements and forming an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Unfortunately I think that many supporters of the BDS movement are not supporters of the two-state solution like I am. 
----------
Q: Would you ever report something that was said to you 'off the record' if you thought it would help save Israel from another war?
A: It is a very theoretical question. I can't imagine a scenario that this dilemma will be really relevant. I think that if such a dilemma arises I will find a way to get conformation from other sources in order to publish the information. 
----------
Q: As someone who is due to be drafted into the Israeli army in a few months, how can I balance my desire to respect the laws of this country and defend its people, when at the same time knowing that the IDF is an occupation force, which day and day out ruins the lives of Palestinian men, women and children?
A: I served in the IDF for 6 years as an officer. I had the same dilemmas. I think it is important that the IDF has soldiers who have such dilemmas and not just robots that don't think or trigger-happy soldiers that only want to release their frustration on Palestinian citizens. If you say 'I don’t want to be part of this' – you're just giving up and letting other, more negative people take your place. And remember – the IDF does not choose its missions; the government does. Actually, many army commanders are far more moderate than politicians when it comes to the Palestinian issue. In order for the IDF to stop being an occupying army there needs to be a change of government.
----------
Q: Do you have any interest in our God?
A: If the question is whether I see myself as a religious person or as an observant Jew – than the answer is no. In general I am not a big fan of any religion. 
----------
Q: Is Netanyahu turning vegan?
A: I don’t think Netanyahu is turning vegan, but he is raising public awareness to animal rights more than any other prime minister. One of his sons is vegetarian and his wife also had influence on him regarding animal rights.
----------
Q: Who do you think could replace Netanyahu as PM?
A: For now Netanyahu's biggest asset is the fact that there is no natural alternative candidate for the Prime Minister's post. On the other hand – many people in Israel are tired of Netanyahu and the Likud party and fed up with many of their policies – mainly on social economic issues. I remind you that the political system in Israel is a parliamentary one and to be Prime Minister you need to form a coalition. Bibi and the Likud might not get enough seats in the Knesset in the next elections to form a coalition. In this case someone else – like labor party leader Isaac Hertzog might get a chance to form a coalition. But this is all speculation and it is impossible to know how the political map might look like when elections are announced.
----------
Q: How come Netanyahu is giving interviews to foreign media and not so much to Israeli news outlets?
A: Very good question! I wonder about this myself. I think Netanyahu doesn’t respect the role of the press in the Israeli democracy and feels he can just ignore it. it is a big mistake on Netanyahu's part and he is only further alienating the Israeli press. Regarding his interview to the international press – they are usually much easier for him. Most of them are on TV and he just spits out his regular talking points without being challenged to much by the interviewer that usually does not have enough information and knowledge of the issues.
----------
Q: Israel is, as we all know, a country that is fiercely being criticized as regards its abidance of human rights. Reading Haaretz and its frequent (justly) criticism of the Israeli government, it seems to me that one thing, the freedom of press (especially compared to its neighbors), is being guaranteed well in Israel. Is this a correct observation, or is freedom of press limited and at stake in your country? P.J. van der Meij, The Netherlands 
A: I think you are right. Freedom of the press is very strong in Israel. For sure if you compare it to Israel's neighbors. That does not mean everything is perfect. When it comes to national security issues there are still some limitations that need to be scaled down if not totally canceled. But the bigger problem is the way Israeli politicians treat the press, the way they refuse to answer question and the way government ministries lack transparency. 
----------
Q: Many people reckon the pope's 'sudden' decision to stop by the Apartheid wall in Bethlehem and pray is of great importance and reflects the shift in world's views regarding Israel as an Apartheid state as a result to the growing BDS campaign. Do you agree or do you think it is just another media stunt?
A: I think that his prayer next to the separation wall was symbolically important, but not more than that. So was his visit to the terror victims' memorial site in Israel. I wouldn’t read too much into either of them.
----------
Q: At Herzl's tomb ceremony with the pope, the two children holding the wreath were one Filipino child and one black child. Who chose them? The pope or some Israeli official? Who are these children (not their names but are they Israeli?) Nicole Cohen-Addad
A: Sorry, I really don’t know!
----------
Q: Is Sarah Netanyahu really as some influential as people claim she is?
A: Sarah Netanyahu is very influential on Netanyahu's decision making – and this is an understatement. It would not be an exaggeration to say she is much more influential over her husband than Michele Obama is over hers. It is enough to see how much effort Netanyahu put into trying to prevent MK Reuven Rivlin from running for President. A big part of Netanyahu's motivation to do that came from his wife.
----------
Q: Does it concern you that a large part of the Israeli public believes that you do not report objectively but rather filter every article (and even your choice of articles to write) to reflect your own subjective political agenda and beliefs? Jacob Weiss. 
A: I don’t think that the term objectivity is relevant or that such a thing even exists – at least not in people that have a pulse. The only objective things I know are stones, trees and other inanimate objects. Every person in every field of life has an agenda – and rightly so. A journalist need not be "objective". He has to be honest, professional and give his readers as much new information as possible. The question is not for whom I voted in the last elections but if my articles are correct, well-founded and are written with ethical standards. I hope this description fits my work in Haaretz. 
----------
Q: Even if you want to accept that at least on some level, Abbas alone is committed to a peace agreement, how can Israel hope to successfully find peace with someone who partners up with an organization sworn to Israel's destruction (Hamas)? Lior Trink
A: first I want to make clear that I think Netanyahu and Abbas are both not really committed to making the needed compromises and the tough decision necessary for a peace agreement. But on your question regarding Hamas: the PLO also wanted to destroy Israel for 25 years but finally recognized it and decided it wants a Palestinian state alongside Israel and not instead of Israel. I don’t know if Hamas will ever get there but I know that if the only policy towards them will be boycott they will only harden their positions. 
----------
Q: What's the best scoop you've ever had?
A: I think the biggest scoop was when I published the new EU guidelines that ban any funding to West Bank settlements or to entities that are connected to the settlements. You can read about it here and here. This story was so important because it influenced not only Netanyahu's decision making regarding peace talks with the Palestinians but mostly because it had a huge effect on public opinion in Israel and on the Israeli discourse regarding the settlements. This story keeps on resonating in different angles since then and I think it made clear to many Israelis that the occupation has a price.

<title>South Africa's De Klerk: Without peace, Israel heading toward apartheid</title>
<date>Wed May 28 18:05:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
South Africa's last president under white rule has suggested that Israel risks heading toward apartheid if it does not reach a peace deal with the Palestinians.
The comments by F.W. de Klerk echo warnings made by Palestinian, American and dovish Israeli officials. But his words carry special meaning, given his role in South Africa's painful history of race relations.
De Klerk was the last president under apartheid and along with the late Nelson Mandela, brought about the end to decades of systematic racial discrimination against blacks, jointly winning the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize.
Comparisons to South Africa's racist rule have increased in public discourse about Israel and its treatment of Palestinians. In April, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry — who had been mediating negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians — set off an uproar when he made a similar warning.
In an interview aired Tuesday on Israeli Channel 2 TV, de Klerk said calling Israel an apartheid state now was "unfair." But he said that without the establishment of a Palestinian state, Israel may have to contend with the consequences of one state for both peoples.
"The test will be (does) everybody living then in such a unitary state, will everybody have full political rights?" de Klerk said. "Will everybody enjoy their full human rights? If they will, it's not an apartheid state."
He added: "There will come in Israel a turning point where if the main obstacles at the moment which exist to a successful two-state solution are not removed, the two-state solution will become impossible."
De Klerk was in Israel receiving an honorary doctorate from the University of Haifa.
Israeli backers of the creation of a Palestinian state say relinquishing control of the Palestinian territories and its roughly residents is the only way to ensure Israel's future as a democracy with a Jewish majority. Following the collapse of the most recent round of peace talks, fears that the sides could be headed toward a single "binational" state are growing. The Palestinians want the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem — territories captured by Israel in 1967 — for their hoped-for independent state.
Israel is a democracy whose Arab minority holds citizenship rights. Israeli Arabs often complain of discrimination but have reached senior positions in government, the judiciary, the foreign service and other fields including the military.
But it is the situation in the West Bank that sparks comparisons to apartheid. The territory is home to two populations — a Palestinian majority of some 2.4 million people and a Jewish settler minority of 350,000 — that are subject to two vastly different legal and political systems. Israeli West Bank settlers, for instance, can vote in Israeli elections, while Palestinians cannot.
Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
Israel vehemently rejects any comparison to apartheid-era South Africa. While South Africa's was a system rooted in race, Israel says the differences in the West Bank stem from legal issues and security needs.
Most of its leaders, including hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have endorsed the idea of establishing a Palestinian state to protect Israel's Jewish majority.
"The two-state solution might be the best one," de Klerk said. "You'll have to move fast. See the window of opportunity. Jump through it. It might close."
A number of prominent centrist Israelis, including former prime ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak, and the current chief peace negotiator, Tzipi Livni, have invoked the apartheid analogy in their calls for a peace agreement and change in the status quo.
Paul Hirschson, a South African-born spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry, brushed off de Klerk's remarks, saying Israel would not accept a one-state solution.
"It's not a warning. It's a comment by people who misunderstand Israel, the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Middle East," he said.
Mohammed Madani, a senior Palestinian official in charge of outreach to Israeli society said Israel should take note of de Klerk's words.
"When the leader of the former apartheid regime in South Africa warns Israel of going down the road to this style, it should listen to him carefully because he knows what he is talking about," he said.

<title>Justin Timberlake angers Palestinians with Western Wall Instagram pic</title>
<date>Thu May 29 21:04:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Pop star Justin Timberlake, who performed in front of over 40,000 Israelis Wednesday night in Tel Aviv as part of his 20/20 Experience World Tour, is getting virtually slammed by Palestinians for posting a photo of himself on Instagram praying at the Western Wall with the hashtag 
Israel.
The caption on the photo said: "The Holy Land... What an experience. I will never forget this day," adding the hashtag 
Israel. The photo has already received nearly a quarter of a million likes.
But there have also been many disgruntled comments left by Palestinians: "There was never an Israel, this was always Palestine," one Instagram user wrote. Another left the comment; "FYI , it's called 
PALESTINE" and "Theres no land called israel be sure of that , its palestine and forever."
On Haaretz's Facebook page reporting on his arrival and photo-op, several users left similar comments: "I lost all respect for Timberlake because he is performing in Israel when there is a Boycott movement against Israel for its apartheid practices."
Another user wrote "Go visit Palestine."
However, there were also many comments of support on Timberlake's Instagram photo, as well as on Haaretz's Facebook page. For example:
"Thank you for coming to Tel Aviv!! By coming to Israel, the only democracy in the mid east where full citizenship and equal rights exist for all who live thereyou and others like the Rolling Stones, Lady Gaga stand up against BDS supporters and hatred. Would Timberlake be able to pray openly and perform on stage without risk of censorship in any of Israel's neighbours?"
His concert coincided with Jerusalem Day, marking 47 years since the capture of East Jerusalem by Israel.
Pope Francis, who was just in Israel, also visited the Western Wall, but what made headlines was his visit to a  different wall: The separation barrier in the West Bank city of Bethlehem.

<title>Boycott Israel posters featured at L.A. exhibit vandalized</title>
<date>Sat May 31 15:11:06 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
An art exhibit in Los Angeles featuring posters promoting the Palestinian boycott of Israeli goods was vandalized, the Los Angeles Times reported.
According to the curator of the exhibit, entitled "Boycott! The Art of Economic Activism," six posters were thrown in the trash and three were stolen. The exhibit, organized by the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker organization, displays a variety of replicas of posters featuring boycott movements throughout history, among them the bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama and South Africa's anti-apartheid divestment campaign.
The exhibit is partly funded by the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs and the Los Angeles County Arts Commission.
Eight out of the nine posters vandalized featured the boycott of goods made in Israel or in Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The organization is considering turning to the police, but hasn't yet.

<title>Q&A with Haaretz editor-in-chief Aluf Benn</title>
<date>Tue Jun 10 19:02:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Haaretz's editor-in-chief, Aluf Benn, answered readers' questions.
Benn was appointed editor-in-chief in 2011, before which he served in a variety of roles, including investigative reporter, head of the news division and as the paper's diplomatic correspondent.
His articles have been published in a variety of international newspapers, including The New York Times, The Guardian, Foreign Affairs and Newsweek.
In his most recent columns, Benn has written about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the defense budget, Israel's arms export business and how South Africa's apartheid regime saved Israel's defense industry. 
----------
Q: Are young Israelis today more right-wing than older generations? And if so, why?
A: It depends on the definition of "right." Does it mean supporting the annexation of the West Bank to Israel? Or deepening the discrimination of Israel's non-Jewish citizens? Or strengthening the role of religion in public life and national institutions?
The answer is mixed. Electorally, the right-wing-Haredi block barely won last year's election, and there was no discernible shift of voters from the center-left to right-wing parties. Having said that, the current government is promoting a nationalist agenda, which puts Israel's Jewish identity over and above its democracy, egalitarianism and protecting minorities.
----------
Q: How do you see the newspaper's English version different than the Hebrew edition? Who do you see as your audience abroad?
A: Different audiences have different priorities and interests. For example, our readers outside Israel are less interested in local stories than the locals, but care more about Jewish world stories than our Hebrew audience.
Our audience abroad includes readers interested in news from the Middle East and particularly about Israel, people who care about the well-being and future of Israel and want to take part in the conversation, and others who simply find our copy relevant, meaningful and exciting.
----------
Q: Who really represents American Jews: AIPAC or J Street?
A: You must ask American Jews, not a second-generation Sabra like me.
----------
Q: Is the so-called military option vis-à-vis Iran finally off the table – or is there still a chance that Bibi will attack? Dave, Toronto
A: Nothing is ever "final" in politics, but currently it appears that the attack option has been shelved in favor of a stronger nuclear deterrent.
----------
Q: Why would Haaretz publish texts such as the one by Carolina Landsmann, on June 6th? I have no issue with her criticism of Israel's policies, but what is the purpose of her prejudiced and essentialist generalizations about "the Jews" and "the Jewish people"? And was Israel really founded on the "myth of the chosen people"? I have read such claims in anti-Semitic literature, but never in serious works of history. There is indeed a world outside of Israel, but it seems Ms. Landsmann is as unaware of this as those she criticizes. Stéphane Bruchfeld
A: Carolina Landsmann criticized the Netanyahu government's PR line, which implies that merely by its Jewish character, Israel has some inherent moral superiority and its critics – particularly European governments, whose predecessors persecuted Jews – are by definition anti-Semitic. 
----------
Q: Haaretz was labeled as the enemy of state; does this mean the democracy is so weak in Israel that a newspaper of center left becomes the enemy of state? Why do you think Israel is abandoning the idea of a real democracy altogether?
A: I beg to differ here. In non-democratic countries, newspapers can't be described as "enemies of the state." Critical press simply doesn't exist there.
----------
Q: Netanyahu was once quoted as saying that Israel has two main enemies: Haaretz and The New York Times. Do you see this as a badge of honor or dishonor?
A: Neither. I see it as a political cheap shot, aimed at pleasing Netanyahu's audience – the staff of The Jerusalem Post.
----------
Q: How do you respond to charges that Haaretz English edition censors its translations to make them more palatable to foreign readers?
A: We don't "censor our translations."
----------
Q: Who did more damage to Israel: Yigal Amir or Mordechai Vanunu?
A: Amir. What damage did Vanunu cause? If anything, he gave credibility to Israel's nuclear deterrent.
----------
Q: Do you think that Israel is heading towards the one-state solution, the two-state solution or no solution? Hussein
A: Let's talk about "reality" or "formula" rather than "solution." For almost a century, since the Balfour Declaration, the models of Jewish-Arab coexistence in Palestine/Eretz Israel have tilted between a unitary state with no internal borders (the British Mandate, the 1939 White Paper, the occupation regime between 1967 and 1987) and some form of partition (the Peel Commission report, UN Resolution 181, the 1949 Armistice, Oslo and its sequels, the Gaza Disengagement and the closure/separation barrier). What we see now is a mixture of annexation and partition, which will probably go on for quite a while. The calls for annexation – in its right-wing apartheid mode, or left-wing one-person-one-vote mode are still too weak to break the status quo.
----------
Q: Taking into account demographic, environmental and technological factors, how do you see the future of Israel in 25 years, regardless of the peace process. What influences your ideas? For example did you serve in the Army, in what capacity? Did you ever shoot someone? Was someone very close to you killed in action or by terrorist? Moshe
A: The key issue facing Israel is integrating its growing Arab and Haredi minorities, especially into the workforce. It's key to sustaining economic growth and mitigate inter-tribal tensions within the country. Since both minorities are non-Zionists, it's not going to be an easy process – but it's crucial.
I served in the military in unimportant non-combat jobs, partly in Lebanon and partly in the General Headquarters in Tel Aviv. I only shot at cardboard targets, not people. My uncle Aluf Hurwitz was killed in action in Gaza, in 1955, and I'm named after him.
----------
Q: One of your predecessors said that the United States needs to 'rape' Israel to make peace with the Palestinians. Leaving aside the violence of that analogy, do you agree that the U.S. needs to be more forceful in its peacemaking efforts? Clint, NYC
A: I think that Israel, first and foremost, needs to be more forceful, sincere and committed in its peacemaking efforts. 
----------
Q: Do you shave your head or are you naturally bald? Larry D.
A: I'm about half-bald since my 20s, and shave the rest.
----------
Q: How do you feel about the election of Rivlin as Israel's next president?
A: Rivlin will have to focus his energy on strengthening Israel's democracy, standing against racism and promoting minority integration. His liberal tendencies as an MK give some hope in this regard.
----------
Q: Do Israeli citizens reflect the ideals of the Likud Knesset and Netanyahu? It appears as though Netanyahu is dragging Israel down in world opinion. Most world leaders do not respect or believe Netanyahu, sort of like "Chicken Little" the sky is falling, he's becoming tiresome. How can Israelis take pride in their leader when he appears so out of touch with reality? I realize some will say the same about us but comparing Israel to the U.S. is apples to oranges. The U.S. is a mover and shaker involved in world policies, Israel is not. Nadya
A: In the eyes of many Israelis, Netanyahu appears to be the only politician who is able to lead the country. Not because they support his ideas or policy, but mainly due to the lack of credible alternative. 
----------
Q: How do you defend the apparently racist article by Salman Masalha that your newspaper published last week?
A: Salman, one of our best writers, published a first-hand account of racial profiling at Ben-Gurion Airport – one of the worst examples of Israel's institutional discrimination against its Arab citizens. He intended to shock by turning the argument on its head and showing that racial profiling could work both ways. Apparently, however, his remark about the security official's skin color, which is acceptable in Israel, could be offensive to some American readers who have different sensitivities.
----------
Q: As editor-in-chief of Israel's oldest and arguably most respected news daily, how do you feel about the fact that the online readership for your English edition has increasingly become a committed group of hateful, anti-Zionist and anti-Semitic extremists who show no interest in true reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians?
A: What is the basis for your allegation? We don't ask the political opinions of our subscribers or occasional readers, in Hebrew or in English. 
----------
Q: Bibi always demanded unity of the Palestinians, now he refuses their reunion. What's his logic, besides delaying the process? Benjamin Cantu
A: Beyond the usual blame-game rhetoric, there is a practical issue at stake as well. Separating the West Bank from Gaza enables the Israeli right-wing one-staters to argue – like Moshe Arens – against the "demographic problem" by stating that Israel can absorb the West Bank Palestinians and still remain a Jewish-majority democracy. Including Gaza and its large Palestinian population in the equation undermines this argument. 
----------
Q: Have you ever considered leaving Israel for good?
A: No.
----------
Q: While the content of the paper has clearly grown with the wider expanse allowed on a digital platform, the publication seems to be moving further than ever to a niche of elitist left, as well as to a young hipster audience, Tel Aviv exclusive. How do you intend to broaden your readership to include the periphery, the Arab intelligentsia, the right-wing who would be well-served and eager for dialogue? Your opinion pages, especially in Hebrew, are disproportionately occupied by one-sided ideas, many of them frankly ignorant, and the magazine content is elusive to the likes of my aging generation. Where are the young settlers debating Gideon Levy? Where is the response to the feminist thought appropriately but disproportionately portrayed? A newspaper need not be partisan nor politically correct. Do you have plans to expand the dialogue so that citizens from Dimona to Nazareth to Shiloh will have their voices heard and engage with Haaretz as an intellectual and relevant publication? Respectfully yours, Joseph Lubiovsky, Jerusalem
A: We're open to anybody as a reader or writer, regardless of their address or political view. And we're definitely not politically correct.
----------
Q: I know that 'apartheid' is a very loaded word – but it's a word that appears many times on the Haaretz website. Are you personally concerned about Israel going down that path? NM, Tel Aviv
A: Yes, as it moves closer to annexing the West Bank.
----------
Q: How do you feel about the election of Rivlin as Israel's next president?
A: Rivlin will have to focus his energy on strengthening Israel's democracy, standing against racism and promoting minority integration. His liberal tendencies as MK give some hope in this regard.
----------
Q: Why on earth should I pay for Haaretz???
A: Because it's a great newspaper.
----------
Q: What criteria should be met that a comment appears in your comments section (that is, that it passes Haaretz' censorship)? I find that 90% of my comments don't make their way to being published (despite that there are no insults, no hate speech, no foul language, only arguments), while some other characters can write whatewer they like. Are some subjects or persons untouchable? May one criticize the 'contributions' of Gideon Levy or Amira Hass? May one draw the attention that 850,000 Jews were expelled from Arab countries.? May one say that the 'occupation' is legal (plus it's legitimate and moral), and 'resistance' is therefore illegal and subject to sanctions?' Or it's just a question of money, you want me to subscribe. (Which I will not).
A: There are no untouchable writers or subjects in our comment section.
----------
Q: Is there one Israeli journalist who you read religiously? Nahum, Givatayim
A: There are many journalists I read regularly – Israeli and non-Israeli.
----------
Q: Do you have any plans to launch Haaretz in any other language? I am a Francophone and I would love to read in my language. Michel, Paris
A: Ideas for a third-language Haaretz (French, Arabic, Russian, Chinese) have been considered from time to time, but currently there are no concrete plans to launch a third edition.
----------
Q: Would Israel be able to survive without American support (political and/or financial)?
A: America's political support is more important to Israel's well-being.
----------
Q: If you could turn back time, which single event in Israeli history would you change or prevent?
A: The Yom Kippur War.
----------
Q: In the age of Internet, do printed newspapers still have a role to play?
A: Sure, as long as people want to read them. New technologies don't always make the older ones obsolete. Radio coexists with TV and internet. Bicycles and trains coexist with cars.
----------
Q: Can you ever envisage a day when Israel will be part of a European Union-style federation of Middle Eastern states?
A: Yes. But it's more complicated than in Europe, even among the non-Israeli states in the region.
----------
Q: Why is Haaretz more anti-Israel in its reportage than some Arab media?
A: We are professional journalists. We don't measure our reporting on a scale of pro- or anti- Israel.
----------
Q: Do you see Avigdor Lieberman as the likely successor to Netanyahu? Could he be the next Begin or Sharon and surprise everyone by being the one to finally get Israel out of the West Bank? Josh 
A: Anything can happen, obviously, but so far there have been no indication of a Lieberman about-face. Remember that Begin and Sharon got out of the Sinai and Gaza at the backdrop of national trauma – the Yom Kippur War and the second Intifada, respectively.
----------
Q: Why is Haaretz (the printed newspaper) so much more expensive than any other Israeli newspaper? Kobi, Tel Aviv
A: Because producing quality is expensive.
----------
Q: Do you miss reporting? Barry, New Jersey
A: Occasionally :-)
----------
Q: I live in New York. I go to synagogue on the High Holidays and I fast on Yom Kippur. I feel a spiritual connection to Israel, but I have never been there. How can I play a more active role in promoting what I believe is the right way forward for the State of Israel?
A: First of all, come visit us.
----------
Q: How do you explain Israel's shift to the right over the past 15 years? Do you see Israel moving back to the center any time soon? @theyoshasit
A: The right has been in power, or has held a virtual veto over policy, for the past 34 years, with a short break during the Rabin-Peres premiership. Moreover, in the past 14 years, since the breakdown of peace talks at Camp David, the mainstream political argument has stated that there is "no partner" on the Palestinian side. 
----------
Q: Do you think a viable Palestinian nation-state is a threat to the national security of United States? Ghaleb Akari, Frisco, TX
A: No.
----------
Q: Were you a member of  a youth movement when you were young? Do you think it would be helpful for your readers to know the ideological background of your columnists - youth movement, party affiliations in the past, etc.? David, Rockville, Maryland
A: In high school I was an active member of Hanoar Haoved, which was and is affiliated with the Histadrut, Israel's labor federation. I was never a political party member.

<title>Reviving the dormant idea of peace</title>
<date>Sat Jun 07 13:19:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
In recent years, Israeli newspapers, including Haaretz and TheMarker have been holding conferences dealing with diverse topics that affect our lives, such as economics, education, the environment, health and social justice, to name a few. But what about peace, that vital component that underpins our very existence? This issue seems to have been relegated to the back burner, dismissed as a marginal topic for daydreamers.
In the course of my work as director of the Israel Peace Conference I have heard many cynical comments and disdainful questions, such as “why are you wasting your time?” or “Has Haaretz lost its mind? Who believes in peace these days?” People said that a newspaper should not be a venue for a peace conference. A newspaper can conduct a campaign for social justice. A media drive calling for more equal sharing of the national burden is quite legitimate. Promoting a pitch that supports a deal for exchanging one Israeli soldier for thousands of terrorists lies within the national consensus. But a peace conference? That is a contentious issue that only delusional left-wingers dare broach.
The concept of peace has seen better days. The words “I prefer making sacrifices for peace to the sacrifices of war,” written by then Prime Minister Menachem Begin to author Amos Oz in 1978, would today be considered treasonous by the right wing. The first Lebanon War was officially called, in Hebrew, “Operation Peace for the Galilee,” even though the reference to “peace” was manipulative and tautologic. Benjamin Netanyahu ran his election campaign in 1996 under the slogan “The Likud – making a secure peace.” In 2001 the party’s slogan was “Only Sharon can make peace.” In those days, surveys and focus groups taught campaign strategists that “peace” sells.
The fatal combination of “there is no partner” propaganda, orchestrated by Ehud Barak, the terror attacks of the second intifada that erupted after the breakdown of the Camp David summit, and Israel’s large-scale “Operation Defensive Shield” against terrorists in the West Bank, erased the word “peace” from the election campaigns of all the major parties, including Labor.
The government’s decision in 2004 to unilaterally withdraw from the Gaza Strip and northern Samaria marked the end of a decade of peace talks. This has been replaced by talk of unilateral convergence, a Palestinian state with temporary borders, an interim agreement and annexation of settlement blocs. The “peace camp” has contracted its vision and goals, from reconciliation and putting an end to the conflict, to the erection of demographic separation barriers that will prevent Israel from becoming a binational state or a de facto apartheid state.
The formula “peace in exchange for territories” has been replaced by a concept of peace being merely a prelude to war. The firing of rockets from Gaza even after Israel withdrew serves as “proof” for the right wing that this formula doesn’t work. This, despite the fact that the territories were evacuated in a unilateral move that was intended, according to Prime Minister Sharon’s adviser Dov Weisglass, to freeze the peace process.
Political leaders are convincing the public (and themselves?) that the opposite of peace is not necessarily war, but rather a deluxe occupation, with the status quo serving as the hallucinatory drug. The establishment in Israel is gradually distancing itself from peace as a value in itself. The leadership sows fear of the price of peace within people’s minds, turning the occupied territories into the most valued object. Whereas in Israel’s Declaration of Independence Israel extended a hand in peace to neighboring states and their peoples but was rebuffed, today it is the Arab League that is offering peace and neighborly relations, only to be rejected by Israel. The Arab Peace Initiative was adopted by the Arab League in 2002, and later by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. The initiative offers Israel not only peace and security, but a normalization of relations. Up to now, no Israeli government has held a single discussion of this proposal. In 2003, the Sharon government dismissed out of hand any reference to this initiative in the “Road Map,” as one of the foundations of peace negotiations.
A common cliché in Israeli media is that the Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity for achieving peace. Three years ago I had a chance to witness this lapse up close. This was the worst missed opportunity since the state was established. I was invited to Cairo along with a group called The Israeli Peace Initiative, which has been trying to mobilize support for the concept of regional peace. Our delegation, which included former head of the Shin Bet security services and current cabinet minister Jacob Perry, former cabinet minister Moshe Shahal, former Chief-of-Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, and ex-chief of the Mossad Danny Yatom, held a long meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil al-Arabi, who had just been nominated as the Secretary-General of the Arab League.
Even though the meeting was held in the midst of the Arab Spring and the Tahrir Square uprising, our host emphasized to Israeli and Arab correspondents that the Arab countries are committed to the Arab Peace Initiative. He expressed his disappointment over the blatant disregard of the Arab League’s initiative by successive Israeli governments. Israeli media outlets, which trumpeted the cries of “the people want social justice” only reported about the meeting in a muted voice, if at all. Half a million people who took to the streets in protest against the price of housing and cottage cheese remained indifferent to the exorbitant costs of abandoning peace. These are not just costs to the economy.
The renowned American journalist and broadcaster Edward Murrow (1908-1965), who fought Senator Joe McCarthy in the latter’s attempts to quash freedom of expression, said that “there is a great and perhaps decisive battle to be fought against ignorance, intolerance and indifference. This weapon of television could be useful. The problem with television,” said Murrow, “is that it is rusting in the scabbard during a struggle for survival.” He added that “this instrument can teach, it can illuminate; yes, and it can even inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that people are determined to use it to those ends. Otherwise it’s merely wires and lights in a box.”
These words are apt for all types of media in Israel. Most of their swords are rusting in their sheaths during this existential struggle, conducting a war for peace. In convening the Israel Peace Conference and in publishing this unique Peace Supplement, Haaretz is fulfilling its duty to use the tool at its disposal in order to inform people of the advantages of peace, to light up the spark in bleary eyes and even to awaken a dormant inspiration among the seekers of peace.

<title>Desmond Tutu: U.S. Christians must recognize Israel as apartheid state</title>
<date>Tue Jun 17 17:29:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Veteran anti-apartheid activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu has called on the Presbyterian Church (USA) to pass a series of resolutions condemning Israel as an apartheid state and proposing policies to boycott it.The church's biennial General Assembly, which is currently meeting in Detroit, has on its agenda eight resolutions dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Activists want the church and its institutions to use their investment dollars to punish Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians, such as by withdrawing investments from companies whose products are used by the Israeli government in the Palestinian territories.Presbyterian national assemblies have considered adopting sanctions over Israeli treatment of the Palestinians since 2004. Divestment advocates were narrowly outmaneuvered at the last Presbyterian convention in 2012, losing a crucial ballot by just two votes.This year, divestment activists enter the GA with signs of increasing momentum, within and outside the church."I am especially urging the Assembly to adopt the overture naming Israel as an apartheid state through its domestic policies and maintenance of the occupation, and the overture calling for divestment of certain companies that contribute to the occupation of the Palestinian people," Tutu wrote in an article published in Huffington Post."The sustainability of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people has always been dependent on its ability to deliver justice to the Palestinians," Tutu wrote. "I know firsthand that Israel has created an apartheid reality within its borders and through its occupation. The parallels to my own beloved South Africa are painfully stark indeed.""Realistic Israeli leaders have acknowledged that Israel will either end its occupation through a one or two state solution, or live in an apartheid state in perpetuity. The latter option is unsustainable and an offense to justice. We learned in South Africa that the only way to end apartheid peacefully was to force the powerful to the table through economic pressure."Tutu stressed that the resolutions that will be voted on the General Assembly "are not about delegitimizing the State of Israel, but about ending its suppression of 4,000,000 Palestinian sisters and brothers. It's about naming an unjust system and refusing to participate in it."
Tutu admonished "stubbornness of Israel's leaders in wanting to hold onto and settling land that is not theirs," saying it "can only lead to tragedy for both peoples. For the sake of them both as God's cherished, the strong witness of the two overtures is the only peaceful route left in the cause of justice and ultimate reconciliation. My prayers today are with the members of the General Assembly and with all the peoples of the Holy Land in Israel and Palestine."

<title>U.S. Presbyterians vote to divest from companies used by Israel in occupied territories</title>
<date>Sat Jun 21 09:34:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) on Friday became the most prominent religious group in the United States to endorse divestment as a protest against Israeli policies toward Palestinians, voting to sell church stock in three companies whose products Israel uses in the occupied territories. Union for Reform Judaism calls on Presbyterians to reverse their decision.
The General Assembly voted by a razor-thin margin — 310-303 — to sell stock in Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard and Motorola Solutions. Two years ago, the General Assembly rejected a similar divestment proposal by two votes.
The American Jewish Committee, a policy and advocacy group based in New York, said the vote was "driven by hatred of Israel." But Heath Rada, moderator for the church meeting, said immediately after the vote that "in no way is this a reflection of our lack of love for our Jewish brothers and sisters."
Alongside the call for divestment, the measure also included an endorsement of the two-state solution, a reaffirmation of the church's belief in Israel's right to exist, and language distancing the church's policies and aims from those of the global BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement. The measure instructed the church to pursue actions that would benefit the lives of both Israelis and Palestinians and work to advance peace via 'positive investment.'
The decision is expected to reverberate well beyond the church. It comes amid discouragement over failed peace talks that have left activists desperate for some way to affect change and as the broader movement known as BDS — or boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel — has gained some momentum in the U.S., Israel's closest and most important ally.
Presbyterians who advocated for divestment insisted their action was not part of the broader boycott movement. Israeli officials, along with many American Jewish groups and their supporters, have denounced the campaign as an attempt to delegitimize the Jewish state. In a separate vote, the assembly also voted to re-examine its historic support for a two-state solution.
The top Presbyterian legislative body has been considering divestment for a decade. Representatives of the Presbyterian socially responsible investment arm told the national meeting in Detroit that their efforts to lobby the three companies for change had failed. Carol Hylkema of the Israel/Palestine Mission Network, a Presbyterian group that advocates for Palestinians and spearheaded the drive for divestment, said their action was modeled on the divestment movement to end apartheid in South Africa.
The vote was the subject of intense lobbying both from within and outside the church. Rabbis and other members of Jewish Voice for Peace, which advocates for Palestinians, lined the halls of the meeting and prayed in vigils outside the convention center wearing T-shirts that read, "Another Jew Supporting Divestment." Other rabbis and their Presbyterian supporters held panel discussions and sent letters to delegates urging them to vote no.
Rabbi Rick Jacobs, head of the liberal Union for Reform Judaism, which is the largest branch of American Judaism, addressed the delegates twice, urging them to vote against divestment. He offered to arrange a meeting for the two top Presbyterian executives next week in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss church concerns, if Presbyterians rejected the divestment proposal. After the vote, Jacobs said the denomination as a whole is no longer "a partner for joint work on Israel-Palestine peace issues."
"We need to be working together on this vital issue and there cannot be a true partnership when one side endorses positions that delegitimize the other's rights and core values," Rabbi Jacobs added.
Rabbi David Sandmel, ADL Director of Interfaith Affairs, who attended the conference, said "We are greatly disappointed by the vote in favor of divesting from companies doing business with Israel, a move that is out of step with the views of the majority of Presbyterians in the pews at the community level."
In leading an effort to strike down the proposal, Frank Allen of the Central Florida Presbytery told delegates, "Divestment will not end the conflict and bring peace. Divestment will create dissension. Dialogue and relationship building will lay the groundwork for true peace."
Bill Ward of the Presbytery of the Inland Northwest, based in Spokane, Washington, argued the proposal was not an attack on Israel. The measure adopted Friday reaffirms Israel's right to exist. "It is motivated by stewardship integrity, not partisan political advocacy. It is not anti-Israel nor is it pro-Palestinian beyond the matter of human rights," Ward said.
Two smaller U.S. religious groups have divested in protest of Israeli policies: the Friends Fiduciary Corp., which manages assets for U.S. Quakers, and the Mennonite Central Committee. Last week, the pension board of the United Methodist Church, the largest mainline Protestant group in the U.S., revealed plans to sell holdings worth about $110,000 in G4S, which provides security equipment and has contracts with Israel's prison system. However, the United Methodist Church had rejected church-wide divestment.
Motorola Solutions said in a statement that the company follows the law and its own policies that address human rights. Hewlett-Packard said its checkpoints for Palestinians were developed to expedite passage "in a secure environment, enabling people to get to their place of work or to carry out their business in a faster and safer way." Caterpillar has said it does not sell equipment to Israel, just to the U.S. government.
A church spokeswoman estimated the value of the Presbyterian holdings in the companies at $21 million.

<title>Palestine's vision of peace is clear</title>
<date>Mon Jul 07 18:00:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Twenty-six years have passed since the Palestine Liberation Organization officially endorsed the two-state solution. In a painful and historic decision, Palestine recognized the State of Israel based on pre-1967 territory, conceding over 78 percent of Palestinian land. Rather than seize this opportunity for peace, the current Israeli government has chosen to use the peace process as a smoke screen for more colonization and oppression. We still wish to believe that our Israeli neighbors do not expect the Palestinian people to live under a system of apartheid. The desire of a peace- and freedom-loving nation for independence can’t be eliminated by force.
Palestine’s vision of peace is clear, and grounded firmly in principles of international law. This is because we believe that no just and lasting peace can be achieved without respecting the rights of everyone, including both Palestinians and Israelis. In accordance with these principles, the sovereignty of the states of Palestine and Israel, as bound by the 1967 international border, must be respected; and the rights of Palestinian refugees must be honored in accordance with United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194.
Negotiation serves as a powerful tool for peace, but negotiations must have a stated goal and known parameters. At least in relation to Palestine, the government of Israel does not share the same goals and parameters as the rest of the world. It is time for the world to accept that the policies of the current government of Israel are not consistent with the two-state solution. It is telling that during the last nine months of negotiations sponsored by the United States, Israel advanced housing units for 55,000 new settlers in occupied territory. Does this signify intent to achieve a just and lasting peace with Palestine? Many of our friends remind us of the wise words of late President Kennedy: “We cannot negotiate with those who say, ‘What’s mine is mine and what’s yours is negotiable.’” Negotiations will be meaningless as long as Israel continues to entrench its occupation and to change the demography of our country in order to impose new facts on the ground.
When Palestine exercised its long-overdue right to seek recognition of statehood before the United Nations, it was not in an attempt to bypass a negotiated peace. This recognition of 138 of the world’s esteemed nations opened new windows of opportunity for Palestine to assert its rights and the rights of its people, mainly through access to multilateral treaties and international organizations. The Palestinian leadership is well aware of the various treaties and organizations Palestine is able to join today.
We ask that the international community stop hiding behind calls for “resumption of talks,” without holding the Israeli government accountable to its obligations. The international community has the responsibility to protect our defenseless people living under the terror of settlers, an occupying army and a painful siege. Decisive action must be taken in order to ensure that Israeli settlers, illegally residing on and exploiting the territory and natural resources of our state, do not enjoy the same benefits as Israelis living in Israel. The attitude of the international community toward the Israeli government must be related to its respect for international law and human rights.
When the Arab League presented its generous peace plan, the Arab Peace Initiative, Israel’s response was more colonization. This offer, which still stands, offers Israel full recognition and normalization from 57 member countries of the Arab League and the Islamic Conference, in exchange for its withdrawal to the 1967 border and a just and agreed solution to the refugee issue, based on UNGA Resolution 194. Israel will never find a better offer of regional integration than the Arab Peace Initiative.
At a time when settlers continue to attack Palestinian homes, churches and mosques, when prisoners continue to be mistreated in illegal prisons, when settlements continue to expand, when more than half of our people remain in exile, and when the prospect of a negotiated two-state solution has been almost entirely eroded by the Israeli government, the brave Palestinian people continue to deliver a message of peace and justice to Israel and the rest of the world.
Despite all Israeli attempts to make our nation accept a reality of exile and apartheid under a cover of impunity, we continue our march toward freedom. Paraphrasing the late Mahmoud Darwish, “Standing here, staying here, permanent here, eternal here, and we have one goal, one, one: to be.”
As the President of the Palestinian people I am totally committed to the vision of a two-state solution, normalization and peace with our neighbor – Israel. This is the reason I have joined Pope Francis - together with President Peres - in prayer for peace. My people want peace, and we are therefore encouraged by the Haaretz conference which reflects the same wish of many Israelis who are genuinely ready for an historic compromise. Knowing that reinforces my peoples’ dedication to continue on the path of peace and reconciliation. This is the sacred obligation of Israelis and Palestinians alike to our children.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is the Chairman of the PLO.

<title>A risk management perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</title>
<date>Fri Jun 27 10:44:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
When the Titanic, the most famous luxury liner in history, set out on her maiden voyage, she was known as “the unsinkable ship.” Given this assumption, the Titanic held on its deck lifeboats with sufficient places for only half its passengers – for after all, an unsinkable ship would never need to be equipped with any more lifeboats than that. (Actually, according to this logic, it should not have needed any lifeboats at all.)
Everyone remembers the Titanic’s tragic end, but not everyone recalls the shining lesson she left the world: Her sinking gave rise, to a large extent, to the field of risk management. The Titanic set out on her voyage on the premise that “everything will be all right.” But after the Titanic, all ships set sail on the diametrically opposite assumption: “Assuming that the ship sinks, will I survive? And how?”
This is precisely the reason why every ship at sea today carries lifeboats with more seats than the number of passengers. If the ship should sink, no matter what happens, there will be no lack of space on the boats for even a single individual.
Forty-seven years after the Six-Day War and the occupation of the territories, and after millions of words have been written about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from nearly every possible point of view, there is one perspective that is entirely absent from discourse about the conflict: the risk management perspective. In other words, if worse comes to worst, will the State of Israel survive, and how?
Today, the routine discourse in the debate on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is based on opportunity management – each side markets its wares and explains why its proposal is better. Forty-seven years of this sort of discourse should have taught us that it is sterile, that it only convinces those who are already convinced and does nothing to aid Israel’s decision-making. The time has come, then, to turn the discourse into one of risk management.
Risk management is much sharper, colder and clearer than opportunity management. It obligates us to examine soberly the options placed before us, consider the extent to which they are unsatisfactory, and foresee the dangers to which they expose us. The choice among various options will of necessity be that of the least of all evils – the alternative that gives Israel the best chance of survival.
Let us consider the following options:
1. An unending continuation of the current situation. A majority of the Israeli public apparently supports this option, for the simple reason that the easiest thing to do is to avoid any change; what’s more, this option has been working wonderfully for Israel for 47 years already. But will it forever remain strong and viable?
A cold analysis shows that continuation of the existing situation is liable to lead Israel to achieve the status of an apartheid state soon. At the end of the day, it is not possible to continue ruling over millions of people by force and simultaneously profess to being a democratic state. At some stage, the enlightened world will no longer be willing to buy into this sleight-of-hand. When that happens, Israel is likely to find itself ostracized by the community of democratic nations and exposed to harsh economic, political and social sanctions. The economic and social repercussions are liable to be far-reaching, along with the impact on Israel’s democratic image.
There might also be security-related repercussions. Could Israel, which relies on the world’s support to defend itself, possibly lose that support? It is difficult to evaluate the security risk – the world is a cynical place, and even dark regimes often receive support from democratic states, simply because of special interests. However, the social, economic and democratic dangers are unquestionably great. In this context, it would be wise to recall the lesson of South Africa: Here was a wealthy and independent state that did not require the world’s support, but which nevertheless was unable to withstand global pressures against the apartheid regime. It is therefore difficult to believe that smaller and much weaker Israel could withstand such pressures (even if it wanted to expose itself to them).
2. Two states for two peoples. The Israeli left of course supports this option, and assures us of a paradise on earth. “The wolf shall dwell with the lamb” if only we agree to withdraw from the occupied territories. It’s enticing to believe this, but what will we do if the paradise becomes hell, and in place of eternal peace, we get eternal war?
This is not an unrealistic scenario, given the lesson of what occurred in Gaza after the disengagement. And in contrast to Gaza, the areas of Judea and Samaria enjoy the topographic advantages of height and proximity to all the densely populated areas of central Israel. The possibility of a “Hamastan state” in the territories, one that would exploit its topographical advantages to rain fire and missiles on Tel Aviv, cannot be dismissed out of hand. This is a possibility that Israel must take into account as it deliberates on whether to withdraw from the territories: a perpetual war with the neighboring Palestinian state, one that would involve missiles and civilian deaths in central Israel.
There is no democratic danger in this option, but the security danger is immense. The socioeconomic risk is also significant, because of the harm a perpetual war would do to Israel’s economic and social stability. There are those who warn that Israeli society would be unable to withstand a scenario of perpetual war and that Tel Aviv’s elite would flee if it were compelled to accustom itself to life under missile attacks. It is not certain that this is a significant risk; one could argue the opposite – that confidence in the righteousness of our path would restore to Israel its lost social cohesion. But the possibility must also be taken into account.
3. One state for two peoples, a binational state. The Jewish majority tends to reject this option automatically, because it means the loss of a Jewish majority and a change in the character of the State of Israel. In this instance, the danger is very much present in the debate.
Nevertheless, it should be said that this option is credible in terms of its democratic aspect . Essentially, most of the world’s nations are “states of all their citizens,” and therefore there is no fundamental reason why Israel should be different. Conversely, it should also be noted that in order for a state of all its citizens to succeed, there must be goodwill on the part of all its citizens; it is not feasible to sustain exceedingly wide gaps between the various civil groups. Along with models like Switzerland and Canada, which successfully maintain multicultural and multilingual societies, is the frightful lesson of the former Yugoslavia, which, because of extensive internal fissures, descended into a horrific civil war and in the end splintered into different nation-states. The Israeli experience, with an extensive cultural emphasis on the Jewish character of the state and the difficulty of containing even 20 percent of Arab-Israelis within it, does not bode well for our ability to unite with the Palestinians in a single state.
As far as we can see, these are the three major options the State of Israel now faces. All of them, as may be discerned, involve immense risks in a wide range of areas. Therefore, the debate cannot remain solely one of a political-security nature; it must also relate to the social and economic risks. The decision-making process, currently dominated by the security establishment, must be removed from the hands of security experts and expanded to include representatives of the economic and social worlds. All of them should together pursue the real discourse, which is so much lacking today in the debate over Israel’s future: the understanding that Israel’s situation is particularly delicate, and that all the options before it are especially bad.
Yes, the future is difficult and complex, and there is no magic solution on the horizon. It would be self-deception to think otherwise. But a responsible state must look soberly at the dangers that may threaten it, and choose the risk that is the least of all evils – which of the three options give it the better chance of survival. True, it is a depressing discourse, but it is the only possible one we have.

<title>Peace in the Mideast? I’m not interested</title>
<date>Thu Jun 26 10:34:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
It’s a well-known phenomenon: the peace camp shrinks, is pushed aside, defined as “crazy leftists selling out the state.” The process is intensified as the settlements – created as temporary outposts – are becoming the decisive factor in government and society, and dragging the majority of Israelis along with them.
Most of the public realizes that the occupation does them harm, but prefers to ignore it and declare the “leftists” the source of the trouble. As Israel becomes more diplomatically isolated, and as the lower class and unstable middle class collapse under the cost of the settlements and security, the Left and its aspirations for peace becomes less and less legitimate.
The reasons for this absurd phenomenon are also well known. Ten years ago, historian and professor Daniel Gutwein showed in his article “Class Foundations of the Occupation” (Theory and Criticism, 2004) how the interests of the upper class are served by the occupation. He also showed how the upper class, which defines itself as moderate (it tends to vote center and center-left), effectively supports the occupation (though completely denies it) in order to continue developing its most precious project – privatization.
According to Gutwein, the upper crust is accepting of the fact that billions are funneled into the settlements, as well as the ongoing Israeli rule of the territories, and thus it actuality sabotages the two-state solution it seemingly champions.
Gutwein shows how the state knowingly shirks off its responsibilities to the citizens and societies within the Green Line; wildly privatizes all social services making them inaccessible to the worn-down middle class; lets the market run wild while setting arbitrary prices for housing, food and transportation, all while privatizing the job market and allowing salaries to fall.
And as the poor get poorer, the top percentiles close themselves off in their luxury residences, enjoying the privileges they acquire for lots of money. The occupation, the settlements and the territories are even farther from them than they are from the poor. When the government sends poor people to the new cities in the West Bank, including the ultra-Orthodox, the upper class is satisfied: it all happens far away from them, and it can continue to make use of the cheap labor and enjoy the good life in the big city.
Today, after the privatization project was completed and the settlements have accumulated so much power that few, even on the Left, think it will be possible to evacuate them, Gutwein’s article is that much more relevant.
Geographical, sociological and political researches have shown the changes in the consciousness of the lower class – for example, young Shas supporters being pushed to live on the other side of the Green Line. They have become “settlerized” due to clashes with their Palestinian neighbors, and as a reaction to alienation (both political and cultural) at the hands of the media, and what they call “the Tel Avivian secular elite.”
Only a few years after Gutwein’s breakthrough, sociology professor Nissim Mizrachi revealed another aspect of this supposed contradiction. In his article “Beyond the Garden and the Jungle: On the Social Limits of the Human Rights Discourse in Israel,” he asks why the poor turn their backs on the “universalistic message of equality, justice and liberation so eagerly pressed upon them.” He subsequently explains that “the politics of universality, grasped from a liberal viewpoint as a key to social reform, is experienced by various groups in Israel’s Jewish society as a grave threat to their core identity.”
Mizrachi’s thesis includes an additional explanation for this political dissonance: the same public that rejects discourse on rights within internal conflicts – for example, the Sudanese and Eritrean asylum seekers in the south – is no less threatened by the peace discourse, as it appears to be part of that same liberal-Western set of values.
Peaceniks are perceived as “those who care more for the Arabs/gays/cats than they do for the Jews.” Such a person’s remarks sound alienated, devoid of solidarity and empathy.
Both explanations make it clear why residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods and the outlying towns refuse to adopt the values of justice and equality. It’s much more natural for them to identify with their relatives, who have gone to live on the other side of the Green Line, than with those “well-off” people in Tel Aviv – let alone anyone who is outside of the national ethos, rooted as it is in the difficult economic, social, and security situation.
This combination between status and cultural identity creates a national expression, which is fiercely nationalistic. Is the peace camp able to understand this complex reality? More importantly, can it break free of its comfortable chains, and open itself up to those who aren’t accustomed to it? It’s doubtful.
Even if the peace camp doesn’t deserve the curses and insults flung in its direction, it has rightfully earned the suspicion it receives from the geographical and social periphery, based on the reasons defined by Gutwein (preference for neoliberalism and abandoning the weak) and Mizrachi (self-definition as European-elitist, and use of the term “villa in the jungle,” which expresses disgust for both the local region and the Middle East as a whole). The Left is perhaps beginning to understand this obstacle, but it isn’t doing much to try and overcome it.
In their elegant European halls, heads of the peace camp employ dictionary definitions (apartheid, racism, war crimes) in these grave discussions, though most of them are empty terms, without influence.
And while they quibble, former Labor Party chairperson Shelly Yacimovich falsely separated claims for social justice and equality and claims for the same values in the political realm, thus granting destructive legitimacy to the “social” right (Moshe Kahlon and friends).
This difference between types of discourse – that of the upper crust (whose descendants have multiple passports and they themselves live both here in Israel and abroad), and that of the other 99 percent (stuck in this threatening, grinding reality) – is only getting more pronounced, and the “social” right wing is taking advantage of this.
The “social” right wing is managing to steer the anger away from the government and the injustices perpetrated by the “well-off” peace camp – whose economic and educational advantages make them less vulnerable from everything, including the ongoing conflict. Why do these leftists care about peace? Because they take pity only on the Palestinians, as opposed to the “social” right wingers, who are looking out for the Jews.
In order to break this mold, the peace camp must prove that it cares about the society in which it lives. It must lead the economic and social struggles it has neglected, and at the same time it must hold an equal, solidary dialogue with all groups of society. It must speak differently: it mustn’t ridiculously beg forgiveness, shouldn’t flatter or condescend, but rather it should learn respect, true sympathy, and how to listen – to listen responsibly and with humility.

<title>Mideast peace impossible without international action</title>
<date>Sun Jun 29 16:00:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The predicted “death” of the two-state solution, which has been repeated consistently for many years now, has led to a sense of complacency and a lack of urgency regarding the current situation. In the government of Israel, this does not provoke major concern, because the present coalition’s political platform is focused on consolidating colonization rather than achieving peace. This is a government that believes it can indefinitely maintain a system whereby one group of people is privileged and another oppressed.
Among the Israeli public, it is not a central concern due to the fact that Israel is not paying any price for its systematic violations of human rights and international law, allowing its people to turn a blind eye to the millions persecuted in their name. But something is clear: We are at the point of no return. Whether we achieve a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders, or enter into a long struggle for civil rights in order to defeat Israeli apartheid throughout historic Palestine, it will fall to the international community to decide.
Palestine recognized Israeli sovereignty over 78 percent of our homeland back in 1988. This painful and historic compromise was not a tactical move, but a strategic choice. We have worked tirelessly to implement, on the ground, the vision of two sovereign, democratic states living side by side in peace and security. We have made every effort to reach a just and lasting peace, from the adoption of non-violent methods to resist the Israeli occupation to diplomatic steps, within the international arena, seeking to achieve overdue Palestinian rights. Acceding to multilateral treaties also helps Palestine to shape itself as a peace-loving state that respects human rights and a responsible actor on the international stage. And yet, all such Palestinian moves have been answered with aggressive responses from Israel, resulting in an absurd situation whereby acts such as sitting at the negotiating table or signing treaties on women’s and children’s rights, are met with further settlement announcements, increased violence against Palestinians and economic sanctions on an already captive economy. 
Although some sectors within Israel understand the urgency of the situation, the lack of decisive international action has undermined those who want a negotiated two-state solution and has empowered the extremists leading the Israeli government coalition. As long as no action is taken on the economic, political and diplomatic levels, Prime Minister Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Lieberman, Housing Minister Ariel and Economy Minister Bennett will continue along the same path, which is one of apartheid and colonization rather than one of justice, peace and reconciliation.
The European Union took an important step by publishing guidelines prohibiting European funding to settlements. This is a step in the right direction, but there is much more to be done in order to tackle the Israeli settlement enterprise, the main obstacle to peace. If the international community believes in the two-state solution, simple actions such as recognizing the State of Palestine; supporting Palestine’s access to international treaties; ensuring that international companies have no contracts with, investments in, or trade with, Israeli entities that have direct or indirect links to settlements; or in the case of Europe, asking Israeli settlers to apply for visas, will go a long way toward achieving this.
The reality of the “end of the two-state solution” has been reflected in the EU Heads of Mission Report on East Jerusalem and reports on human rights and freedom of worship from the U.S. State Department. It can be read in every document produced by UN organizations and can be seen all over the occupied State of Palestine. The reality is no secret. What is required, however, is more active steps from all third party states, steps which will bring their operative policy in line with their declared policy, and most importantly, with international law.
It is time for the international community to empower those within Israel who want peace rather than colonization. It is time to stop treating Israel as a state above the law. It is time for Israel to revoke dozens of laws and hundreds of policies that discriminate against Palestinian Christians and Muslims. It is time to end the immorality of prolonging the exile and occupation of an entire nation due to the incapacity of the international community to hold Israel accountable for decades of forced displacement, occupation and colonization.
Over the years I have come to know many Israelis. My belief in the prospects of peace was boosted, most of the time, after those personal encounters. I feel that many Israelis resent the notion of forever being occupiers. However, their government continues to avoid the only logical conclusion. Time does not stand still. Israelis are approaching the point where they must make a fateful choice: Are they ready to opt for the two-state solution, or abandon it forever? I am one of those who believe a two-state solution is still possible, but I am not naïve. Without international action, the prospects for a just and lasting peace will remain elusive.

<title>Obama turned Israeli settlements into a deal breaker</title>
<date>Wed Jul 02 20:30:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Israel’s announcements regarding construction in Judea and Samaria were not the reason for the failure of the most recent talks between Israel and the Palestinians; the European and American reactions to those announcements were a much more decisive factor. Since the talks ended, U.S. officials have been feeding the media with hints and leaks blaming Israel for the failure, supposedly due to its numerous declarations of renewed construction. Examples include Secretary of State John Kerry’s unforgettable “poof” remark to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and emissary Martin Indyk’s not-so-discreet conversations in a trendy Washington, D.C. bar. Kerry and Indyk made such statements in more official settings as well, and even hinted that similar sentiments were emanating from the Oval Office. “14,000 new settlement units announced since we began negotiations,” cried the secretary of state, adding, “it’s very difficult for any leader to deal under that cloud.”
Analysts who were briefed by senior Obama administration officials explained that one could not expect Mahmoud Abbas or any other Palestinian leadership to negotiate while Israel was building in areas that were designated to be part of a future Palestinian state. Even if we ignore the fact that the U.S. knew ahead of time that there would be announcements of settlement construction during the negotiations – as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told journalist Jeffrey Goldberg – and that the number of housing units mentioned by Kerry and Indyk were grossly exaggerated – even if we completely ignore these decisive facts, the American accusations against Israel are baseless.
That, and more: The great majority of those declarations – at least 80 percent – pertained to construction in Jerusalem, or what have been called “settlement blocs” that would remain in Israeli hands, even if the negotiations were to bear fruit.
But all of this is inconsequential in light of the fact that not a single one of the “announced” housing units was going to be constructed during the negotiations. Ground would not have been broken on the lands included in the announcements for at least two years, if at all. In the past, many such land tenders remained on paper, and were not transformed into completed structures, for various reasons, economic or otherwise.
The second kind of declaration – advancing planning processes – were even less relevant to the negotiations. In some cases this meant retroactive permits for already-constructed homes, and in most cases it meant planning the earliest stages among the seven planning phases (some call them the “seven circles of hell”) required to build in Judea and Samaria. Each one of the seven stages requires, incomprehensibly, a permit from the government. Therefore, when “planning permits” are granted, we’re still many long years away from actual construction, and the process can be stopped at any time by the Israeli government.
Therefore, all of these declarations pointed to by Kerry and Indyk had absolutely no bearing on the results of the negotiations, or the feasibility of implementing those results, if they were achieved. The only potentially negative effect was a psychological one, or to use the same term as Kerry himself – the creation of that cloud. But that cloud was created by the American government, which now finds itself damning its creation and cursing its mistakes.
Before Barack Obama entered the White House in January 2009, construction in Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem was never a reason for crisis. In effect, building in Ramot, Gilo, French Hill or Pisgat Ze’ev never even made headlines. True, there was one case regarding Har Homa during the Clinton era, but that was the exception that proves the rule. That case was a completely new neighborhood, built on the far outskirts of Jerusalem, after the Oslo agreements.
President Obama changed U.S. policy regarding construction in Jerusalem. The Obama Administration’s words transformed Gilo into a settlement; planning in Ramat Shlomo became a personal affront to Vice President Biden. In one fell swoop, a single foolish American decision turned construction in Jerusalem’s Jewish neighborhoods – which completely lack political significance – into a reason for crisis. Thus, the American government planted the first seeds of the “cloud” that it now speaks of. “One cannot issue an edict by which the public cannot abide,” goes one wise Jewish maxim. The Obama administration ignored the impracticality of ceasing Jewish construction in the capital, and thus made a terrible strategic mistake.
But the American government’s mistakes did not stop there. Kerry had the ability to turn Israel’s declarations into an obstacle or a catalyst for the negotiations. Unfortunately, he chose the former. During the months-long talks, the U.S. secretary of state became an expert at threatening Israel over what could happen should it fail to be flexible in negotiating. On Israel’s Channel 2, he threatened a third intifada; in Munich, he hinted at boycotts; and in Washington, he played the trump card and mentioned apartheid. No one suspects that Kerry actually wants to see one of those options become reality, but he knows how to use them effectively to “shake Israel up.”
Why were these tactics – which the U.S. government considers effective in influencing Israel – not employed on Mahmoud Abbas? In contrast to Netanyahu, Abbas did not budge even an inch from the positions he held at the start of the talks. If one of the sides required hastening and “shaking up,” it was the Palestinians. Kerry and Indyk could have gone to Abbas, secretly or openly, and told him clearly: If you aren’t flexible, if you keep dragging your feet, you’ll find many more Israelis in Judea and Samaria in a few years. Yasser Arafat himself admitted in the past that one of his motivations for signing Oslo was his fear of the settlers’ rising numbers. Instead, the U.S. chose to admonish and chastise Israel, thus finding itself, along with the Palestinians, in the same cloud it spread over the talks.
Opposition to Jewish construction in Judea and Samaria has become an article of faith, a dogma, and no longer requires any rational proof. The time has come to bring the issue back to its proper proportion.
Dani Dayan is the former chairman of the Yesha Council of Jewish Communities in Judea and Samaria (2007-2013) and presently its chief foreign envoy.

<title>The undisputed truth about Israeli occupation</title>
<date>Mon Jul 07 14:20:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Imagine for a moment a man who picks someone’s safe and loots a hoard of money. The victim, tracking the man down, demands the money back. But the fellow refuses to recognize the cash as someone else’s property; it is “disputed.” The wronged party finally brings in a mediator, but, adopting the man’s logic about the money being “disputed” and not stolen, the mediator tells the victim to work out his disagreement directly with the man. And so the lucky man continues spending, the mediator continues mediating, and the victim remains a victim, poorer by the day.  
I often think of this analogy when, sitting in my home up on Mount Gerizim above Nablus, I stare out a window at the rapidly expanding colony of Har Bracha.
Since 1967, the Palestinians have lost control of their land, hilltop by hilltop, field by field, and none of the mediators sent our way has managed to stop or even to slow the ever-quickening pace of dispossession. Often the mediator has provided diplomatic cover for this.
This is all the more disturbing because the basic contours of a two-state solution have been well known and accepted by the Palestinian leadership for over 30 years. In 1981, the Palestine Liberation Organization was, like most other national liberation movements, seeking the total defeat of the enemy. Article 1 of the PLO Charter, drafted in 1964 by nationalist delegates at the Intercontinental Hotel on Jerusalem’s Mount of Olives, spelled it out: “Palestine is an Arab homeland bound by strong Arab national ties to the rest of the Arab countries and which together form the great Arab homeland.” By “Palestine,” of course, the delegates meant the entire territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean.
I was one of the delegates that day. Because I assumed that was the way the conflict should end, I was surprised when I got a phone call in my London office in 1981. Saudi Crown Prince Fahd was on the line. “Yes, your Royal Highness.” The prince sounded like he was on a treadmill, he was so out of breath. Once he calmed down he told me he had a “plan” to bring peace to the Holy Land. He had already discussed the plan with Yasser Arafat.
What I heard that afternoon was unfathomable: The Saudis were willing to offer the Israelis peace with the Arabs once they cleared out of the occupied territories, dismantled the settlements, solved the refugee issue, and agreed to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. And then “all states in the region should be able to live in peace.”
Even more surprising to me was Arafat’s reaction: He accepted what came to be known as the Fez Initiative. Arafat made it even clearer in 1988 that he was willing to accept the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, 22 percent of historic Palestine, as our future Palestinian state. Needless to say, this was a painful decision for him to take.
This was the logic behind his embrace of the Oslo Accords in 1993, and the reason he signed off on the Arab Peace Initiative in 2002, which, like the Fez Initiative, offers Israel full recognition and normal relations with the Arabs in the context of comprehensive peace. Today, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas mentions the API on a daily basis.
The Israeli government never responded to either the Fez Initiative or the API. In 2013, Israelis built more settlements than ever before, and this spring the peace talks launched and guided by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry foundered because of the relentless drive to build more and more homes in Palestine. 
How is it possible that while my friend and hero Yasser Arafat, and indeed much of the Arab and Muslim world, long ago accepted the basic framework of a two-state solution, the occupation is far more entrenched today than when the Oslo Accords were signed some 20 years ago on the White House lawn? 
A main cause of the failure of so many well-intentioned peace initiatives, including the latest round of talks, is the very reason the man in my story never got his money back: The “honest brokers” all too often agree with our occupiers that the destructive spread of settlements is on “disputed,” not occupied, land; and that we and the Israelis must “work out” our differences across a table. With the negotiation rules thus rigged, justice will forever remain elusive. 
No conflict in modern history has decimated as many forests for newsprint, books and doctoral dissertations as ours. But scant attention has been paid to this linguistic sleight of hand that turns a military occupation into a quarrel over “disputed” land. When the Republican Governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, recently dared to utter the words “occupied territories” in a speech, he was so pilloried by incensed supporters of Israel that he had to apologize.
There will be no peace so long as this fundamental truth is not told – that since 1967 we Palestinians have been occupied by the Israel Defense Forces, controlled by Israeli government planners and watched over by the Shin Bet security service. We do not need an “honest broker” refereeing our “dispute.” We need an honest judge to deliver justice. 
One option for Palestinians, of course, is to turn to the United Nations. The Security Council, which created Israel in 1947, has condemned settlement activity 15 times over the years. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court can also be used to compel Israel into obeying international law. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, tearing a page from the anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s, can simultaneously call for boycotts against the Israeli economy and culture.  
These are all likely courses if we cannot find a positive and just formula between the parties. 
Crown Prince Fahd was visionary by recognizing in 1981 that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must be solved in a multinational, win-win manner. In the spirit of the Fez Initiative and the API, the world community should make it clear what the end game must look like: two states based on the 1967 borders, two capitals in Jerusalem, and a just and mutually agreed-upon solution to the refugee problem in accordance with UN Resolution 194. In exchange, both now and in the future, Israel will enjoy full peace and security with its neighbors and 57 Arab and Islamic countries. The bonus to Israel is beyond imagination.
Once our two governments return to the negotiation table and conclude a peace agreement, we want to live in harmony with the Israelis. Even more so, we want Israelis to contribute to our nation-building through their know-how in science, IT, entrepreneurship, health care and the humanities.
This is what the future can hold if wise men once again return to the Holy Land.

<title>On hope and despair in the Middle East</title>
<date>Tue Jul 08 19:30:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Hope and despair. For years, we were tossed back and forth between one and the other. Today, most Israelis and Palestinians seem to be in a gloomy, flat, state of mind, one with no horizon; dully comatose, a self-induced numbness.
Today, in an Israel that has known so much disappointment, hope (if ever mentioned at all) is always hesitant, a bit timid, and apologetic. Despair, on the other hand, is utterly confident and self-assured, as if speaking on behalf of a law of nature, an axiom that states that between these two peoples there shall never be peace, that the war between them is a heavenly decree, and that altogether, it will always be bad here, nothing but bad. As despair sees it, anyone who still hopes, who still believes in the possibility of peace, is at best naïve, or a deluded dreamer, and at worst, a traitor who weakens Israel’s wherewithal by encouraging it to be seduced by false visions.
In this sense, the Israeli right has won. The right, which adheres to this worldview – certainly over the last decades – has managed to instill it in a majority of Israelis. One could say that the right has not only vanquished the left: It has vanquished Israel. And not just because this pessimistic worldview is pushing Israel into paralysis in the area most fateful to its survival, the area where boldness and flexibility and creativity are required; the right has vanquished Israel by crushing what once could have been called “the Israeli spirit”: that spark, the ability to remake ourselves, that “nevertheless” spirit, and courage. And hope.
In the area most critical to its survival, today’s Israel is practically immobile, one might even say incompetent. Strangely enough this state of mind, is not causing overt anguish: Not only its leaders, but most of its citizens are able to keep the situation out of their minds. They excel in the ability to completely separate the two, and to keep doing so for many years, 47 years of occupation, and even do fairly well, while at the center of their being, there is essentially a void. A void of actions, a void of consciousness, a void in which an efficient suspension of moral judgment prevails, a failure to notice the injustice at the root of the entire situation.
The American writer David Foster Wallace once told a story about two young fish who are happily swimming along in the sea when they come upon an older fish. “Hello there, fellows,” the old fish says to them. “How are things?”
“Great!” say the two fish.
“How’s the water?” he asks them.
“The water’s great!” the young fish answer. Then they bid the old fish goodbye and keep on swimming. A few minutes later, one of them turns to the other and asks – “Hey, what’s water?”
Listen to the water. To the water we’ve been swimming in and drinking for the last 47 years. To which we’ve become so accustomed that we no longer feel it. This water is the life that flows here, and it is, unquestionably, still brimming with vitality and creativity, but it has also become somewhat crazed, with a chaotic, clearance-sale feeling to it – a feeling of interwoven mania and depression; a feeling of tremendous strength that sometimes plummets into colossal weakness; of living in a selfÎsatisfied democracy, with pretensions to liberalism and humanism, that occupies and humiliates and crushes another people for decades on end. A life lived amid a deafening media clamor, much of which is deliberately intended to distract and dull the senses – for how would it be possible to face this without a little distraction and self-medication? How else would it be possible to face, say, the results of the so-called “settlement project”? To face up to the full meaning of this crazy gamble on the country’s future? Listen to the water. Below the turbid waters we’ve been treading for the past 47 years runs a deep and cold current, a current of dread over a huge mistake, a monumental wrong turn and loss of way. The current is taking ever-stronger shape before our eyes in the form of a binational state, or an apartheid state, or a state of all its soldiers, or a state of all its rabbis, all its settlers, all its messiahs.
And maybe, just maybe, the despair that has ruled us in recent years is also partly the despair of the doomed, who understand by now that there is no way to avoid punishment for their deeds, or for what they allowed to happen through their support, or their silence, or their apathy, so therefore – Why not eat, drink and make merry while one still can?
This Israeli despair also contains a peculiar element of eagerness for disaster, or at least for disappointment: a certain gloating directed at anyone whose hopes were dashed. This is a particularly twisted form of joy, for ultimately, we’re rejoicing in our own misfortune. Sometimes it seems that Israeli hearts and minds are still smarting at the insult of having dared to believe back in 1993, when the Oslo Accords were signed, not just in an enemy who suddenly became a partner – but in the very possibility that things would be good, that it could ever be good here.
As if having been tempted to believe – say the people of the despair faction – in something that runs so counter to our life experience, to our tragic history, we somehow betrayed ourselves, betrayed some trademark of our destiny, and for this belief we have paid dearly, and shall go on paying, many times over. But at least from now on you’ll never catch us believing in anything, in any promise, in any chance.
Even if Mahmoud Abbas fights with all he has to prevent terror against Israelis, and declares that he knows he will only ever return to Safed, his birthplace, as a tourist; and even if he declares that the Holocaust is the gravest crime in human history – even if he does all of that, Prime Minister Netanyahu will hasten to pour a bucket of cold water on his head.
And even if the countries of the Arab League present Israel with an initiative that could kick-start some type of peace process, that contains an explicit invitation to a new kind of dialogue we’ve never seen before, for which we’ve yearned for years – the Israeli government will totally and demonstratively ignore it for 12 years and counting. Because no one is going to trick us again. We’re not suckers. Never again will we be caught believing a Palestinian, or any Arab for that matter. Or, say, a, tall, silver-haired American secretary of state who doesn’t get what life is really made of. Or in the hope that we could ever have a better life. Or just life.
It’s interesting: We only seriously tried the path of peace with the Palestinians once, in 1993. It failed, and from that moment on, it’s as if Israel decided to seal off that option once and for all. Here, too, see the twisted logic of despair at work: We’ve tried the path of war, occupation, terror and hatred dozens of times, never wearying of it or giving up on it, so why the rush to permanently divorce ourselves from peace, of all things, after a single failure?
Israel has, of course, many reasons to fear and to worry. The Middle East is in turmoil, fanatic and fundamentalist currents toss and turn it, and most of it is still hostile toward Israel and openly wishes for its destruction. But precisely against those dangers and threats, the policy of despair and dejection does not seem to be the right path to follow.
The government of Israel, the governments of Israel, act like prisoners of despair. Like its helpless victims. I do not remember ever hearing any serious statement about hope from Benjamin Netanyahu, or from any of his ministers and advisers. Not even one word of a vision of the possibilities a life of peace could offer, or about the chance that Israel could become part of a new fabric of alliances and interests in the Middle East. How did even the word itself, “hope”, become a dirty, incriminating word, second only to the word “peace” in its dangerous levels of radiation?
It’s maddening to think that the tremendous military power Israel has amassed is not giving it the courage to overcome its fears and existential despair and take a decisive step that will bring peace. The great idea of the founding of the State of Israel is that the Jewish people has returned home, and that here, we will never be victims again. Never shall we be paralyzed and submissive in the face of forces mightier than us.
Look at us: The strongest nation in the region, a regional superpower that enjoys the support of the United States on an almost inconceivable scale, along with the sympathy and commitment of Germany, England and France – and still, deep inside, it sees itself as a helpless victim. And still it behaves like a victim – of its anxieties, its real and imagined fears, its tragic history, of the mistakes of its neighbors and enemies.
This worldview is pushing the Jewish public of Israel to our most vulnerable and wounded places as a people. The very essence of “Israeliness,” which always had a forward-looking gaze and held constant ferment and constant promise, has been steadily dwindling in recent years, and is being absorbed back into the channels of trauma and pain of Jewish history and memory.
You can feel it now, in 2014, within very many of us “new” Israelis, an anxiety over the fate of the Jewish people, that sense of persecution, of victimhood, of feeling the existential foreignness of the Jews among all the other nations.
What hope can there be when such is the terrible state of things? The hope of nevertheless. A hope that does not disregard the many dangers and obstacles, but refuses to see only them and nothing else.
A hope that if the flames beneath the conflict die down, the healthy and sane features of the two peoples can gradually be revealed once more. The healing power of the everyday, of the wisdom of life and the wisdom of compromise, will begin to take effect. The sense of existential security. Of being able to raise children without abject fear, without the humiliation of occupation or the dread of terrorism. The basic human desires for family and livelihood and study. The fabric of life.
Among the two peoples today, the agents of despair and hatred have practically taken over, so it may be hard to believe that the picture I’ve described is truly possible. But a situation of peace will start to produce the agents of hope and closeness and optimism; it will give rise to more people who have a practical interest, unrelated to ideology, in creating more and more ties with members of the other people. Perhaps eventually, after some years, a deeper attachment will evolve, even genuine friendship between these two peoples, and those human beings. Such things have happened. But for now let us suffice with all those mundane situations in which Israelis and Palestinians could live with one another like human beings.
We, the people who have gathered at this Israel Conference on Peace cling to this hope, and preserve it in our heart. We cannot afford the luxury and indulgence of despair. The situation is too desperate to be left to the despairing, for accepting despair amounts to an admission that we’ve been defeated. Defeated not on the battlefield, but as human beings. Something deep and vital to us as humans was taken away, was stolen from us, the moment we agreed to let despair to have a dominion.
He whose policy is essentially a thinly veiled, profound despair is placing Israel in mortal danger. He who behaves thus cannot pretend to speak about being “a free people in our land.” He may sing “Hatikva,” “The Hope,” our national anthem but in his voice we hear: Our despair is not yet lost, the despair of two thousand years.
We who have gathered here today, and many others who are with us in spirit, insist upon hope. A hope that is not wide-eyed, a hope that won’t give up. A hope that gives us – Israelis and Palestinians both – our only chance to resist the gravitational pull of despair.

<title>Despite it all, most Israelis still support the two-state solution</title>
<date>Mon Jul 07 14:32:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The majority of Israelis continue to view the two-state solution as preferable for the long-term, provided the prime minister is behind the proposal. However, most Israelis don’t believe the prime minister when he says he intends to advance that solution. Almost a quarter of Israelis say that a binational solution in which the Palestinians will lack full rights – in short, an apartheid state – is preferable. And, according to another finding of a special survey conducted for Haaretz’s Israel Conference on Peace, 40 percent of Israelis have never visited a settlement in the territories.
The survey was conducted by the Dialog Institute, under the supervision of Prof. Camil Fuchs of Tel Aviv University. The sample of 504 respondents was weighted according to population groups, gender, age and voting in the last Knesset election. The survey was conducted June 9-11 (with a 4.4 percent margin of error).
Sixty percent of those asked responded affirmatively to the question, “If the prime minister reaches an agreement, whereby a Palestinian state will be established alongside Israel, would you support or not support that agreement?” Only 32 percent said they wouldn’t support such an agreement, while 7 percent said they didn’t know. This result indicates a backtracking in the Israeli public’s acceptance of a two-state solution.
In December 2012, two other polling firms conducted identical surveys, commissioned by the S. Daniel Abraham Center for International and Regional Studies at Tel Aviv University. Both polls asked a similar question concerning a peace agreement that would result in the country’s partition. At that time – just 18 months ago – 67 and 68 percent, respectively, of the respondents said they would support such an agreement.
Two additional reservations also arise from the latest Haaretz survey. The first is that the Israeli public is seemingly unfamiliar with the geopolitical situation. When the implications of partition and the specifics of an agreement were presented to the respondents – “The establishment of a Palestinian state within the 1967 boundaries with border modifications, most of the settlements to be annexed to Israel, Jerusalem to be divided and no return of refugees” – support for the two-state solution plummeted to 35 percent, with 58 percent replying in the negative. This time, the term “prime minister” was omitted as the individual who backs the agreement. The implication of this is that great responsibility falls on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as large segments of the public view his acceptance of an agreement involving partition as a precondition for their support.
The second, equally important, reservation is that the same public that says it will support a partition agreement if it’s supported by the prime minister doesn’t actually believe the prime minister’s stated intention to arrive at any such agreement. Thus, 54 percent replied in the negative and only 37 percent in the affirmative to the question, “Do you believe Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he says he wants to promote a peace agreement with two states for two nations?”
Another question examined what the public thinks the government should do, following the recent collapse of the peace talks and the establishment of a Palestinian unity government. (The survey was conducted a week before the kidnapping of three Yeshiva students in the West Bank.) Of the various options suggested – unilateral annexation of territories; a boycott of the Palestinians; make an effort to resume the negotiations; unilateral withdrawal from the territories; a freeze on settlement construction; or do nothing – only one gained a majority: Make an effort to return to the negotiating table. Sixty percent of those asked replied that they “agree” or “agree strongly” with this option.
The unilateral actions didn’t receive majority backing: Fifty-six percent object to a unilateral annexation of territories by Israel, compared to 37 percent who agree to this; 70 percent object to a unilateral withdrawal by Israel, compared to 25 percent who agree.
In the question that presented possible long-term solutions, partition of the country was the most popular, preferred by 28 percent of those polled. At the same time, two other possibilities were not far behind: “Continuation of the present situation” is favored by 25 percent; and an apartheid state model – “one state, in which the Palestinians will have limited rights,” as the question phrased it – is preferred by 23 percent of Israelis. Only 10 percent said they would opt for a state in which all citizens will have equal rights.
Overall, it would seem that the Israeli public is more apprehensive about granting equal rights to the Palestinians than about returning territories. Fifty-six percent said they are against granting the Palestinians full rights in the event of annexation.
Haaretz also wanted to discover which scenario the public finds most frightening: a binational (single) state, a boycott or a wave of violence. Though it’s difficult to point to a definitive result, it would appear that the most palpable threats are perceived as a binational state and a wave of violence: 50 and 51 percent (respectively) said they fear those scenarios to a large or very large degree. In contrast, 34 percent said they are afraid of an international boycott on Israel (while 62 percent said they aren’t afraid).
Israelis continue to be cool toward the settlement project. No fewer than 40 percent said they have never visited a settlement. Another 25 percent said they hadn’t visited a settlement in the past year. Conversely, 42 percent of Israelis say they have never met a Palestinian. Forty percent replied that the settlements are receiving resources that are “larger” or “significantly larger” than what Israel’s outlying towns receive; only 16 percent believe the settlements receive fewer resources than the outlying towns.
The question of what would be preferable – a peace agreement that would require the evacuation of settlements, or continuation of the settlements without an agreement – drew almost identical responses: 45 percent are in favor of an agreement and settlement evacuation; 43 percent are in favor of the current status quo with the settlements.
If the government reaches an agreement that obliges it to evacuate the settlements, only 12 percent think the evacuation will go smoothly; 57 percent that the evacuation will involve a major effort and lead to casualties; and 23 percent of the public believes the government will not succeed in evacuating settlements.

<title>Israel boycott could harm Palestinian cause, says Noam Chomsky</title>
<date>Thu Jul 03 12:43:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The campaign calling to boycott Israel in an effort to change its policies toward the Palestinians risks backfiring because of limited support, leading American academic and political activist Noam Chomsky has said.
In an article posted in the Nation on Wednesday, Chomsky targets the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. He says that while there is international support for two of the movement's main goals – ending the occupation of territories captured in the 1967 war and granting equal rights to Arab citizens of Israel, there is no significant support for its third objective – allowing Palestinian refugees to return to their homes in Israel.
Insisting on the right of return for Palestinian 1948 refugees, he writes, "is a virtual guarantee of failure."
Calling to boycott Israeli academic institutions is also undesirable, he says, since it opens the door for "glass house" principle: "if we boycott Tel Aviv University because Israel violates human rights at home, then why not boycott Harvard because of far greater violations by the United States?" he asks.
Chomsky says that efforts should be directed at initiatives that are likely to succeed. "Failed initiatives harm the victims doubly — by shifting attention from their plight to irrelevant issues… and by wasting current opportunities to do something meaningful."
He also questions with the analogy between apartheid South Africa and Israel, which is commonly used by the boycott movement. Chomsky writes that while discrimination within Israel does exist, it still doesn’t constitute as "South African-style apartheid." As for the occupied territories, "the situation is far worse that it was in South Africa," he says.
In South Africa, "the white nationalists needed the black population: it was the country’s workforce, and as grotesque as the bantustans were, the nationalist government devoted resources to sustaining and seeking international recognition for them. In sharp contrast, Israel wants to rid itself of the Palestinian burden," he explains his stance. "The road ahead is not toward South Africa, as commonly alleged, but toward something much worse."
"While there is, finally, a growing domestic opposition in the United States to Israeli crimes, it does not remotely compare with the South African case," he writes. "The necessary educational work has not been done. Spokespeople for the BDS movement may believe they have attained their 'South African moment,' but that is far from accurate. And if tactics are to be effective, they must be based on a realistic assessment of actual circumstances."
Chomsky throws his support behind efforts to boycott Israeli settlement products, noting not only the recent resolution by the Presbyterian church to divest from U.S.-based multinationals that are linked to the occupation, and more importantly the guidelines, as declared by the Europe Union, saying that the settlements are illegal under international law.
In conclusion, Chomsky urges those who are "sincerely dedicated to the Palestinian cause" to "avoid illusion and myth, and think carefully about the tactics they choose and the course they follow."

<title>U.S. rapper Talib Kweli backs out of Israel show</title>
<date>Fri Jul 04 10:52:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
American rapper Talib Kweli Greene has canceled his planned participation in an Israeli music festival, the artist announced on his Twitter feed, but remains interested in visiting the region and meeting with both Israelis and Palestinians fighting against the occupation.
"As much as I want to play Israel, I have decided not to in solidarity with Palestinians who will not have access to my show…," the 38-year-old rapper from Brooklyn tweeted on Tuesday.
Two minutes later, however, he qualified his previous statement. "After days of discussions with many, I've decided to try & visit Israel & Palestine with those who fight to end the state of apartheid… rather than use my art to force the issue on those who would rather not deal with it…," the artist wrote.
Greene, who goes by the stage name Talib Kweli, was supposed to perform at Hadera's Boom Box festival August, alongside Wyclef Jean and J. Views, Femi Kuti and others. Kweli is known as a rapper with a political conscience.
The announcement followed pressure from BDS tweeters to fall in line with a total boycott of Israel that built up on Monday, though some suggested alternative ideas such as giving "free shows in Palestine" or meeting with African refugees.Some followers said they hate the occupation and wish Kweli would not boycott and others supporting his decision because of the occupation. A few followers demanded more consistency from the artist, asking him if he would boycott Russia in solidarity with Ukraine, boycott Uganda because of its anti-gay hatred or condemn Islamic terror.

<title>U.K. MP Galloway probed for declaring Bradford an 'Israel-free zone'</title>
<date>Thu Aug 07 22:06:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
British Parliament Member George Galloway is under investigation for declaring Bradford "an Israel-free zone."
The BBC cited West Yorkshire police officers as saying that two complaints have been lodged about a speech Galloway made on August 2 urging the city to reject all Israeli goods, services, academics and even tourists.
“We don’t want any Israeli goods. We don’t want any Israeli services. We don’t want any Israeli academics, coming to the university or the college," Galloway said at a meeting of the far-left Respect Party in Leeds.
“We don’t even want any Israeli tourists to come to Bradford, if any of them had thought of doing so.
“We reject this illegal, barbarous, savage state that calls itself Israel. And you have to do the same.”
According to the BBC, a spokesman for Galloway, Ron McKay, said the Bradford West MP stood by his remarks.
"George stands by the comments," McKay was quoted as saying. "He thinks they are quite reasonable.
"The reason he made them is because there's mass carnage and mass slaughter going on against the people of Gaza," he continued. "Direct action helped in the struggle against apartheid."
Conservative MP Robert Halfon, a former political director of the Conservative Friends of Israel, has dismissed Galloway's remarks as an "ill-considered rant that will cause great offence to many."
David Ward, Lib Dem MP for neighboring Bradford East, meanwhile, said that any boycott of Israel should extend beyond the city into a nationwide movement.
"Why restrict it to a particular town? If you are going to do boycotts, divestments and sanctions simply for a particular city or part of the country, how is that going to do any good?
"What's the point of that? It has to be a national movement," Ward was quoted saying by the BBC.
Galloway, a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause, in 2009 said "the Palestinian people in Gaza are the new Warsaw Ghetto, and those who are murdering them are the equivalent of those who murdered the Jews in Warsaw in 1943."

<title>OIC lobbying Palestinians to join International Criminal Court</title>
<date>Sun Sep 28 17:44:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The world's largest bloc of Islamic countries has been lobbying the Palestinians to join the International Criminal Court so it can prosecute Israeli politicians and military leaders for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, the bloc's leader said Saturday.
Iyad Madani said the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation strongly supports Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' plan to ask the UN Security Council to impose a deadline for an Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian lands.
In a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press, Madani also described the Islamic State extremist group which has captured a wide swath of Syria and Iraq as "criminal" and said he supports its destruction.
The Palestinians, under pressure from the United States and Israel, have been reluctant to become a party to the Rome Treaty that established the ICC. Abbas had been expected to sign up to the treaty during the recent 50-day Gaza war that killed more than 2,100 Palestinians and 73 Israelis. But he postponed an announcement, saying the Palestinians want to pursue action in the Security Council first.
"As OIC, we're lobbying him to join the Rome Treaty and open the door as a member of the ICC court to bring up charges against the individual politicians and military people in Israel who are responsible for all those atrocities, the latest of which is Gaza," Madani said.
ICC membership could work both ways. Palestinians – particularly Hamas officials who approved rocket attacks on Israeli civilians – could also be implicated for war crimes. Observers suggest this is one reason holding the Palestinian Authority back from joining the Rome Statute at this stage.
Madani said the OIC agrees with Abbas' statement to the UN General Assembly's ministerial meeting on Friday that war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide were committed in Gaza.
Madani accused Israel of "dehumanizing" treatment of the Palestinians for decades, "and we think there is a strong case to classify this current government of Israel as an apartheid state that should be dealt with internationally as an apartheid state."
But the OIC secretary general said the quest for peace can't be forgotten in the discussion of "how we can penalize each other."
The thrust now should be "to bring the Israelis to the peace camp" with the United States, Israel's most important ally, as a "moderator," not a party to the conflict, he said.
"I think you have to choose," Madani said. "You are either a moderator or a party to a conflict," he said.
Madani called for a revival of the stagnant Quartet of Mideast mediators — the United States, United Nations, European Union and Russia — with new leadership. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has been the official envoy of the Quartet since June 2007.
On the issue of terrorism, Madani said he fully supports U.S. airstrikes in Syria and Iraq targeting the Islamic State group, also known by its acronyms ISIS and ISIL, but only if they are part of a wider effort to dismantle the group's presence and deal with the causes that created and bred extremism in the region.
"Drones and airstrikes will not do the job alone," he said.
He also derided extremist groups like the Islamic State and Boko Haram in Nigeria who claim to represent true Islam.
"This is madness. These people cannot be voices of Islam, they don't understand Islam, and just claiming the caliphate is simply a way of creating false legitimacy of their purpose," he said.
The Islamic State group, an Al-Qaida breakaway group, has exploited the chaos resulting from Syria's civil war to carry out a blitz in which it swallowed up roughly a third of Iraq and Syria. It has brutalized the local population and imposed its strict interpretation of Islamic law in areas under its control.
Madani, however, criticized the United States for dismantling state institutions in Iraq after invading it in 2003 and adopting a policy that "emphasized sectarian differences" among Iraqis. He also blamed the international community's failure to face up to the crisis in Syria and put an end to the Palestinian suffering.
While he said it was "impossible" for Syrian President Bashar Assad to remain in power, he said the state in Syria should be maintained.

<title>Mahmoud Abbas’s address to the UN General Assembly</title>
<date>Mon Sep 29 01:28:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
In this year, proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly as the International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, Israel has chosen to make it a year of a new war of genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian people.
In this year, in which this Assembly, on behalf of the countries and peoples of the world, conveyed the world’s yearning and determination to realize a just peace that achieves freedom and independence for the Palestinian people in their State of Palestine alongside Israel in order to rectify the historic injustice inflicted on the Palestinian people in Al-Nakba of 1948, the occupying Power has chosen to defy the entire world by launching its war on Gaza, by which its jets and tanks brutally assassinated lives and devastated the homes, schools and dreams of thousands of Palestinian children, women and men and in reality destroying the remaining hopes for peace.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I have addressed you in this hall during similar days in 2012 and cautioned that the colonial occupying Power was preparing for a new Nakba against the Palestinian people, and I appealed to you: Prevent a new Nakba. Support the establishment of a free and independent State of Palestine now.
I returned to this same hall two months later as Palestine was healing her wounds and her people were burying beloved martyred children, women and men after yet another war waged then against the Gaza Strip, and that day I stated: certainly there was not a single person in the world needing the loss of the lives of tens of Palestinian children in order to confirm that Israel insists on occupation; and there was also no need for thousands of deadly raids and tons of explosives to remind the world that there is an occupation that must end and that there is a people that must be freed.
I also said at that time: there was no need for a new devastating war in order to realize the absence of peace.
And, here we are again today.
Here we find ourselves, full of grief, regret and bitterness, raising the same long-standing conclusions and questions after a new war, the third war waged by the racist occupying State in five years against Gaza, this small, densely-populated and precious part of our country.
The difference today is that the scale of this genocidal crime is larger, and that the list of martyrs, especially children, is longer, as well as lists of the wounded and disabled, and that dozens of families have been completely decimated.
The difference today is that approximately half a million people were displaced from their homes, and that the number of homes, schools, hospitals, public buildings, residential buildings, mosques, factories and even cemeteries destroyed is unprecedented. And, the difference today is that the devastation caused by this recent aggression is unmatched in modern times, as confirmed by a witness, the honorable Commissioner-General of UNRWA.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
This last war against Gaza was a series of absolute war crimes carried out before the eyes and ears of the entire world, moment by moment, in a manner that makes it inconceivable that anyone today can claim that they did not realize the magnitude and horror of the crime. And, it is inconceivable that some are unable to characterize this situation in real terms and that they suffice with simply declaring their support for Israel’s right to self-defense without regard for the fate of the thousands of victims of our people, ignoring a simple fact that we remind them of today: that the life of a Palestinian is as precious as the life of any other human being.
We must also assume that no one will wonder anymore why extremism is rising and why the culture of peace is losing ground and why the efforts to achieve it are collapsing.
Yet, we believe – and hope – that no one is trying to aid the occupation this time in its impunity or its attempts to evade accountability for its crimes.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
In the name of Palestine and its people, I affirm here today: we will not forget and we will not forgive, and we will not allow war criminals to escape punishment.
I affirm in front of you that the Palestinian people hold steadfast to their legitimate right to defend themselves against the Israeli war machine and to their legitimate right to resist this colonial, racist Israeli occupation.
At the same time, I affirm that our grief, trauma and anger will not for one moment make us abandon our humanity, our values and our ethics; we will always maintain our respect and commitment to international law, international humanitarian law and the international consensus, and we will maintain the traditions of our national struggle established by the Palestinian fedayeen and to which we committed ourselves since the onset of the Palestinian revolution in early 1965.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Amidst a torrent of massacres and storms of massive destruction, we witnessed the peoples of the world gathering in huge demonstrations on the streets of many cities declaring their condemnation of the aggression and occupation and their support of freedom for Palestine. And we witnessed the overwhelming majority of countries on the various continents declaring the same noble position and rushing to provide all kinds of support and assistance to our people. And we witnessed the qualitative and quantitative broadening of activities of the international grassroots boycott campaign against Israel’s policies of occupation, apartheid and colonial settlement, especially among academia, cultural, student and youth groups.
Thus, in the name of Palestine, we pay tribute to everyone who chose to stand with human values and demanded freedom, justice and peace. All of these manifestations of true solidarity constituted an important message to those who were facing genocide in Gaza, helping them to feel they felt that they were not alone.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The recent Israeli war confirmed on the ground the crux of what the Israeli government had been declaring in the closed rooms of negotiation. This war came after long, difficult negotiations for more than eight months under the auspices of the United States and the efforts of President Barack Obama and tenacious efforts of his Secretary of State John Kerry. We engaged in this endeavor with open minds, in good faith and with a positive spirit and engaged with the efforts of the American administration in the most constructive manner, and we put forth our firm positions based on the resolutions of international legitimacy, which receive the overwhelming support of the nations of the world. And, we genuinely respected all of our commitments and understandings. Even as we watched the ongoing and escalating Israeli violations, we exercised unimaginable self-restraint, silencing our cries and tending to our own wounds in order to give the American efforts the best possible chance for success.
However, and as usual, the Israeli government did not miss the opportunity to undermine the chance for peace.
Throughout the months of negotiations, settlement construction, land confiscations, home demolitions, killing and arrest campaigns, and forced displacement in the West Bank continued unabated and the unjust blockade on the Gaza Strip was tightened. The occupation’s campaign specifically targeted the City of Jerusalem and its inhabitants, attempting to artificially alter the spirit, identity and character of the Holy City, focusing on Al-Aqsa Mosque, threatening grave consequences. At the same time, racist and armed gangs of settlers persisted with their crimes against the Palestinian people, the land, mosques, churches, properties and olive trees.As usual, the Israeli government once again failed the test of peace.
It breached an agreement with the American administration regarding the release of a group of Palestinian prisoners in the occupation’s jails — and we continue to insist on releasing all of them. And, when confronted with simple questions in the direct negotiations or through the American mediator, it did not hesitate to reveal its true positions:
Israel refuses to end its occupation of the State of Palestine since 1967, but rather seeks its continuation and entrenchment, and rejects the Palestinian state and refuses to find a just solution to the plight of the Palestine refugees.
The future proposed by the Israeli government for the Palestinian people is at best isolated ghettos for Palestinians on fragmented lands, without borders and without sovereignty over its airspace, water and natural resources, which will be under the subjugation of the racist settlers and army of occupation, and at worst will be a most abhorrent form of Apartheid.
Israel has confirmed during the negotiations that it rejects making peace with its victims, the Palestinian people.
This has all been done concurrent with an attempt to give a religious nature to the conflict and with the rising and rampant racism in the Israeli political and media discourse and its entrenchment in the school curriculum and in a series of laws and practices of the occupation and its settlers. This culture of racism, incitement and hatred was glaringly manifested in the despicable, appalling crime committed months ago by fascist settlers, who abducted the young Jerusalemite boy Mohammed Abu Khdeir, burnt him alive and killed him.
Over the past years, the occupying Power has also pursued a policy aimed at deliberately weakening the Palestinian National Authority to undermine it and, in essence, to fully negate its role. The occupation targeted the work we have been relentlessly undertaking to establish the foundations of the State of Palestine that we want: a sovereign and independent State living in peace and building bridges of mutual cooperation with its neighbors; that respects commitments, obligations and agreements; that strengthens the values of citizenship, equality, non-discrimination, the rule of law, human rights and pluralism; that deepens the Palestinian enlightened traditions of tolerance, coexistence and non-exclusion; that strengthens the culture of peace; that promotes the role of women; that establishes effective administration committed to the standards of good governance; and that cares for the needs and interests of its people. The occupation has, and continues to, to strike at this effort because it is the antithesis of its settlement policies and because it wants to destroy the chance for the realization of the Palestinian existence in an independent State within the framework of the two-State solution.
When our efforts to end the internal division through national dialogue succeeded a few months ago and we prepared to restore the unity of our land, nation and institutions and formed the national consensus government and began the process to lead to the holding of presidential and legislative elections, all countries of the world welcomed this achievement, with the exception of Israel, which has constantly sought to fragment our land and our national unity.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
And now, where do we go from here?
The idea that it is possible to simply return to the past patterns of work, which repeatedly failed, is naive at best and, in any case, is wrong, as it ignores the fact that it is no longer acceptable, nor possible, to repeat methods that have proven futile or to continue with approaches that have repeatedly failed and require comprehensive review and radical correction.
It is impossible, and I repeat – it is impossible – to return to the cycle of negotiations that failed to deal with the substance of the matter and the fundamental question. There is neither credibility nor seriousness in negotiations in which Israel predetermines the results via its settlement activities and the occupation’s brutality. There is no meaning or value in negotiations for which the agreed objective is not ending the Israeli occupation and achieving the independence of the State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital on the entire Palestinian Territory occupied in the 1967 war. And, there is no value in negotiations which are not linked to a firm timetable for the implementation of this goal.
The time has come to end this settlement occupation.
Palestine refuses to have the right to freedom of her people, who are subjected to the terrorism by the racist occupying Power and its settlers, remain hostage to Israel’s security conditions.
The people of Palestine are actually the ones who need immediate international protection, which we are seeking through international organizations, and who are in need of the security and peace that they are missing more than any other people, and the children of Palestine are worthy of the world’s efforts to ensure that their childhood, dreams and lives will not be devastated once again.
It is time for the chapters of this prolonged, ongoing tragedy to be closed.
Those who were uprooted from their warm homes, good land and beautiful country in Al-Nakba 66 years ago, pushed into the misery of exile and life as refugees and now being forced into new waves of expulsion or onto the ships of death in the world’s seas, are in need of assurances that they will not be displaced from their homes again, that their homes will not be destroyed again, and that they will not spend their lives waiting for the explosion of a new war.
It is time for this long tragedy to end.
We will not accept to forever be the ones being demanded to prove their good intentions by making concessions at the expense of their rights and to remain silent as they are killed and their land is stolen, and to understand the conditions of the other party and the importance of preserving its coalition government, while it entrenches its occupation. We are exhausted of the additional tests we must undergo to prove our efficiency, competence and eligibility to earn our natural, simple right to live a normal life and our inherent right to expect a stable and ordinary tomorrow, to dream about more beautiful days, and for our youth to be able to plan their coming days and years safely in peace and freedom over our land, like other peoples of the world.
The time has come for a real, just peace to prevail in the land of peace.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
We, and all the Arab countries, have constantly cautioned about the disastrous consequences of the continuation of the Israeli occupation and the denial of freedom and independence for the people of Palestine. We have repeatedly draw attention to the fact that allowing Israel to act as a state above the law with impunity and absolving it of any accountability or punishment for its policies, aggression and defiance of the international will and legitimacy has absolutely provided fertile ground and an environment conducive for the growth of extremism, hatred and terrorism in our region.
Confronting the terrorism that plagues our region by groups – such as “ISIL” and others that have no basis whatsoever in the tolerant Islamic religion or with humanity and are committing brutal and heinous atrocities – requires much more than military confrontation. It is an urgent matter that requires much more than condemnations and declarations of positions, which are of course necessary. What is primarily needed is a comprehensive, credible strategy to dry out the sources of terrorism and eradicate its roots in all political, intellectual, economic and social spheres in our region. It requires the creation of solid foundations for a reasonable consensus that makes the fight against all forms of terrorism in any place everywhere a collective task that is undertaken by the alliance of nations, peoples and civilizations. It requires, in this context and as a priority, bringing an end to the Israeli occupation of our country, which constitutes in its practices and perpetuation, an abhorrent form of state terrorism and a breeding ground for incitement, tension and hatred.
Mr. President,
At this moment in which we are still suffering from the horrors of war, we face a formidable challenge to reconstruct what has been destroyed by the occupation.At the invitation of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Kingdom of Norway, which we deeply appreciate, the city of Cairo will host next month an international conference for the relief and reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. Our government will present comprehensive reports to the conference on the losses inflicted by the aggression on the different sectors of life, and it will provide details of the plans and programs that will be rapidly implemented and supervised in the Gaza Strip to meet immediate relief needs and the requirements of reconstruction, in full coordination with United Nations agencies and bodies.
While we reiterate our appreciation and gratitude to all countries and organizations that rushed to provide assistance to the Palestinian people during and after the war, we are confident that brotherly and friendly countries will not waver in supporting support the plans and programs we will present and that the conference will achieve practical results that fulfill the expectations and needs of the victims of this aggression.
We reaffirm here that the primary prerequisite for the success of all these plans and efforts is an end to the ongoing Israeli blockade that has for years suffocated the Gaza Strip and turned it into the largest prison in the world for nearly two million Palestinian citizens. At the same time, we affirm our commitment and the necessity to consolidate the cease-fire through negotiations under the auspices of Egypt.
However, in order to avert repeating the cycle of war and cycle reconstruction every two or three years, it is imperative to focus on the fundamental issue and starting point, which is that the suffering of Gaza will not be completely alleviated except by ending the occupation and achieving the independence of the State of Palestine.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
During the past two weeks, Palestine and the Arab Group undertook intensive contacts with the various regional groups in the United Nations to prepare for the introduction of a draft resolution to be adopted by the United Nations Security Council on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to push forward the efforts to achieve peace.
This endeavor reaffirms our commitment to achieve a just peace through a negotiated solution and our adoption of a diplomatic and political effort through United Nations bodies. This endeavor is inspired by and based fully on the spirit and provisions of the many resolutions you have approved in the General Assembly and those adopted by the Security Council, which have set the foundations for a lasting solution and a just peace.
This endeavor aspires to correct the deficiency of the previous efforts to achieve peace by affirming the goal of ending the Israeli occupation and achieving the two-State solution, of the State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, over the entire territory occupied in 1967, alongside the State of Israel and reaching a just and agreed upon solution to the plight of the Palestine refugees on the basis of resolution 194, with a specific time frame for the implementation of these objectives as stipulated in the Arab Peace Initiative. This will be linked to the immediate resumption of negotiations between Palestine and Israel to demarcate the borders, reach a detailed and comprehensive agreement and draft a peace treaty between them.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We are confident that this endeavor will receive broad and full support by those who are committed to ensuring that our country will not witness new wars and atrocities, by those who wish to support a campaign to combat terrorism, by those who believe that it is necessary to act expediently to rectify the historical injustice inflicted by Al-Nakba on the Palestinian people, and by those who wish to see peace prevail in the land of the monotheistic religions.
The adoption of this resolution will affirm what you strived to realize in this year is the International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, who will continue their struggle and steadfastness and will rise brave and strong from the rubble and destruction.
We, as our poet Mahmoud Darwish said: “are infected with an incurable disease, that is hope, and we love life if we are given the chance for it”.Mr. President Ladies and Gentlemen,There is an occupation that must end now.There is a people that must be freed immediately.The hour of independence of the State of Palestine has arrived.

<title>South Africa delays approval of Israeli circumcision device after BDS pressure</title>
<date>Mon Sep 29 19:00:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The South African Department of Health reportedly is delaying approval of an Israeli-made circumcision device after political pressure from anti-Israel trade unions.
Prepex, a nonsurgical circumcising device developed in Israel, was approved last year by the World Health Organization. Studies show it reduces the likelihood of contracting the virus that causes AIDS by nearly 60 percent.
The boycott of the device began in 2013 by the Congress of South African Trade Unions, or Cosatu, and the African National Congress, both supporters of the Boycott Divest Sanctions campaign against Israel.
Cosatu has threatened to tell its members, many of them nurses, to refuse to use the device, Business Day Live reported.
The Department of Health denies that the delay is due to pressure from anti-Israel groups.
National Education Health and Allied Workers Union spokesman Sizwe Pamla told Business Day Live on Sunday that the union would not allow any Israeli product to be used in the public health system.
“We have told the African National Congress and the government that our position is clear and unambiguous when it comes to Israel. We boycott everything and every product that comes from that pariah and apartheid state,” he said.

<title>At UN, Netanyahu asks Arab states for new peace plan </title>
<date>Mon Sep 29 21:08:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
NEW YORK – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday called on moderate Arab states to update the 2002 Arab League peace initiative to match current Middle East reality, particularly in view of the civil war in Syria and the wave of Islamic terror being spearheaded by Islamic State.
Addressing the UN General Assembly in New York, Netanyahu argued that improved relations between Israel and the Arab states would contribute to advancing peace with the Palestinians, rather than vice versa. The prime minister, however, did not present a practical plan for achieving this.
Click here for a transcript and video of the full speech.
“With a fresh approach from our neighbors, we can advance peace despite the difficulties,” he told a half-empty hall. “In Israel, we have a record of making the impossible possible. We’ve made a desolate land flourish. ... Peace, of course, would enable Israel to realize its full potential. … But the old template for peace must be updated. It must take into account new realities and new roles and responsibilities for our Arab neighbors.”
Netanyahu noted that after years during which the Arab states saw Israel as an enemy, they now understand that they and Israel are confronting the same threats, particularly Iran and radical Islam.
“Our challenge is to transform these common interests to create a productive partnership, one that would build a more secure, peaceful and prosperous Middle East. I believe the partnership between us can also help facilitate peace between Israel and the Palestinians,” he said.
“Many have long assumed that an Israeli-Palestinian peace can help facilitate a broader rapprochement between Israel and the Arab world. But these days, I think it may work the other way around, namely that a broader rapprochement between Israel and the Arab world may help facilitate an Israeli-Palestinian peace. To achieve that peace, we must look not only to Jerusalem and Ramallah but also to Cairo, to Amman, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh and elsewhere,” said the prime minister.
Despite all the challenges, he said, “I believe peace can be realized with the active involvement of Arab countries – those that are willing to provide political, material and other indispensable support. I’m ready to make a historic compromise, not because Israel occupies a foreign land. The people of Israel are not occupiers in the land of Israel. … I want peace because I want to create a better future for my people.”
Netanyahu also responded to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’s speech to the General Assembly last Friday, in which Abbas accused Israel of committing war crimes during Operation Protective Edge in Gaza.
“Today the Jewish state is demonized with the apartheid libel and charges of genocide,” Netanyahu said. “In what moral universe does genocide include warning the enemy civilian population to get out of harm’s way? ... Well, I suppose it’s the same moral universe where a man who wrote a dissertation of lies about the Holocaust and who insists on a Palestine free of Jews – Judenrein – can stand at this podium and shamelessly accuse Israel of genocide and ethnic cleansing,” he said, referring to Abbas.
“In the past, outrageous lies against the Jews were the precursors to the wholesale slaughter of our people, but no more. Today, we, the Jewish people, have the power to defend ourselves. We will defend ourselves against our enemies on the battlefield; we will expose their lies against us in the court of public opinion.”
Once again resorting to visual aids in a UN speech, Netanyahu displayed a picture taken by a France 24 crew of Palestinian children congregating around Hamas rocket launchers, citing this as proof that Hamas was attacking Israel from civilian areas.
“Hamas embedded its missile batteries in residential areas and told Palestinians to ignore Israel’s warnings to leave,” Netanyahu said. “And no less reprehensible, Hamas deliberately placed its rockets where Palestinian children live and play.
“Ladies and gentlemen, this is a war crime. And I say to President Abbas, these are the crimes, the war crimes, committed by your Hamas partners in the national unity government which you head and you are responsible for. And these are the real war crimes you should have investigated or spoken out against from this podium last week,” Netanyahu said, drawing applause.
The prime minister addressed the broadening of the international battle against Islamic State and militant Islam in general, saying Islamic State and Hamas “are branches of the same poisonous tree.”
Radical Islam’s ultimate goal, he said, is to dominate the world. “Now, that threat might seem exaggerated to some since it starts out small, like a cancer that attacks a particular part of the body,” he said. “But left unchecked, the cancer grows, metastasizing over wider and wider areas. To protect the peace and security of the world, we must remove this cancer before it’s too late.”

<title>Transcript of Benjamin Netanyahu's address to the 2014 UN General Assembly</title>
<date>Mon Sep 29 22:19:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: Thank you, Mr. President. Distinguished delegates, I come here from Jerusalem to speak on behalf of my people, the people of Israel. I've come here to speak about the dangers we face and about the opportunities we seek. I've come here to expose the brazen lies spoken from this very podium against my country and against the brave soldiers who defend it.
Read these analysis pieces on the speech: Yossi Verter on Netanyahu's UN speech: Hamas, Iran, Islamic State and a finger in Obama’s eye; Barak Ravid:  Netanyahu's empty UN speech was a tour de force of deja vu.
Ladies and gentlemen, the people of Israel pray for peace, but our hopes and the world’s hopes for peace are in danger because everywhere we look militant Islam is on the march. It’s not militants. It’s not Islam. It’s militant Islam. And typically its first victims are other Muslims, but it spares no one: Christians, Jews, Yazidis, Kurds. No creed, no faith, no ethnic group is beyond its sights. And it’s rapidly spreading in every part of the world.
You know the famous American saying, all politics is local? For the militant Islamists, all politics is global, because their ultimate goal is to dominate the world. Now, that threat might seem exaggerated to some since it starts out small, like a cancer that attacks a particular part of the body. But left unchecked, the cancer grows, metastasizing over wider and wider areas. To protect the peace and security of the world, we must remove this cancer before it’s too late.

Last week, many of the countries represented here rightly applauded President Obama for leading the effort to confront ISIS, and yet weeks before, some of these same countries, the same countries that now support confronting ISIS, opposed Israel for confronting Hamas. They evidently don’t understand that ISIS and Hamas are branches of the same poisonous tree.
ISIS and Hamas share a fanatical creed, which they both seek to impose well beyond the territory under their control. Listen to ISIS’ self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. This is what he said two months ago: A day will soon come when the Muslim will walk everywhere as a master. The Muslims will cause the world to hear and understand the meaning of terrorism and destroy the idol of democracy. Now listen to Khaled Mashal, the leader of Hamas. He proclaims a similar vision of the future: We say this to the West -- by Allah you will be defeated. Tomorrow our nation will sit on the throne of the world.
As Hamas’ charter makes clear, Hamas’ immediate goal is to destroy Israel, but Hamas has a broader objective. They also want a caliphate. Hamas shares the global ambitions of its fellow militant Islamists, and that’s why its supporters wildly cheered in the streets of Gaza as thousands of Americans were murdered in 9/11, and that’s why its leaders condemn the United States for killing Osama bin Laden whom they praised as a holy warrior.

So when it comes to their ultimate goals, Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas. And what they share in common all militant Islamists share in common. Boko Haram in Nigeria, Al-Shabab in Somalia, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Al-Nusra in Syria, the Mahdi army in Iraq, and the Al-Qaida branches in Yemen, Libya, the Philippines, India and elsewhere.
Some are radical Sunnis, some are radical Shiites, some want to restore a pre-medieval caliphate from the seventh century, others want to trigger the apocalyptic return of an imam from the ninth century. They operate in different lands, they target different victims and they even kill each other in their battle for supremacy. But they all share a fanatic ideology. They all seek to create ever-expanding enclaves of militant Islam where there is no freedom and no tolerance, where women are treated as chattel, Christians are decimated and minorities are subjugated, sometimes given the stark choice, convert or die. For them, anyone can be considered an infidel, including fellow Muslims.
Ladies and gentlemen, militant Islam’s ambition to dominate the world seems mad, but so too did the global ambitions of another fanatic ideology that swept into power eight decades ago. The Nazis believed in a master race. The militant Islamists believe in a master faith. They just disagree who among them will be the master of the master faith. That’s what they truly disagree about. And therefore, the question before us is whether militant Islam will have the power to realize its unbridled ambitions.
There is one place where that could soon happen -- the Islamic State of Iran. For 35 years, Iran has relentlessly pursued the global mission which was set forth by its founding ruler, Ayatollah Khomeini, in these words. “We will export our revolution to the entire world until the cry ‘there is no god but Allah’ will echo throughout the world over.” And ever since, the regime’s brutal enforcers, Iran’s revolutionary guards, have done exactly that.
Listen to its current commander, General Mohammad Ali Jafari. And he clearly stated his goal. He said “Our imam did not limit the Islamic revolution to this country, our duty is to prepare the way for an Islamic world government.”
Iran’s President Rohani stood here last week and shed crocodile tears over what he called the globalization of terrorism. Maybe he should spare us those phony tears and have a word instead with the commanders of Iran’s revolutionary guards. He could ask them to call off Iran’s global terror campaign, which has included attacks in two dozen countries on five continents since 2011 alone.
You know, to say that Iran doesn’t practice terrorism is like saying Derek Jeter never played shortstop for the New York Yankees. This is -- this bemoaning by the Iranian president of the spread of terrorism has got to be one of history’s greatest displays of doubletalk.
Now, some argue that Iran’s global terror campaign, its subversion of countries throughout the Middle East and well beyond the Middle East, some argue that this is the work of the extremists. They say things are changing. They point to last year’s election in Iran. They claim that Iran’s smooth-talking president and foreign minister, they’ve changed not only the tone of Iran’s foreign policy but also its substance. They believe that Rohani and Zarif (generally/genuinely ?) want to reconcile with the West, that they’ve abandoned the global mission of the Islamic Revolution. Really?
So let’s look at what Foreign Minister Zarif wrote in his book just a few years ago:
We have a fundamental problem with the West, and especially with America. This is because we are heirs to a global mission which is tied to our raison d'être, a global mission which is tied to our very reason for being.
And then Zarif asks a question -- I think an interesting one. He says: How come Malaysia -- he’s referring to an overwhelmingly Muslim country -- how come Malaysia doesn’t have similar problems? And he answers: Because Malaysia is not trying to change the international order.
That’s your moderate. So don’t be fooled by Iran’s manipulative charm offensive. It’s designed for one purpose and for one purpose only: to lift the sanctions and remove the obstacles to Iran’s path to the bomb. The Islamic Republic is now trying to bamboozle its way to an agreement that will remove the sanctions it still faces and leave it with a capacity of thousands of refugees -- of centrifuges, rather -- to enrich uranium. This would effectively cement Iran’s place as a threshold military nuclear power. And in the future, at the time of its choosing, Iran, the world’s most dangerous regime, in the world’s most dangerous region, would obtain the world’s most dangerous weapons. Allowing that to happen would pose the gravest threat to us all. It’s one thing to confront militant Islamists on pickup trucks armed with Kalashnikov rifles. It’s another thing to confront militant Islamists armed with weapons of mass destruction.
I remember that last year, everyone here was rightly concerned about the chemical weapons in Syria, including the possibility that they would fall into the hands of terrorists. Well, that didn’t happen, and President Obama deserves great credit for leading the diplomatic effort to dismantle virtually all of Syria’s chemical weapons capability. Imagine how much more dangerous the Islamic State, ISIS, would be if it possessed chemical weapons. Now imagine how much more dangerous the Islamic state of Iran would be if it possessed nuclear weapons.
Ladies and gentlemen, would you let ISIS enrich uranium? Would you let ISIS build a heavy water reactor? Would you let ISIS develop intercontinental ballistic missiles? Of course you wouldn’t. Then you mustn’t let the Islamic state of Iran do those things either, because here’s what will happen. Once Iran produces atomic bombs, all the charms and all the smiles will suddenly disappear. They’ll just vanish. And it’s then that the ayatollahs will show their true face and unleash their aggressive fanaticism on the entire world.
There’s only one responsible course of action to address this threat. Iran’s nuclear military capabilities must be fully dismantled. (Applause.) Make no mistake: ISIS must be defeated. But to defeat ISIS and leave Iran as a threshold nuclear power is to win the battle and lose the war. (Applause.) To defeat ISIS and leave Iran as a threshold nuclear power is to win the battle and lose the war.
Ladies and gentlemen, the fight against militant Islam is indivisible. When militant Islam succeeds anywhere, it’s emboldened everywhere. When it suffers a blow in one place, it’s set back in every place. That’s why Israel’s fight against Hamas is not just our fight, it’s your fight. Israel is fighting a fanaticism today that your countries may be forced to fight tomorrow. For 50 days this past summer Hamas fired thousands of rockets at Israel, many of them supplied by Iran. I want you to think about what your countries would do if thousands of rockets were fired at your cities. Imagine millions of your citizens having seconds at most to scramble to bomb shelters day after day. You wouldn’t let terrorists fire rockets at your cities with impunity, nor would you let terrorists dig dozens of terror tunnels under your borders to infiltrate your towns in order to murder and kidnap your citizens. Israel justly defended itself against both rocket attacks and terror tunnels. (Applause.)
Yet Israel faced another challenge. We faced a propaganda war because in an attempt to win the world sympathy, Hamas cynically used Palestinian civilians as human shields. It used schools -- not just schools; UN schools -- private homes, mosques, even hospitals to store and fire rockets at Israel. As Israel surgically struck at the rocket launchers and at the tunnels, Palestinian civilians were tragically but unintentionally killed. There are heartrending images that resulted, and these fueled libelous charges that Israel was deliberately targeting civilians. We were not. We deeply regret every single civilian casualties.
And the truth is this: Israel was doing everything to minimize Palestinian civilian casualties. Hamas was doing everything to maximize Israeli civilian casualties and Palestinian civilian casualties. Israel dropped flyers, made phone calls, sent text messages, broadcast warnings in Arabic on Palestinian television, all this to enable Palestinian civilians to evaluate targeted areas. No other country and no other army in history have gone to greater lengths to avoid casualties among the civilian population of their enemies. (Applause.)
Now, this concern for Palestinian life was all the more remarkable given that Israeli civilians were being bombarded by rockets day after day, night after night. And as their families were being rocketed by Hamas, Israel’s citizen army, the brave soldiers of the IDF, our young boys and girls, they upheld the highest moral values of any army in the world. (Applause.) Israel’s soldiers deserve not condemnation but admiration, admiration from decent people everywhere. (Applause.)
Now, here is what Hamas did. Here is what Hamas did. Hamas embedded its missile batteries in residential areas and told Palestinians to ignore Israel’s warnings to leave. And just in case people didn’t get the message, they executed Palestinian civilians in Gaza who dared to protest. And no less reprehensible, Hamas deliberately placed its rockets where Palestinian children live and play. Let me show you a photograph. It was taken by a France 24 crew during the recent conflict. It shows two Hamas rocket launchers, which were used to attack us. You see three children playing next to them. Hamas deliberately put its rockets in hundreds of residential areas like this -- hundreds of them.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a war crime. And I say to President Abbas, these are the crimes, the war crimes, committed by your Hamas partners in the national unity government which you head and you are responsible for. And these are the real war crimes you should have investigated or spoken out against from this podium last week. (Applause.)
Ladies and gentlemen, as Israel’s children huddle in bomb shelters and Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense knocked Hamas rockets out of the sky, the profound moral difference between Israel and Hamas couldn’t have been clearer. Israel was using its missiles to protect its children. Hamas was using its children to protect its missiles. (Applause.)
By investigating Israel rather than Hamas for war crimes, the UN Human Rights Council has betrayed its noble mission to protect the innocent. In fact, what it’s doing is to turn the laws of war upside down. Israel, which took unprecedented steps to minimize civilian casualties -- Israel is condemned. Hamas, which both targeted and hid behind civilians -- that’s a double war crime -- Hamas is given a pass.
The Human Rights Council is thus sending a clear message to terrorists everywhere: Use civilians as a human shield. Use them again and again and again. And you know why? Because, sadly, it works. By granting international legitimacy to the use of human shields, the UN Human Rights Council has thus become a terrorist rights council, and it will have repercussions -- it probably already has -- about the use of civilians as human shields. It’s not just our interests. It’s not just our values that are under attack. It’s your interests and your values.
Ladies and gentlemen, we live in a world steeped in tyranny and terror where gays are hanged from cranes in Tehran, political prisoners are executed in Gaza, young girls are abducted en masse in Nigeria, and hundreds of thousands are butchered in Syria, Libya and Iraq, yet nearly half -- nearly half of the UN Human Rights Council’s resolutions focusing on a single country have been directed against Israel, the one true democracy in the Middle East; Israel, where issues are openly debated in a boisterous parliament, where human rights are protected by the -- by independent courts, and where women, gays and minorities live in a genuinely free society.
The human rights -- that’s an oxymoron, the human -- UN Human Rights Council, but I’ll use it just the same. The council’s biased treatment of Israel is only one manifestation of the return of one of the world’s largest prejudices. We hear mobs today in Europe call for the gassing of Jews. We hear some national leaders compare Israel to the Nazis. This is not a function of Israel’s policies. It’s a function of diseased minds. and that disease has a name. It’s called anti-Semitism. It is now spreading in polite society where it masquerades as legitimate criticism of Israel.
For centuries the Jewish people have been demonized with blood libels and charges of deicide. Today the Jewish state is demonized with the apartheid libel and charges of genocide -- genocide. In what moral universe does genocide include warning the enemy civilian population to get out of harm's way, or ensuring that they receive tons -- tons of humanitarian aid each day even as thousands of rockets are being fired at us, or setting up a field hospital to aid their wounded?
Well, I suppose it's the same moral universe where a man who wrote a dissertation of lies about the Holocaust and who insists on a Palestine free of Jews -- Judenrein -- can stand at this podium and shamelessly accuse Israel of genocide and ethnic cleansing. In the past, outrageous lies against the Jews were the precursors to the wholesale slaughter of our people, but no more. Today, we, the Jewish people, have the power to defend ourselves. We will defend ourselves against our enemies on the battlefield -- (applause) -- we will expose their lies against us in the court of public opinion. Israel will continue to stand proud and unbowed. (Applause.)
Ladies and gentlemen, despite the enormous challenges facing Israel, I believe we have a historic opportunity. After decades of seeing Israel as their enemy, leading states in the Arab world increasingly recognize that together, we and they face many of the same dangers, and principally, this means a nuclear-armed Iran and militant Islamist movements gaining ground in the Sunni world. Our challenge is to transform these common interests to create a productive partnership, one that would build a more secure, peaceful and prosperous Middle East. Together, we can strengthen regional security, we can advance projects in water and agricultural, in transportation and health and energy in so many fields.
I believe the partnership between us can also help facilitate peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Now, many have long assumed that an Israeli-Palestinian peace can help facilitate a broader rapprochement between Israel and the Arab world. But these days, I think it may work the other way around, namely that a broader rapprochement between Israel and the Arab world may help facilitate an Israeli-Palestinian peace. And therefore, to achieve that peace, we must look not only to Jerusalem and Ramallah but also to Cairo, to Amman, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh and elsewhere.
I believe peace can be realized with the active involvement of Arab countries -- those that are willing to provide political, material and other indispensable support. I'm ready to make a historic compromise, not because Israel occupies a foreign land. The people of Israel are not occupiers in the land of Israel. (Applause.) History, archaeology and common sense all make clear that we have had a singular attachment to this land for over 3,000 years.
I want peace because I want to create a better future for my people, but it must be a genuine peace -- one that is anchored in mutual recognition and enduring security arrangements -- rock solid security arrangements on the ground, because you see, Israeli withdrawals from Lebanon and Gaza created two militant Islamic enclaves on our borders for which tens of thousands of rockets have been fired at Israel, and these sobering experiences heightens Israel's security concerns (regarding ?) potential territorial concessions in the future.
Now, those security concerns are even greater today. Just look around you. The Middle East is in chaos, states are disintegrating, and militant Islamists are filling the void. Israel cannot have territories from which it withdraws taken over by Islamic militants yet again, as happened in Gaza and Lebanon. That would place the likes of ISIS within mortar range, a few miles, of 80 percent of our population.
Now think about that. The distance between the 1967 lines and the suburbs of Tel Aviv is like the distance between the UN building here and Times Square. Israel is a tiny country. That’s why in any peace agreement, which will obviously necessitate a territorial compromise, I will always insist that Israel be able to defend itself by itself against any threat. (Applause.)
And yet despite everything that has happened, some still don’t take Israel’s security concerns seriously. But I do and I always will -- (applause) -- because as prime minister of Israel, I’m entrusted with the awesome responsibility of ensuring the future of the Jewish people and the future of the Jewish state. And no matter what pressure is brought to bear, I will never waiver in fulfilling that responsibility. (Applause.)
I believe that with a fresh approach from our neighbors, we can advance peace despite the difficulties we face. See, in Israel, we have a record of making the impossible possible. We’ve made a desolate land flourish, and with very few natural resources, we’ve used the fertile minds of our people to turn Israel into a global center of technology and innovation, and peace, of course, would enable Israel to realize its full potential and to bring a promising future not only for our people, not only for the Palestinian people, but for many, many others in our region.
But the old template for peace must be updated. It must take into account new realities and new roles and responsibilities for our Arab neighbors.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is a new Middle East. It presents new dangers but also new opportunities. Israel is prepared to work with Arab partners and the international community to confront those dangers and to seize those opportunities. Together, we must recognize the global threat of militant Islam, the primacy of dismantling Iran’s nuclear weapons capability and the indispensable role of Arab states in advancing peace with the Palestinians. All this may fly in the face of conventional wisdom, but it’s the truth, and the truth must always be spoken, especially here in the United Nations. (Applause.)
Isaiah, our great prophet of peace, taught us nearly 3,000 years ago in Jerusalem to speak truth to power. (Speaks in Hebrew.) For the sake of Zion, I will not be silent, for the sake of Jerusalem, I will not be still until her justice shines bright and her salvation glows like a flaming torch.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us light a torch of truth and justice to safeguard our common future. Thank you. (Applause.)

<title>Zambia's Guy Scott becomes Africa's first white head of state in 20 years</title>
<date>Wed Oct 29 16:09:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	Zambian President Michael Sata, once dubbed "Mr. King Cobra" for his sharp-tongued remarks, died in a London hospital after a long illness, the Zambian government said Wednesday. Vice President Guy Scott, a white Zambian of Scottish descent, was appointed acting president of the southern African nation until elections are held within 90 days.
	Scott is the first white leader of an African nation since F.W. de Klerk, the last president of South Africa under apartheid, the white racist regime that ended in 1994. Scott, a 70-year-old former agriculture minister, has said he has no presidential ambitions, and he cannot in any case become a fully empowered president because his parents were born outside Zambia, according to analysts.
	"Dr. Scott will act as president of the republic of Zambia until the country goes for a presidential by-election," said Defense Minister Edgar Lungu, who is also secretary general of the ruling Patriotic Front party.
	"The government remains intact and so does the Patriotic Front as a party," Lungu said.
	Lungu had served as acting president when Sata traveled to London for medical treatment earlier this month. Scott was previously agriculture minister and has also worked in Zambia's finance ministry.
	Sata died shortly after 11 p.m. on Tuesday at London's King Edward VII hospital, where he was being treated, Cabinet secretary Roland Msiska said in a statement.	Sata's wife, Christine Kaseba-Sata, and his son, Mulenga Sata, were at the 77-year-old president's side when he died, Msiska said. Mulenga Sata is the mayor of the Zambian capital, Lusaka.
	"I urge all of you to remain calm, united and peaceful during this very difficult period," Msiska said in an appeal to Zambians.
	Zambia had already declared Wednesday to be a national day of mourning for 26 people, all but three of them schoolchildren, who died Oct. 24 when a crowded boat capsized on Lake Kariba, near the border with Zimbabwe.
	The children were on their way to a ceremony marking Zambia's 50th anniversary of independence from Britain. Sata was unable to preside over the national celebrations because he was in the London hospital.
	Kenya, South Africa and other countries sent condolences to Zambia after Sata died. British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Sata "played a commanding role in the public life of his country over three decades."
	Rumors that Sata was deathly ill had gripped Zambia since the leader largely dropped out of public view months ago, and opposition groups had questioned whether Sata was fit to lead a country of 15 million people that has enjoyed robust economic growth but suffers widespread poverty.
	On Sept. 19, Sata spoke at the opening of parliament in Lusaka, poking fun at speculation about his failing health, saying that he was still alive.
	Following that appearance, Sata failed to give a scheduled address at the United Nations in New York and police said doctors treated him in a hotel room.
	Earlier this year, Sata traveled to Israel amid speculation he was seeking medical treatment. On Oct. 20, Zambia said Sata had left for a "medical check-up abroad."
	Sata had a mixed relationship with Chinese investors in Zambian mines and other infrastructure, criticizing them as exploitative but toning down his rhetoric after taking office.
	Some critics say Sata became increasingly intolerant as president. An opposition leader, Frank Bwalya, was acquitted this year of defamation charges after he compared Sata to a local potato whose name is slang for someone who doesn't listen.
	As an opposition leader, Sata lost three presidential votes, breaking the jinx to become Zambia's fifth president in 2011. He also served in previous governments, and was a member of every major party.
	Sata was born in Mpika in what was then northern Rhodesia, and worked as a police officer and trade unionist under colonial rule. He also trained as a pilot in Russia.
	After independence in 1964, he joined Kenneth Kaunda's United National Independent Party, becoming governor of Lusaka, a city as well as a province, in 1985.
	He resigned from Kaunda's party in 1991 and joined the newly formed Movement for Multiparty Democracy, later serving as a party lawmaker for 10 years and as minister for local government, labor and social security, and health.
	In 2001, he left to form his Patriotic Front party. In 2008, he suffered a stroke and went to South Africa for treatment. The same year, President Levy Mwanawasa died following a stroke and a special election held later saw Sata narrowly lose to Rupiah Banda, who had been Mwanawasa's vice president.
	Sata's wife is a medical doctor and the couple had eight children.
	Sata introduced Kaseba-Sata at the opening of parliament last month, crediting her with tough love.
	"She has made me stay up to now," he said. "I haven't died yet."

<title>Livni: Settlers want ‘apartheid’ buses</title>
<date>Fri Oct 31 08:10:00 IST 2014</date>

	Settlers’ demands that Jews and Palestinians travel on separate buses smack of apartheid, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni said in an interview with Army Radio Thursday.
	The Defense Ministry has said the new busing plan, first reported in Haaretz, stems strictly from security considerations: To ensure that Palestinians allowed into Israel to work don’t stay overnight illegally, they will henceforth have to leave via the same checkpoint through which they enter so their entry and exit can be tracked more easily. Since regular Israeli buses don’t pass through this checkpoint, the new rule effectively precludes Palestinians from riding them.
	However, Haaretz reported that Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon also came under heavy pressure from settlers to approve the new rule.
	“As long as we’re talking about security, the considerations are relevant ones, and the defense minister’s job really is to ensure the citizenry’s security,” Livni said in the interview. “But he said he didn’t give any such order” – i.e., one barring Palestinians from riding Israeli buses serving the settlements.
	“I applied to the attorney general when I read the [Haaretz] article, because I understood that this was the result of pressure by settlers who don’t want to travel with Arabs on the bus. I read the transcripts of what was said in that Knesset committee. It’s intolerable, the claims that they [the settlers] need their own buses, because one [Palestinian] didn’t get up for a woman or an elderly person, and another wasn’t nice to them. This is apartheid!” Livni said.
	“If this is due to security considerations, that’s something I can not only live with, but I’ll even support,” she continued. “But if we’re talking about settler pressure, that it’s not convenient or pleasant for them in the very places they sought to live, where there are Palestinians – that’s something I find unacceptable, and I’ll work against it. This is discrimination that’s forbidden by Israeli law.”
	Earlier this week, Haaretz published transcripts from a November 2013 meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee’s subcommittee on the West Bank. The meeting was called to discuss the shortage of buses to the settlements, but several settlers complained about the behavior of Palestinian passengers on these buses.
	Ofri Tal-Or, 23, of Ariel, for instance, complained that a Palestinian once sat next to her and started feeling her up, ignoring her requests to stop. “I was too scared to get up because the bus was filled with Arabs and I didn’t know what to do,” she said.
	Yoni Dreier of Ariel added that his wife once came home from Bar-Ilan University on a bus packed with Palestinians, and even though she was nine months pregnant, none of them offered her a seat, forcing her to stand the whole way.

<title>Romney assault on 'naive' Obama headlines expat Israeli-American fete  </title>
<date>Sat Nov 08 09:30:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	The inaugural conference of the Israeli-American Council served as a platform for a blistering attack on President Barack Obama on Friday night, launched by his defeated rival in the 2012 elections, Republican Mitt Romney. The "naive" president, Romney said, “is weakening our military, distancing ourselves from allies, and being divisive and demeaning towards our friends.”
	Romney said that he was ‘stunned’ by Obama’s recent letter to Iranian leader Ali Khamenei. “That the president would write a letter of this nature, in effect legitimizing a nation and a leadership that is violating international norms and is threatening the world, is so far beyond the pale, I was stunned. I was speechless.”
	Romney was warmly received with a standing ovation by about 700 expatriate Israelis who are participating in the first-ever national political conference exclusively devoted to the expat Israeli community. The conference, organized by the Israeli American Council (IAC) aims to establish the community as a “strategic asset” for Israel in the U.S. and, according to Jewish activists, as a potent political force in the future. The organization was established in Los Angeles in 2007, but underwent dramatic development and expansion after casino mogul Sheldon Adelson's decision in late 2013 to serve as its main funder. 
	Romney, who was interviewed by his former adviser Dan Senor, author of the popular book “Start-Up Nation," told the crowd that he had flown on Adelson’s private plane last week from Alaska, where he had campaigned on behalf of the Republican candidate for the Senate, Dan Sullivan. Adelson sat in the audience, together with his wife Miri, who serves as the chairperson of the IAC’s Las Vegas branch. Also attending were Israel’s UN ambassador, Ron Prosor, who exhorted his audience to participate in hasbara efforts to defend Israel, as well as Israel’s new Interior Minister Gilad Erdan, who will address the conference on Sunday.

	Although the conference claims to be bipartisan, the only other politician speaking at Friday’s opening plenary was former U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman, who quit the Democratic Party in 2006 and has since become one of Obama’s harshest critics. Lieberman’s “balance” to Romney, therefore, was to attack Obama for his “harmful” relations with Israel and for the “chickenshit” epithet used against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by an anonymous administration official quoted by Jeffrey Goldberg in the Atlantic. Lieberman said of Romney “in politics and in life I’ve never met anyone as honorable or as able” as him.
	Two Democratic lawmakers are also scheduled to appear before the conference on Saturday, but both – outgoing Senate Foreign Relations Committee head Robert Menendez and Florida Congressmen Ted Deutch – are also expected to criticize Obama’s policy on Iran, though in milder terms than Romney. South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, however, will probably be just as harsh as Romney, if not more so.
	Speaking after a kosher Shabbat dinner in a ballroom at the Washington Hilton Hotel, a short distance from the White House, Romney said that the U.S. should treat Iran as it did apartheid South Africa, as a pariah state whose leaders are shunned. He said that Obama “continues to diminish himself and America and leads bad people to think America can be pushed around,” Romney said.
	He also lambasted the fact that Obama had bypassed U.S. allies in the region, including Israel. “The president is weakening our military and distancing us from our allies - which weakens us,” Romney said. “He began by going into the Arab world and apologizing for America, and saying we were dictatorial, divisive - and that we were dismissive of other nations. And the remarkable thing is that he now is doing that very thing. But not to our enemies. To our friends.”

<title>Five must-read opinion pieces about Israel's nation-state bill</title>
<date>Mon Dec 01 18:41:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	Few pieces of Israeli legislation have aroused as much passion and debate as the so-called nation-state bill, which has been approved by the cabinet but has yet to go to the Knesset plenum due to vociferous coalition opposition. It's the sort of bill that brings down coalitions – and it may still do just that. 	The bill, which was drafted by MK Zeev Elkin but has been adopted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a toned-down format, defines the State of Israel as "the nation-state of the Jewish people” – an overriding identity whenever democratic principles clash with Jewish interests. 	It also reserves communal rights in Israel for Jews only, limiting the country's Arab community to “personal rights … according to law.” Elkin's original version would have defined Hebrew as Israel’s only national language, as well, reducing Arabic to secondary status.  Salman Masalha notes Netanyahu's undeniable Jewish patriotism, but questions whether the prime minister has ever known what it means to be Israeli. The last prime minister who acted in an Israeli fashion, he notes, "was murdered in a square in the first Hebrew city by a Jewish, yarmulke-wearing assassin." Read the full article.
	Welcome, Diaspora Jews, to the Israel you've been avoiding, writes Asher Schechter. "It's not like Netanyahu is changing anything," he says, "he's just lifting the veil." The money, influence and unwavering support of Jews abroad, particularly those in America, has "enabled many of the behaviors that contributed to the kind of arrogant solipsism that made Israeli politicians believe they can get away with anything. " Read the full article.   Gideon Levy speculates that the intentions underlying bill may be more far-reaching than they seem. The legislation, he says, may be "legal preparation for the right wing’s one-state solution, the annexation of the territories and the establishment of the Jewish apartheid state." There would be no need for the bill in a two-state environment, Levy writes. Only in a binational state – in which there are "two peoples, one superior and the other inferior" – would it be necessary to ensure Jewish supremacy. Read the full article.  Chemi Shalev conjures up a nightmarish scenario of post-nation state Israel. He envisions a future in which the judiciary has been emasculated and hundreds of thousands of Arabs have been deprived of voting rights and forced to wear small green crescents on each sleeve – "for their own safety as well as that of the Jews." "We've come a long way since we legislated the Jewish nation-state law back in 2014," says the prime minister, "but we still have a long way to go.” Read the full article.  	"The year 2014 has been one of the worst that the State of Israel has ever known," writes Uzi Baram. "This is the year that the hatred, racism and aspirations for Jewish exclusivity crawled out of their holes." He points to the November 2012 removal of Benny Begin – a man who was "loyal to parliamentary democracy and respected the legal system" – from the Likud slate in as the moment at which the alarm bells started ringing – though they went largely unheard at the time.

<title>Three EU powers draft Security Council resolution on Israeli-Palestinian deal</title>
<date>Wed Dec 03 23:59:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	The three leading European Union countries, France, Germany and Britain, are drafting a UN Security Council resolution outlining the principles of an Israeli-Palestinian final-status deal and setting a two-year timetable for completing negotiations on such an agreement.
	Senior Israeli diplomats familiar with the draft resolution’s provisions said the Europeans have also briefed Washington on it.
	The Israeli diplomats, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue, said the move was initially led by France, a permanent member of the Security Council. Over the last two weeks, however, the French have managed to persuade both Britain – another permanent Security Council member – and Germany. The latter isn’t on the Security Council, but its support is important due to both its international influence and its close ties with Israel.
	The EU draft is meant to serve as a counterweight to an extreme, one-sided resolution drafted by the Palestinians, which is being backed by the Arab League and formally sponsored at the Security Council by Jordan. The Palestinian draft calls for an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank within two years and the immediate acceptance of Palestine as a full UN member. The Palestinians would like their resolution brought to a vote in the second half of December, before the Christmas holiday.
	These UN moves come at a particularly bad time for Israel, given that the government has just fallen and an election campaign has begun. Moreover, a diplomatic crisis over such a Security Council resolution is liable to focus the election campaign on the Israeli-Palestinian issue and push Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, due to pressure from his right-leaning electorate, into more extreme retaliatory measures against the Palestinian Authority.
	Netanyahu is very worried about both the Palestinian and the European initiatives, but hasn’t managed to formulate a strategy to preempt them. His poor relations with both Europe and Washington make it harder to either thwart the Palestinian proposal or soften the European one to bring it closer to Israel’s positions.
	It’s not yet clear to what extent the recent political developments in Israel will affect either the Palestinian or the European timetable. Senior PA officials said their effort to push their own resolution wouldn’t be affected. “It’s impossible to freeze everything and wait for Netanyahu to fall, since after the election, perhaps the negotiations won’t be about a Palestinian state, but about an apartheid plan,” one said.
	The French, British and Germans want to present a more balanced resolution that could serve as a basis for renewed Israeli-Palestinian talks and win American backing. Thus, for instance, the European draft doesn’t call for immediately recognizing Palestine as a full UN member. Moreover, it allots two years for final-status negotiations and envisions an Israeli withdrawal beginning only after that.
	But the three European powers still haven’t agreed among themselves on all the issues. There’s a consensus on calling for a Palestinian state based on the 1967 lines, with territorial swaps. But there’s an argument over whether the resolution should address the issue of Israel being the nation-state of the Jewish people – a clause Germany is pushing to include.
	Over the past week, French, British and German diplomats have held talks at UN headquarters in New York with the Palestinians, Jordanians and representatives of other Arab states in an effort to come up with a mutually acceptable draft. But so far, the Palestinians oppose the European proposal and insist on advancing their own.
	Israeli diplomats said their impression is that the Palestinians want to advance their extreme draft in order to isolate the United States and force U.S. President Barack Obama to veto it. But senior Palestinian official involved in the talks with the Europeans rejected the claim that PA President Mahmoud Abbas opposes any European initiative or wants a confrontation with America.
	“Our insistence stems from one simple reason, which is that in every conversation we’ve had with the Americans and Europeans so far, we haven’t heard a proposal that could meet the Palestinians’ minimum demands,” one said.
	The Palestinians’ impression from their talks with the Europeans, one PA official added, is that Germany is trying to soften the European draft by eliminating the fixed timetable – which would instead simply lead to another round of talks that could last for years. “We can’t accept a draft that doesn’t include agreement on the border and a timetable for ending the occupation,” he said.
	French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has briefed U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on the European initiative, but the Americans aren’t yet actively involved in the negotiations over its wording. Israeli diplomats said the Americans’ position on the European proposal is unclear, and it seems they haven’t yet made a decision.
	The Americans very much want to avoid casting a veto on any resolution relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, due to their efforts to forge a coalition of Arab states against the Islamic State. And Israeli diplomats noted that the European resolution would be even harder for the Americans to veto than the Palestinian one.
	Some people in the U.S. administration, headed by Kerry, are even considering submitting an American resolution to the Security Council, but the White House currently opposes this. Right now, Obama and his team want to focus on their negotiations with Iran and the war against the Islamic State rather embarking on a new Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative.
	Netanyahu is very worried about both the Palestinian and the European initiatives, but hasn’t managed to formulate a strategy to preempt them.

<title>West Bank settlement expansion surged under Netanyahu</title>
<date>Mon Dec 15 16:04:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	The population of Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank has surged during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's years in office, growing at more than twice the pace of Israel's overall population, according to newly obtained official figures.
 Settlement growth also was strong beyond Israel's separation barrier, seen by many as the basis for a border between Israel and a future Palestinian state.
	The figures reflect Netanyahu's continued support for settlement construction, even while repeatedly stating his commitment to the eventual establishment of an independent Palestinian state as part of a future peace agreement. They also could be a topic of discussion as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry meets with Netanyahu and European officials this week over a promised UN Security Council proposal dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
	While Israeli leaders of all political persuasions have built settlements for decades, the U.S. and western allies have dwindling patience for their construction.
	From the beginning of 2009 until the beginning of 2014 — Netanyahu returned to office in March 2009 — the Jewish settler population in the West Bank grew 23 percent, to 355,993 people. In comparison, the overall population has grown 9.6 percent to just over 8 million in that time. Figures for 2014 are not expected before late next year.
	The rate of settler population growth slowed slightly under Netanyahu, from 31 percent during the previous five years under his predecessors Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert. Olmert especially took relatively little heat for the settlements because he was seen as a moderate.
	In all, the settler population has more than doubled in the 21 years since Israel and the Palestinians have been engaged in an on-and-off peace process aimed at a partition of the Holy Land.
	Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and prime ministers of all political affiliations have allowed and sometimes encouraged settlement of the territory.
	The Palestinians claim the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip for their future state. They say all Israeli construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem is illegal — a position with wide international support. Israel withdrew all its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005.
	In a situation that challenges Israel's claims to being a democracy, the more than 2 million Palestinians in the West Bank cannot vote for the Israeli government that controls much of their lives, while Jewish settlers can.
	Netanyahu repeatedly has drawn U.S. ire with controversial construction plans. Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon suggested last week that the government would have liked to do more if not for the U.S. pressure.
	"We are very, very careful not to push the envelope too much," Yaalon said. "This (U.S.) administration won't be around forever and I hope it is temporary." Even so, he boasted that settlements are growing faster than "any other part of the country."
	The figures, which come from Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, confirm Yaalon's claims. Netanyahu's office declined to comment on the figures ahead of a possible U.N. Security Council vote this week a resolution setting a November 2016 deadline for ending Israeli occupation. Another proposal, by France, would set a time limit of two years for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
	Shortly after taking office, Netanyahu gave a landmark speech endorsing Palestinian statehood, reversing his previous opposition. But his government has refused to stop settlement construction, with the exception of a 10-month period in 2009 and 2010 that was meant to spur peace talks. U.S.-brokered negotiations since have collapsed.
	Netanyahu never has said where he envisions a final border, but he has indicated that Israel must at the minimum retain the settlement "blocs," a term that usually refers to communities inside the separation barrier.
	The barrier stretches beyond the internationally-recognized pre-1967 Israeli borders, encompassing nearly a tenth of the West Bank. Israelis see that as a practical effort to incorporate most Jewish settlers, mitigating the difficult task of removing settlers as part of a peace partition. The Palestinians have suggested they would accept such an idea if they were compensated for the territory with land swaps.
	Construction beyond the barrier complicates any future pullout. Past experience in removing settlers — from Egypt's Sinai desert in the early 1980s and from Gaza in 2005 — suggests many would try to resist. The number of settlers living beyond the barrier line, according to the new numbers, is about 10 times greater than the settler population of Gaza — nearly 82,000 settlers at the beginning of 2014, compared to about 68,000 five years before.
	If the settlements beyond the barrier make partition impossible, Israel could one day face a scenario in which Palestinians demand equal rights within a single state, which would force it to choose between being a Jewish state and a democracy.
	The settlement growth is roughly the same on both sides of the separation barrier, with the anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now identifying growth rates of 23 percent inside the barrier and 20 percent beyond it.
	"We are seeing construction growth throughout the entire West Bank," said Lior Amihai, a Peace Now researcher. "This indicates government policy."
	He said that even when factoring in the higher birthrate of the settler population, which tends to be more religious, the settlement growth rate is higher because of the nonstop construction.
	The ultra-Orthodox settlement of Beitar Illit, for example, grew 29 percent during the five-year period. The population of Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox city inside Israel, grew 14 percent.
	Another complication is the settlement of Ariel, which has grown into a town of over 18,000 people. Even though it is in the middle of the northern West Bank, many Israelis consider it to be part of the blocs, something Palestinians reject. Including Ariel, more than 100,000 settlers would potentially have to be evacuated.
	Netanyahu "is a prime minister for settlements," senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said. "His aim was to destroy the two-state solution. He wants the concept of one state, two systems — apartheid."

<title>Israel elections updates / Knesset boosts security around Eli Yishai</title>

 Haaretz's latest political analyses and opinions: Israeli Arabs, don't give the Jewish State your vote | A Herzog-Livni upset? Only in your dreams | Curtain coming down on Netanyahu’s rule
 Latest updates:
 3:26 P.M. Election Opinions
	As long as the Israeli government is built on Jewish ethnic purity, the Knesset has nothing to offer Israel’s Arab citizens. The Arab MKs merely serve as a fig leaf that covers the nakedness of Israeli apartheid. Consequently, Arab citizens should boycott the election, argues Salman Masahala. Read full opinion here
	While no one doubts that what Israel needs is a moderate, democratic leadership, the public does not want such a government; it is not yet ripe for a complete end to settlement construction or border adjustments, Tal Niv writes. Read full opinion here
	One of the most critical tasks facing whatever government is elected in March will be to impose order on the Education Ministry and reexamine its criteria for allocating funds, today's Haaretz Editorial says. Read full editorial here
 9:13 A.M. Knesset boosts security around Eli Yishai
	The Knesset has boosted security around Eli Yishai, in addition to a body guard already assigned to him. The decision came in reaction to scuffles that broke out between his supporters and the supporters of his political rival, Aryeh Deri, after Yishai announced his was breaking away from Shas. (Yair Ettinger)
 00:10 A.M. Kahlon declines Lapid's joint ticket 
	In an attempt to set up a second centrist block, Yair Lapid, the leader of Yesh Atid, met with Kulanu's Moshe Kahlon on Monday evening and proposed joining the parties into a unified ticket- and was declined.
	Both Yesh Atid and Kulanu declined to comment on the meeting's content. Lapid, whose party is expected to be cut half in size after the upcoming elections, has been in recent weeks working to set up understandings with both Kahlon and Lieberman's Yisrael Beitenu- but both have made it clear they have no interest in such a move.
	Before meeting with Kahlon, Lapid conducted a series of polls relating to the prospects of a joint ticket. According to the estimations put forth by Yesh Atid sources, both Yesh Atid and Kahlon's Kulanu would benefit significantly from a joint ticket - and, if running together, would be candidates for the task of assembling the next coalition.
	But these conclusions have been met with a degree of doubt by Kahlon's team. Other polls suggest Kulanu would suffer from joining forces with Lapid.
	In any case, Kahlon's party has made it clear no intentions to join any block exist. But sources who spoke with Kahlon in recent days told Haaretz that while "on the formal level, Kahlon is unequivocally refusing to join forces with any other party - he is definitely flirting with the idea. He doesn't have enough money to manage a significant campaign, and if he does end up joining Yesh Atid or Yisrael Beitenu, it will be in order to benefit from the massive budgets that they have at their disposal, for an effective campaign."
	Along with the fiscal problems, Kahlon is having trouble assembling his new party's human line-up, the sources said. "Kahlon is surrently the only one who can promise his candidates ministerial roles; his party is turning out to be the only one that is certain to join any government that will be set up after the elections – be it helmed by Netanyahu or by Herzog. Kahlon won't sit in the opposition. And despite this, many good people have got offers from him, and walked on."
	Kahlon himself stated at a Monday conference that "contrary to the rumors, there is still no list of part members." (Jonathan Lis)

<title>Meridor: I won't be the Likud's detergent</title>
<date>Thu Dec 18 22:24:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	Former Likud minister Dan Meridor launched a broadside against his old party on Thursday, strongly criticizing its promotion of the nation-state bill and its incitement against asylum seekers.
	Meridor, who served as justice minister under Yitzhak Shamir and finance minister under Benjamin Netanyahu, stressed that he had no intention of being part of the Likud list for the upcoming elections.	"Netanyahu won't call me and he knows why," Meridor said, during an interview on the Knesset Channel.
	"When I hear from the party that Arabs have human rights but not civil rights … when I hear that certain people are a cancer, when I hear statements that I don't even want to repeat, could I really be their detergent and represent them?"
	"No. If the party were to return to its historical path, national-liberal and not nationalistic, I would be happy to continue being part of it."
	In a separate interview on Channel 10's "London and Kirschenbaum" program, Meridor criticized the current diplomatic standstill and called on Netanyahu to advance negotiations with the Palestinians.
	"Israel doesn't lead, doesn't initiate," Meridor said. "We can't close our eyes to what is happening in Europe. They're talking, parliament after parliament, about a Palestinian state. After all, Netanyahu is in favor of a state; that's what he says. But he wants it to be agreed in negotiations that will lead to an agreement. So why oppose the idea of a state? I think we should bring a resolution to the Security Council that we are in favor of negotiations."
	Two issues should be central to negotiations with the Palestinians, Meridor said: "The '67 borders with adjustments and no return [of Palestinian refugees] to Israel. That's what we should propose. If [the Palestinians] oppose it because it denies the right of return, the world will know where the problem lies. If they support it, it will be an historic upheaval."
	Meridor also criticized the building of settlements, saying "our actions talk, not our words, because we allow settlement everywhere. Most Likud members, as well as [Habayit Hayehudi leader Naftali] Bennett and others say that there won't be a Palestinian state, so the world asks, 'well, what do you want then?' We damage ourselves."
	Last year, Meridor attacked his former Likud colleagues for promoting legislation that discriminated against Arabs and refugees, saying that they were promoting apartheid policies.
	"The only thing that interests them is the territories," he said. "Human rights, democracy, equality – none of those exist for them."

<title>2009: A woman who didn’t embarrass South Africa dies</title>
<date>Thu Jan 01 06:00:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
	On January 1, 2009, Helen Suzman, who in her 36 years in the South African parliament fought for the peaceful overthrow of apartheid, died at the age of 91.
	During an especially difficult 13-year period, Suzman was her Progressive Party’s only serving member. (For six of those years, she was also the only woman in the lower house of parliament, the House of Assembly.) But she persisted, enduring the condescending and sometimes racist and anti-Semitic comments of her colleagues, and retired only when it was clear that the battle against apartheid was over.
	Helen Gavronsky was born on November 7, 1917, in Germiston, a small mining town outside Johannesburg. Her parents, Samuel Gavronsky and the former Frieda David, were Lithuanian Jews who came to South Africa in the early years of the 20th century. Frieda died two weeks after Helen, her second daughter, was born.
	Samuel, a prosperous meat merchant, remarried when Helen was 9 and the family moved to Parktown, a comfortable Johannesburg suburb.
	The Suzmans were traditional in their Jewish observance, though Helen attended the Parktown Convent school.
	Helen began studying economics and statistics at the University of the Witwatersrand in 1934. Three years later, at 19, she dropped out and married Moses Meyer Suzman, a cardiologist 13 years her senior. They had two daughters and remain together until his death, in 1994.
 For the people with no vote
	After returning to and graduating from Witwatersrand, Suzman worked as a statistician at the War Supplies Board. In 1945 she began teaching economic history at Wits, a job she held until she entered parliament in 1953.
	Her entrée into politics was sparked by her research for a government commission examining the economic conditions of the black African population. When the National Party came to power, in 1948, and South Africa formally adopted a policy of racial separation, Suzman became involved in the United Party, then the official opposition, in the hope of fostering change.
	In 1953, Suzman entered the House of Assembly, representing the Johannesburg district of Houghton. She also became what she later described as an “honorary ombudsman for all those people who have no vote and no Member of Parliament” — that is, for all non-white South Africans.
	In her commitment to using democratic means only to end apartheid, Suzman differed from the African National Congress, led by Nelson Mandela, which was willing to use violence. From 1967 she was a regular visitor to the imprisoned Mandela, who was released only in 1990 and who told a reporter that “this courageous woman” was the “first and only woman ever to grace our cells.”
 No egg on her face
	In 1959, with the United Party becoming more supportive of apartheid, Suzman and 11 other MPs broke away to form the Progressive Party. (In 1977, after merging with the Reform Party, it became the Progressive Federal Party.) From 1961 to 1974, Suzman was the party’s only MP.
	She used her status — and immunity from prosecution — as a legislator to badger the government and keep the facts of apartheid in the public eye. When one cabinet minister chided her in parliament for her regular inquiries, saying, “You put these questions just to embarrass South Africa overseas,” Suzman famously replied, “It is not my question that embarrasses South Africa — it is your answers.”
	Suzman never saw herself as a spokesman for the Jews, but was open and proud of her Jewish heritage and supportive of Israel. But she was critical of the organized Jewish community for the refusal of its Board of Deputies to take a stand against apartheid.
	In 1989, when it became clear that the country’s new president, Frederik W. de Klerk, was ready to take the necessary steps to end apartheid, Suzman, then 71, announced her retirement from politics. Over the next 20 years, before her death on this day in 2009, she remained active in public life and did not hesitate to criticize the ruling ANC when she judged its conduct to be illegal or undemocratic.

<title>Aboriginal leader identifies with Jewish suffering on Holocaust Day </title>
<date>Thu Jan 29 16:54:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
	On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Jews from the Auschwitz death camp, the chairman of Australia's first and largest community-controlled Aboriginal health service expressed his people's identification with "the injustice wrought on the Jewish community," the organization announced.
	“Aboriginal leader William Cooper was advocating for the rights of Jews long before other many Australians – including, to our shame, our government - began to lend support to the Jewish cause,” said Sol Bellear, chairman of the Aboriginal Medical Service Redfern. “The reason why was simple: William Cooper and many of his contemporaries knew then, just as Aboriginal people still know today, how the sting of persecution and oppression feels. That’s why William Cooper began speaking up in the 1930s, and it’s why Aboriginal people today still speak up.”
	Israel has honored Cooper for his Israel advocacy on several occasions, planting trees in his honor at the Forest of the Martyrs and honoring his memory at the Yad VaShem Holocaust Museum.
	“The Liberation of Jewish people from Auschwitz is a very important moment in world history, and the Aboriginal Medical Service Redfern acknowledges its importance not only to our own community, but to the broader Australian community,” Bellear said.
	He said Aboriginal Australians, despite never being afforded their own self-determination, had a long history of confronting injustice, such as protesting against Apartheid South Africa.
	“Bad things happen when good people stay silent, and the history of Aboriginal people advocating for the oppressed is long and well established, and that’s something for which everyone in the Aboriginal community should be rightly proud,” added Bellear.

<title>Durban university student council issues call to expel Jewish students</title>
<date>Thu Feb 12 20:00:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
	The student council at the Durban University of Technology has called on the South African school to expel all Jewish students, particularly those who don't back the Palestinian cause, according to press reports in the country.
	“As the SRC, we had a meeting and analyzed international politics," the council secretary, Mqondisi Duma, was quoted by Independent Online and other outlets as saying.
	"We took the decision that Jewish students, especially those who do not support the Palestinian struggle, should deregister.”
	The university's vice chancellor, Ahmed Bawa, said in a statement quoted by the South African Jewish Report that the demand was "totally preposterous, unjust, unfair, unreasonable and unconstitutional.
	"It’s in violation of our values and principles. [The university] does not discriminate against any person based on their race, religion, color, ethnicity, sexual orientation or political affiliation.”
	Jewish groups also weighed in on the student-council request.
	Independent Online quoted the chairwoman of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, Mary Kluk, as saying she was “appalled,” and Natan Pollack, national chairman of the South African Union of Jewish Students, as calling the proposal “deplorable."
	On his Facebook page, Duma posted a statement from the student council, saying that the panel "apologizes without reservation to any one offended by recent demands made by us regarding Jewish students."
	He then said that the council wished to "clarify that our position is, in fact, that Israel is an Apartheid, genocidal and terrorist State and that in solidarity with our Palestinian people who are currently oppressed and colonized by Israel we demand that ANY student Jewish, Muslim, Christian even Atheist or any other that is funded by the Apartheid State of Israel and its institutions must not be students in DUT, and if there are any, they must be immediately de-registered.
	"Our campuses will not be breeding grounds for Apartheid.
	"The SRC at DUT furthermore ... has adopted a full and complete cultural and academic boycott of Israel in line with the international boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against Israel movement." 
	Durban was the reference point of three conferences on racism, in 2001 in Durban, 2009 in Geneva and 2011 in New York. The conventions were criticized for promoting anti-Semitism.

<title>South African BDS protesters threaten to kill Jews</title>
<date>Tue Mar 10 17:16:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
Johannesburg, SOUTH AFRICA — Protesters chanted anti-Semitic slogans and threatened to kill Jews outside a South African Zionist Federation event in Johannesburg on Sunday. “You think this is Israel, we are going to kill you!” and “You Jews do not belong here in South Africa!” supporters of the BDS movement shouted in front of the Sandton Convention Centre, where the South Africa-Israel Expo and a federation conference was being held. They were joined by protesters in African National Congress and South African Communist Party T-shirts. Together, they disrupted traffic in the city’s business and financial center.
ANC officials and figures from the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement took turns addressing the crowd from atop a small truck protest organizers had parked outside the convention hall.
“At one point a man got on the truck and said that as a Jew he was calling on other Jews to stop apartheid in Palestine,” a man who said he had come from Pretoria to attend the trade expo told Haaretz, adding, “The protesters were pushing security staff stationed outside the conference center. It was shocking.”
Security officers blocking the main entrance directed people leaving the event to exit through the attached shopping mall, out of concern for their safety.
It is “every South African citizen’s constitutional right to attend events of our choosing without fear of intimidation,” the South African Jewish Board of Deputies said in a statement.
“From the outset, it was clear that the aim of the demonstration, in the protesters’ own words, was to ‘shut down Sandton’ and ensure ‘no Zionist conference be held on our soil,’” board of deputies chairwoman Mary Kluk said, adding, “When their attempts at doing so failed, it became apparent that the rally was nothing more than a front to stoke up Jew-hatred in South Africa.”
The national coordinator of BDS South Africa, Muhammed Desai, told Haaretz that claims the protesters made anti-Semitic remarks were “utter nonsense.”
“Typical of the board of deputies to play the anti-Semitism card,” Desai said. “If there was any anti-Semitism it should have been reported to local authorities. That the board hasn’t lodged any complaints shows their bluff. They are trying to distract from the fact that they are defending an apartheid Israeli regime.”
The event marked the end of Israeli Apartheid Week, which saw several events organized by BDS and affiliate groups at South African university campuses and other venues.
Last week, an address by prominent Palestinian human rights activist Bassem Eid at the University of Johannesburg, organized by the South African Union of Jewish Students, was forced to end early due to BDS protesters, according to the board of deputies.
Eid, a vocal critic of BDS and Israeli Apartheid Week, is the founder and executive director of the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group. He was escorted to safety by campus security officers after students climbed onto the stage; one stuck his fingers into Eid’s nose.
In a video clip, posted to the Stop the BDS Facebook page, a Muslim student who attended the event registered her shock and disgust with the behavior and messages of the BDS protesters in the audience. “These people are not Muslims, they are barbarians,” cried the young woman, who wore hijab.
Laundering Jew-hatred
 
Canadian MP and human rights lawyer Irwin Cotler, who was active in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa and represented Natan Sharansky, now the chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel, while he was a prisoner in the Soviet gulag, spoke at the opening of the Zionist federation conference Saturday night.
He railed against what he called the laundering of anti-Semitism using the language and tools of the universal struggle for human rights.
“Criticism of Israel is not anti-Semitism,” Cotler said. “But singling out Israel for selective opprobrium and condemnation, or denying Israel’s right to exist and calling for its destruction, is discriminatory and hateful, and not saying so is destructive. To compare Israel with South African apartheid shames the real anti-apartheid struggle.”
Other speakers at the event included Sharansky, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat and Israeli Ambassador to South Africa Arthur Lenk.
Lenk praised the local Jewish community for its support of Israel, and contrasted the charity events it organizes with recent BDS events featuring appearances by Palestinian airplane hijacker Leila Khaled.
Johannesburg’s The Star newspaper reported that some of the protesters bused in by BDS on Sunday did not know what exactly they were protesting.
“I can’t say I know why I’m here,” they quoted one protester as saying. The South African Communist Party “called me to say there was an event in Sandton and buses were available. I don’t know why we are here, who we are supporting and against who.”

<title>Student councils of 5 South African universities join BDS campaign</title>
<date>Mon May 04 20:02:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
	The student councils of five South African universities decided Monday to join an academic boycott of what they refer to as "Apartheid Israel," and said they will be pressuring their institutions to implement the boycott.
	"The Israeli regime is proving itself to be anti-children, anti-student and anti-education," student council presidents of the universities said in a statement.
	Many opponents of the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign have said BDS is just another form of age-old anti-Semitism, a criticism the five South African universities – the University of South Africa, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Durban University of Technology, Mangasutho University of Technology and the University of the Western Cape – sought to defuse.
	"Conflating criticism of Israel's colonial policies of Occupation and Apartheid can not and should not be equated with anti-Semitism," the statement said.
	The five student councils said they would be auditing their universities' investment funds and service providers "to ensure that companies that are in violation of the BDS call and complicit in the Israeli Occupation" will be excluded from investment funds and service contracts.
	They said they would also be supporting the Israeli Apartheid Week initiative, a collection of international events aimed at raising awareness of Israel's policies toward the Palestinians and building support for BDS, and joining the call for a conference in South Africa about boycotting Israel.
	The decision came shortly after South Africa's minister of higher education, Blade Nzimande, called for a boycott of Israeli academic institutions last month after Israel refused him an entry visa, saying he is radically anti-Israel and was planning to visit the Palestinian Authority rather than Israel.
	In February the student council at the Durban University of Technology called on the school to expel all Jewish students, particularly those who don't back the Palestinian cause, according to press reports in the country.
	In 2011 the South African Union of Students, which represents all university student councils in the country, urged a widespread boycott of Israel.	That year, the University of Johannesburg ended its relationship with Israel's Ben-Gurion University. The University of the Witwatersrand joined the boycott in 2012 and the University of Cape Town took part last year.

<title>On U.S. campuses, when does ‘anti-Israel’ become anti-Semitic?</title>
<date>Sat May 23 01:45:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
JTA - Liana Kadisha, a senior at Stanford University, says some Jewish students on her campus feel they have to hide who they are. The 22-year-old knows of several who tuck their Star of David necklaces inside their shirts, self-conscious about drawing attention to their Jewish identity.
That’s not the only worry for Jews at the bucolic Palo Alto campus.
Last month, Molly Horwiz, a Jewish candidate for the Stanford student senate, found herself grilled by members of a campus club who questioned her ability to think independently because of her “Jewish identity,” she said. Days later, vandals painted swastikas on a Stanford frat house.
Those incidents followed a student senate debate over an Israel divestment resolution in February. The bill passed on a second vote, after failing in a first round.
“The night of the first vote, one of the pro-divestment students got up and shouted ‘Long live the intifada’ and stormed out of the room,” Kadisha recalled. “That was extremely disturbing.”
After the resolution passed, more than 150 current and former faculty members and researchers signed an open letter condemning the “single-minded ferocity” of the divest-from-Israel campaign on their campus. Its goal, the letter claimed, “wasn’t to open up discussion on these complex matters but to dictate simple, outright excoriation.”
Steven Zipperstein, a Stanford professor of Jewish culture and history, helped craft the letter, telling J. in March that the tenor of the campus debate on Israel was worrying.
“I understand why Israeli politics would enrage,” he said in March. “I’m enraged by many of the politics in Israel. But the fact that outrage against Israeli politics is the one issue that captured more attention at Stanford than any other political issue in the last 30 years, as stated by our president — that’s bizarre.”
Anti-Semitic incidents 
Something bad is happening on American campuses, and it’s not unrelated to the anti-Israel boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. A survey by the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law found that 54 percent of Jewish college students experienced or witnessed anti-Semitism on their campuses during the 2013-14 school year, including incidents of harassment, violence or a “hostile environment.”
Incidents can range from swastikas scrawled on frat houses to student committees questioning whether Jewish students are fit to serve in student government. The latter occurred earlier this year at UCLA as well as Stanford, though university administrators immediately intervened in both cases and the inquisitorial students apologized.
It could be worse. At a university in Durban, South Africa, one student government body called for the expulsion of all Jewish students on the chance they could be Zionists.
In this country, experts agree, such incidents tend to occur on campuses with an active BDS presence.
BDS' true aim?
On its face, the BDS movement formally organized in 2005 to oppose Israel’s policies toward the Palestinians. The idea is to put political and economic pressure on Israel, publicly, in order to force an end to the occupation, among other stated goals. Tactics include  boycotting goods made in Israel or the settlements; barring Israeli academics from international conferences and pressuring international artists and scholars not to visit Israel; and, on campus, putting forward student resolutions asking universities to divest holdings in companies that do business with Israel.
However, BDS critics — including some who are critical of Israeli government policies — believe the movement’s true aim is not to pressure Israel, but to eradicate it.
As former Harvard President Larry Summers once said of BDS, it is “anti-Semitic in effect if not intent.”
“[BDS] is a concerted campaign by people who seek the elimination of the State of Israel,” said Rabbi Doug Khan, executive director of the S.F.-based Jewish Community Relations Council. “At the very least, it’s a nonviolent means to a violent end.”
Critics of BDS link the movement to overtly anti-Semitic activity, pointing, for example, to swastika graffiti that emerges after divestment bills are passed — or not passed. Jewish supporters of BDS dismiss these charges, calling them desperation tactics by pro-Israel advocates who want to shut down any criticism of Israel.
“There’s no evidence of any kind that [swastika graffiti] has anything to do with the Palestinian solidarity movement,” said Rabbi Alissa Wise, co-director of organizing for the Oakland-based Jewish Voice for Peace, which endorses BDS. “It’s sloppy and unethical to suggest a connection. [Pro-Israel activists] use [anti-Semitism] to deflect a conversation about what is happening inside Israel, over policies that are discriminatory, violent and deny basic human rights to Palestinians.”
It is true that the vandals who scrawled swastikas at Stanford last month and on the walls of a Jewish fraternity at U.C. Davis in January have never been caught, and no one knows their motives.
But sentinels on the lookout for anti-Semitism believe the BDS movement must accept its share of blame for the increase in incidents and overheated rhetoric. They say the movement hides its true agenda, which they contend is anti-Semitic at its core.
Correlation is not causation. But when it comes to BDS and anti-Jewish rhetoric, some Jewish community watchdogs see the two overlapping too often.
'Zionist Nazis'
Seth Brysk, Central Pacific regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, makes his living detecting anti-Semitism. The ADL does not level the charge or use the term lightly, he says, but BDS matches the description.
“The positions of BDS leaders advocating the unqualified right of return of all Palestinian refugees [to Israel], a one-state solution, would lead to the demise of Israel as a Jewish state,” Brysk said. “People who advocate that promote an idea that at its core is anti-Semitic.”
Though he concedes that not everyone involved in BDS is anti-Semitic, Brysk cites examples of supporters using incendiary rhetoric, expropriating Nazi terminology to describe Israel and Israelis. For example, he says, some BDS adherents charge Israel with perpetrating a “holocaust” against Palestinians, and he points to a new anti-Israel term du jour — Zizis, short for Zionist Nazis, used to describe Israelis and their supporters.
Even when activists temper their rhetoric, Brysk says the BDS movement makes anti-Semitic acts and speech “acceptable and more inevitable,” creating an atmosphere that normalizes anti-Jewish behavior.
“It takes an extremely one-sided approach to a complex problem,” he added, “and rather than really engage in peaceful protest, it’s a disingenuous and prejudiced movement.” Roz Rothstein, founder and director of the pro-Israel nonprofit StandWithUs, employs a litmus test to determine whether criticism of Israel veers into anti-Semitic speech: the “three Ds” of delegitimization, demonization and double standard. Those are key parts of the State Department’s official definition of anti-Semitism.
“If you apply the three Ds, you can see that [BDS] does qualify,” Rothstein said. “The movement targets [only] Israel, blaming it for the lack of peace. The movement conveniently does not discuss its goal, which is not peaceful coexistence."
Rothstein points to some of the more extreme examples of imagery seen in anti-Israel protests: posters that replace the six-pointed Jewish star with a swastika, blood-spattered Israeli flags, or political cartoons that contort Israeli leaders into hook-nosed ghouls out of the pages of the Nazi propaganda sheet Der Stürmer.
“The Jewish star to the Jewish people signifies their religion,” she said. “It’s very scary. People don’t understand how egregious this is.”
Such imagery may disturb, but the First Amendment protects anti-Jewish speech, no matter how hateful. And there is little university administrators can do to stop it, one of them notes.
“I’m a First Amendment maven,” said Mark Yudof, the former president of the University of California and a professor of constitutional law. An ardent supporter of Israel who is active in the Bay Area Jewish community, Yudof says that in no way diminishes his stance on this issue. “I believe in free speech. I honestly believe people can be highly critical of Israel and not be anti-Semitic. It’s painting with too broad a brush to say everyone who doesn’t agree with you on policy toward Israel is tarred and feathered with anti-Semitism.”
Still, though he defended free speech and peaceful protest during his tenure as U.C. president, Yudof always found the BDS movement and its agenda contemptible.
“You get suspicious sometimes,” he said. “I’ve listened to the narratives. Sometimes it’s not that Israel is wrong or it should do this or that. The [BDS] narrative is that Jews are too powerful, too privileged, have too much influence with Congress and the media. It strikes me as containing an anti-Semitic element.”
Yudof once met with indignant pro-Palestinian students, who told him he was wrong to defend the free speech rights of Israel supporters because “the First Amendment is only for marginalized people, and not privileged people like Jews.”
The danger of being pro-Israel
If anyone is marginalized, Tammi Rossman-Benjamin would say it is the pro-Israel college student. The U.C. Santa Cruz Jewish studies lecturer and co-founder of the Amcha Initiative, which combats anti-Semitism on campus, believes that sticking up for Israel has grown dangerous.
The nonprofit’s website has a tracker monitoring anti-Semitic incidents on campus. Since January 2014, the tracker has logged 29 incidents of swastika graffiti on or near American campuses, among them U.C. Berkeley, U.C. Davis and Stanford.
“It’s becoming more clear, more explicit every day,” she said of the link between BDS and anti-Semitism. “What used to be Israel Apartheid Week is now called Anti-Zionism Week. No more ‘Let’s criticize the policies of the government of Israel.’ Now it becomes opposition to Israel’s very existence.”
And since making Israel disappear would require the disappearance of seven million Israeli Jews, that would amount to anti-Semitism, Rossman-Benjamin argues.
“There is a certain hostile environment for Jewish students who identify with the Jewish state,” she said. “So when there are divestment resolutions, you have a climate that is actually toxic. It spills over into acts against Jews. In the minds of those carrying out BDS activities, it’s about the Jews, the Jewish state, and the Jews who support the Jewish state. It can’t be a coincidence.”
Pro-BDS Jews
Jews who are active in BDS say their very presence in the movement disproves the charges of anti-Semitism.
“You have StandWithUs and Amcha that use a claim of anti-Semitism as a political weapon,” said JVP’s Wise. “That desensitizes people to actual incidents of anti-Semitism and makes it harder for those of us concerned with Jewish safety and anti-Jewish oppression to counteract and address it. To me it reads as a last-gasp attempt to maintain the status quo of Israeli right-wing policy.
”Gabi Kirk, 24, echoes Wise’s sentiments. A San Jose native and former counselor at Camp Tawonga, Kirk most recently served as the campus liaison for JVP. Though she left the organization last month, she still agrees with its criticism of Israeli policy and considers BDS a legitimate tactic.
Not only does she believe BDS is not inherently anti-Semitic, she thinks the status quo the Israeli government maintains in the Palestinian territories incites anti-Jewish sentiment more than any campus campaign could do.
“We believe ultimately that occupation, militarization and systems of apartheid harm everyone,” Kirk said. “They harm Jews by eroding moral values and pitting people against each other.”
Kirk said any time she encounters anti-Semitism from within the BDS movement on campus, she calls it out. When someone spouts anti-Semitic tropes, she tries to explain that their actions are no different from Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry. “Anti-Semitism exists,” she added. “We don’t deny that.”
Kahn says JCRC works to combat BDS on campus. But the organization also wages the fight in other arenas, such as liberal Protestant denominations, labor unions, and even grocery stores.
He cites past victories, such as persuading Sonoma County not to cancel a contract for buses made by a company that does business with Israel, and convincing San Francisco’s Rainbow Grocery co-op to resume stocking Israeli goods, which had been targeted for boycott.
But he concedes the battle is growing tougher. Kahn estimates the number of pro-BDS organizations in the Bay Area has risen from 60 to 130 in the past five years. Outside some campus actions, Kahn says one of the most notorious local anti-Semitic incidents was last summer’s Block the Boat campaign at the Port of Oakland, which turned away an Israeli-owned cargo ship under the banner “Zionism is not welcome in Oakland.”
A thin line
To Kahn it’s a short hop, skip and jump to a banner that one day could read “Zionists not welcome in Oakland.”
The JCRC counter-strategy has been to expose extremism. In 2010, the pro-Palestinian Christian organization Sabeel, which promotes church divestment from Israel and companies that work with Israel, held its biennial in San Anselmo, with more than 450 attendees and dozens of sponsors. Kahn says the thrust of the conference was to advocate for BDS.
“They had many speakers who wanted to see no Israel,” he recalled. “We sent a large delegation, not to make waves but to attend every session.” JCRC then shared what it heard at those sessions with sponsors, which led to many pulling their sponsorships from the next conference after “we exposed how extreme [the organization] was.”
As for BDS on campus, Kahn acknowledges that anti-Semitism likely does not animate a majority of activists, but he worries anyway. As a textbook case he points to the chain of events at U.C. Davis, which passed an Israel divestment resolution in January, immediately followed by a Facebook posting from one of the bill’s proponents claiming “Sharia law has come to Davis” and the swastika scrawled on a Jewish fraternity.
“The vitriol injected by the BDS movement, the repetitious espousal of hate for Israel and its supporters, potentially creates an atmosphere in which an individual may get his or her wires crossed and engage in a blatantly anti-Semitic act, such as painting a swastika,” Kahn said.
“Whoever perpetrated the act ultimately bears responsibility. By the same token, people who so readily create a hostile atmosphere for pro-Israel and Jewish students on campus cannot ultimately absolve themselves of responsibility, either.”
By aligning with BDS, Kahn says, Jews such as Wise and Kirk and organizations such as JVP merely provide the movement with a veneer of diversity.
Wise counters by noting that JVP has grown in the last few years to 30 chapters, with 200,000 supporters who donate or take action of some sort. That adds up to many Jews who, presumably, do not consider themselves anti-Semites.
“I would never advocate anything that I think would do harm to Jews,” Wise declared. “One of my biggest pet peeves is when people accuse me of that. If I believed the work I was doing was putting my family and friends in Israel in harm’s way, I wouldn’t do it.”
Growing pushback
Even as the BDS movement gains strength on many campuses, particularly in California, pro-Israel activists note examples of growing pushback.
Student councils at UCLA, U.C. Berkeley and U.C. Santa Barbara have adopted the State Department’s definition of anti-Semitism (including the three Ds), though how it might be enforced on campus is unknown. Supporters of BDS, furthermore, believe this definition would silence legitimate criticism of Israel.
A biennial global forum for combating anti-Semitism just wrapped up in Jerusalem, recommending that governments and websites around the world adopt new, more stringent standards for hate speech.
The ADL has launched a program, Words to Action, to push back against anti-Semitism and inoculate younger generations against it. It is designed to teach high school and college students how to differentiate between legitimate criticism of Israel and anti-Semitic speech, actions and symbols, and how to respond.
Yudof has been consulting with organizations such as the Charles and Lynn Schusterman Foundation to devise strategies to combat BDS. He urges a more aggressive, national approach. That’s the StandWithUs modus operandi, with its marked presence on campuses in terms of student volunteers, staff and educational materials.
The tide may be turning.
In recent weeks, divestment was rejected at Bowdoin College in Maine, Princeton University, San Diego State University, the University of New Mexico, University of Texas at Austin and U.C. Santa Barbara, as well as the general assembly of the Student Senate for California Community Colleges (resolutions did pass at Oglethorpe University in Georgia and Earlham College in Indiana).
In California this month, 57 rabbis from across the state joined 23 Jewish organizations in writing to U.C. President Janet Napolitano, drawing her attention to “anti-Semitism on U.C. campuses” and urging the system to adopt the State Department definition of anti-Semitism.
Kahn believes the majority of college students are not very engaged in Middle East politics, but says that with enough effort, a convincing pro-Israel message might sway the persuadables.
“Increasingly [students] know that a tiny fringe is trying to push the campus in a direction that is both divisive and embarrassing when it engages in this blatantly biased beating up of Israel,” Kahn said. “There’s an opportunity for Jewish students to build coalitions that may address anti-Semitism and this broader challenge around anti-Israel activity.”
At Stanford, even though the divestment resolution passed, pro-Israel activists took heart from the backlash that followed — not only the open faculty letter opposing the resolution, but a petition signed by thousands of students concerned over what they felt the resolution, and the BDS movement, might portend.
“There’s a small but very strong group of Israel supporters on campus,” said Kadisha, the Stanford senior who formed Coalition for Peace to work against future divestment efforts. “I have total faith that they will continue to educate the campus and have this conversation in the best way possible going forward. Instead of pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian students fighting each other, there should be a place where their interests are one and the same.”

<title>South African official threatens to punish students who visited Israel</title>
<date>Wed Jul 15 18:15:49 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
Jewish groups in South Africa condemned a government official for threatening to punish students who visited Israel.
Obed Bapela, a deputy minister in President Jacob Zuma’s office, charged the students, who visited Israel recently under the auspices of the South Africa Israel Forum, with bringing the ruling African National Congress into “disrepute” and said the party would “summon” them to an investigation.
The director of the South Africa Israel Forum, Dan Brotman, told Haaretz that “some of the participants, who will be future leaders in South Africa, were under enormous pressure not to come or received threats over being kicked out of their political parties.”“The goal is not to make them pro-Israel, but to expose them to a narrative they really don’t hear in South Africa,” he said.
Bapela said Israel was “offering free trips and holidays to embarrass the ANC,” adding that it was a “campaign by Israel to distort our stand on Palestine. We have a clear position that supports Palestinian freedom. No leader of the ANC in a private capacity or for the party will visit Israel. It will be putting the ANC in disrepute.”
No official ban has been placed on members of the government or ANC traveling to Israel.
Denis Goldberg, a South African social activist who was imprisoned with Nelson Mandela over the anti-apartheid movement, issued a statement last week slamming “Israeli propaganda holiday trips.”
The South African Zionist Federation and the South African Jewish Board of Deputies in a joint statement said it was “deeply disturbing that a member of the South African government should condemn and threaten to punish those who have simply exercised their democratic right to freedom of thought and association. What is so wrong – either legally or morally – about a group of young South Africans travelling to another country in order to broaden their knowledge about the situation there? Is Mr. Bapela afraid that by being exposed to information and opinions that differ from his own, they might end up coming to the ‘wrong’ conclusions?”
The groups charged that Bapela’s attitude goes against South Africa’s approach to engagement with other countries, noting that groups from South Africa have traveled consistently to all parts of the world, “including to countries where serious human rights abuses are taking place. Why is it only Israel that they should not be allowed to visit?”

<title>U.S. industrial union votes to endorse BDS</title>
<date>Sun Aug 30 06:19:37 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
One of the more prominent industrial unions in the U.S. voted to endorse the goals of the worldwide boycott, divestment and sanction (BDS) movement against Israel, citing "its long history of violating the human rights of the Palestinians," thus purportedly becoming the first nationwide union to do so.
The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers' national convention met in Baltimore last week and voted on a string of foreign and as well as domestic policy issues, including the call to boycott Israel and support the nuclear deal with Iran.
According to a statement on the UE's website, the union voted in favor of the "Justice and Peace for the Peoples of Palestine and Israel", and cited Israel’s sordid human rights record: "starting with the ethnic cleansing of 750,000 Palestinians in 1947-48 that turned most of Palestine into the State of Israel."
The move's goal, the union said, was "to pressure Israel to end its apartheid over the Palestinians just as similar tactics helped to end South African apartheid in the 1980s." The union further called for the U.S. aid to Israel to be cut off and expressed support for "the right to return."
The union also voted on a number of other foreign policy issues, including the demand to end U.S. military intervention in the Middle East and other regions.
"We (need) to get rid of this culture of war,” said Mike Ferritto, a local delegate. “We have done enough damage. We need to get out of the Middle East," said Brandon Dutton, another delegate.
The vote on Israel was prompted by an encounter with Palestinian trade unionists during the World Social Forum in Tunisia. Delegate Autumn Martinez, who cosponsored the resolution and participated in the meet, said: “It’s absolutely disgusting what is going on. Free Palestine!”

<title>Poll: British Jews are pro-Israel but critical of its government</title>
<date>Thu Nov 12 18:17:39 IST 2015</date>
<content>
The first major survey in five years on British Jews’ attitudes toward Israel shows them overwhelmingly to be pro-Israel and Zionist (though not all of them seem to actually like to be described as such). A large majority is also very critical of Israeli policies, particularly the expansion of settlements. The poll broadly confirms the findings of the 2010 Israel Survey by Britain’s Institute for Jewish Policy Research.
The new survey was commissioned and funded by Yachad, a British “pro-Israel, pro-peace” advocacy organization, designed by City University London and carried out by the IPSOS Mori market research firm.
It found that 90 percent of British Jews support Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state, 84 percent feel a “deep sense of pride” in its achievements in art, science and technology and 93 percent say Israel plays a part in their Jewish identity (73 percent say an “important” or “central” part).
But their deep-felt support for Israel does not extend to its current government and policies, with 75 percent agreeing that the expansion of West Bank settlements is a “major obstacle to peace” and 47 percent agreeing that the government is “constantly creating obstacles to avoid engaging in peace negotiations.”
This nuanced support is also seen in their opinions on the regarding the military conflict in the Gaza Strip in the summer of 2014. While 93 percent say Israel was entitled to respond to Hamas rockets and infiltration tunnels with military action, 37 percent say the scale of the Israeli response was “disproportionate” (though 78 percent believe that those condemning Israel’s military actions are guilty of “double standards”).
A majority of respondents — 58 percent — agreed with the statement that “Israel will be seen as an ‘apartheid state’ if it tries to retain control over borders which include more Arabs than Jews” and 24 percent said they would support “some sanctions against Israel if I thought they would encourage the Israeli government to engage in the peace process.”
The results of the survey were similar to those of the JPR survey from five years ago — that British Jews are deeply supportive of Israel as the Jewish state but highly critical of its politics and on the issue of the Israel-Palestine conflict, to the left of both the Israeli mainstream and of the traditional positions espoused by most of the British-Jewish leadership and large communal organizations.
In addition, older and more religious Jews are less critical than younger and secular Jews, who are also less likely to be heavily involved in communal activity. Interestingly, while 72 percent five years ago described themselves as “Zionist,” in the new survey that is down to 59 percent, though the level of support and identification with Israel remains the same. This is probably due to how public perceptions of the definition of Zionism have changed and it is now increasingly seen as meaning right-wing as well.
Some of the newspapers in Britain that have reported the survey highlighted the widespread criticism of Israel’s policies among British Jews, as if it should be surprising. But why should it be? Believing in the necessity and justice of the Jewish state while deploring the actions of its elected government is the most moral and sensible position to take. Assuming that a majority of British Jews does not hold such a position is an insult to their intelligence. In a sense, the results should come as a surprise only to those who are not really acquainted with a wide range of British Jews or those who simply don’t think they are capable of nuanced political thinking. It also contradicts the view that while on all evidence, Jews have been drifting rightward on the British political scale, away from the Labour Party (in line with Labour’s general decline in popularity), this isn’t necessarily connected to Israeli issues, on which the majority remains left-of-center.
The press release accompanying the publication of the survey was headlined “Three quarters of British Jews think Israel’s approach to peace is ‘damaging to its world standing.’” Choosing that particular statistic, as if it was unexpected, does the Jews of Britain a disservice. Just as a headline saying that 90 percent of them believe the world is not flat would be. Of course Israel’s approach to peace is damaging its standing in the world, why should any honest person say otherwise? To assume that, you would have to think that British Jews are some Pavlovian mass of idiots who swoon in admiration as soon as a blue-and-white flag is waved in front of them. That was never the case and this survey should surprise only those who had a dim view of British Jews to begin with.
The survey is valuable of course for groups, like Yachad, that have been fighting the community establishment for legitimacy. It proves that those who are prepared to be openly critical of Israel’s government while remaining within the Zionist camp are the mainstream and not the community’s largely self-appointed spokesmen trying to stifle dissent, including the more noisy advocacy groups and some prominent Jewish media pundits. This however puts the onus on those groups to better articulate their views and motivate their potential supporters, who may be in the majority but seem less inclined to voice their positions. Right-wingers can hardly be blamed for monopolizing the discourse when they are often the only ones present. This survey will be wasted if Yachad’s leadership doesn’t face the deeper implication — that is has failed to make the silent majority visible and voluble.
What should be noteworthy about the survey is that despite the deep unease over Israel’s policies, love and attachment for Israel remain extraordinarily strong and while the right-wingers are a minority, it is the anti-Zionists who are the real fringe. British Jews are basically sensible liberal Zionists, their critical faculties undiminished.

<title>Boston public transit to display ads calling to 'end U.S. support for Israeli apartheid'</title>
<date>Sun Nov 15 18:13:06 IST 2015</date>
<content>
The Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority approved the display of an anti-Israel ad it had previously rejected.
The poster, which features a large photograph of a child and the word “violence” in large, bold letters, accuses Israel’s military of using U.S. tax dollars to kill 2,000 Palestinian children since September 2000, and calls for the end of US military aid to Israel.
It is one of three ads that was initially approved by the MBTA in June 2014, but later removed. At the time, the governing body of the state’s public transportation system said the ads violated its policy against language that demeans or disparages individuals or groups.
The American Civil Liberties Union challenged the rejection on behalf of the Palestinian rights organization, Palestine Advocacy Project. The group, formerly called Ads Against Apartheid, asserts that the poster is a form of protected First Amendment speech and should be allowed in a public space.
The agency’s decision to approve came after the ACLU persuaded it that the ad does not violate the MBTA’s policy against demeaning ads, according to Sarah Wunsch, deputy legal director of the ACLU’s Massachusetts branch.
In a statement to JTA, a spokesman for the MBTA said these advertisements comply with its guidelines, that it described as “viewpoint neutral standards for all advertising displayed on MBTA property.”
“To reduce unnecessary litigation which can arise from issue-based ads of this nature, the MBTA is currently considering whether to amend its advertising guidelines and in the future will not accept ads concerning political issues or matters of public debate,” the statement continued.
Jeremy Burton, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston said in a statement provided to JTA: “We do not believe that the MBTA nor any other government authority should regularly be in the business of banning speech. However, spreading distortions and inaccuracies about a complex political situation will achieve no positive benefit in the search for a lasting end to the conflict in the region, a cause to which we and all reasonable people are committed.”

<title>Famed Holocaust documentarian tackles the occupation in new film </title>
<date>Thu Nov 19 23:57:22 IST 2015</date>
<content>
JTA - Ophuls is perhaps best known for his 1969 Academy Award-nominated film “The Sorrow and the Pity," which raised questions of French collaboration during the Nazi occupation, along with his monumental 1988 biopic “Hôtel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie,” which explored the actions of the notorious Nazi as well as the human condition.
Given his track record, news of the award-winning director’s next film may come as a surprise.
Ophuls —whose father, Max, was a prominent Jewish director, and who fled Nazi Europe as a child — announced last month that he will title his forthcoming film “Let My People Go.” Although the iconic phrase resonates deeply with anyone who has attended a Passover seder, Ophuls said he will use the familiar imperative to support the Palestinians.
“The title is going to be ‘Let My People Go,’ which means that the Israelis should let the Palestinians go,” Ophuls, 88, said at the 38th annual Mill Valley Film Festival, an increasingly prominent awards platform. The statement garnered applause from the audience. When this reporter asked specifically where Israel should let the Palestinians go, Ophuls offered just one word: “Anywhere.”
At the festival — where Ophuls received a tribute for his contributions to cinema — the filmmaker announced plans to film in Syria and Israel in the near future, eyeing a possible debut at the Cannes Film Festival in May.
“There are only 10 days of shooting left and a few months of editing, of course,” he said. “And if we can make the film, finish the film, it will probably go to Cannes next spring.”
The project gained media attention from a report in The New York Times, which noted its original working title, “Unpleasant Truths.” Late last year, Ophuls sought to raise 50,000 euros, then about $62,000. The film is a joint project with Eyal Sivan, an Israeli documentarian who left Israel for Paris in 1985.
Sivan told the NYT they seek to answer the questions such as “Is Israel provoking anti-Semitism?” and “whether Islamophobia is the new anti-Semitism."
A 12-minute clip of the work in progress, which is available on YouTube under its former title, opens with Ophuls failing to persuade the famed French director Jean-Luc Godard — who previously released a book and film on Jewish identity — to join him on a collaborative scouting trip to Israel. (According to the NYT, the directors began discussing a collaboration on the topic more than 10 years ago. Whether Godard, a vocal supporter of Palestinian rights, is also an anti-Semite is a question that has garnered media attention.)
Ophuls also interviews Michel Warschawski, described as an “anti-colonial activist"; Abraham Burg, a former speaker of the Israeli Knesset, and Rabbi Shlomo Aviner, whom he describes as the spiritual leader of the settlers. The clip includes footage of a rally of Israelis against Jews marrying Arabs. And at one point, Sivan says that in the territories, the water ratio is “one liter of water for the Palestinians to 10 liters for the Jews.”
In another scene, Ophuls travels on the road between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. In a phone call, he describes the route with “barbed wires everywhere. A prison for Palestinians on one side. It’s apartheid, really.”
“I’m going to tell you why Max Ophuls wasn’t a Zionist,” Ophuls says on camera of his famous father’s lack of support for the Jewish state. “Not really anti-Zionist but certainly not Zionist. Because he thought the Jews’ destiny in the 20th century was to be cosmopolites — against nationalism.”
Ophuls’ notable body of documentary work includes  "A Sense of Loss" (1972), about the conflict in Northern Ireland; an examination of the Nuremberg Trials titled "The Memory of Justice" (1973-76); an investigation into the fall of communism in East Germany and its repercussions called "November Days" (1992), and a look at war correspondents titled "The Trouble We've Seen" (1994).
His 2013 film, “Ain’t Misbehavin’: A Marcel Ophuls Journey,” is a rambling exploration of his life and career. The documentary details how his family fled Nazi Germany for France in 1933, then in 1941, following the German invasion of France, fled to Los Angeles. (Ophul’s mother is the non-Jewish actress Hildegard Wall.)
At the Mill Valley Film Festival event, an audience member asked Ophuls during a question-and-answer session how he develops concepts for his films.
“Ideas come when they come," he said. "My father, because he spoke German, called it ‘Einfallen.' They start in heaven and then they may come down. ... Some days you have no ideas at all, for weeks or more. They don’t want to come. And you’ve got to work for them. Some people are more creative than others. Talent is not given to everyone.”
Notably, Ophuls said he doesn’t write scripts.
“That, to me, is the essential difference between documentaries and movies and real movies,” he said. “I only script in the editing room when I have maybe 120 hours of rushes [raw footage]. And I work on those, and by and by, idea by idea, sometimes they’re good and sometimes they’re not so good, it all comes together.”
His "organic" style of filmmaking allows a “big story” to fill “a big space in time.” With no preconceived notions about how long a film should be, his run famously long. “The Sorrow and the Pity” is nearly 4 1/2 hours, as is “Hotel Terminus.”
Initially produced for television, “The Sorrow and the Pity” was notoriously banned from French TV, although it eventually aired in 1981. The film gained even more attention after director Woody Allen featured it twice in his Oscar-winning “Annie Hall.” In what became a classic scene, Allen’s character, Alvy Singer, invites Diane Keaton’s Annie to view the film. She responds, "I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis."
At the film’s close, however, Alvy bumps into Annie as she takes a date to see the documentary. Alvy calls it "a personal triumph."
Ophuls, in turn, briefly excerpts “Annie Hall” in “Ain’t Misbehavin'," and reads a laudatory letter from Allen that he shows in a close-up.
Still, some writers leveled criticism at the pic, saying the story of Ophuls’ life might have benefited from another director.
The same might be said for Ophuls' upcoming film. Applying an ancient Exodus narrative to the Palestinian cause, and accusing Israel of apartheid, may cause Ophuls’ Jewish fans no choice but to let him go -- at the box office.

<title>Can Jews support 
BlackLivesMatter and be Pro-Israel?</title>
<date>Mon Dec 21 14:40:56 IST 2015</date>
<content>
In less than three minutes, flanked by President Obama and Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, Can Jews support 
BlackLivesMatter and be Pro-Israel distilled the sprawling interests of American Jewish liberals into a passionate manifesto while leading a White House Hanukkah menorah lighting before a bevy of communal leaders.
Anti-Semitism, racism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, gun control, nuclear waste, Middle East peace, justice for Palestinians, Women of the Wall and Black Lives Matter — Talve called them all out in her invocation before turning to bless the candles in the White House East Room. “Like the Maccabees of old, we too will win,” she declared.
“That’s how I always talk; I always mention these things,” the 63-year-old rabbi of St. Louis Central Reform Congregation said in an interview the next day. “I always add a kavana, an intention, that will help us let the prayers inspire us to action.”
But in the eyes of some on the left, the activist rabbi’s intentions on the streets with the Black Lives Matter movement are not sufficient. A week before officiating at the White House Hanukkah ceremony, Talve was targeted in an open letter from Jewish pro-Palestinian activists in that movement, questioning her place within it. The reason: her outspoken support for Israel.
“To whitewash the lived alliances between Ferguson and Palestine is to silence the very voices we seek to hear,” read the letter, sponsored by the St. Louis chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace.
Months earlier, other activists spread on the Internet photos of Talve, describing her in the caption as a “supporter of genocide and international apartheid,” and adding the hashtag 
realterrorist.
The sharp criticism reflects the efforts of some in the Black Lives Matter movement to establish solidarity and cooperation between their cause and those of others who are fighting oppression. In the process of this effort, Talve has become, to a great extent, the face of progressive Jewish activists’ struggle with “intersectionality,” the concept that binds together a variety of causes that share an experience of oppression.
In this case, the oppression experience of black Americans is linked to that of the Palestinians, leaving pro-Israel activists such as Talve having to defend their support for the movement.
It’s an experience shared by a number of other Jews who have supported Black Lives Matter, particularly students. “I don’t always feel that my pro-Israel views were welcome in those communities,” Chantelle Moghadam said, referring to the social movements she has voiced support for at the University of Missouri, including Black Lives Matter. But she added, “I express my opinions anyways.”
Moghadam, who is the co-founder of her school’s chapter of Students Supporting Israel, supports progressive movements, but said that anti-Israeli sentiment translates to anti-Semitism, a concept she thinks is lost among her peers.
Other students rejected this equation. Sophia Goodfriend, a senior and a member of the JVP chapter at Tufts University, said many of the pro-Israel Jewish students on her campus don’t attend the Black Lives Matter rallies because they understand they might be criticized. But Goodfriend is not too sympathetic.
“Students who support movements like 
blacklivesmatter,” need to ask themselves “why they are complicit in supporting racist governments,” she said.
Talve, who moved to St. Louis 35 years ago after being ordained at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, founded the Central Reform Congregation after first sharing a congregation with her husband. It is the only synagogue within the St. Louis city limits. An activist involved in all facets of social justice, Talve was drawn to the Black Lives Matter movement that emerged in the city after the August 2014 killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by police in nearby Ferguson.
“What pulled me into the movement,” she said, was seeing African-American women call out to the policemen and say, “Look at me, see me for what I am,” she told the Forward, recalling her time standing outside in Ferguson alongside black activists. This, Talve said, struck a chord with her: “Don’t we get that as Jews?”
In the hours and days she spent with the protesters, she discovered commonality with members of the local African-American community and with local clergy. Conversations about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were rare. But at times, Talve found herself explaining her view as a Zionist that Jews are just as indigenous as Arabs to the Land of Israel.
The necessity she felt to do so reflects the gravitation by some in the Black Lives Matter movement toward other struggles where they perceive commonalities.
In January, a group of 14 activists, including Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors, traveled to the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank to explore the possibilities for increasing solidarity between the two movements. Cullors described in an interview with Ebony magazine what she saw there as “an apartheid state,” adding that those who denied this fact were “part of the Zionist violence.”
The report in Ebony quoted one of the delegation participants, community organizer Cherrell Brown, who found similarities between the way Israel treats Palestinians and how U.S. authorities treat African Americans. “So many parallels exist between how U.S. polices incarcerate [African Americans] and perpetuate violence on the black community, and how the Zionist state that exists in Israel perpetuates the same on Palestinians,” Brown said.
Now, some — though far from all — involved in Black Lives Matter question whether pro-Israel activists can remain part of the movement.
The 
realterrorist online meme depicting Talve as a supporter of apartheid was the harshest expression of mistrust, but not the only one. Black Lives Matter activists took issue with Talve’s involvement in the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the mainstream Washington-based lobby that is widely seen as taking an uncritical stance toward the Jewish state’s policies, in line with its hard-line government.
Talve rejects these activists’ assertions of necessary linkage with the Palestinian struggle, and in particular with those among the Palestinians calling for boycott, divestment and sanctioning of Israel, a movement known as BDS.
But her critics say they cannot silently abide her insertions of support for Israel in contexts where Black Lives Matter activists are asserting their connections with the Palestinian struggle. In their open letter to her, activists with the St. Louis JVP chapter cited Talve’s alleged response to a Palestinian speaker at a vigil “to mourn state violence” in America and Israel who told “a heart-wrenching story about his friend being killed by an Israeli soldier.”
“It brought deep pain to Murad and our entire community when you reacted by saying: ‘What do we have to learn from the Palestinians — to strap bombs to ourselves?’” they wrote.
Talve told the Forward the alleged remark referred to a “private conversation I had with a student who was at that vigil [that] had nothing to do with the story that Murad told.” “It had nothing to do with the terrible story of the tragedy of his family,” she wrote in an email. “It was a conversation about [using] nonviolence versus violence to be heard and achieve one’s goals. The Black Lives Matter is a nonviolent movement. It was so out of context and so misleading to connect it to a tragic story.”
Talve stressed, “People need to understand that racism in America is different than the experience of Israelis and Palestinians.” Some on what she describes as the fringe of the Black Lives Matter movement “oversimplify” the issues, she argued, explaining: “This often happens in movements where people are struggling. It’s a very sad thing.”
In its letter to her, JVP, which is active in the Black Lives Matter movement and also supports applying BDS to Israel to pressure it to change its policies, expressed admiration for Talve’s “courageous and outspoken stand” in support of Black Lives Matter and “many other social justice issues.” But they wrote: “Solidarity from Ferguson to Palestine has become a central tenet of the movement in St. Louis. Because Israeli and U.S. state oppression are deeply interconnected.”
“It’s hypocritical to support one [issue] and not the other,” said Jeff Ordower, a St. Louis community organizer who was among the activists who approached Talve. Talve rejects this dichotomy. “People on the fringe who try to turn this into an either/or conversation leave out so many people who don’t agree to exactly everything they want,” she said. Talve also argued that voices wishing to exclude pro-Israel Jews from Black Lives Matter are ignoring the reality of black and brown American Jews who also need protection.
K.B. Frazier, a Jewish African American who not only participates in most of the movement’s protests in Ferguson and St. Louis, but also does so armed with his drum to provide rhythm and beat to the demonstrations, said that calls to exclude Talve and supporters of Israel from the protests serve only those seeking to divide the movement. “No way are we going to allow anyone to divide the movement by creating some kind of litmus test,” he said.
Frazier, like other activists, did not rule out a tie among Ferguson, Palestine and other battlegrounds. But the only way to discuss what he views as “systematic racism” is to create a respectful dialogue within the movement.
Over the course of the past year, Talve and her critics sought to establish such a dialogue. JVP members spoke at Talve’s synagogue and presented their case to congregants. Later, Talve invited an AIPAC representative to offer a counter-narrative, an appearance that the JVP activists objected to in their letter.
At the end of the day, the dialogue was deemed unfruitful. The breach between the sides seemed to widen, and JVP published its open letter in early December.
“Our choice to protect you, to give you time, to give you the benefit of the doubt, has placed the burden on Palestinians and black leaders to voice and grapple with the painful ways you have brought Zionist oppression into this beautiful movement,” the letter stated. “How much longer can we wait for you?”
Talve proudly defines herself as a supporter of Israel who has visited the Jewish state on a rabbinical tour sponsored by AIPAC. But she has made clear that she supports a two-state solution to the conflict. In her public statements, including her call to the White House for “justice for Palestinians,” she clearly acknowledges that Palestinians are being oppressed.
But asked just who or what entity is oppressing them, Talve told the Forward that in the case of both black males in the inner city and Palestinians in the territories occupied by Israel, “there are systems that are in place that make it hard [for] them to succeed and to be their best self.”
“I don’t want to get more specific than that,” she said. “Things are being twisted in ways that I haven’t meant. I think it’s enough to say there are systems of oppression in many of our societies where many people have privilege and many don’t.” But though the oppression suffered by American blacks and by Palestinians are both “wrongs that we need to act against,” she stressed, “they are not the same thing.”
Talve declares the experience will not deter her from remaining active in the Black Lives Matter movement. But she admits that her “biggest fear” is the impact that intersectionality might have on other Jews — especially Jewish students who identify with the struggle.
“I don’t have to choose. I can be pro-Israel and I can have empathy and work for justice for the Palestinians, and I can be part of the Black Lives Matter movement,” Talve said. “That’s a message I want Jews to know about.”
As she battles critics from the left, the rabbi’s progressive message has also gotten pushback from the right wing of the Jewish community. “Her behavior was deeply insulting to the religious Jewish community,” Daniel Greenfield accused on Frontpage, a right-wing website. He called her White House address a “crazed rant.”
Talve also received what she described as a “quite rude” note, complaining about her use of the Arabic blessing “inshallah,” or “God willing,” during her speech. Talve said she heard Rivlin utter the phrase after her call for peace and justice, and decided to repeat the blessing. “It was the same word my Turkish grandfather used to use,” she explained.

<title>Dr. Maher Hathout, father of Muslim-American identity, dies at 79</title>
<date>Wed Jan 07 11:26:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
	Dr. Maher Hathout, a prominent interfaith leader hailed as the father of the Muslim American identity, has died. He was 79.
	Hathout, who was born in Egypt but became a steady and insistent voice for Muslim American civic engagement over four decades, died Friday at the City of Hope in Duarte after a yearlong battle with liver cancer, said Salam al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, which Hathout co-founded in 1988.
	Hathout, also a practicing cardiologist, spoke passionately of the need for Muslim Americans to create an identity that did not rely on Middle Eastern cultural interpretations of Islam. He encouraged Muslims in the U.S. to embrace their dual identity and advocated participation in American politics, volunteerism and interfaith work. Deeply religious and deeply patriotic, he often reminded colleagues that "home is not where my grandparents are buried, but where my grandchildren will be raised."
	His work, particularly the foundation of MPAC, cultivated a unique sense of identity that sustained Muslim Americans as they weathered the backlash from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
	"He helped bring together Muslim Americans in a way that no one had before. He provided the infrastructure, the space and the language for this community to think about itself as both Muslim and American," said Varun Soni, dean of religious life at the University of Southern California. "It gave them a seat at the table."
	Hathout also worked tirelessly over four decades to build interfaith bridges and was close friends with many prominent Christian, Jewish and other leaders, including Rick Warren, the best-selling author of "The Purpose Driven Life" and founder of Saddleback Church.
	His passion for interfaith dialogue cut through long-standing assumptions and won him friends and gave him credibility in the most unlikely of places, said the Rev. Dr. Gwynne Guibord, an Episcopal priest who invited Hathout to sit on the advisory council of the Guibord Center-Inside Out.
	"His was a voice that was steady, although passionate. I think that's what made him so great, not only great as a Muslim but great as a human being. He had the innate ability to embrace a lot of people who many people wouldn't have embraced because of that ability to see something good and powerful in someone else," she said. "His willingness to be available fully was a gift, a tremendous gift."
	After moving to Los Angeles from Buffalo, New York, in 1970, Hathout began working as spokesman and chairman at the Islamic Center of Southern California, one of the most progressive mosques in the U.S.
	That work led to some pioneering projects to redefine the American Muslim experience and connect with youth, including the first-ever co-ed Muslim Youth Group, the Islamic Information Service that produced a nationally televised weekly program on Islam, The Minaret magazine and the New Horizon School system. He also consulted frequently with the U.S. government, authored several books and was the first Muslim invited to give the invocation prayer at the Democratic National Convention in 2000.
	Hathout was honored with an interfaith award on the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations despite strong objections from Jewish organizations who criticized him for comments made about Israel.
	Speaking at a 2000 Jerusalem Day rally, Hathout said: "We did not come here to condemn the condemned atrocities committed by the apartheid brutal state of Israel because butchers do what butchers do and because what is expected from a racist apartheid is what is happening now."
	Hathout said in 2006 that his remarks had been "harsh." He said they sprang from anger over the way Israeli authorities were treating Palestinian protesters in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the second intifada.
	Hathout is survived by his wife, Dr. Ragaa Hathout, two children and four grandchildren.
	He was buried Monday and the city of Los Angeles will hold a ceremony in his honor Saturday.

<title>Netanyahu responds to Ehud Barak's Haaretz interview: He's still an irresponsible leftist</title>
<date>Thu Jan 08 00:05:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed Ehud Barak on Thursday, in a response to a Haaretz interview with Barak, who served as a defense minister in Netanyahu's previous government and as prime minister between 1999 and 2001.
	"This is my response to the interview with Ehud Barak, which you will not see tomorrow (Friday) in Haaretz: Former Defense Minister Ehud Barak has done much for Israel's security. Under my leadership, we both worked closely to keep the state secure, out of responsibility and with a level-head," Netanyahu said over his Facebook and Twitter accounts.
	"However, regarding the diplomatic issue Barak has yet to come to his senses and keeps presenting irresponsible leftist stances just like his friends on the left, Tzipi and Bougie (Tzipi Livni and Isaac Herzog). Despite the rise of radical Islam in our region, and around the world, as we've seen this week in the murderous attack in France, the leftists Barak, Tzipi and Bougie are still trying to peddle to the public the dream of the new Middle East that has turned into a nightmare a long time ago."
	According to Netanyahu, "if the delusions of the Labor party across time were realized, ISIS men would today be dipping their toes in the Sea of Galilee. While the Palestinians are trying to drag IDF soldiers to the International Criminal Court, the left's leaders are still hanging on to Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) and seek to bring Israel back to a policy of concessions and retreats."
	Netanyahu added: "I, as prime minister, will continue to promote the backchannel with moderates in the Arab world, those who can forces the Palestinians reach a diplomatic agreement that will ensure Israel's security."
	In the Haaretz interview, Barak criticized Netanyahu's conduct regarding the peace process and said, among other things, that "his open leadership manifests a very strong element of pessimism, passivity, a preference to refrain from taking action. Many times I said to Bibi and Lieberman: Your rhetoric has a backbone of stainless steel, but what you do in practice is like living proof of the statement that the nation can be taken out of the Diaspora – but it’s far more difficult to take the Diaspora out of the nation.
	"In the end, when we reach the critical junctions where decisions have to be made – maybe the most important decisions since the state’s establishment – you behave as though you prefer to be dragged there by a situation that will be forced on you. Two things are happening during your waiting. First, no divine promise or paradise awaits at the end of the road, rather something very grave. And second, a great many people are being killed along the way there.”
	When asked where does he think Netanyahu's passivity on the Palestinian front is leading, Barak replied: "“In the end, passivity and avoidance of taking action lead to something being imposed on you that is far less good than what you could have achieved. And there is always the considerable danger that you will cross, without sensing it, the point of no return, and when you snap out of it and really want the previous situation back, it will simply not be possible, you will slide down a slippery slope. We saw examples of this in the last century in a neighboring continent – in South Africa during the apartheid years. It may have been Mark Twain who once said, ‘History doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.’"

<title>Clegg condemns party MP for anti-Netanyahu tweet</title>
<date>Thu Jan 15 16:30:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
	Nick Clegg, the British deputy prime minister, condemned an anti-Netanyahu tweet by one of his party's MPs as "crass, stupid and insensitive," The Guardian reported Thursday. However, he declined to call the remarks racist, according to the British paper.
	After Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took part in solidarity march in Paris on Sunday, following last week's terror attacks in the French capital, Liberal Democrat MP David Ward tweeted, “
Netanyahu in Paris march – what!!! Makes me feel sick” and “Je suis 
Palestinian.”
	Clegg said on a phone-in show Thursday that Ward “clearly doesn’t speak for the party on this at all and I cannot be more unambiguous in condemning what I think is a highly insensitive way of behaving.”
	He asserted it was stupid to say he doesn't want to see Netanyahu because regardless of what one thinks of his politics the Israeli prime minister has the right to participate in such a demonstration. "But do I think it was a racist thing to say?" asked Clegg rhetorically. "No.”
	Earlier Thursday, the Israeli ambassador to Britain expressed his abhorrence at Ward's "offensive and shocking" comments to Clegg, The Guardian reported.
	“At a time when leaders were united in condemnation of extremist atrocities, Mr Ward’s statement is a disgraceful attempt to politicize suffering, de-legitimize Israel, and justify acts of terror," wrote Ambassador Daniel Taub to the deputy prime minister.
	Ward stirred controversy in 2013 when he compared Israel's treatment of Palestinians to the Holocaust. His party reprimanded him for his "use of language," according to The Guardian. The Lib Dems suspended him later in 2013 for tweeting, “Am I wrong or am I right? At long last the Zionists are losing the battle – how long can the apartheid State of Israel last?”
	Ward issued an apology in July after his party threatened him with disciplinary action for saying he would likely fire a rocket at Israel if he lived in Gaza, noted The Guardian.

<title>Over 100 U.K. artists announce cultural boycott of Israel</title>
<date>Sat Feb 14 19:02:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
Over 100 British artists announced on Friday that they are launching a cultural boycott of Israel, along with hundreds of others who have also signed up to the initiative. 
“Along with more than 600 other fellow artists, we are announcing today that we will not engage in business-as-usual cultural relations with Israel,” the group wrote in a letter published by Britain’s Guardian newspaper. 
According to the letter, this includes accepting professional invitations to Israel or funding from any institutions linked to the Israeli government.
“Since the summer war on Gaza, Palestinians have enjoyed no respite from Israel’s unrelenting attack on their land, their livelihood, their right to political existence,” read the letter, noting that the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem has called 2014 “one of the cruellest and deadliest in the history of the occupation.”
Notable signatories of the letter include film directors Ken Loach and Mike Leigh, legendary musician Brian Eno and art theorist John Berger. Roger Waters, well known for his criticism of Israel, also signed on. The full list of over 700 supporters appears on the Artists for Palestine U.K. website.   
The artists wrote that “Israel’s wars are fought on the cultural front too. Its army targets Palestinian cultural institutions for attack, and prevents the free movement of cultural workers. Its own theatre companies perform to settler audiences on the West Bank – and those same companies tour the globe as cultural diplomats, in support of ‘Brand Israel.’
During South African apartheid, musicians announced they weren’t going to ‘play Sun City.’ Now we are saying, in Tel Aviv, Netanya, Ashkelon or Ariel, we won’t play music, accept awards, attend exhibitions, festivals or conferences, run masterclasses or workshops, until Israel respects international law and ends its colonial oppression of the Palestinians.”

<title>U.S. pro-Palestinian group's latest bus ad to target Netanyahu speech to Congress</title>
<date>Thu Feb 26 01:07:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
	The Washington D.C.-based American Muslims for Palestine on Wednesday unveiled their latest ad, which targets Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's controversial upcoming speech to Congress, and which the group intends to run on buses.
	The ad excepts a statement Netanyahu, unaware he was being filmed, made to West Bank settlers in 2001, reading, "America is a thing you can move very easily." The ad then states: "Stop the disrespect – End U.S. aid to Israel."
	It also shows Netanyahu making his "cartoon bomb" speech to the United Nations, but the placard he's holding shows not the cartoon, but rather a checklist he's presenting to Congress, with "Israel agenda" checked off and an X next to "U.S. agenda."  
	In 2013, American Muslims for Palestine put up poster ads in New York train stations reading, "Americans give Israel $3 billion per year! End apartheid now! Stop U.S. aid to Israel."
	It was part of a duel with right-wing pro-Israel groups, one of which put up ads in New York train stations reading, "It's not Islamophobia, it's Islamorealism."
		Analytics say our new ad has reached nearly 18 million people online

<title>Israel Election Updates / Abbas: We welcome Arab Joint List, wish them great success</title>

 Latest opinion and analysis: Netanyahu hopes to ride rhetoric to electoral victory (Yossi Verter) | Who is a Zionist? (Salman Masalha) | Digital media is the big winner in Israel's election campaign (Nati Tucker)
 Latest updates:
 1:15 P.M. Abbas: We wish Joint List much luck in Israeli election
	Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas came out in support of the joint Arab electoral list for the upcoming Knesset elections, saying, “We welcome the Joint List and wish them much success. This is not interference [in domestic Israeli politics]… it is our right as members of the same nation to [endorse] them.” Abbas made the remarks at the opening of the Palestinian Central Council, one of the institutions of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
	“We identify with every political force in Israel that recognizes the establishment of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders and opposes racism, discrimination and apartheid,” the Palestinian president said.
	Abbas also said he supports “popular resistance not only in the Palestinian Authority but all of the world in the name of justice for Palestinians,” adding that “the existing resistance is not enough and needs to be strengthened.” (Jack Khoury)	 
 11:30 A.M. Israeli diplomats set to cast first ballots in election
	The first ballots of Israel’s upcoming national election were set to be cast some two weeks before the election date.
	Israeli representatives stationed in 98 diplomatic missions throughout the world were due to begin voting Wednesday evening Israel time in elections for the 20th Knesset, according to a statement issued by the Knesset.
	Some 6,250 representatives abroad are eligible to vote in the elections. Other Israelis working or living abroad cannot cast absentee ballots. Israeli citizens must be in the country on the day of the election in order to vote.
	The first votes are set to be cast at the Israeli consulate in Wellington, New Zealand, at 11 P.M. Wednesday in Israel, which is morning there, and the last 36 hours later in San Francisco. The consulate in New York has the highest number of eligible voters, with about 600. (JTA)
 10 A.M. Israeli TV swamped with political campaign ads
	Day One of the TV campaign ads was disappointing – no party came out with a surprising new message or with an item that would evoke public discussion after its screening. In an era of social media, no clips were shown that had not been widely viewed previously on Facebook or Whatsapp. It’s doubtful whether televised electioneering such as was shown yesterday will actually impact the public agenda or the results of the elections.
	Thus, as provided for by the law, the political system took over valuable screen time to broadcast the election messages of the different parties. These will be shown daily on all three TV channels for the next two weeks.
	The only party that attempted to address the public agenda was the Zionist Camp, which scoffed at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to the U.S. Congress shortly after the speech was delivered. The clip stated that in contrast to the bombing of the Iraqi reactor ordered by Menachem Begin and the Syrian one by Ehud Olmert, Netanyahu bombarded Congress with words while destroying relations with the United States.

 5:20 A.M. Herzog: Even after Netanyahu's speech, Israel is still isolated
	Opposition leader Isaac Herzog criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress on Tuesday, saying that despite the impressive rhetoric, his words did not slow Iran's quest for nuclear weapons.
	Speaking in a southern community not far from the Gaza border, Herzog, who is seeking to unseat Netanyahu in the March 17 Knesset elections, told the audience that their problems worry him no less than the Iranian nuclear threat.
	"Netanyahu knows how to deliver a speech," he said, "but [his] speech did not put a halt to a nuclear agreement and didn't influence it." Herzog added: "No Israeli leader will countenance a nuclear Iran."
	Herzog also addressed the Israel-U.S. relations following the speech. "The painful truth is that after the applause, Netanyahu was left alone," he said. "Israel was left isolated. And the negotiations with Iran will continue without any Israeli involvement. This speech badly damaged U.S.-Israel relations. It won’t change the administration's stance but will only widen the rift with our greatest friend and strategic ally." (Jonathan Lis) Read the full article

<title>Erekat: International community to blame for Netanyahu reelection</title>
<date>Wed Mar 18 13:48:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
	Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat on Wednesday blamed the international community for Israel's election results and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reelection.
	"Such a result would not have been possible had the international community held Israel to account for its systematic violations of international law," Erekat said in a statement.
	Erekat said that results show "the success of a campaign platform based on settlements, racism, apartheid and the denial of the fundamental human rights of the Palestinian people."
	He implored the international community to act, urging it to "rally behind Palestinian efforts to internationalize our struggle for dignity and freedom through the International Criminal Court and through all other peaceful means."
	Earlier Wednesday, senior officials in the Palestinian Authority told Haaretz that Netanyahu's reelection, after declaring during his campaign that a Palestinian state would not be created and the settlements would remain largely in place, proves that there is no partner in Israel.
	The international community must understand that and not defend Netanyahu or his policies, the officials said. If Netanyahu does form a right-wing government, the officials said, it will make it easier for the Palestinians to succeed in the international arena, with the picture of Israel's policies so much clearer.
	Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority have not yet released an official response to the election results, and sources close to Abbas said that he would until the final results were in and the coalition was assembled before doing so.
	Haaretz reported Tuesday that according to Palestinian officials who spoke with officials in the Obama administration, the White House prefers to see a national unity government formed in Israel to stand behind a diplomatic arrangement.
	The Palestine Liberation Organization's Executive Committee will meet Thursday to discuss the decision made two weeks in ago in the Palestinian central committee regarding a halt in security coordination with Israel. The final decision on whether to implement that operationally will likely be left to Abbas.
	Hamas, meanwhile, said that the re-election of Netanyahu "who doesn't believe in a solution" obligates the PA to "cut off contact with the occupying authorities."

<title>Habayit Hayehudi MK says 'extreme Israeli left' is like bacteria</title>
<date>Sun Apr 12 22:16:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
	Habayit Hayehudi MK Yinon Magal criticized on Sunday what he termed "the extreme left" and blasted columns of Haaretz columnist Gideon Levy, saying they are "like a bacteria that harms the brain."
	On his Facebook page, Magal – former editor-in-chief of the Israeli news portal Walla – wrote: "Now that it has finished inciting Europe against Israel, the Israeli extreme left is working to do the same in the U.S. The people who invented a people, who decided [those people] need a state (on Israeli land, of course), encourage boycotts against the Zionist state, hatched false accusations, falsely determined that there is apartheid here, pushed condemnations of Israel, flew around the world to slander us at every conference on the globe (great job) … are now intent on damaging our relationship with the U.S."
	According to Magal, "one must read Gideon Levy's latest columns published by Haaretz to understand how far the madness has come. Like a bacteria that targets the brain." Magal attached a photograph of Levy's article (Hebrew) from April 9. The article also ran in English.
	"These columns are translated into English every day and are read in capitals around the world," added Magal. "It's hard to gauge the damage that this milieu did and does to Israel. Actually, you can see our situation diplomatically and in terms of security. The extreme Israeli left has a lot of responsibility for it."

<title>Palestinians clash with IDF during Prisoners Day demonstrations</title>
<date>Fri Apr 17 19:05:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
	Israel Defense Forces soldiers clashed with Palestinian protesters in the West Bank village of Bilin on Friday during annual demonstrations marking Palestinian Prisoners Day, AFP reported.
	One protester was reportedly wounded as over 100 Palestinians, some throwing stones, rallied near the separation barrier at the village. Security forces fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. 	Prisoners Day is marked every year in solidarity with the more than 6,000 Palestinians currently in Israeli jails. 	Fourteen Palestinian members of parliament and 20 journalists are among those detained and over 450 Palestinians are being held without trial for indeterminate periods under administrative detention provisions.
	Since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, over 800,000 Palestinians have been detained by Israel's military, while over 60 Palestinians have died in Israeli jails, according to data provided by the PLO.
	Over 70 percent of Palestinian families have had at least one relative detained at some point, according to the UN.
	The current number of Palestinian prisoners is the highest for at least five years, according to figures from Palestinian human rights groups.
	In Gaza City, hundreds of Palestinians performed Friday prayers in front of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to mark Palestinian Prisoner's Day. 	"Today, we honor and express our solidarity with all Palestinians who have been and continue to be imprisoned in Israeli jails," senior PLO official Hanan Ashrawi said in a statement.
	"We commend their steadfastness, courage and determination in defiance of Israel's military occupation and system of enslavement and apartheid."
	"We call on all members of the international community to act on the basis of justice and human rights and bring Israel to compliance for its willful breach of the rights and lives of Palestinian political prisoners," Ashrawi added. 	President Mahmoud Abbas marked Palestinian Prisoner's Day by saying that any future peace agreement must free all Palestinian prisoners.
	"It is time for decision holders in Israel to realize that jails, settlement, confiscating lands and withholding holding PA tax funds will only lead to more extremism and keep us from reaching what we seek, which is a just peace based on ending occupation," Abbas said in a televised statement on Thursday.
	In Hebron on Wednesday, hundreds of Palestinians marched through the streets in a Prisoners' Day demonstration, calling for an end to child detainees, an end to administrative detention and the military court system, the release of prisoners in bad health and the release of women prisoners.

<title>U.K.'s Green Party leader backs Israel boycott</title>
<date>Sat Apr 18 17:38:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
The leader of the U.K.'s Green Party says she backs a boycott of Israel, which is official party policy since before Natalie Bennett became leader in 2012. 
In an interview with the Jewish Chronicle ahead of general elections on May 7, Bennett said, “We need to get the message across to the Israeli state. It needs to comply with international law and human rights…The boycott of Israel is Green Party policy. It is a really difficult area, but I would support the policy."
The Green Party is the only mainstream U.K. party that supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.  The party's 2015 manifesto, which was made public this week, calls for suspending the EU-Israel Association Agreement, the legal basis for EU trade with Israel which has been in force since 2,000, and is worth more than nearly 1.5 billion dollars year, according to the Jewish Chronicle.
Bennett, an Australian-born former journalist, told the newspaper that the agreement "should be contingent on respecting human rights and international law. Until Israel is in compliance with international law, I don’t think we should have that trade deal."
She added, “I believe we should stop arms sale to Israel. I believe that we should be using diplomatic pressure to push Israel to respect international law and UN resolutions," and said she also thinks the U.K. should stop arms sales to Saudi Arabia.
The stance of some of the party's candidates on Israel has drawn some criticism from some Jewish groups. In one incident earlier this week, Green Party candidate Tanya Williams, called Israel “a racist and apartheid state,” and in a YouTube video uploaded in January, the deputy leader of the party, Sharer Ali, is heard telling a pro-Palestinian rally in London that, “Just because you observe the niceties of Holocaust Memorial Day it does not mean you have learned the lessons of history.”
Referring to his comments, Bennett told the Jewish Chronicle, " When I am talking about the situation between Palestine and Israel, I focus on the behaviour of the Israeli government." She added that, “Britain’s place in the world should be as a champion of human rights and democracy.”
The Green Party leader has never visited Israel or the West Bank, and told the newspaper she has no plans to visit.  “I have sort of lost my travel lust to be honest,” she said. “I am Australian, I travelled a lot, I came to Europe and I travelled around Asia. These days, when I have holidays, I tend to sit somewhere very quiet in a bit of nature and not move.”

<title>Ex-U.S. President Jimmy Carter says situation in Gaza is 'intolerable' </title>
<date>Sat May 02 21:24:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
	Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter says that eight months after the 50-day  hostilities between Israel and Hamas, the situation in the Gaza Strip is "intolerable."
	Carter's delegation called off a planned visit to Gaza earlier this week, giving no explanation. Speaking Saturday in the West Bank city of Ramallah, however, Carter said he is still determined to work for a Palestinian state. But he lamented that "not one destroyed house has been rebuilt" in Gaza since the war.
	At a press conference with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Carter, 90, also urged the Palestinians to hold elections. "We hope that sometime we'll see elections all over the Palestinian area and east Jerusalem and Gaza and also in the West Bank," AFP reported.
	Carter said that elections were "very important" for "full implementation of the agreement reached between Hamas and Fatah," referring to a reconciliation deal the two sides agreed on last year. There been no election in Gaza or the West Bank for nearly a decade. Though Abbas was meant to leave office in 2009, he has stayed put because there has yet to be an election. The last time the Palestinian parliament met was in 2007, and the last legislative elections were held in 2006.
	Though Carter visited Abbas, he was shunned by Israeli leaders who long have considered him hostile to Israel.
	Although he brokered the first Israeli-Arab peace treaty during his presidency, Carter outraged many Israelis with his 2006 book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid." He's also repeatedly reached out to Gaza's Islamic Hamas leaders, considered terrorists by much of the West.
	Carter was also accompanied by former Norwegian prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland.
	Carter is a member of The Elders Group, an independent group of global leaders who describe themselves as working together for peace and human rights. The Group said ahead of Carter and Brundtland's trip that they were visiting "in a renewed push to promote the two-state solution and to address the root causes of the conflict" in the Mideast.

<title>Israel suspends plan to segregate Israelis, Palestinians on West Bank buses following criticism</title>
<date>Wed May 20 15:25:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon decided Wednesday to suspend a program to separate Israeli and Palestinian bus travel in the West Bank.  
The program, launched Tuesday, stipulated that Palestinian workers would have to return from Israel to the West Bank via the same checkpoint they left and will not be allowed to ride Israeli bus lines.
Deputy Minister of Defense MK Eli Ben-Dahan (Habayit Hayehudi) said on Wednesday in the Knesset that he was "surprised" by the suspension of the program. Responding to a parliamentary question submitted by MK Ofer Shelah, Ben-Dahan said: "I didn't know. I wasn't updated. I only began serving as deputy minister this morning, it's not appropriate to send me to give an answer without me being aware of it." 
President Reuven Rivlin welcomed the suspension of a move that "could have led to an unthinkable separation between bus lines for Jews and Arabs."
"As one who loves the Land of Israel, I have nothing but regret for the discordant voices that we heard this morning, supporting the separation between Jews and Arabs on the basis of ideas that have no place being heard or said," he said.
"Such statements go against the very foundations of the State of Israel, and impact upon our very ability to establish here a Jewish and democratic state," Rivlin added. "Such statements cause great damage to the State of Israel, and to the settlement movement.  It is important we remember that our sovereignty obligates us to prove our ability to live side by side."
Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein also welcomed the decision, saying the program would have presented legal challenges.
Earlier on Wednesday, Zionist Union leader and opposition head Isaac Herzog said "separating Palestinians and Jews on public buses is a warrantless humiliation and a stain on… the country and its citizens." In a Facebook post, Herzog added that the move will fan the flames "of hatred toward Israel around the world."
'This is what apartheid looks like'
"This is another mistake by the prime minister, who… is giving in to a miserable decision that has nothing to do with the country's security," Herzog said, adding that such steps – which "cause unnecessary harm to Israel's image at such a sensitive time" – should have been avoided. "At this time, Israel needs cool-headed and responsible leadership, not haphazard, capitulating steps," he said.
Former Likud Minister of Interior Gideon Sa'ar also criticized the program. The decision, he said, "causes great harm to the settlement [enterprise] in Judea and Samaria and to Israel's image around the world. It cannot remain in place." Sa'ar added that "since it's obvious this decision will be canceled" the program should be promptly scrapped to "minimize the grave damage to Israel and to the settlements."
Zionist Union MK Shelly Yacimovich lashed out at what she called a "chilling" program: "There is no explanation that can erase the stain it casts on Israel," she said. "Dealing with security-related challenges is difficult, but such a blatant separation between Jews and Arabs is a violation of every international moral norm and will exact a heavy toll on Israel."
Meretz leader Zehava Galon said that Ya'alon "gave in to pressure exerted by Jewish settlers, who complained over the large number of Palestinians on the buses." Ethnic separation on buses, she said, is "unacceptable in a democratic country."
"This is what apartheid looks like," said Galon. "Separate bus lines for Palestinians and Jews prove that democracy and occupation cannot coexist."
On the other side of political spectrum, Habayit Hayehudi MK Moti Yogev – who also chairs the subcommittee on Judea and Samaria in the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee – welcomed the launch, saying it provides "better service and security to both populations."
Yogev said Wednesday that the previous decision to allow Palestinians laborers to ride the buses used by West Bank settlers "caused sexual harassment, theft and even feelings of insecurity," while the overcrowded buses made it impossible "for the elderly and the young [passengers] who require public transit."  Yogev added that those who criticize the program "don't know the reality and their statements are "hypocritical, disingenuous and irresponsible."

Short transcript:
(Scroll down for the full clip)
Livni: There is a huge gap between criticizing a policy or having a debate or asking Israel questions and boycotting and putting sanctions against Israel, which is basically a collective punishment.
David: Did you agree with the sanctions, the equivalent BDS movement against apartheid South Africa?
Livni: If I may, we have sanctions on Iran and I am here to say they should be kept and to remove it at once.
David: What about the South African ones?
Livni: Yes, I did that, but there is a difference because there is no apartheid in Israel.

<title>Last president of apartheid South Africa: Sanctions no way to solve Israeli-Palestinian conflict</title>
<date>Sun Jun 21 16:21:08 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
Frederik Willem de Klerk, the last president of South Africa under apartheid, said in an interview with an Israeli radio channel that he is firmly opposed to international sanctions against Israel as a means to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and that he finds comparisons of Israel to apartheid South Africa "odious."
"I think sanctions are more counterproductive than helpful to change any country on the course it is taking," de Klerk said, according to excerpts from the interview released on Israel Radio's website on Sunday.  
"In the case of South Africa our experience has been that sanctions sometimes delayed the reforms, it had the effect of driving the white population, who at that stage had all the power, into a corner, and they resisted it fiercely," de Klerk told Israel Radio.
According to de Klerk, the sanctions against South Africa hurt the black population much more than it did the white population it was targeting.
Regarding comparisons between the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the policy of racial segregation in South Africa, known as apartheid, de Klerk said: "I think comparisons are odious and wouldn't like to draw direct comparisons. I prefer dialogue and negotiation as a way to get governments to change their attitudes."
De Klerk also conveyed his concerns about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, saying it can "explode into something that can cause big waves far beyond the borders of Israel itself." De Klerk added that he would like to see a resolution to the conflict, but said that he does not believe sanctions would be a productive means to that end. 
De Klerk served as South Africa president from 1989 to May 1994 and brokered the end of apartheid. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 along with Nelson Mandela for his role in the transformation of the country into a multi-racial democracy.

<title>Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken: Israel’s settlers have won</title>
<date>Wed Jun 24 08:44:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
It's not easy being Amos Schocken, the publisher of Haaretz, in present-day Israel. The Israeli bon ton is distancing itself from him, and he and his newspaper have become a target for the barbs of right-wing organizations, who portray the newspaper as anti-Zionist and as a fifth column. And those are some of the milder descriptions.
For Schocken, 70, everything began with family. His German-born grandfather, Salman Schocken, began his career as an uneducated shopkeeper and became an economic phenomenon. Along with his varied business interests and the chain of department stores that he built and managed, he was an impressive autodidact who read books on philosophy, history, the humanities and Judaism. He provided financial support for quite a number of Jewish philosophers and intellectuals, and was the patron of Israel's Nobel laureate for literature, S.Y. Agnon.
In 1934, when the Nazi party came to power, Salman Schocken, an ardent Zionist, decided to immigrate to Palestine. There he became a member of the board of the Jewish National Fund, and helped to purchase land in Haifa Bay. In 1935, he added to his publishing empire a local newspaper that he purchased for 23,000 pounds sterling. It was called Haaretz.
"My father told me a story," says Amos Schocken. "My grandfather participated in meetings of the JNF board of directors. The representatives of the 'settlers' of that time, the settlement movement that wanted to establish kibbutzim and moshavim, would come to ask for money for their projects. Some of the requests were approved, some rejected. Suddenly my grandfather realized that what had been rejected at one meeting would reappear at the next one.
"Dr. Arthur Ruppin (a leader of the Jewish settlement movement in Palestine) was sitting beside him. So my grandfather asks: 'Dr. Ruppin, I don't understand. At the last meeting we decided we were not approving this settlement. Why has it come up again?' And Ruppin answered: 'Mr. Schocken, you don't understand. In Palestine there's no such thing as no. No just means it's been put off until the next meeting.'" Some might say that Amos Schocken also doesn't understand that there's no such thing as 'no,' especially when it comes to peace plans and withdrawals.
Grandfather Salman gave the newspaper to Amos' father, Gershom Schocken, who was chief editor and publisher from 1939. After his death, in 1990, Amos became the publisher. The paper's guiding principles have remained clearly leftist (Amos Schocken told me he only once vote for Likud – in 1973, after the Yom Kippur War, because he felt Prime Minister Golda Meir had unleashed a catastrophe).
Haaretz opposes Israel’s continued occupation of the West Bank. It is critical of official bodies in Israel – including the Israel Defense Forces. This often elicits anger from the Israeli public, as happened last year during Operation Protective Edge, when Haaretz published a piece by Gideon Levy ("Lowest deeds from the loftiest heights") that called the Israel Air Force a “death squadron”.
I met Schocken, who is also one of Israel’s most important art collectors, at the Haaretz offices in south Tel Aviv.
Amos Schocken, as the publisher of Haaretz, do you still believe in peace?
"Of course, there's no other option."
After such a long period when peace efforts have failed time after time, isn't that messianic blindness?
"Not at all. On the contrary, I think that there's messianic blindness in Israel's decision to prevent peace at all costs, by continuing the settlement enterprise rather than giving it up. That, in effect, is the strategy of the Israeli government."
Was the evacuation of Gush Katif [Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip] justified in the way in was carried out?
"Yes, every evacuation is justified. Settlement in the occupied territories is like theft – you come, take territory that isn't yours and settle there. It's not recognized by international law, but they look for all kinds of ways to make this theft kosher."
Jewish settlers cry before Israeli police remove them from the Neve Dekalim settlement in the Gush Katif bloc of Jewish settlements, in the southern Gaza Strip, August 17, 2005. (Reuters)
Why do you consider it ethical to accept the occupation when it comes to Sheikh Munis [now part of Ramat Aviv where Tel Aviv University stands] and not when it comes to Ariel [in the West Bank]?
"Because it received international recognition, and the Arabs recognized it too. The Jordanians and the Egyptians recognized it, and even Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas recognizes it." Bear in mind that even Israel recognizes Ariel only as an Apartheid presence. Its territory is not part of Israel, its Israeli population is under Israeli law, but its Palestinian neighbors are under Israeli martial law.
Do you really think they believe that? You must have seen the heated interview between Dan Margalit and MK Jamal Zahalka (Balad), when Zahalka shouted at him: "This is Sheikh Munis; you won't throw me out of here."
"So let's test them. We'll tell them: 'Look, this is our offer, these are the borders, and these are the security arrangements.' Let's assume that in any case they won't agree and they'll say they also want Abu Kabir and Sheikh Munis, Israel will then say: 'Friends, that's our limit. We can't come to an agreement.'"
And you'll agree to say, "That's our limit"?
"I think so. After all, the Jews' right to this land is a somewhat strange right. Someone comes and says: 'In some history from 2,000 years ago I was here, and therefore it's mine and I have rights.' According to this logic, our rights in Hebron are no less than our rights in Yavne (a city in proper Israel). That's clear to me. But we cannot deny the Arabs' rights to Sheikh Munis and Abu Kabir. Our way not to deny their rights and simultaneously to protect our rights is to say: 'Okay, in a situation where everyone has rights in the region – let's share.' We'll give up the right to Hebron, and they'll give up the right to Sheikh Munis."
Going back to Ariel University for a minute, would you hire someone who studied there?
"Of course. We also have settlers who work here."
Do you consider Ariel University legitimate?
"Everything that's there shouldn't be there. I was visiting Chancellor Yigal Cohen-Orgad at the university. I said to him: 'Great, but why here?'"
About two years ago, at a panel discussion, you said that the settlers have won. Do you still believe that?
"When Ayelet Shaked [Habayit Hayehudi] is appointed justice minister – there's no greater victory than that. It's clear that the settlers have won; the settlers are running the country. They are only a handful. Count all the people who live in the territories ­– they are not a significant percentage of the country's inhabitants. But their influence is not insignificant at all."
But the most recent election proved that the majority of Israelis thinks like settlers even if they don’t all live in the territories.
"I don't think so. I think that the public wants peace, but doesn't believe it's possible. The public isn't interested in the settlements; they're not on its agenda and I don't think people travel there much. On the other hand, all the heirs of Gush Emunim [the settlement movement] are highly talented people who are very focused on maintaining constant growth in the settlement enterprise. I can understand the attraction of the settlers, because it seems that while all the others are interested in a career, in money and in their private life, these are people who are determined to implement a significant strategic and diplomatic step. They have a vision."

Do you envy the right for its vision?
"The Zionist vision before the establishment of the state was also a very significant motivating force, and this movement became important within a few decades. It’s good that there's a vision for the country, but to say that I envy this cannibalistic vision – not at all."
Does the left still have a chance of winning an election in Israel?
"I have no idea. It depends on a lot of things, among them it depends on leadership."
Is there something they should have done in the past election?
"You could say that what Labor leader Isaac Herzog should have done is to hang signs reading 'Herzog will divide Jerusalem,' to tell the truth. You have to tell the truth rather than be vague."
Would that have helped him?
"I don't know. If not this time, maybe next time. If not next time, then the time after that. Jerusalem is already divided – there are entire areas that Israelis don't enter, except for settlers who are trying slowly but surely to expel the Arab population."
How did you feel about the atmosphere here before the election – the tension, the hatred?
"Maybe because I don't hate anyone, I don't understand why they keep discussing the issue of hatred. It's true that the comments on Facebook and the comments on the Internet are sometimes shocking, but I must say I don't feel hatred toward the settlers, or toward the ultra-Orthodox, or toward anyone. I also hope that the newspaper doesn't convey hatred. Hatred is not a tool that Haaretz should use."
So what do you think about the comments of artist Yair Garbuz, actress Anat Waxman et al.?
"They're not important."
Garbuz railed against those who kiss amulets. Your grandfather was also attracted to Jewish mysticism.
"Yes, that's true. But let's put it this way: The mysticism that my grandfather was interested in is on a higher level than the people who have never read a book in this field. Still, I'm not impressed by what Garbuz said. I think that the way in which someone expresses his faith and his feelings is entirely personal, and one person can't judge another. It's a personal matter."
Do you think that Garbuz's comments are legitimate?
"Comments are legitimate, but are they helpful? Are they wise? That's quite another question."
Schocken believes that Israel's political strategy in recent years has been to empower the settlements. He also believes Israel’s recent attempts at peacemaking have not been in good faith. "Maybe late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin did think about that, but even Ehud Barak, when he was prime minister, bragged about the fact that he didn't give back any territory during his term. Today, Habayit Hayehudi Chairman Naftali Bennett, says 'Not even one centimeter.' So it's clear that Israel isn't interested in peace. Israel's behavior is not that of a country that wants peace."
Do the Palestinians in Gaza want peace?
"This line of arguing, in which we reject something in advance by saying, 'They won't agree so there's no point' is dishonest in my opinion. And why is it dishonest? Because they aren't saying, 'We'll wait until they agree, and until then we won't build settlements.' They're saying the opposite: 'We'll build settlements, we don't care.' Then we can't come with complaints against the Palestinians, when every day, every hour, we're preventing any possibility of peace."
Should we ignore Hamas' calls against making peace?
"We could reach an agreement with Abbas. Hamas doesn't want to reach an agreement? So after a while, either we'll reach an agreement with Hamas too, or we won't. But by then you'll establish a state in the West Bank. After all, we can't use Hamas as an excuse to prevent an agreement in the West Bank. When Hamas and the PA formed a national unity government, we might have thought that Hamas would join the framework of the PA. But Netanyahu rejected that. He wanted the opposite."
Maybe he was right. Six months later there was a war.
"He made it happen. The war broke out because Israel pushed them into a corner, with the siege and the intolerable situation in Gaza. After all, what happened when the three boys, Eyal Yifrah, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Fraenkel were kidnapped? Israel exploited the opportunity during the search for them, and re-arrested Palestinians released in the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange. They acted against Hamas members that had nothing to do with the search. What could Hamas have done in Gaza other than what it did?

"Let's go further back, to the peace initiative of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. The prime minister never came to the Israeli public and said it was important. Throughout the entire Kerry initiative he torpedoed it until he finally destroyed it by not releasing the fourth round of prisoners as he had promised. When that happens, I can understand why Hamas asks, 'Why is Abbas talking with that man, who has no intention of making peace? The Jews understand only force, regardless of whether we give up our historic viewpoint.' After all, Abbas is not saying what Hamas says, that the PA wants to eliminate the State of Israel. He says, 'I want to make do with 22 percent of the territory.'"
So according to you, first we'll reach an agreement with the Palestinians and give up 22 percent of the territory. But the conflict still won't be over, because Gaza is home to a population of 1.7 million people who presumably say no to peace.
"You could have said that about the peace with Egypt, too: 'If we make peace with Egypt, that still doesn't solve the problem with Syria.' We could have reached an agreement that wouldn't threaten Israel's security. And we can make security arrangements that differ from when we evacuated Gaza without an agreement."
What do you think of the situation on the Temple Mount?
"I think that we have to reach a situation in which after peace they'll find an arrangement that will enable everyone to pray."
And now, in the present situation?
"I think we have to be very careful."
Isn't the State of Israel discriminating against the Jews in this connection?
"To hear that Jews are discriminated against in Israel is something that has to be rejected out of hand. The Jews rule, the Jews decide what will happen, the Jews tell a Palestinian student whether or not he will get to university, whether or not a Palestinian artist can travel to an exhibition that he was invited to take part in at a New York museum.
"First let's allow the Arabs, the Palestinians, to go from place to place, and then we'll talk about these rights. The fact that Jews are whining about discrimination against them? Give me a break..."

Aren't they being denied a basic right of freedom of worship?
"And at the same time pushing Palestinian families out of Silwan [in East Jerusalem]? It's one versus the other. These things inflame the situation and turn their ascent to the Temple Mount into something explosive. If relations were normal we could ask: What would happen if we were to go to Rachel's Tomb and pay $10 a ticket to the PA Tourism Ministry? Nothing. They would earn $10, we would enter Rachel's Tomb, and everything would be fine. And when they come here to the mosque they would pay $10. You can find solutions if you want to. But when the Jews say, 'It's all mine and nothing is yours,' then let's not discuss some place where they claim they're discriminated against.
Several controversial articles have been published in recent years in Haaretz, including one, from April 2013, by Amira Hass, a Haaretz journalist who covers the Palestinians living in the West Bank. Her piece began with the sentence: “Throwing stones is the birthright and duty of anyone subject to foreign rule,” and it outraged Israelis. Opponents of the newspaper claimed that it was granting a license to kill, and some people demanded that the authorities "restrict the newspaper's ability to publish such incitement."
Do you define Hamas as a terror organization?
"Any killing of civilians, children and women is terror. When you act to kill people who are not involved, that's terror."
Is there another way for a minority to confront a majority?
At this point Schocken presents an article in Haaretz by Yitzhak Laor, who quotes philosopher Frantz Fanon, known for his writing on colonialism and the confrontation between Third World countries and the European powers that occupied them. "Fanon in effect says: There's no choice but to silence the arrogance of the settler, because capitalism didn't allow its subjects to become free," says Schocken.
"When you apply this to Israel you say: We aren't allowing them to become free. According to that theory, terror is a solution that you can condemn and you can disagree with, but it's an inevitable solution."
The right's main accusation against Haaretz is that you have abandoned the Zionist consensus and become anti-Zionist.
"I think that the opposite is true: The right has changed the definition of Zionism. My definition of Zionism is a viewpoint or an ideology that sees the establishment of a national home in the Land of Israel, in the context of a Jewish and democratic state, as a solution for the Jewish people. That is Haaretz's viewpoint. The viewpoint of those who call themselves 'Zionists' today, and whom I consider anti-Zionists, is 'the Land of Israel for Am Israel (the Jewish people).' While the establishment of a Jewish home for the Jewish people in the Land of Israel doesn't eliminate the possibility of Arabs living anywhere in the country, and does not preclude a Palestinian state, the Zionism of the settlers is the Land of Israel for the Jewish people – and there is no place for Arabs."
Did the State of Israel undermine the newspaper's freedom of expression, in your opinion?
"I think so. For example, I think the Boycott Law [the law allowing a lawsuit for damages against anyone who calls for a boycott against Israel] is a real blow to freedom of expression."
Are you pleased with Haaretz's image?
"I think that our image among people who read Haaretz is good. People who don't read it, or here and there see some part that annoys them, have an incorrect image of the newspaper. I think people who read Haaretz know that what Haaretz says it says because it believes in good faith that it's the right thing for Israel, and not because it's serving some agenda against Israel or in favor of anyone else.
"Both Herzog and [Meretz leader Zehava] Galon complained to us that we were critical of them. It's true that in terms of politics we think that Netanyahu's leadership is dangerous for Israel, and we thought that a different leadership could bring about a change, but that still doesn't grant the other side immunity from criticism."

How many subscriptions were canceled after Gideon Levy's article "Lowest deeds from loftiest heights"?
"I think we had 800 cancellations of daily subscriptions, and a similar number of Friday subscriptions."
Is that a serious blow?
"Yes."
‘We're okay financially’
The newspaper industry in Israel has undergone a shake-up, and that includes Haaretz. Schocken was criticized quite a bit for letting two new foreign partners join the newspaper during his tenure: oligarch Leonid Nevzlin and German media mogul Alfred DuMont, who passed away recently.
What is Haaretz's situation at present?
"All in all it's doing all right. We implemented several capital-related moves in recent years that eliminated our bank debts. In 2006 and 2011 we took on partners, and then we also realized our holding in [Israeli Web portal] Walla!, so that financially we're okay. Still it's hard, because advertising revenues keep eroding, and we have to keep taking care of expenditures. I can't say that we weren't hurt by all these cuts, but the alternative would be for the newspaper to cease to exist. We made several strategic decisions, like charging for the digital edition, which also brings us income. We are now approaching 21,000 digital subscribers in Hebrew and almost 20,000 in English."
Why do you continue to operate the paper if profitability is uncertain?
"First of all, there is profit. And I also think, unfortunately, it is a dual purpose business. I think Haaretz is an important institution in Israeli society, and if ceases to exist things will be worse. It's important that there will be newspapers like Haaretz and like TheMarker (Haaretz' business daily) in Israel."
One of your partners is the German DuMont family, whose patriarch was a member of the Nazi party. And the second, Leonid Nevzlin, is an oligarch who some might say represents things TheMarker fights.
"I don't see any fault in the fact that Israel does business with someone whose parents were Nazis. In the case of Alfred Neven DuMont's father, there's also a difference between being a Nazi who believes in that ideology and promotes it, and being a Nazi in Germany, at a time when if you weren't one it can be assumed you may not have survived – especially if you were the owner of a newspaper. There's a difference between doing business with someone who was an active Nazi and someone who was a party member, operated a newspaper and published what Goebbels allowed him to publish.
"But in any case, I made this deal with a man who was 18 years old when the war ended, who was not in the Hitler Youth Movement, who wasn't in the army, whose family actually smuggled him out, and who is a true friend of Israel. [The interview was conducted before Alfred DuMont passed away at the beginning of June.] I don't think that anyway sons should be punished for the sins of their fathers; that seems unreasonable to me."
And what about Nevzlin? He was harshly criticized in Russia at the time.
"We had to learn the entire story, so we thoroughly examined those incidents. We read all the paperwork of the court decisions in Russia, and we saw that there was no judicial procedure there. It was like a Stalinist court. When Russia submitted an extradition request for Nevzlin, Israel’s State Prosecutor's Office said that there was no basis for extradition. The Russians actually brought no proof of their claims. The Israeli Supreme Court approved the State Prosecutor’s decision that there was no basis for extradition and for an indictment."
‘It’s hard to detach yourself from Israel’
Being a publisher is a heavy burden.
"Yes, it's a burden. And in Israel sometimes it means being in the trenches."
Are you afraid that if Haaretz shutters on your watch, you'll feel you were unable to safeguard the family project?
"I really don't know what the future of this industry is, so I don't look at it that way at all. When I was 26 years old, I finished my master's degree in the United States and I stayed there to work for almost two more years. After a year my father came to visit me and said: 'I'll soon have to appoint a new CEO for the newspaper, so decide whether you're coming back. If so – then it's you.' So I came back. My two children recently completed their studies in the United States and are working there. I wouldn’t want to come to my son, Roni, and say what my father said then. Although he religiously follows events in Israel and has opinions, and I do think that he could have a job here."
So what are the options?
"I don't know. At The Wall Street Journal the owners were not the operators most of the time, but were on the board of directors."
Why wouldn't you want to put him in charge?
"I don't know. Freedom."
How do you think Israel will look 50 years from now?
"I'm very concerned."
Are you afraid of the present leadership?
"Yes. I think that if the court in Israel gradually becomes a political court, that would be a catastrophe."
Are you in despair?
"Not in despair, we're in battle. I think that if this government lasts and advances its programs, this step of undermining freedom of speech will progress to other things. You can't have an apartheid regime, a discriminatory regime, an oppressive regime, without controlling the media."
Would you advise a relative to stay in the country?
"Listen, it's very hard to detach yourself from Israel."
What's hard?
"Israeli-ness. After all, there is such a thing. It's possible that I experience it very differently from the way it's experienced in other places because Tel Aviv, as we saw in the election, is something entirely different from other parts of the country, or from some parts. But Israeli-ness is language, Israeli-ness is culture.
Do you like Israeli-ness?
"I live in it, don't I?"

<title>Clinton 'alarmed' over calls for Israel boycott, urges bi-partisan action</title>
<date>Mon Jul 06 20:01:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton expressed her alarm last week over the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanction movement, and said countering it was a priority that stretches "across party lines," vowing to always "stand up for Israel" if she becomes president.
In a July 2 letter sent to Israeli-American businessman Haim Saban – a major donor and fundraiser for Clinton – she stressed the need to counter the BDS campaign "with information and advocacy" and to "fight back against further attempts to delegitimize Israel."
In the letter, the former secretary of state asked Saban for his advice "on how leaders and communities across America can work together to counter BDS."
"From Congress and state legislature to boardrooms and classrooms, we need to engage all people of good faith," she wrote, in order to explain "why the BDS campaign is counterproductive to the pursuit of peace and harmful to Israelis and Palestinians alike."
According to Clinton, the BDS movement dictates to both Israelis and Palestinians how to resolve the conflict, while seeking to "punish" Israel. And while she reiterated her support for the two-state solution, Clinton said the BDS campaign "is not the path to peace," which can only be reached through direct negotiations.
Clinton also said she was concerned by "attempts to compare Israel to South African apartheid," particularly at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise. Israel, she noted, "is a vibrant democracy in a region dominated by autocracy, and it faces existential threats to its survival."
Citing her tenure as senator and as secretary of state, Clinton mentioned she had opposed "dozens of anti-Israel resolutions at the UN, the Human Rights Council, and other organizations," and has stood by Israel in the wake of the Goldstone Report and when the Palestinians tried to make unilateral moves at the UN. "Time after time," she concluded, "I have made it clear that America will always stand up for Israel – and that's what I’ll always do as President."
Ending on a personal note, Clinton recalled her first visit to Israel and her emotional attachment to the country: "The Jewish state is a modern day miracle – a vibrant bloom in the middle of the desert. We must nurture and protect it."
Saban, an Israeli-American businessman, is considered one of the biggest donors to the Clintons over the years. Last month, Saban and casino mogul Sheldon Adelson hosted a summit in Las Vegas that brought together representatives from various Jewish organizations to discuss ways of countering BDS on U.S. campuses.
Clinton's letter to Saban – and it's dissemination by Saban's spokespeople and Clinton's election headquarters – are meant to garner support among the American Jewish community, in particular Jewish voters who are unhappy about President Barack Obama's policy towards Israel and are considering voting for a Republican nominee.

<title>Growing BDS movement raises alarm among Israeli leaders</title>
<date>Tue Jul 07 14:28:38 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
AP — Ten years ago, a small group of Palestinian activists had a novel idea: inspired by the anti-apartheid movement, they called for a global boycott movement against Israel as a nonviolent method to promote the Palestinian struggle for independence.
Long confined to the sidelines, the so-called BDS movement appears to be gaining momentum - so much so that Israel has identified it as a strategic threat on a par with Palestinian militant groups and the Iranian nuclear program. While Israel says the movement is rooted in anti-Semitism, its decentralized organization and language calling for universal human rights have proven difficult to counter, resulting in a string of recent victories that have alarmed Israeli leaders.
"We are now beginning to harvest the fruits of 10 years of strategic, morally consistent and undeniably effective BDS campaigning," said Omar Barghouti, one of the group's co-founders. "BDS is winning the battles for hearts and minds across the world, despite Israel's still hegemonic influence among governments in the U.S. and Europe."
The BDS movement - named for its call for boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel - began as an idea by 170 Palestinian civil society groups worldwide in 2005. It has grown into a worldwide network of thousands of volunteers lobbying corporations, artists and academic institutions to sever ties with Israel.
Its members include campus activists, church groups and even liberal American Jews disillusioned by Israeli policies.
Most worrying for Israel, some of the group's core positions toward products made in West Bank settlements are starting to be embraced by European governments. Although the EU says it opposes boycotts of Israel, it is exploring guidelines for labeling settlement products, which many in Israel fear could be a precursor to a full-fledged ban.
At a time when peace efforts are frozen and show no sign of getting back on track under a new hardline government, Israelis fear such sentiment will increase.
"The concern is that there will be a spillover to a much wider phenomenon that will become mainstream and erode support for Israel," said Emmanuel Nahshon of Israel's Foreign Ministry.
The BDS movement has three goals: to end Israel's occupation of territories captured in the 1967 Mideast war, to end discrimination suffered by Arab citizens of Israel, and to promote the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to family properties lost in the war surrounding Israel's creation in 1948.
For Israel, this last position is nothing less than a call for its destruction. Israel opposes the Palestinian "right of return," saying a massive influx of refugees would mean the end of the country as a Jewish state. The international community favors a "two-state solution" creating a Palestinian state alongside Israel, and even Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has indicated willingness to compromise on the refugee issue under a final peace deal.
Barghouti, a U.S.-educated engineer who also holds a graduate degree at Israel's Tel Aviv University, said the BDS movement is "completely neutral" on the political solution to the conflict. But he said he represents the Palestinian "consensus," and any deal that "undermines our basic rights under international law and perpetuates the colonial oppression" is unacceptable.
As for his attendance at a university he asks others to boycott, he said Palestinians "cannot possibly observe the same boycott guidelines as asked of internationals," adding that the "indigenous population" is entitled to all services they can get from the system.
Israeli leaders consider the movement to be the latest in a history of antagonists out to destroy the Jewish people.
"We are in the midst of a great struggle being waged against the state of Israel, an international campaign to blacken its name," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said recently. "It is not connected to our actions. It is connected to our very existence."
The BDS movement is led by a West Bank-based national committee with representatives from around the world, which sets guidelines but allows local branches to decide their own strategy. It focuses on battles with a reasonable chance of success. So some of the biggest companies active in Israel, such as Microsoft and Intel, have not been targeted.
Battles have taken place in U.S. food co-ops and city councils. The movement has helped organize several boycotts by U.S. and British academic unions and has made inroads on American campuses. Roughly a dozen student governments have approved divestment proposals.
Entertainers, including Roger Waters, Elvis Costello and Lauryn Hill have refused to perform in Israel. The BDS movement also claims responsibility for pressuring some large companies to stop or alter operations in Israel, including carbonated drink maker SodaStream, French construction company Veolia and international security firm G4S.
Last month, Britain's national student union joined the movement. Last week, the top legislative body of the United Church of Christ voted to divest from companies with business in the Israeli-occupied territories, following a similar move by the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) last year. The Episcopal Church and Mennonite Church USA also considered divestment proposals recently, with the Episcopals rejecting it and the Mennonites deferring action for two years.
Perhaps the biggest blow was last month's announcement by the chief executive of French mobile phone giant Orange that he wanted to end his partnership with Israeli carrier Partner Communications. He cited his desire to improve business in the Arab world. Although CEO Stephane Richard later traveled to Israel to apologize, Orange and Partner announced plans to unwind their deal.
The idea of boycotts is extremely sensitive in Israel. The Nazis launched a nationwide boycott of Jewish businesses and artists - often accompanied by acts of violence and anti-Semitic slogans - in the 1930s Germany ahead of the Holocaust. In the 1970s and 1980s, Arab countries pressured companies doing business with them to shun Israel. Currently, Israel is fending off attempts by the boycotters to compare Israeli policies in the West Bank to South African apartheid.
"The attacks on the Jews were always preceded by the slander of the Jews," Netanyahu recently said.
BDS activists deny being fueled by anti-Semitism, saying their battle is against Israel, not Jews. They point to a small but growing number of Jewish supporters, including the "Jewish Voice for Peace," whose 9,000 dues-paying members support a boycott of Israel.
Naomi Dann, JVP's media coordinator, said the stance stems from frustration over failed U.S.-backed peace efforts. She said that while the group recognizes the Jewish attachment to Israel, it can't come at the expense of Palestinians.
"It's not about destroying Israel," she said. "But full equal rights and a democratic society are more important than preserving the Jewish character of the state."
It remains difficult to quantify the BDS movement's actual achievements.
Leading global companies, including Microsoft, Google, Apple and Intel, maintain operations in Israel. Major entertainers, including Paul McCartney, Lady Gaga, Madonna and Rihanna, have performed in Israel in recent years.
A February report by Israel's Finance Ministry concluded the BDS movement has had a negligible economic impact. But it outlined some worst-case scenarios, including EU government-led boycotts or cancellation of free-trade agreements. Likewise, a recent study by the Rand Corp. said that while the BDS movement "has not yet had a significant negative effect" on Israel, it is growing. It noted Israeli leaders' fears it could have "substantial detrimental effects" on the economy.
Last month, Jewish billionaires Sheldon Adelson and Haim Saban led a Las Vegas fundraiser to fight the BDS movement at U.S. universities. Israel's justice minister, Ayeled Shaked, instructed her ministry to prepare "legal steps" against the movement. This week, Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Rodham Clinton said she opposed the BDS movement.
David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the Washington Policy for Near East Policy and former member of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's peace team, said Israel must show it is serious about the creation of a Palestinian state to slow the momentum.
"You can reduce its scope, its impact by making clear when the prime minister ... says he supports two states for two people that he is not then going to say Israel will settle in what will be a future Palestinian state," he said.

<title>Pioneer Jewish South African freedom fighter calls Israel 'apartheid state'</title>
<date>Tue Jul 28 17:58:21 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
Veteran Jewish anti-apartheid activist Denis Goldberg, whose release after two decades in a South African prison was aided by Israel, and who then lived briefly in the Jewish state before leaving in protest, told a Johannesburg gathering that Israel is an apartheid state, the Middle East Monitor reported on Tuesday.
Noting that critics of this view protest that Palestinian citizens of Israel, unlike blacks in apartheid South Africa, vote and serve in their country's parliament, Goldberg said, "You don't need to be like South Africa to be an apartheid state, there is a definition in international law through the UNESCO declaration on apartheid," he said.
Apartheid exists, he said, in states that enforce laws and policies that discriminate between people on the basis of race or religion, and this holds true in Israel proper as well as in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. He was one of a panel of anti-apartheid activists discussing the lessons that struggle holds for the Palestinian cause.
Goldberg, 82, one of the original members of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the African National Congress, was sentenced with Nelson Mandela and other activists to life in prison in the 1964 Rivonia treason trial. He was released in 1985 with Israel's intercession, then went to live on a kibbutz, but moved to London months later, denouncing Israel's war in Lebanon, its occupation of the Palestinian territories, and its close ties with South Africa.
"There is no doubt in my mind that Israel is an apartheid state," Goldberg told the gathering. "Having lived through apartheid in South Africa, I cannot allow in my name the same kind of oppression to go on."
He added, "I have to be an opponent of the exclusionist policies of Zionism, but let me say straight away that I have to be opposed to the exclusionary policies of the feudal Arab states of the Middle East as well."

<title>Roger Waters sets the record straight: I hate apartheid, not Israel</title>
<date>Sun Aug 02 02:30:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
The tires of the taxicab crunch softly along the gravel driveway leading up to the house. The gray building, hidden from the street like all the houses here, isn’t so large for Southampton, this very affluent suburb on Long Island, New York. A tiny house-number sign, by the side of the entrance to the driveway, is the only way you know you’ve reached your destination. The taxi driver who picked me up at the local bus station tells me Paris Hilton has a house nearby. He doesn’t know who lives in the gray house.
I ring the doorbell at the appointed time, and hear a dog barking. Roger Waters opens the door, barefoot, in shorts and a faded polo shirt. His cheeks are covered with white stubble, his blue-gray eyes seem a little weary and his gray hair is disheveled. He shuffles a little as he walks, but his body is youthful and his smile endearing. Hours of wavering over whether to greet this idol of my youth with a handshake or a hug are dispensed with instantly: He embraces me. We’ve never met before.
I follow him back into the two-story house. An American home with paintings on the walls and broad carpets on the floors, a grand piano in the living room. Outside is a heated swimming pool, whose water is kept surprisingly warm, even early on a chilly morning. Next to the pool is a small gym. There are a number of bedrooms, some just for guests. And, of course, a recording studio.
The garden is impeccably maintained, and vases of freshly cut blue flowers can be found throughout the house. Every window looks out on a gorgeous view: a big pond with wide green marshes behind it and, beyond that, the ocean, whose waves can be heard clearly. The closest house is a good distance away, and the tennis court of the Swedish neighbor lies in between. On the two-hour bus ride from Manhattan, people were talking about the new helicopter service to the town: just $400 each way, a real bargain.
Laurie Durning, Waters’ fourth wife, welcomes me with a friendly handshake and we sit down on the garden patio, their 11-year-old white dog joining us too. Laurie is very knowledgeable about what’s happening in the Middle East, and she accompanied Roger on his unforgettable concert in Israel in the summer of 2006. She says she could feel the audience’s love, maybe even more than her husband did.
A lot of chickpeas have since grown in the fields of Neve Shalom, where the concert took place before a crowd of 54,000 Israelis. Waters says he remembers all the lavish goodies that producer Shuki Weiss arranged to have backstage. I remember that incredible, magical night, but it’s difficult to tell Waters that – he doesn’t like hearing fans gush about “How you changed my life, blah, blah, blah.”
To him, Pink Floyd – the band responsible for the mysterious and legendary soundtrack of our youth, the greatest-band-of-all-time, in my view – is primarily a job he left behind 30 years ago. His 20 years with the band, especially the latter ones, became a nightmare for him, mainly due to a rancorous relationship with guitarist David Gilmour.
The masterpiece “Shine on You Crazy Diamond,” about initial lead singer, Syd Barrett, is a heartbreaking tale of mental illness and the drugs that precipitated it. Waters says that if Barrett hadn’t become ill and stopped writing, he may never have started writing songs himself. Barrett’s premature retirement spurred Roger to write what became the bulk of Pink Floyd’s work.
An Englishman in New York
On his right hand, Waters wears a ring he hasn’t taken off since 1968. The wedding band on his other hand has been replaced several times over the years. He has three children from two of his previous marriages (his first wife died). Durning, with whom he does not have children, is a film producer from New York.
For many years now, Waters has been an Englishman in New York, as Sting once sang. I tell him this as he leads me upstairs to my room, and he smiles. The couple is currently building a new summer house, not far from this one. It will be much larger, in the hope that the kids and grandkids will come to visit more often.
The man who once sang “Money, it’s a crime” lives well. He also has a townhouse in midtown Manhattan and a vacation home in England, which he doesn’t use much. Two shiny black Mercedes sedans are parked out front; one is a convertible. Still, he comes across as a modest guy, devoid of rock-star pretensions. Here at home, at least.
He has a British personal manager, Mark Fenwick, who’s been working with him since he left Pink Floyd, and a Hungarian butler, Csaba Kralik, who’s been with him for 15 years. The latter doesn’t live with the couple, but attends to all their needs and accompanies them on their travels.
Peace activist Nurit Peled-Elhanan, daughter of the late Israeli Maj. Gen. Matti Peled, keeps Waters regularly updated on what’s happening with the occupation. He also has a friend in Bil’in who sends him weekly pictures from the protests there. After the Neve Shalom concert, he visited Israel and the territories once more as a guest of UNRWA, and made a point of putting his signature on the West Bank separation barrier. He feels that “The Wall” is Pink Floyd’s best album.
In recent years, Waters has devoted a lot of his time to the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement. Every artist who wants to perform in Israel receives a letter of rebuke from him. Neil Young ended up canceling during last summer’s Gaza war, but Waters says no artist ever admits they canceled because of him. Cyndi Lauper, Robbie Williams and even Pink Floyd’s old sound engineer, Alan Parsons – to name a few – did not heed his entreaties and performed in Israel. But there’s no question he’s created a new international mood.
Waters’ involvement in the struggle against Israel actually began after his performance here nine years ago. At the time, he, too, received letters urging him not to perform, but he ignored them. Initially, he was supposed to perform in Tel Aviv, but then he shifted the venue to Neve Shalom, with the idea that it would be an Arab and Jewish audience. But the Arabs didn’t come, and he was disappointed. Today, he would refuse to perform anywhere in Israel.
“I was so unaware then,” he says. “Artists today are more aware.”
Some of the artists he addresses think he’s off his rocker; others are worried about hurting their livelihood, while some say politics and music should be kept separate. Waters doesn’t accept this. He’s determined to fight the occupation and what he sees as an apartheid state.
Believe whatever you like, but Waters does not hate Israel. He’s deeply outraged at the injustices it perpetrates. When he talks about Israel, it’s with pain, criticism and anger, but not hatred. And anti-Semitism is not part of the picture here, despite the show in which he placed a pig on a Star of David, along with other religious symbols, during his 2013 European tour, which raised that suspicion.
Waters has Jewish grandchildren from his Jewish daughter-in-law. The number tattooed on the forearm of a friend of his mother’s, a French-Jewish Holocaust survivor, left a strong impression on him as a child. He recalls her constant anxiety: “I remember she was terrified for her children. Her kids were not allowed to come out in a canoe with us. You can imagine. Well, you can’t, none of us can imagine. But I remember that, I remember thinking, Why is this woman scared of the river? You know, she was scared of everything; she was scared of her own shadow.”
Why Israel?
It’s hard not to believe him, with his candidness and openness. His house is unlocked; even late at night the doors are wide open. He feels strongly that the injustice done to the Palestinians must be remedied, and he believes he is toiling on behalf of this cause. By doing so, he believes he is also working for the sake of Israelis.
Why this particular injustice and not other, even worse ones? Waters says that during the apartheid era in South Africa, there were plenty of other atrocities happening in the world, but no one asked, why South Africa. Why Israel? Because things can be remedied and changed there, just like in South Africa.
Maybe it all began with his father, a communist and pacifist who was a volunteer ambulance driver during the London Blitz, eventually enlisted in the British Army to fight the Nazis, and was killed by a tank shell in Italy. His body was never found.
In a new film debuting in September, “Roger Waters: The Wall,” Waters is seen playing the trumpet at the spot in southern Italy where his father died, next to a memorial tablet there. From letters his father wrote to his grandmother, Waters learned that his father studied in Jerusalem for two years. His grandfather was also a casualty of war: He was killed in World War I and is buried in France.
Waters never met his father, Eric Fletcher Waters; he was just five and a half months old when Eric was killed in 1944. His mother, Mary, raised him and his brother as a single mother in Cambridge. She was also a communist – and taught her children to pursue justice. His brother is a retired cab driver; their mother died six years ago at 96. Roger would sometimes bring her to Pink Floyd concerts, and says the other band members used to bring their parents, too.
Waters will turn 72 in September. As a child, he thought about becoming a veterinarian, and later studied architecture. He’s a very warm and charming fellow, and fond of drinking white wine. When he does so, he opens up even more and becomes very amusing: You have to see his imitation of Mikhail Gorbachev, whom he once met. He loves to cook, and does so every day. The linguine he made for lunch was spicy enough to make the eyes water. In the evening, he baked a superb tarte tatin. He attached a little yellow note to the baking pan, “Caution, hot. Don’t touch.”
For dinner, which was prepared by two young cooks, he invited a dozen or so friends, many of them Jewish. One, a relative of Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal, mistakenly thought the meal was going to take place in Manhattan. When he realized his error, he simply hired a helicopter to bring him to The Hamptons. A senior American television reporter also joined us.
Antiwar songs
Everything Waters has written in the last few years has a political, mainly antiwar, aspect to it. In one of the new songs he’s still working on, Waters sings in French: “Je suis Charlie, Je suis Juif.” The song was written after the terror attacks in Paris last January. That’s what happens when your father and grandfather were both killed in war.
We sat in the studio until 2 A.M., listening to his new songs. His desk in the studio is piled with papers – new songs with lots of notes and revisions. Late in the morning – he’s a late riser – I saw him sitting in the kitchen half-dressed, writing down lines on a little scrap of paper. In the studio itself, there’s no trace of Pink Floyd. Waters is not nostalgic or sentimental. He’s not a collector of memorabilia. He doesn’t even have a guitar from those days.
He’s in the process of writing an autobiography, played at the Newport Folk Festival last week, and plans to go on another world tour next year. He’s a busy and active man. Once in a while, he plays golf. He also has a pool table in his studio; the Hungarian butler says Waters beats all his guests.
I told Waters that back in my student days, my roommate and I had a strict rule: When one of us was playing Pink Floyd, the other had to stay out of the house. “Dark Side of the Moon” was the soundtrack to many nights of new loves, heart-to-heart talks and personal confessions.
In the hotel back in Manhattan, before setting out for The Hamptons, I had listened to the album once more and found that the magic was still there, even after all these years.
Over the two days I was a guest in his home, we went up to his recording studio twice for long interview sessions. Waters willingly answered every question. At one point, we stopped to watch several fawns that had pranced into the garden to graze.
When and how did your political involvement in the Middle East begin? 
“I got an offer to play in Israel, and that’s where it really started. It really started for me without thinking – because this is how naïve I was in 2006. I didn’t think about it. When my agent did the deal with Shuki Weiss and accepted the gig in [Hayarkon Park] in Tel Aviv, I was engaged in other things, to my eternal shame … but then I started getting emails.”
From whom?
“There were hundreds of different organizations, mainly from the Middle East and North Africa. But there were other places, Europeans, and people saying, ‘Are you sure about this? Do you know about this new organization?’ Because it was new in 2006, BDS. But their voice was very measured and persuasive, and I engaged in a dialogue with them.”
They were telling you not to go?
“Yes, telling me not to come. They said I’d be enabling the occupation. How naïve I must’ve been … Certainly living here in the United States – and presumably it’s the same in the U.K. – the hasbara [Israeli public diplomacy] is extremely powerful.
Eventually, I canceled that gig but went to Neve Shalom instead.”
Who suggested Neve Shalom? Whose idea was that?
“I have no idea. I can’t remember. But I must’ve done a lot of research and I heard about this place – where Jewish people and Christians and Muslims try to live together in an agricultural community, and they educate their children together through all the trials and tribulations that that kind of inclusive society necessarily demands of its citizens. It was and still is a beautiful experiment, and should be encouraged in all possible ways.
“The gig was fantastic. But – and it’s a big ‘but’ – at the end, I made a short political speech, and suddenly it was as if I was from Mars when I suggested this was the generation of young Israelis that should make peace with their neighbors. They went very, very quiet. Afterward, I thought about the implications of travel restrictions and realized it was pretty unlikely that there were any Palestinians or Arabs in the audience, and I felt really bad about that.”
But during the concert itself, what did you feel?
“Concerts are very seductive, especially if you’re standing on the stage with people going ‘Whoa, how cool are you!’”
Did you feel all the love directed at you?
“Yes, it was fantastic, I could feel it. Maybe I shouldn’t tell you this story, but I will. When I visited Jenin [in 2009], I met Ismail, the father whose son was at the center of the movie ‘The Heart of Jenin,’ about the Palestinian boy who was shot…”
And his organs were donated to Israelis.
“And they donated his organs, so it was very emotional. And then they said to me in Jerusalem, ‘Will you come and talk to the students at the film school?’ And I thought: What a great opportunity.
“So I turn up one day, and everyone’s all bubbling and there’s a room with about 150 young people and all their teachers standing around, and it couldn’t have been more welcoming. I thanked them for having me and asked what we should talk about. And they were silent, so I said, ‘Alright, I’ll tell you what we should talk about. How many of you have seen the documentary ‘Heart of Jenin’? And they might just as well have had stainless-steel shutters behind their eyelids.
“I started to talk about it, but it was like I had turned into a Martian or something. Suddenly, you could see the distaste and horror that I would be mentioning this. And I got quite angry. I didn’t shout at them but I said: ‘There is something wrong with this picture.’ So as wonderful and as full of love as playing to that audience of young people was, this was horrific.”
‘I’m not a prophet’
Do you think you’ve found the truth concerning the Middle East?
“I don’t know, I’m not a prophet. Nobody’s handed me a bunch of tablets and said, ‘This is the truth.’ I’m having to figure this out for myself. What I do know is, whosoever it might be, from any side of any war, if anybody is dropping bombs and killing children – I know I’m on the other side. So, I live in the United States and I could not be more passionately opposed to the War on Terror – drone warfare in particular.”
And here we get to the core of the issue, because in Israel many people ask: Why Israel, when there are so many other countries that do the same?
“Well, if you’re determined to stand on the side of truth, justice, liberty, human rights, individual freedoms, political equality, and freedom to worship whatever you want, all of that – from time to time, situations crop up that demand your attention more than other situations, because they’re blatant and they’ve been going on for a very long time. People also complain about anybody making comparisons between apartheid South Africa and Israel. But particularly in the occupied territories – but also in Israel, in my view – the comparisons are valid.
“In the 1970s and ’80s, there was no question – we all focused on South Africa because it was the obvious place to focus. It was a place where it looked like all of us who took part in the Anti-Apartheid Movement, as it was called then, might have an effect, and might cause changes in policy in that small part of the world. Israel is that bit of the world now. Whether Israelis or anyone else like it or not, it just is.”
In Israel, you are described as not listening to both sides. Do you listen to the Israeli side?
“Okay, tell me what it is and I’ll listen. I mean, you’re the perfect person to tell me what it is, because I’ve read your work and I sense we have a great deal in common. In a way, though, maybe I shouldn’t be talking to you; maybe I should be talking to [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu. Well, obviously not. I couldn’t. Once I was put on the phone with [Israeli ambassador to the U.S.] Ron Dermer. Maybe he thought he could turn me. It was like having a conversation with a pit bull.”
What did Dermer say to you?
“He just went, ‘Hey, we all want peace,’ and I said if we can make peace then that would be fantastic. He told me peace would happen instantaneously if there was a single person on the other side he could speak to.”
And what did you say to him?
“Nothing. That’s not a conversation I should have. Where can the conversation happen? Because it’s a very difficult conversation to have. We saw the news recently with Hillary Clinton’s letter [to Haim Saban] promising to help destroy the BDS movement if she’s elected president. I said, ‘What? Is this democracy at work?! You give me money and then I destroy BDS?’ Where might there be a sensible conversation? Nobody knows what’s going to happen. But what we do know is that throwing more armaments at it is not going to help anybody.”
So maybe BDS should be aimed at the United States, and you should stop performing at Carnegie Hall?
“At some point, it might become the correct thing to try to start a boycott movement of some sort in the United States. But that time is not now. I’m part of this BDS movement, which is spreading fast through the universities – which is why people are pouring millions of dollars into the universities to try to buy [the students]. You can’t buy them! They’re young people. They’re not for sale.
“In an article I wrote a year ago, I was talking about [pro-Israel lobby] AIPAC: When Netanyahu spoke to AIPAC two years ago, he mentioned BDS 17 times in his speech. The year before that, it was never mentioned to anyone, anywhere. That’s a huge change.”
Isn’t there a danger that BDS will unite Israelis and make them even more nationalistic?
“I don’t think so. I think it will give power to Israeli people who are not happy with their domestic and foreign policy, knowing that they have friends and supporters outside the country who are standing with them and applauding them, admiring the bravery it takes to be an Israeli and to stand up for what is right and proper, humane and full of value.
“I’m not religious, but my suspicion is that, what actually relates much more to Judaism and the humane principles Judaism is based upon, is that those people are not insignificant. It is a small number, but it is a significant number. They are at least being active in some way.
“What is our alternative? Will someone give me an alternative to nonviolent protest, if we believe that the occupation is wrong and if we believe that the Palestinian citizens of Israel should operate under the same laws as Jewish citizens of Israel.”
Ending the occupation
Here we come to the question of the goals of BDS, which are presented in Israel in a vague way by the Israeli government.
Will the end of occupation mean the dismantling of BDS? Is this enough of a goal?
“Yeah, we’re talking about equality under the law.”
And the [Palestinian] Right of Return – it also includes this, correct?
“Yeah, of course.”
On the basis of equality?
“Yeah, on the basis of equality. I would say to people like Ron Dermer: ‘What’s your solution? What would you do?’ Well, we know they have one, but they still can’t quite get it out. A Greater Israel – I suspect that’s their solution, to preserve the apartheid.”
A two-state solution or a one-state solution? Do you have a preference?
“Because I’m a radical atheist, my personal preference would be a democratic, secular state with equal rights for all its citizens with a universal franchise, equal property rights, freedom to practice whatever religion you want. I’m very against theocracies.”
But it hasn’t worked in many parts of the world, including Northern Ireland.
“Okay, that’s an interesting point. I agree with you that a divided Ireland may never work. But we don’t know what is going to work. At a certain point, it was decided it was going to be a two-state solution. That that little bit [in the north] was going to stay part of the United Kingdom, and the rest was going to be a democratic republic.
“If there were two secular states, why not? I care just as much about Jewish children as I do about Arab children. I care about people not having a future where they can work, earn a living, sit around a table with their family and plan for the future, and make decisions about water or the things that are really starting to crop up all over the world with what we’re doing with the oceans. Or broader questions of conservation and ecology or global warming, or this and that. You can’t focus on any of that stuff when you’re lobbing bombs at each other over a wall. There’s no time to do anything sensible or grown-up.
“So, I don’t know what the answer is – but I know this isn’t the answer. This status quo is not the answer and you cannot, in my view, maintain a status quo that is built on the idea that it’s okay to expel people from their homes – whether it’s people’s homes in East Jerusalem now, or people who lived in villages during the Nakba [the Palestinian term for the creation of Israel in 1948]. Both things are wrong, and it’s very difficult to sustain a country based upon invasion and colonization.”
Do you understand the sentiment of many Israelis that the Jewish people have the right to their own country after everything they have gone through? And that the one-state solution for them means extermination?
“Well that’s just nonsense! People are always saying, ‘BDS is trying to delegitimize Israel.’ No, it’s not. It’s trying to stop the oppression of the Palestinian, Bedouin and other Arab peoples of the region you are oppressing. It’s trying to stop you oppressing your fellow human beings. It’s not trying to delegitimize Israel.”
An Israeli de Klerk?
So give me the scenario where you come back to perform in Israel again. What has to happen – and I mean this symbolically.
“When you and I can sit down together over a glass of wine and look each other in the eye and hold each other’s hands and go, ‘Wow! We, they, us – everybody did it.’ We can see that we did it: Everyone has equal rights, nobody is killing anybody. Then I promise you I will come and play ‘The Wall’ in its entirety.”
Will we ever reach that moment?
“I had conversations with [Mikhail] Gorbachev in 2002 or 2003. If in the mid-1980s you and I had asked, ‘Are we going to see the Berlin Wall come down within our lifetime?’ – it would have been a very difficult question to answer. But we didn’t know Gorbachev then. He is the most remarkable man – my two huge heroes since Gandhi are Nelson Mandela and Gorbachev. So who would’ve known? Things can happen. Maybe there’s a Mandela somewhere in an Israeli prison.”
Maybe we need a F.W. de Klerk?
“If you look through one of my recent op-eds, it says, ‘It may be far easier to find the Palestinian Mandela than it will be to find the Israeli De Klerk.’ But we cannot give up hope. We cannot say it’s too difficult, because even to abandon one child is one child too many. And the pictures we see coming out of Gaza are so disgusting and so heart-wrenching that those people … and I’m not saying it’s not heart-wrenching if a suicide bomber blows themselves up on a bus in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem – of course it is, it’s equally horrific.”
Should artists and academic institutions really be at the top of the boycott list?
“No. There are a number of Israeli politicians – [Shimon] Peres might well be one – who can’t come to England because they’ll be arrested the second they step foot there, as war criminals. Because there is a legal apparatus that, once you define an act as a war crime, even in the opinion of the International Criminal Court, then you have grounds for detaining somebody. There have been a number of Israeli politicians who’ve had to turn around and go home because they didn’t want to risk being sent to prison in the United Kingdom.”
Should Khaled Meshal, the political head of Hamas, be arrested if he comes to the U.K.?
“I don’t know. I would need to be legally advised to know if there is evidence that Meshal has committed war crimes. I haven’t seen evidence to that effect.”
But you’ve seen Shimon Peres commit war crimes?
“We all saw the massacres from South Lebanon.”
An Israeli music critic I know, a huge expert on Pink Floyd, wanted me to ask you this: Why don’t you criticize Hamas, too? And also, do you know what it feels like to be under the constant threat of Qassam rockets? That it’s like being in London during the Blitz?
“Absolute nonsense. I know something of the Blitz in London. Both my parents were there and worked on through the whole thing, and we’ve seen the damage. Bits of London looked a bit like Gaza does now. You can’t show me anywhere in the State of Israel that looks even faintly like that, because rockets never hit anything – or very occasionally they blow a few chunks out of a tree somewhere.
“They [the rockets] are completely useless, everybody knows it. They’re a gesture of resistance, that’s all. They might hit something, but they won’t. And if they do, they might kill one person, or two people, and very occasionally they do. But it can’t be compared with the Blitz in London. That was thousands of bombers dropping hundreds of tons of high-explosive bombs. Every night.
“But the thing about Hamas is, yeah, I condemn that. In fact, I’ve written about it often. I’ve said it is wrong, no matter how ineffective they [the missiles] are – that’s no defense for lobbing them out of Gaza. If they were directional and if they knew where they were going to land, then it would have every justification for firing them at Israeli military targets – they have been attacked, they are continuing to be attacked all the time, and they have an absolute right and duty to resist by military force. It’s explicitly defined in the Geneva Conventions and all normal laws of war: that an occupied people has an absolute right and responsibility to resist the military of the invader. Israel is the invader.”
‘Frittering away the goodwill’
What would you like to say to Israelis?
“I would like to say that in 1945, or ’47-’48, you had the goodwill, the sympathy and good wishes of the rest of the world. You were a bit like the United States after 9/11. But you’ve sadly frittered away that goodwill and you need to look at what happened in ‘47-’48, and what has happened since. But for the sake of your country and your countrymen, you need to accept that you’ve made mistakes. And you need to find the courage to live with your neighbors. You need courage. It takes courage to look at the reality, rather than trying to maintain the image of a false reality.”
But when you see what Israel is doing, don’t you feel hateful toward Israel as a whole?
“You have a very strong armament industry in Israel, it’s one of your biggest things. I hate that. But so do the United States and the U.K., and so do Belgium and Russia – and so will China, given half a chance. So the fact we’re pouring technology and investment into an arms race, it’s disgusting and is something Israel should be just as ashamed of as the U.S. Don’t start making drones and laser-guided weapons, and all that. I’m not singling Israel out, obviously.
“Israelis are just people. I can’t hate people. There are some individuals, some politicians, who crop up from time to time that are sort of hateful. But even then, somebody like your prime minister – you feel sort of sorry for him, because he looks to me like he’s the product of so much bullshit. I don’t mean to sound arrogant. I’m not holy – but I’m a lot holier than he is, that’s for sure. He made that speech in Congress, and they were all going up and down like bloody yo-yos. Talk about a response Pavlov would have been proud of.”
What do you say to those who think it’s enough to boycott the settlement project but not Israel?
“I think the more visible BDS becomes, the more likely it is to have a good effect on the eventual outcome of the situation that exists between the Israeli people and the Palestinian people. For instance, things that I’m involved in, like the cultural boycott, if I tried to persuade people not to do gigs – absolutely on the anti-apartheid model – it wouldn’t be much use for me to say to people, ‘Don’t go and do gigs in settlements.’ The settlements are a huge problem, annexing the occupied territory – or some of it – as they do. But the pressure needs to be brought to bear upon the government of Israel. And anything that shines a light on that need is good. In my view, broader is better. Restricting it just to settlement projects isn’t enough.”
What about those artists who come to Israel to perform and say, “Let’s separate music from politics”?
“They’re not actually saying, ‘Let’s separate politics from music.’ They’re actually saying, ‘I care more about my work and career than I care about these oppressed people. I’m very happy to care about the oppressed people, but not to the point where I’ll let it interfere with my career.’ That’s what they’re saying. So they’re showing themselves to be people who actually don’t care. They have no care for what’s going on in Gaza.”
What about those who say, “I’ll go and play there, and I’ll try to convince the Israelis”?
“I can look them in the eye and say, ‘You’re on a false errand, that’s not going to happen. You’re not going to change the minds of the people in the Knesset and get them to behave in a legal, proper and humane way toward the occupied Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.’ It will not work. It doesn’t work. It didn’t help the situation in South Africa back in the 1980s and ‘90s with Rod Stewart and Elton John and Dionne Warwick, and whoever the few others were – there were very few of them – like Queen, going and playing in Sun City.
“It helped not one jot to change the politics. What did help was that we wouldn’t go and play rugby against them. And they couldn’t come and play rugby against us. And they couldn’t compete in the Olympics. And most artists refused to go even to Sun City, and nobody went to South Africa itself. And that made a huge difference, and eventually it changed things in a big way.
“No, it has to be a political movement, and it has to grow, and it has to be thousands and thousands of people, and they have to be from all over the world – and they have to all stand together in solidarity with the occupied people. And in solidarity with the Israeli people as well, because that’s not a life any of them should be leading. It’s unhealthy for everybody. Nobody’s winning.”
What would you say to an Israeli who thinks outside intervention is anti-democratic, who says, “We should get to decide our future for ourselves”?
“What would I tell such a person? I would say to them, ‘If you actually had a democracy within the State of Israel – if there was such a thing within the Green Line, within the ’67 borders, within the whatever – if you reinstate all those houses you’ve demolished in East Jerusalem, and let the people who were living there before you threw them out come back; and if it was a democracy, and if you weren’t occupying all this other land, and so on and so forth, and if you weren’t trying to reduce the numbers of the other indigenous people who are not Jewish people in the area – if all those things pertained, well, I would absolutely applaud you and your state.’
“But that is not happening. And I suppose you could make the case for it being a Jewish state – I personally think it’s hugely dangerous to give any religion the power to control an entire country and all the people in it.”
Israelis talk about the Jewish people, not only the Jewish religion.
“Well, I’m not one of them, so it’s really none of my business, if you know what I mean. It would be like talking about Scotland – ‘Oh, we’re the Scots!’ Okay, well fine, good, okay. Obviously, the Scots at the moment are talking about whether to remain part of the United Kingdom, but they’re not going to suddenly start introducing laws where people who aren’t Scottish are going to be removed from the place or are not allowed to own property. Or, ‘I have two sets of laws: one for people who are Scots; and one for people who aren’t.’ That is not a democracy. That is an apartheid state where people are treated differently and subject to different laws, based upon their race or their religion.
“When you see the images, and you see the children’s faces, and you see the injuries, and you look at the rubble, and the filth, and the squalor, and the open sewers – you just think: I have to keep working on it.”
‘We took the music quite seriously’
Let’s talk about Pink Floyd.
“Why not?”
It seems that this chapter is totally over for you. Do you listen to Pink Floyd from time to time? To the old records? When was the last time you listened to “Dark Side of the Moon,” for example?
“Probably before I took it on the road for the last time. Just to remember exactly what the arrangements were and how we put the songs together.”
No nostalgia?
“Nostalgia? Oh yeah, of course. I mean, the work we did together from 1965 until when I left – which was 1985, so it’s 20 years – it was a lot of work, and I think a lot of it was very good. And it was certainly great fun to do the work. Work is more fun than fun. Work is the real play, certainly for me. I’m never happier than when I’m working.”
There was no way it could go on?
“No, people grow apart, you know. We were four different people – well, after Syd went crazy and then David joined the group, and then there were four of us – and we’re very different people. I made one friend in the group, who’s Nick Mason; I was never really that close to Rick Wright and David Gilmour, and we grew apart philosophically and politically – and even musically. And David and I started to really butt heads after ‘Dark Side of the Moon.’ There was a lot of this going on all the way through ‘Wish You Were Here,’ ‘Animals,’ ‘The Wall’ and ‘The Final Cut.’ So it became the only thing to do, for me to stop doing it.”
And it’s irreversible, you think?
“Yeah, of course.”
Though you did reunite that one time for Live 8, in 2005.
“Yeah, but we just about got through it. And the performance was pretty good, there was a good feeling. But it absolutely reinforced the fact that, 23 years before [when they recorded ‘The Final Cut], I’d made absolutely the right decision not to have anything to do with them ever again.”
So when did you and David Gilmour last talk?
“We were in touch last year.”
You’ve said some very tough things about him in the past. Any regrets?
“No, why should I have? I mean, after I’d left and they were going touring the three of them, that was a difficult period because they obviously were hugely successful and I confess that I never thought they’d get away with it – but they did.”
Could it be that your political activity is a kind of way to cover it up?
“Cover what up?”
The pain of being less successful than you were before. Is this a way to compensate yourself?
“I went on the road – I’ve actually been way more successful than we ever were from Pink Floyd, and certainly more than they were when they went out on the road. So there isn’t a big burden of failure floating around, and there is also that warm blanket of the love that people have for the work that we do – and that blanket covers me as well as David and Rick.”
The common sentiment is that people want to see you together again.
“Well, I find that very understandable and also supremely irritating, because I’m not attached to it and I was in it. That’s what I did for a living for 20 years, but it was a living lie for the last few years. It was no longer a healthy working relationship.”
But in the beginning, at least – was it as romantic as it seemed from the outside?
“It was just four or five young men scrabbling to try to make a few grand and get laid, like any other group. That’s what it was. We took the music quite seriously.”
Was Pink Floyd the best band of all time?
“I have no idea. I’m not interested in that.”
Can you define any other group as the most important one? As the best? The most influential?
“No I can’t. There are certain groups whose names you can just pluck out of the air, and songwriters. Like you can say John Lennon is an important songwriter, as is Paul McCartney. So is Neil Young, Bob Dylan, so is John Prine. I could probably go on for 20 minutes and then I would run out of names. Who else? There aren’t many rock ‘n roll acts I would ever listen to or care about.”
So what do you listen to?
“Nothing really, I don’t listen to music. When I’m playing gin rummy with Laurie, we listen to Chet Baker. That’s all we listen to – the same five CDs. Except the CD player’s broken now. I couldn’t get it working yesterday.”
So you’re not even up to date?
“No.”
How come there aren’t iconic groups any more like Pink Floyd, The Beatles or The Rolling Stones?
“It’s an area I don’t know anything about, because I’m not interested in it, never have been. Well, maybe when I was a young teenager I was interested in pop music a little bit. Like when I was 12, and ‘Hound Dog’ came out. There was something about the romance of the instant world of fame and being a celebrity that’s appealing to small children. It very soon loses its glitter and becomes about something else.”
And then he picked up a guitar, sat down on the striped sofa in the studio, barefoot. Oblivious to the rest of the world, he began to sing “Wish You Were Here”:
So, so you think you can tell, Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?A smile from a veil?Do you think you can tell?Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?Hot ashes for trees?Hot air for a cool breeze?Cold comfort for change? …How I wish, how I wish you were here.
And I was left speechless.

<title>U.S. pop star Pharrell Williams faces BDS backlash during South African tour</title>
<date>Tue Aug 04 18:03:38 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
REUTERS - Concerts scheduled by U.S. pop star Pharrell Williams in South Africa next month face disruptions from pro-Palestinian protesters over a promotional deal he has with major retailer Woolworths, which has trade ties with Israel.
The Grammy award-winning producer and performer has been targeted by the South African branch of the international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel (BDS) movement. It objects to Israel's 48-year-old occupation of territories where Palestinians seek an independent state.
Williams is collaborating with Woolworths on its “Are You With Us” campaign, acting as style director on several sustainability-focused projects encompassing fashion and fundraising for education.
“He is about to face the biggest backlash any artist has faced in South Africa in over 30 years, since the days of apartheid,” said Braam Hanekom, a BDS South Africa board member.
“He is walking into a very angry, unhappy environment because he has chosen to walk with Woolworths,” Hanekom told Reuters after the City of Cape Town denied an application by thousands to protest at Pharrell's first concert on September 21.
He said protesters could block roads on concert nights, potentially delaying proceedings, or even rally inside venues.
Pharrell's representatives did not respond immediately for comment. Grand West Casino, where the Cape Town concert will take place, said they would not allow any protests on their property. The second concert is in Johannesburg.
Pro-Palestinian marches in South Africa often attract large crowds, especially in Cape Town with its large Muslim community.
Woolworths said in a statement that it did not source produce from the occupied territories, less than 0.1 percent of its food came from Israel and that it clearly labeled every product's country of origin.
The global BDS movement has also campaigned against British security firm G4S over its Israel links. It says its pleas have prompted musicians including Irish rocker Sinead O'Connor and hip hop star Lauryn Hill to support its cause.

<title>Carter: Zero chance for two-state solution</title>
<date>Thu Aug 13 18:35:53 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said there is no chance of seeing the two-state solution realized "at this moment," accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of pursuing a one-state solution without equal rights for Palestinians.
“At this moment, there is zero chance of the two-state solution,” Carter, 90, told Prospect Magazine, in an interview published on Thursday.
Carter added that after the failure of the last negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in 2014, brokered by Secretary of State John Kerry, the U.S. "has withdrawn" from the issue.
Carter said Netanyahu "does not now and has never sincerely believed in a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine,” and  accused him of deciding "early on to adopt a one-state solution, but without giving them [the Palestinians] equal rights."
Carter told Prospect that while he is "reluctant" to use the word apartheid in a news article, claims that the term applies to Israel have real force because of the growing number of Palestinians who live in lands controlled by Israel.
Carter, who served as president from 1977 to 1981, founded the Carter Center for peace and health, and is a member of The Elders Group, an independent group of global leaders who describe themselves as working together for peace and human rights.
Although he brokered the first Israeli-Arab peace treaty during his presidency, Carter outraged many Israelis with his 2006 book "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid." He's also repeatedly reached out to Gaza's Islamic Hamas leaders, considered terrorists by much of the West.
In the interview, given shortly before Carter was diagnosed with cancer, he also voiced his support for the "superb" nuclear deal reached with Iran in July, and said he believes Democrats will support the deal in Congress.
Carter also said that even though Hillary Clinton is "not proven" as a politician, he and his family still intend to vote for her if she will be the Democrat contender for the White House.

<title>LISTEN: Bradley Burston discusses his article saying Israeli policy is apartheid on BBC</title>
<date>Wed Aug 19 15:39:32 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
Haaretz's Bradley Burston said his recent use of the term "apartheid" to describe the Israeli occupation of the West Bank is justified, in a panel discussion on the BBC World Service on Tuesday.
Burston, whose article "It's Time to Admit It. Israeli Policy Is What It Is: Apartheid" was published on Monday, said recent events underscored the situation in the West Bank in which Israel operates different sets of laws for Jews and Arabs.
"It is [...] the policies that underwrite that situation and enshrine it that lay behind this whole piece," Burston said.
"The wall we’ve built from the West Bank is not only concrete. It also had to do with not being able to see or feel what’s going on there. So I think the idea of an emotive word is not necessarily a bad idea when the situation is horrible […] and getting worse," Burston said.
In response, Ran Bar Yoshafat, project manager for the Israeli Jewish Congress, said the term "apartheid" distracts from the real issue at hand:
"The branding of Israel as an apartheid state was created in order to make people not think about the morality of the issue. It just makes you say 'Israel is apartheid. Apartheid is bad, therefore Israel is bad.' This is not a discourse of building relationships, but rather ending them," he said.
Benjamin Pogrund, Haaretz contributor and author of “Drawing Fire - Investigating the Accusations of Apartheid in Israel,” said the use of the word is "is both wrong factually and politically unwise."
"The firebombing and - so far not automatic aid - for victims. Well, there’s a simple answer for that. They’re Palestinian, they’re not Israeli. Israelis get automatic compensation. He [Bradley] said 'all Israelis.' What he didn’t say is that includes Israeli Arabs. So it’s not a racial thing, it’s a matter of a different group of people," he said.

<title>Iceland's capital adopts motion to boycott Israeli goods </title>
<date>Wed Sep 16 18:59:05 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
The city council of Iceland's capital, Reykjavik, has adoped a motion to boycott Israeli-made goods. 
Reykjavik City Council voted in favor of the motion, put by Björk Vilhelmsdóttir, councilwoman for the Social Democratic Alliance, on Tuesday.
The boycott will be in place “as long as the occupation of Palestinian territories continues,” the motion said.
According to the motion, it is "a symbolic act," intended to show the city council's support for the Palestinian statehood and its condemnation of “the Israeli policy of apartheid," according to a report in Iceland Magazine.
A member of the governing coalition at the city hall, Sóley Tómasdóttir, told a local radio station that the  boycott is intended to pressure Israel to stop the occupation. She also said the city might follow it up with boycotts of other countries that violate human rights.
Not everyone is in favour, however. Einar Gautur Steingrímsson, a lawyer, said it goes against Iceland's constitution. “This is as illegal as refusing to do business with red haired people and it makes no difference whether they justify their decision with references to some alleged actions by the Israelis,” he told a local news site, Iceland Magazine said. 
According to Ynet, Israel's Foreign Ministry’s spokesman, Emanuel Nachson said in response that, “A volcano of hate is currently exploding in Reykjavik’s city council building. There is no reason or justification for this move, besides hate itself, which is being heard in the form of calls for a boycott against Israel, the Jewish state. We hope that someone in Iceland will wake up and stop this blindness and one sidedness which is aimed against the only democracy in the Middle East, Israel.”

<title>BDS protesters picket Pharrell Williams concert in South Africa</title>
<date>Tue Sep 22 05:52:52 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
About 500 people demonstrated outside a Cape Town venue where Pharrell Williams was due to perform on Monday, in protest against the U.S. pop star's promotional deal with South African retailer Woolworths and its trade ties with Israel.
The Grammy award-winning producer and performer's concert was scheduled to go ahead despite the protest, launched by the South African branch of the international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel (BDS) movement.
"By working with Woolworths, Pharrell supports Israel, a country that supports the oppression of Palestine, a country that is the new apartheid state," said Ashraf Salie, standing amongst a crowd waving Palestinian flags at the entrance to the GrandWest Casino where Williams was performing.
Pro-Palestinian marches often attract large crowds in South Africa, especially in Cape Town which has a large Muslim community.
Some passing motorists hooted support to protesters, who held up placards saying "Pharrell is welcome if Gaza is free" and "Pharrell and Woolworths have blood on their hands" as local musicians and artists entertained the crowd from a stage.
Protesters were allowed to gather under a heavy police presence after the City of Cape Town lost a court case seeking to limit attendance to 150 protesters.
Williams is collaborating with Woolworths as its style director on several fashion projects as well as fundraising for education.
Woolworths has said it does not source produce from the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, less than 0.1 percent of its food comes from Israel and that it clearly labels every product's country of origin.

<title>Abbas says PA not bound by agreements with Israel </title>
<date>Wed Sep 30 19:28:16 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
NEW YORK – The Palestinian Authority will no longer uphold the agreements it has signed with Israel over the last 20 years, PA President Mahmoud Abbas told the UN General Assembly on Wednesday.
Terming this decision a response to Israel’s policies in the West Bank, Abbas said Israel “must assume all of its responsibilities as an occupying power.”
Abbas used the speech to assail Israel, accusing it of systematically violating all its agreements with the Palestinians and of trying to destroy the two-state solution.
“Thus, we declare that as long as Israel refuses to commit to the agreements signed with us, which render us an authority without real powers, and as long as Israel refuses to cease settlement activities and to release the fourth group of Palestinian prisoners in accordance with our agreements, they leave us no choice but to insist that we will not remain the only ones committed to the implementation of these agreements, while Israel continuously violates them,” he said, according to the advance copy of the PA’s official translation of his Arabic-language speech. 
“We therefore declare that we cannot continue to be bound by these agreements and that Israel must assume all of its responsibilities as an occupying power, because the status quo cannot continue,” Abbas said.
“The State of Palestine, based on the 4th of June 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, is a state under occupation,” Abbas continued. He urged the United Nations to grant the Palestinians international protection and said any country that hasn’t yet recognized Palestine should do so forthwith.
It’s not clear what practical significance Abbas’ declaration has or what exactly will happen the day after, though he said the decision would be implemented immediately. But he did note that in a 2012 resolution recognizing Palestine as a nonmember observer state, the United Nations also recognized the PLO Executive Committee as Palestine’s temporary government and the Palestinian National Council as its parliament. 
A response to the speech issued by the Prime Minister’s Office didn’t relate directly to Abbas’ statement.  
“We expect and call on the [Palestinian] Authority and its leader to act responsibly and accede to the proposal of the prime minister of Israel and enter into direct negotiations with Israel without preconditions,” the PMO said. “The fact that he – time and again – has refused to do so is the best possible proof of the fact he does not intend to reach a peace agreement.”
Abbas began his speech by attacking Israel’s policy on the Temple Mount, accusing the government of trying to alter the status quo there. 
“I come before you today ... to sound the alarm about the grave dangers of what is happening in Jerusalem, where extremist Israeli groups are committing repeated, systematic incursions upon Al-Aqsa mosque, aimed at imposing a new reality and dividing [it],” he said. 
These groups, “under the protection of Israeli occupying forces and accompanying ministers and Knesset members ... enter the mosque at certain times,” he charged, while “preventing Muslim worshippers” from doing so. 
“I call on the Israeli government, before it is too late, to cease its use of brutal force to impose its plans to undermine the Islamic and Christian sanctities in Jerusalem, particularly its actions at Al-Aqsa mosque, for such actions will convert the conflict from a political to [a] religious one, creating an explosive [situation] in Jerusalem and in the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory,” he concluded.
The PMO’s statement vehemently rejected these assertions, saying Abbas’ speech “was deceitful and encourages incitement and lawlessness in the Middle East. In contrast to the Palestinians, Israel is strictly maintaining the status quo on the Temple Mount and is committed to continuing to do so in accordance with the agreements between us and the Jordanians and the Waqf.”
Abbas also dwelled at length on hate crimes perpetrated by Jews against Palestinians and accused Israel of protecting the perpetrators rather than catching them. He also accused Israel of establishing an apartheid regime in the West Bank.
“How can a state claiming to be an oasis of democracy and claiming that its courts and security apparatus function according to the law accept the existence of so-called ‘price tag’ gangs and other terrorist organizations that terrorize our people, their property and holy sites, all under the sight of the Israeli army and police, which do not deter or punish, but rather provide them with protection?” he demanded.
Responding to speeches by other world leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which focused mainly on the battle against ISIS, Abbas declared that any war on terror must begin with solving the Palestinian problem.
Immediately after his speech, Abbas attended a festive ceremony in which the Palestinian flag was raised at UN headquarters for the first time. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and many foreign ministers were in attendance.
Shortly after that, representatives of the PA’s donor states met at UN headquarters. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told the gathering that he doesn’t consider Israeli-Palestinian peace an “impossible dream” and that Washington remains committed to peace talks.

<title>Netanyahu responds to Abbas: Israel expects Palestinians to honor their commitments </title>
<date>Thu Oct 01 19:26:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
UNITED NATIONS — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took advantage of his speech to the UN General Assembly on Thursday to declare, “Israel expects the Palestinian Authority to abide by its commitments.” He was responding to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’ speech the day before, in which Abbas announced that in light of Israel’s policies in the West Bank, the Palestinians would no longer fulfill its agreements with Israel.
“I remain committed to a vision of two states for two peoples,” Netanyahu said. “Israelis know the price of war. I know the price of war. I was nearly killed in battle. I lost many friends. I lost my beloved brother Yoni. Those who know the price of war can best appreciate what the blessings of peace would mean — for ourselves, our children, our grandchildren. I am prepared to immediately, immediately, resume direct peace negotiations with the Palestinian Authority without any preconditions whatsoever. Unfortunately, President Abbas said yesterday that he is not prepared to do this.”
Read the full transcript of Prime Minister Netanyahu's address to the UN General Assembly
About an hour after Netanyahu’s speech, an Israeli couple were shot to death driving near the West Bank settlement of Itamar.
Netanyahu claimed that in the 20 years since the peace process began, six Israeli prime ministers tried to achieve peace with the Palestinians, who rejected every offer. “You heard that rejectionism again only yesterday from President Abbas. How can Israel make peace with a Palestinian partner who refuses to even sit at the negotiating table?” he said. 
Addressing the PA president, Netanyahu said: “President Abbas, I know it’s not easy. I know it’s hard. But we owe it to our peoples to try, to continue to try, because together, if we actually negotiate and stop negotiating about the negotiation, if we actually sit down and try to resolve this conflict between us, recognize each other, not use a Palestinian state as a stepping stone for another Islamist dictatorship in the Middle East, but something that will live at peace next to the Jewish state, if we actually do that, we can do remarkable things for our peoples.”
PLO Secretary General Saeb Erekat issued a statement in response to Netanyahu’s speech, saying it was full of inaccuracies. “The Palestinians have never placed conditions on peace.  Palestinians have demanded that Israel abide by the obligations it has already made to the Palestinians, which Israel has yet to fulfill,” Erekat said.
“As Mr. Netanyahu tells the world he wants to negotiate for two states, he has built the largest illegal settlement enterprise seen in modern history,” Erekat added.
The day before Netanyahu’s speech, Abbas told the General Assembly that in light of Israeli policy in the West Bank, the PA would not keep the agreements it signed with Israel over the past 20 years. However, the practical application of Abbas’ statements was unclear. He did not set a timetable for ending implementation of the agreements but said the Palestinians would begin carrying out the decisions immediately, using legal means, not violence.
Most of Netanyahu’s speech focused on the nuclear agreement with Iran, which he called “a very bad deal.” He said that over the past six months Iran had increased its support for terror groups, its undermining of various regimes in the Middle East and its support for the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria. ”Israel will continue to respond forcefully to any attacks against it from Syria,” Netanyahu said.
He told the General Assembly that the deal with Iran “does place several constraints on Iran’s nuclear program. And rightly so, because the international community recognizes that Iran is so dangerous. … If Iran doesn’t change its behavior, in fact if it becomes even more dangerous in the years to come, the most important constraints will still be automatically lifted by year 10 and by year 15.
“That would place a militant Islamic terror regime weeks away from having the fissile material for an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs,” Netanyahu said.
He chided the diplomats in the hall and said that even 70 years after the Holocaust, the world remains silent in the face of threats against the Jewish people. At that point, the prime minister fell silent for 44 seconds, and then said: “Believe me, it would be far easier to remain silent. But throughout our history, the Jewish people have learned the heavy price of silence. And as the prime minister of the Jewish state, as someone who knows that history, I refuse to be silent.” His silence and this statement were greeted by stormy applause from dozens of his supporters in the assembly hall visitors’ gallery.
Netanyahu presented a series of actions he said the international community should take following the agreement with Iran: “Make sure that the snapback sanctions actually snap back. And make sure that Iran’s violations aren’t swept under the Persian rug,” adding, “Israel will be watching closely.”
With regard to Israel’s ties with the United States, Netanyahu said: “President Obama and I agree on the need to keep arms out of the hands of Iran’s terror proxies… Israel deeply appreciates President Obama’s willingness to bolster our security, help Israel maintain its qualitative military edge and help Israel confront the enormous challenges we face. President Obama and I have both said that our differences over the nuclear deal are a disagreement within the family. But we have no disagreement about the need to work together to secure our common future.”
'Arrogance, bravado, recycled clichés and useless gimmicks'
The political opposition reacted critically to Netanyahu’s address.
“While Netanyahu addresses the UN, the government is approving illegal outposts, the deputy foreign minister is arrogantly confronting and insulting the Jordanian foreign minister, and Israel is doing things that are going in the wrong direction,” said Oppostion Leader leader Isaac Herzog (Zionist Union). “I’m here to replace Netanyahu.”
MK Shelly Yacimovich (Zionist Union) called Netanyahu’s speech, “A model of arrogance, bravado, recycled clichés and useless gimmicks.” Netanyahu and his speeches, she said, “Are the direct cause of Israel being sidelined from any position of influence on the issue of Iran."
“His remarks about the Jewish people not remaining passive as in the past are a farce in and of themselves,” she said. “Israel under Netanyahu has been totally passive, both before Iran and the Palestinians, and is allowing reality to unfold without any initiative on our part.”
MK Tzipi Livni (Zionist Union) praised Netanyahu for “An eloquent speech that moves every Jewish soul,” but added, however, "There’s a huge gap between the good feeling he creates in Israel and the reception and status of Israel in the world.”
“History proves that Netanyahu’s speeches have changed nothing," Livni said. "While Israeli citizens are moved by his speech, the world sees someone who speaks about peace and two states for two peoples, but isn’t prepared to pay even the smallest political price for it.”
MK Yousef Jabareen (Joint List) said that while Netanyahu makes an effort to express himself diplomatically, “the world already knows that he doesn’t accept the two-state solution along the 1967 lines." Jabareen added: Netanyahu is leading Israel toward an apartheid regime, in which the State of Israel controls the fate of five million Palestinians and denies them the right to freedom and self-determination. Netanyahu practices the politics of fear and intimidation, and endangers the future of the entire region.”

<title>Olmert blasts Netanyahu's foreign policy, warns of risk of apartheid in Israel</title>
<date>Fri Oct 02 22:37:53 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert criticized incumbent leader Benjamin Netanyahu's foreign policy on Friday in an interview with Al Jazeera English, saying that Israel is at risk of becoming an apartheid state.
The television interview, which Al Jazeera described as Olmert's first international interview since he was sentenced for eight months in jail for fraud and breach of trust this past May, aired on Friday evening.
According to excerpts released before the interview aired, Olmert rejected Netanyahu's claim at the UN that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas isn't interested in negotiations with Israel. "[Abbas] certainly is a partner for peace. There is no other," Olmert was quoted as saying. “He is the president of the Palestinian Authority and he, time and again, proved that he’s against terror and that he is ready to spell it out in the strongest possible terms.”
Olmert repeated his past warning that Israel could become an apartheid state should the Israeli-Palestinian peace process remain stalled.
 “I still make this warning," he said. "I think that this warning is a serious one and we have to address ourselves to this in a very serious [way] and to expedite the [peace] process.”
Prime Minister Netanyahu said in his UN General Assembly address on Thursday that he is prepared to resume direct peace negotiations with the Palestinians "immediately," but asserted that Abbas is not willing to do so. "Well, I hope he changes his mind," Netanyahu said. "Because I remain committed to a vision of two states for two peoples, in which a demilitarized Palestinian state recognizes the Jewish state." 
In the interview, Olmert called Netanyahu's speech a "great performance."
Olmert further criticized the prime minister's vocal opposition to the nuclear deal between the world powers and Iran. He said that while the agreement isn't ideal, "it's a done deal," and called on Netanyahu to work with the U.S. rather than fight it over the accord.
Most of Netanyahu’s UN address focused on the nuclear agreement with Iran, which he called “a very bad deal." On Friday, U.S. officials told Haaretz that the prime minister has indicated that the speech would be his swan song on his public fight against the accord.
Messages from Netanyahu's aides gave senior officials the impression that the prime minister is ready to discuss how the United States and Israel will jointly deal with Iran and its subversive activities in the region.
Olmert was sentenced in May to eight months in prison for receiving hundreds of thousands of shekels in cash-filled envelopes from Jewish-American businessman Morris Talansky and failing to report the donations to either the tax authorities or the state comptroller. His jailing has been postponed due to an appeal.  
Olmert is also fighting a six-year sentence and a one million shekel fine meted out after he was found guilty of taking bribes in a different case, known as the Holyland scandal, which involved the construction of a housing complex in Jerusalem.

<title>This isn't an intifada, this is what binational Israel looks like</title>
<date>Thu Oct 15 03:51:54 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
A very partial list of things that happened in the last few days: In Jerusalem, a Palestinian 13-year-old, aided by a 15-year-old, stabbed and almost killed a 13-year-old Israeli boy. Hours before, a 16-year-old Palestinian girl was shot after stabbing a police officer. Most of the attacks against Israelis since the last round of  violence began have been carried out by teenagers and women (or both). 
Israelis are being attacked by Palestinian minors wielding kitchen cutlery, vegetable peelers and screwdrivers. In Jerusalem, a 31-year-old Palestinian woman shouting Allahu akbar tried, unsuccessfully, to ignite a gas balloon in her car.
Fearing for their safety, and encouraged to do so by politicians like Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat, ordinary Israelis have begun carrying weapons. Barkat himself was caught on camera walking around in the streets of Jerusalem with an unholstered gun in his hand. Also in Jerusalem, a man helped subdue a Palestinian terrorist using nunchaks.
In all the chaos, there have been cases of 'vigilantism'. Three Palestinians and a Bedouin were stabbed by a mentally ill Jewish man in Dimona. In Kiryat Ata, a Jewish man stabbed another Jewish man, thinking he was Palestinian.
With violence in Israel and the West Bank steadily increasing, many are asking: Is this an intifada? Is this truly the beginning of yet another, years-long, bloody chapter in the saga of Israel-Palestine, or is this just another footnote, like the so-called “firecracker intifada” of 2014? The Economist thinks this is not an Intifada. Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog thinks it is.
Based on the volume of violent incidents and, more importantly, the identity of the people behind them, it’s easy to say: this isn't an intifada. It's something far worse.
Negotiating with screwdrivers
Intifada (the Arabic term for “uprising”) is by definition political. The last two Palestinian intifadas were led by political factions, and were at least somewhat organized. The present wave of violence, on the other hand, is being perpetrated by ordinary young people operating on their own.
It is a new, and terrifying, type of horizontal terror: random, leaderless, and uncoordinated.
Unlike the suicide bombers of yore, recent attackers didn’t leave behind video wills explaining their motives. None were affiliated with any terrorist organization or political group. Most had lives, jobs, studies they abruptly halted.
Asraa Zidan Tawfik Abed, the 30-year-old neophyte terrorist who tried to stab a soldier in Afula and was gunned down last week, is a mother of three who holds a degree from Israel's Technion University and was pursuing a master’s degree.
All of this has Israeli leaders stumped and bewildered, casting about frantically for unorthodox solutions.
Opposition leader Isaac Herzog and Habayit Hayehudi leader Naftali Bennett both suggested imposing blockades, closures and, newly, curfews on the residents of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Habayit Hayehudi MK Yinon Magal tweeted: “Stop them from leaving their homes.” Former foreign affairs minister Avigdor Lieberman suggested restoring martial law regarding Palestinians in East Jerusalem and Israeli Arabs in the Triangle (Israel had previously lifted military rule in 1966.)
In a way, it’s easy to understand why Israeli politicians are confused. Intifadas usually end with a massive military campaign: Operation Defensive Shield ended the Second Intifada; or a massive peace effort - the Madrid Conference and the Oslo Accords ended the First Intifada.
But this time it isn't a conflict for armies or diplomats. You can't send a tank to fight a mother with a master’s degree wielding a knife. You can't negotiate with a hate-filled 15-year-old armed with a screwdriver.
Diplomacy and force won't work this time because despite the kneejerk appellation of intifada, this is not an intifada.This is something far more sinister: A terrifying preview to a binational, one-state Israel that already exists to a large degree on the ground.
When Big Ideas die
After the unceremonious death of the two-state solution, with pessimism among Israelis and Palestinians at an all-time high, this is what we’re left with: Two hostile peoples reluctantly sharing one piece of land, butchering each other with whatever they can get their hands on, just as they have done for the past 100 years, but now with even less hope for a peaceful future or even co-existence.
One cannot separate the wanton abandon with which Israelis and Palestinians have been battering one another from the political vacuum. Netanyahu, Abbas, Herzog – none have any plan for the future. None know how to bring progress.
After the death of Big Ideas, the only thing left is the reality in which Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly entangled. The binational state that the architects of the two-state solution warned us about looks very much like the one transpiring before our very eyes, with ordinary Palestinians resorting to terrorist acts in their desperation and Israel taking on more and more dimensions of an apartheid state.
This scenario is worse than an intifada: For one, intifadas end. But this, there is no way to end this stage of the conflict - no peace negotiations, no magic “process”, no state-in-waiting. A fully equal binational state might stop it, but the chances of that happening are slim. 
However this current wave of violence plays out, Israelis and Palestinians have now seen the future. What’s happening in Israel-Palestine in the last few days is not an anomaly. It is the reality we have created, driven to its bleakest conclusion.

<title>Israel turning conflict into a religious one, warns Abbas, with disastrous consequences</title>
<date>Wed Oct 28 20:44:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday called for international protection for the Palestinians, saying the human rights situation under Israeli occupation is the worst it has ever been, and accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of exploiting the Holocaust to attack the Palestinians.
The fiery speech by Abbas to a special session of the UN-backed Human Rights Council in Geneva threatened to stir up new tensions with Israel, just as U.S.-led efforts to calm the situation in the region are getting under way.
Abbas blamed Israel for turning its political conflict with the Palestinians into a religious conflict and threatened that there would be "destructive repercussions."
Netanyahu has previously said the violence is the result of incitement by Palestinian leaders, including Abbas, as well as social media. The Palestinians say it is the result of frustration stemming from nearly 50 years of Israeli occupation, repeated failed peace efforts and a lack of hope in gaining independence anytime soon.
Abbas said Wednesday the human rights situation in the Palestinian territories is at its "worst and most critical since 1948" — the year of Israel's independence — and insisted "it is no longer useful to waste time in negotiations for the sake of negotiations. What is required is the end of the occupation in accordance with international legitimacy."
He called on the Security Council to "shoulder its responsibilities" and set up a "special regime of international protection for our Palestinian people. We want your protection — we want the protection of the world." He did not elaborate.
Abbas said that regional peace, security and stability would not be reached until the Israeli occupation ends and a Palestinian state is established along the 1967 borders with Jerusalem as its capital.
"I warned for years about what has been happening in Jerusalem and its environs, about the vice around it and the harm to Palestinian human, civil, economic and social rights," said Abbas, who added that he had also warned about what successive Israeli governments have done since 2000, changing Jerusalem's demographic balance, expanding settlements, digging under al-Aqsa and building fences to divide Palestinian neighborhoods. He also accused Israel of closing Palestinian national institutions.
"Israeli policy turned the political conflict into a religious conflict, which will have destructive repercussions," he added.
"Israel is behaving like a country that is above the law without any deterrence or accounting," asserted Abbas. "It continues a policy of controlling Palestinians on the ground, stealing their natural resources and building fences for settlers, paving roads and establishing a transportation system for them to create facts on the ground, based on Apartheid."
Abbas said that Israel was using military cover to let settlers commit crimes against Palestinians and damage their property and holy sites in Palestinian towns and villages.
"The situation has reached the point of armed gangs going by the name of 'price tag' committing crimes of murder and incitement," he said. "The terrorists from recent incidents – the burning of the Dawabsheh family home and the murder and burning of Mouhamad Abu Khdeir – have yet to be brought to justice."
Abbas attributed the recent Palestinian violence directly to the Israeli "policy we warned of, which is expressed in Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people and the failure of the international community to stop them."
The Palestinian president added that the current situation cannot go on and said, "I have come from Palestine with a message of a people that yearns for liberty and independence, and I ask you until when will this occupation continue? Has the time not arrived for the Palestinian people to win its independence? We are waiting to create the institutions and establish the rule of law."
Abbas then declared, "I call on the leadership in Israel – the time has come for you to recognize a Palestinian state and perhaps this is the last chance because we don't know what will happen given the winds of change blowing in the region."
He warned that if the "Palestinian people don't enjoy peace, security and stability on its land, no one will enjoy peace and stability because the Palestinian people won't sit with its hands folded." He said his people had grown up on principles of respect and its right to protect itself in all nonviolent ways and within the framework of international law.
'Mufti comments untrue and baseless'
Abbas also criticized Netanyahu for comments a week earlier suggesting that a World War II-era Palestinian religious leader had persuaded the Nazis to carry out a policy that exterminated 6 million Jews. The remarks about Nazi sympathizer Haj Amin al-Husseini, a former grand mufti of Jerusalem, aimed to illustrate Netanyahu's claim that Palestinian incitement at Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site goes back decades. Instead, it set off an uproar as Israeli historians accused him of bending historical facts for political gain.
Abbas said Netanyahu's allegations manipulate the sentiments of Jews about "the most horrendous crime known in modern history committed by the Nazis."
"He prefers to blame Palestinians for everything — even the Holocaust. You all know that this is totally false. It is untrue and baseless," he said.
"When the Israeli prime minister tries to absolve Adolf Hitler from his ugly crimes, against the Jews, and blame Palestinians for these crimes, he is trying thereby to justify the crimes committed against the Palestinian people," he said, according to an official translation of his remarks, which were delivered in Arabic.
Abbas accused Israel of carrying out "extrajudicial killings" during the latest violence — a reference to the shootings of Palestinians accused in stabbings.
He did not condemn the stabbings or mention that many of those killed were shot while carrying out stabbing attacks. Palestinians have accused Israel of using excessive force, claiming that alleged assailants were either unarmed or could have been stopped without being killed. Netanyahu has called on Abbas to condemn the stabbings.
Abbas called for "peaceful popular resistance" amid the alleged violations of Palestinian rights, lashed out at Israel's "oppressive war machine," and said "the criminal acts of settlers must be stopped."
The New York Times reported that Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Eviatar Manor, condemned Abbas over for the speech, and the Human Rights Council for holding a “scandalous special meeting” and allowing itself to be used as a stage for propaganda and “fanning the flames of conflict.”
“What we have witnessed today is the glorification of terror and violence,” Manor said following Abbas’ speech. “What the council allowed today is the banalization of the spilling of Jewish blood.”
After days of talks with Israel, Palestinian and Jordanian leaders, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced over the weekend that surveillance cameras would soon be installed at the sensitive Jerusalem holy site that has been at the heart of the unrest.
The hilltop compound in Jerusalem's Old City, revered by Jews as the Temple Mount, is the holiest site in Judaism. Known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, it houses the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the gold-topped Dome of the Rock. It is the third-holiest site in Islam and a key Palestinian national symbol.
Israel and Jordan are working out the details of the cameras, and expect to install them in a matter of days.
The Palestinians have expressed disappointment over Kerry's camera plan, saying it does nothing to address the deeper issues at the heart of the conflict.

<title>BDS movement targets top chefs visiting Israel</title>
<date>Fri Oct 30 03:41:11 IST 2015</date>
<content>
The BDS movement is targeting an event scheduled to bring nine top chefs from around the world to Tel Aviv next week.
As part of the event, Round Tables, eight chefs from acclaimed restaurants in Europe and the United States are scheduled to arrive with their restaurant staffs in order to dish up their flagship dishes to diners in Tel Aviv. Some of the restaurants have Michelin stars.
Now, the boycott, sanctions and divestment movement has teamed up with some 130 organizations in calling on the chefs not to participate. The petition states “Take apartheid off the menu” and describes the event as “gastro diplomacy” courtesy of the Israeli government that seeks to improve international trade and cultural relations.
“The initiative is even more tasteless as it comes on the heels of brutal Israeli repression against Palestinians protesting for their rights and freedom in the Occupied Territories and inside Israel,” states the BDS movement in its letter, published Tuesday.
So far, none of the participants have agreed to cancel, the BDS movement admitted.
Round Tables stated in response: “The initiative is being held as planned. All the guest restaurants and chefs are on their way to Israel. Some have already landed and started operations at the host restaurants. All the chefs have said they’re happy to take part in the initiative while recognizing Tel Aviv and Israel as international culinary powerhouses.”
Participating international restaurants include Craft in London, the Fat Radish in New York, the Cinnamon Kitchen in London, Ron Gastrobar in Amsterdam, Fruhsammers in Berlin, Tragaluz in Barcelona, Estiatorio Milos in Athens, Stazione di Posta in Rome, and Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles. Hosting restaurants in Tel Aviv include Coffee Bar, Yaffo Tel Aviv, Taizu, Herbert Samuel and Cafe Italia. Diners pay a fixed price of 269 shekels ($70).

<title>Roger Waters would rebuild 'The Wall' in Israel if gov't changed its policies</title>
<date>Mon Nov 16 23:56:36 IST 2015</date>
<content>
Pink Floyd star Roger Waters surprised many when he told Rolling Stone Magazine in an interview that he would be willing to rebuild his "The Wall" stageshow and perform it in Israel once again - but of course Waters, one of the most outspoken critics of Israel and a strong backer of the BDS movement against the Jewish State, had conditions.
"If Israel works toward equality and actual, real, genuine democracy, with no apartheid or racism infecting the society, then I will go over there and play The Wall again. I have the bits and pieces of the stage stored, and the ones I haven’t got stored, I will rebuild," Waters told Rolling Stone two weeks ago.
Waters is said to have written “The Wall” in 1979 as a metaphor for his internal isolation. But in recent years, he has increasingly politicized the seminal album, particularly to criticize Israel’s polices toward the Palestinians.
Waters said the message of “The Wall,” on which he wrote most of the songs, is: “Do you want a voice? And if you do, you better bloody well go out and get it because it’s not going to be handed to you on a plate.”
In 2006, Waters was slated to perform in Tel Aviv, but after visiting the security barrier, he decided to move his show to Neve Shalom, a cooperative village founded by both Arabs and Jews. He spray-painted the words “We don’t need no thought control” – lyrics from the song “Another Brick in the Wall” – on the security barrier.

<title>Everything you need to know ahead of Jonathan Pollard's release</title>
<date>Tue Nov 17 13:05:44 IST 2015</date>
<content>
JTA - Jonathan Pollard, the American spy for Israel sentenced to life in prison in 1987, is due to be released on parole on Saturday, 30 years after his arrest.
The former U.S. Navy analyst’s exit from a federal prison in Butner, North Carolina (where he reportedly befriended Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff), follows three decades of intrigue that have included charges of anti-Semitism against top U.S. officials, allegations that Pollard offered his services to other countries and his becoming a card in Middle East peace talks.
While those close to Pollard, 61, say security considerations keep them from revealing details of his release -- and U.S. government officials are not returning calls about it -- an examination of recent interviews with Pollard’s lawyers reveals some tangible details about the life Pollard will lead outside of the prison walls.
Pollard could be out by Shabbat.
According to the website of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Pollard is slated to be released on November 21. But that falls on a Saturday – Shabbat – and Pollard is now a Sabbath observer. Pollard’s lawyers have suggested in interviews that they have secured the parole commission’s agreement to allow Pollard to leave the day before.
His dream is to make aliyah
Eliot Lauer, a Pollard lawyer, told the Israeli daily Yedioth Acharonot last month that Pollard’s dream is to immigrate to Israel. But he'll need President Barack Obama’s say-so, and that’s not happening in the near term.
“The president has the authority, as a goodwill gesture, to limit the sentence to 30 years and thereby end it completely, allowing Pollard to become a free man and to fulfill the dream he has told me about many times — to make aliyah to Israel,” Lauer said.
On Monday, two Jewish congressmen from New York -- Reps. Eliot Engel and Jerrold Nadler, both Democrats -- wrote to Loretta Lynch, the U.S. attorney general, saying Pollard was ready to give up his U.S. citizenship in order to be allowed to travel immediately to Israel.
In a separate interview this month, Lauer told the Times of Israel that Pollard “wants to make a contribution” to Israel. “He has a lot of significant ideas.”
In any case, Pollard’s Israel plans will likely have to wait, given the parole commission's restrictions on his movements and requirements that he report to a probation officer for at least a year.
Pollard has a job
Pollard’s lawyers said in July that they had “secured employment and housing for Mr. Pollard in the New York area.” Lauer, in an email to JTA, declined to be more specific. The New York Observer reported this week, quoting “sources,” that Pollard would live in Manhattan.
More recently, Lauer told the Times of Israel that the “Orthodox or semi-Orthodox community” has been most helpful in securing employment and residence for Pollard while he is in New York.
Whatever Pollard does, it will not be too strenuous. He has endured multiple hospital visits in recent years, at times to address kidney and liver ailments, according to his supporters. (A Knesset bill under consideration would have Israel paying for his medical and residential expenses, as well as providing him with a monthly stipend, The Jerusalem Post reported earlier this month.)
He is remarried
Pollard and his second wife, Esther, will enjoy freedom together for the first time. Pollard divorced his first wife, Anne, who served three years on the espionage charges, in part so she could forge a new and separate life. He married Esther, a Canadian who had been advocating for his release, in 1994, his ninth year in prison.
There's no love lost between Pollard and Jewish communal leaders
Though he's looking forward to being active in the “Jewish community,” he’ll likely steer clear of mainstream Jewish communal officials.
“During the course of this initiative, we got to know an awful lot of Jewish leaders here in the United States,” Pollard told journalist Edwin Black in an extensive 2002 interview. “And they seem to fall into one of several groups in their response to me. Some ran away from it ... others promised to do things but basically didn’t … and others did harm.”
The feeling is mutual. Pollard has alleged that his interrogators asked him to implicate a list of American Jewish leaders in his espionage; he refused to do so. The Jewish leaders told Black they believed the list was Pollard’s invention, a ploy to stir sympathy for his cause.
Competing narratives will endure ...
Don’t expect the competing narratives between Pollard’s defenders and accusers to be reconciled. Was Pollard a reluctant recruit driven to divulge to Israel a narrow set of data that would save Jewish lives but that the Americans, despite pledges to share such information, were keeping secret? Or was he, as his accusers have charged, greedy, delivering mountains of documents to Israel in exchange for a lavish lifestyle, and peddling his services to other nations, including apartheid South Africa? But the terms of Pollard's parole will likely keep him quiet.
... And so, too, will the rancor
When it comes to “with us or against us,” Pollard and his defenders make George W. Bush look like a pushover. For a time, the Washington Post reported in 1998, Pollard cut off his family, despite their years of dedication to his release. He has alienated some of his most ardent supporters. And pity the journalists who stray even slightly from their narrative that Pollard is a heroic victim of a massive injustice – the recriminations come fast and furious.
Pity also David Luchins, the much-lauded longtime Orthodox Jewish activist who in 1993 organized an appeal to President Bill Clinton to commute Pollard’s sentence. The appeal included a letter of remorse from Pollard, in which Pollard admitted that his crimes had violated not just U.S. but Jewish law. Pollard, according to Black, later had regrets about the admission, and Pollard’s followers blamed Luchins. Black reported that Luchins suffered death threats and required federal protection for a period.
Pollard's accusers at times, too, seem susceptible to a delusional apoplexy
Seymour Hersh, writing for the New Yorker on the case in 1999, probed intelligence officials to explain how they knew information Pollard handed Israel reached the Soviets. The officials acknowledged that they had no hard evidence, and the accusation — key to perceiving Pollard as someone who posed a threat to national security — seems more an article of faith than of fact.

<title>The top Haaretz scoops of 2015</title>
<date>Tue Dec 29 14:47:50 IST 2015</date>
<content>
How closely did you follow the news in 2015? Catch up on the biggest Haaretz investigations, exposés and special reports that set the news agenda this year.
1. Settlement Dollars
Private U.S. donors are massively funding Israeli settlements by using a network of tax-exempt nonprofits, which funneled more than $220 million (about 850 million shekels) to Jewish communities in the West Bank in 2009-2013 alone, a Haaretz investigation found. In a series of reports, Uri Blau follows the money trail from Israeli and American donors to the settlements.
2. Anti-Semitism in Europe
Is it time for the Jews to leave Europe? After terror struck Paris in January and Copenhagen in February, many asked that question. Haaretz's Anshel Pfeffer traveled the continent to ask European Jews themselves. He found vibrant and engaged communities largely unafraid to be openly Jewish, and who aren't going anywhere. His trip was documented in the 11-part series, "The Cossacks Aren't Coming."
3. 'Lost Tribes'
Though little, if any, proof exists of their Jewish lineage, the Bnei Menashe of northeastern India are moving to Israel in large numbers thanks to an unprecedented government decision. Haaretz's Judy Maltz investigated how this unusual operation came about.
4. Hitler-Mufti Debacle
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sparked public uproar when he claimed that the Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, was the one who planted the idea of the extermination of European Jewry in Adolf Hitler's mind. The Nazi ruler, Netanyahu told the World Zionist Congress in Jerusalem, had no intention of killing the Jews, but only to expel them. A Haaretz report brought the utterance to light, sparking a global debate that ultimately led Netanyahu to backtrack, clarifying that he never meant to "absolve [Adolf] Hitler of his responsibility for the Holocaust."
5. One Year Since War
June marked one year to the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenage boys in the West Bank that sparked Operation Protective Edge. In a special report, Amos Harel and Chaim Levinson revealed the mistakes that lined Israel's frantic search for the teenagers. In August, Haaretz published a nine-part series on the Israel-Gaza war, examining what had changed in the year since the 50-day conflict ended, and to ask whether – or when – the next war will erupt.
6. Ripples Through Modern Orthodoxy
Has Modern Orthodoxy in America reached its breaking point? Haaretz's Yair Ettinger traveled to New York to write a special report on the deep crisis facing the wealthiest and most influential Jewish community in the United States.
7. Jewish Terrorism
After an arson attack on a Palestinian family's house in the West Bank town of Duma, the Shin Bet security services raised the threat level of a group of Jewish radicals called "The Revolt." Haaretz's Chaim Levinson revealed who the group's key members are, how it operated and what it seeks to achieve.
8. Donald Trump in High Heels
Who is Miri Regev? The firebrand culture minister is constantly in the media – and the more controversy she stirs up, the more popular she gets. Danna Harman wrote an in-depth profile on the woman Haaretz coined Israel's Donald Trump in high heels.
9. Apartheid or Israel
Roger Waters, one of the leading lights in the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement, set the record straight, telling Haaretz he hates apartheid, not Israel. In an exclusive interview with Gideon Levy, the former Pink Floyd singer spoke about his political views, tragic family history – and when the rock star-turned-activist will be happy to play in Israel again.
10. Silvan Shalom
Yaniv Kubovich's article on a woman alleging Silvan Shalom sexually assaulted her prompted several other women to make similar claims. The allegations ultimately led to the interior minister's resignation from public office, after 23 years as a Knesset Member and several ministerial positions.
11. Labeling Settlement Goods
The foreign ministers from 16 out of 28 European Union countries sent a letter in April to the European Union's foreign policy chief asking to push forward the process of labeling goods produced in Israeli settlements that are sold in grocery chains across the continent. Haaretz's Barak Ravid obtained a copy of that letter, and published it in an exclusive report. Ravid followed the story closely throughout the year, including when the European Commission adopted guidelines in November for labeling products from Israeli settlements.
12. Netanyahu and Walla!
Gidi Weitz, Haaretz’s chief investigative reporter, showed how the popular Hebrew news portal Walla has developed an appetite for positive stories about Benjamin and Sara Netanyahu, and revealed the links between politicians and tycoons.

<title>'The Settlers' gives Sundance a window into extremist West Bank movement</title>
<date>Sat Jan 30 17:28:34 IST 2016</date>
<content>
JTA - What is a settler?
That’s the question that opens the new documentary film “The Settlers,” which premiered last week at the Sundance Film Festival.
Written and directed by Shimon Dotan, the film offers an answer almost immediately: a religious fundamentalist driven by messianic ideology who believes Jews have the exclusive right to the West Bank and may use all manner of subterfuge, violence and law breaking to fulfill the divine imperative of settling the Holy Land.
There is truth in this answer, but it is not the whole truth.
Most settlers, as Dotan himself acknowledged in an interview with JTA, do not fit this description. They are “economic settlers” – Israelis who live in the West Bank because it’s cheaper than living in Israel proper. They are overwhelmingly law abiding, reside mostly within commuting distance of major Israeli cities and include secular Jews among their ranks.
Dotan said that 320,000 of the West Bank’s 400,000 settlers fall into this category. Only the remaining 80,000 are “ideological settlers,” who live there for reasons of religious or political principle. Of those, a fraction are extremists.
That context is largely missing from his film, which focuses almost exclusively on the far-right religious extreme – the hilltop youth who illegally occupy remote outposts, the young Jews who perpetrate and celebrate violence against Palestinians, residents of the most fanatically anti-Arab communities in the West Bank.
Dotan told JTA he focused on the fringe because the extremists determine the course of the entire movement.
“If you want to understand a phenomenon, you have to go the fringes, to the leaders,” Dotan said.
By failing to provide much context about mainstream settlers, the film conveys the message that the Jews of the West Bank are exclusively racist, murderous zealots and the sole impediment to Israeli-Palestinian harmony. Or, as veteran Haaretz columnist Akiva Eldar describes them in the film, “a monster of half a million people standing in the way of peace.”
That’s not to say settler extremists aren’t an important subject for consideration. Though relatively small in number, they wield outsize influence on the settlement enterprise, on Israeli-Palestinian relations and on Israeli policy. Increasingly, they are a focus of worldwide attention. On January 18, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Daniel Shapiro, made headlines when he warned of unchecked “Israeli vigilantism in the West Bank.”
Dotan’s film forces us to reckon with the ugliness in the settler movement, even as he showcases the West Bank’s beauty with some stunning aerial photography. His subjects are the settler from Tekoa who proudly declares himself a racist, the father who talks jovially to his young sons about beating up Arabs when they grow up, the settlers who want their enterprise eventually to swallow the Kingdom of Jordan — and maybe even all the land from the Nile River in Egypt to the Euphrates in Iraq.
“Today, almost 50 years after the first settler made his home in the West Bank, the settlement drive is a clear-cut success,” the film’s narrator says. “The settlers see themselves as pioneers, the leaders of Israeli society. The question is: Where are they leading it — to divine redemption, as they claim, or to apartheid?”
Dotan, 66, who has lived in the United States for the past 20 years and teaches political cinema at New York University, approaches his subject chronologically. He starts with the leaders of Gush Emunim, the ideological movement that, influenced by the teachings of Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook, believed that the 1967 war heralded divine redemption and that settling the newly conquered territory would help usher in the messianic age.
The film intersperses interviews with the movement’s aging leaders with archival footage of those leaders as young men, leading demonstrations, establishing new West Bank outposts, celebrating with followers. Where there’s no footage, Dotan relies on illustrations and voice-overs to tell crucial parts of the story. The beautiful illustrations are the work of artist David Polonsky, who did the animation for “Waltz with Bashir,” the Oscar-nominated 2009 Israeli film about the Lebanon War.
The result is a fascinating look at how the settlements came into being, and the men and women on the movement’s fringe who continue to push its boundaries – both ideologically and physically. “The Settlers” also documents how the Israeli government — sometimes willingly, sometimes unwillingly and often unwittingly and without foresight – helped build and reinforce the settlement enterprise.
In one scene, Sarah Nachshon, who played a seminal role in establishing the Jewish settlement in Hebron, recalls how she forced the reopening of the old Jewish cemetery at a time when it wasn’t clear Israel would allow Jews to remain in the city. In was the mid-1970s, and her infant son had just died in his crib. She insisted on burying him in Hebron, though no Jew had been buried there since before Israel’s establishment.
When Israeli officials refused, Nachshon simply ignored their orders, marching past Israeli soldiers with her dead baby in her arms. Once the baby was interred, the cemetery became another site Israeli soldiers were compelled to patrol – another active Jewish outpost in the West Bank.
The film features interviews with unrepentant members of the Jewish Underground, who in the 1980s carried out bombing attacks against the Palestinian mayors of Nablus, Ramallah and El Bireh (two were maimed, one escaped unharmed), plotted to blow up the mosque at the Temple Mount and planted bombs on Arab buses. Israeli officials caught them and defused the bombs before they exploded.
We see undated scenes of Jews beating Arabs in their fields with crowbars, Jews beating Arabs in the streets of Hebron, a Jew explaining how in the Jewish tradition, “Revenge is an important thing.”
Palestinian violence against Israelis goes almost unmentioned, except for a few oblique references. In Dotan’s film, the only Palestinians we see are victims. Palestinian violence is “irrelevant” to this story, Dotan said.
Dotan says his primary target for this film is Israelis, among whom he hopes the movie will spark conversation. Dotan is still looking for an American distributor for the film.
“I think Israelis know very little about what’s happening in the West Bank and little about the ideological origins of the settlements,” Dotan said. “This film gives settlers’ voices a platform. I hope people will listen.”

<title>Oxford University Labour Club co-chair resigns over Israel Apartheid Week dispute</title>
<date>Tue Feb 16 11:59:43 IST 2016</date>
<content>
The co-chair of the Oxford University Labour Club has resigned after the club's decision to endorse Israel Apartheid Week.
Alex Chalmers, the co-chair of the student organization affiliated with the British Labour Party, stated that he did not feel comfortable with the direction the society was moving in, and could no longer defend its actions, according to Oxford's Cherwell student newspaper.
"Despite its avowed commitment to liberation, the attitudes of certain members of the club towards certain disadvantaged groups was becoming poisonous," Chalmers wrote.
"Whether it be members of the Executive throwing around the term 'Zio' (a term for Jews usually confined to websites run by the Ku Klux Klan) with casual abandon, senior members of the club expressing their 'solidarity' with Hamas and explicitly defending their tactics of indiscriminately murdering civilians, or a former Co-Chair claiming that 'most accusations of antisemitism are just the Zionists crying wolf,’ a large proportion of both OULC and the student left in Oxford more generally have some kind of problem with Jews," Chalmers continued. 
"The decision of the club to endorse a movement with a history of targeting and harassing Jewish students and inviting antisemitic speakers to campuses, despite the concerns of Jewish students, illustrates how uneven and insincere much of the active membership is when it comes to liberation."
"I had hoped during my tenure as Co-Chair to move the club away from some of its more intolerant tendencies; sadly, it only continued to move away from me," he wrote in a Facebook post. "A large proportion of both OULC and the student left in Oxford more generally have some kind of problem with Jews."
Chalmers told Cherwell that he no longer recognized the club he joined last year. "I hope my decision will go some way in raising awareness of the campus anti-Semitism that has gone unnoticed for far too long in Oxford," he was quoted as saying.
Noni Csogor, Chalmers' co-chair, said that while she respected his decision to quit, the endorsement did not represent a blanket position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
"I understand Alex’s position, but am looking forward both to running the events we’ve organised for the rest of the term, and to contributing to an ongoing discussion about the complex intersection of justice for Palestine and the safety of Jewish students," Csogor said.

<title>Variety refuses to publish a pro-BDS ad accusing Israel of apartheid in Oscars issue</title>
<date>Tue Feb 23 18:11:04 IST 2016</date>

Entertainment magazine Variety refused to publish an advertisement that says, “Don’t endorse Israeli apartheid," in its upcoming Oscars issue.
Jewish Voice for Peace, or JVP, a group that supports the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel, announced Monday that the magazine initially accepted payment for the group’s ad, but then said it could not publish it since “it would need to have a softer tone.”
The ad, whose top line reads “Free Trip to Israel at the Expense of Palestinians,” calls on Oscar nominees to refuse a free Israel trip worth $55,000 offered in their “swag bags.”
JVP said in a statement it had asked for suggestions of “specific edits,” but was told that:  “The topic is too sensitive at this time and we will not be in a position to add it to next week’s edition.”
JVP Executive Director Rebecca Vilkomerson called the refusal “a clear and disturbing example of the constraints on public debate about Palestine and Israel. Variety’s refusal to print our ad — especially in the context of the pro-occupation ads they have published in the past — illustrates a clear bias. Messages that support Israel are acceptable, while those that assert the humanity of Palestinians are censored.”
JVP, which co-sponsored the ad together with the US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, was apparently referencing a December 2011 ad Variety published from the Emergency Committee to Protect Israel. That advertisement does not explicitly support Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, but it asks: “Why does the Obama administration treat Israel like a punching bag?”
Variety did not respond to a request from the Forward for comment.
The Israeli government is sponsoring the $55,000 all-expense paid, 10-day luxury travel pack with first-class air to Tel Aviv that is included in swag bags for Oscar host Chris Rock and all nominees in the best actor/actress, best supporting actor/actress, and director categories.
So far two Oscar nominees, Mark Rylance and Asif Kapadia, have pledged not to visit Israel professionally, according to JVP.

<title>Oberlin professor's anti-Semitic posts are 'personal views,' says college</title>
<date>Sun Feb 28 01:01:14 IST 2016</date>
<content>
In response to an article revealing that an Oberlin College professor made numerous postings about Jews and Israel to Facebook, the liberal arts college’s president said the college “respects the right of its faculty, students, staff and alumni to express their personal views.”
Marvin Krislov’s statement came after The Tower on Thursday published an article about Joy Karega, an assistant professor of rhetoric and composition at the elite Ohio institution.
Karega, who took down her Facebook posts and Twitter account after the article’s publication, had made comments accusing Israel and “Rothschild-led bankers” of responsibility for downing a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine in 2014. She also posted a graphic of Jacob Rothschild, a member of the prominent Jewish banking family, with a caption reading: “We own your news. The media. Your oil. And your government.”
Screenshots of many of her posts were published originally on The Tower.
In a statement posted on Oberlin’s alumni Facebook page on Thursday, Krislov, who is Jewish, added, “The statements posted on social media by Dr. Joy Karega, assistant professor of rhetoric and composition, are hers alone and do not represent the views of Oberlin College.”
Alan Dershowitz, an emeritus professor of law at Harvard University, criticized Krislov’s response, telling The Tower: “If Karega had expressed comparably bigoted views about Blacks, Muslims or gays, the President of Oberlin would not have posted the boilerplate he posted. He would have condemned those views, even if he defended her right to express them.”
In one post, Karega accused “the same people behind the massacre in Gaza” of shooting down the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine. She continued: “With this false flag, the Rothschild-led banksters, exposed and hated and out of economic options to stave off the coming global deflationary depression, are implementing the World War III option.”
Karega’s social media posts drew attention after she was listed as co-sponsor of an event at Oberlin scheduled for March 2 in which Robin Kelley, a history professor at UCLA, is due to deliver a lecture entitled, “Fighting Apartheid Since 1948: Key Moments in Palestinian and Black Solidarity.”
Karega declined to respond to The Tower, but posted on Facebook Friday: “Robin Kelley IS still coming to Oberlin next week, despite efforts by some to prevent it. Trust, when I come up out of my Unbothered state of being, I’ll have a lot to say (analysis, no doubt) about the kinds of intimidation and silencing tactics that are rhetorically enacted in digital spaces, through email, through telephone communication, and propagandized editorial articles, masquerading as ‘journalism,’ and how common it is for Black women, who are early in their career on the tenure track as part of the professoriate, to be prime targets for these kinds of activities and practices.”
Oberlin has drawn attention in recent months for what some alumni claim is a culture of tolerance for anti-Semitism. More than 250 alumni have signed an open letter to Krislov voicing concern about this and mentioning several incidents at the school, including the expulsion of the Kosher Halal co-op from the Oberlin Student Cooperation Association and a protest against Israel on Rosh Hashanah that Jewish students had to pass through on their way to holiday services.
Some Jewish student leaders criticized that letter in an op-ed published in the Cleveland Jewish News this week, saying the letter “lack(ed) a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics on Oberlin’s campus” and expressing concern that “there was virtually no student involvement or input on the letter’s contents.”
The school also garnered headlines in December when African-American student activists issued a 14-page list of demands to Krislov, including that the school divest from companies doing business with Israel. The document also demanded that Krislov guarantee tenure “upon review” for Karega and seven other African-American tenure-track faculty members.

<title>Columbia University professors sign petition in support of BDS</title>
<date>Wed Mar 02 11:07:44 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Forty Columbia University faculty members have signed a petition urging the New York school to divest from companies that “supply, perpetuate, and profit from a system that has subjugated the Palestinian people.”
The petition was released Monday morning to mark the first day of Israel Apartheid Week, the Columbia Spectator reported.
According to the petition, the signatories “stand with Columbia University Apartheid Divest, Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine as well as with Jewish Voice for Peace in calling upon the University to take a moral stance against Israel’s violence in all its forms.”
They include Rashid Khalidi, a history and Middle Eastern studies professor who is a longtime critic of Israel and supporter of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement; Joseph Massad, a professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history who sees Zionism as a racist and colonialist movement, and Nadia Abu El-Haj, an anthropology professor who received tenure in 2007 following a heated battle over the merits of her work, particularly a book that accuses Israel of manipulating archaeological findings to legitimize its existence.
The most heavily represented departments among the signers are Middle Eastern South Asian and Africa studies, or MESAAS, English and comparative literature, and anthropology.
Partha Chatterjee, an anthropology and MESAAS professor at the Ivy League school who signed, told the Spectator in an email that he wanted to protest Israel’s security regime, which “virtually amounts to apartheid.”
“I fully support every effort to put pressure on the Israeli government to end its illegal occupation of Palestinian lands,” he said.
Dirk Salomons, a signatory who is a senior lecturer at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs, told the Spectator, “I’ve always had a feeling as a Jew that a Jewish state should rise slightly above the lack of morality of its neighbors. It pains me to see how a country which I love and which I have visited many times can be so blind to the needs of its neighbors.”

<title>New York City Council's Jewish caucus drafting bill to combat anti-Semitism at CUNY</title>
<date>Thu Mar 03 21:23:01 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Members of the New York City Council’s Jewish caucus are drafting legislation aimed at combating anti-Semitism at the City University of New York.
Councilman Mark Levine, who chairs the 14-member caucus, said he expects legislation to be submitted within a month, the New York Post reported Wednesday. The law would require CUNY officials to report all incidents of bias at its campuses to the council.
“We’re not convinced that the university is adequately tracking what is clearly a pattern of bigotry,” Levine told the Post.
On Monday, the Post reported that James Milliken, the chancellor of CUNY, a 24-campus public university in New York City, had appointed two attorneys to investigate claims of anti-Semitism. According to the Post, the school will also establish a task force to address campus bigotry.
The news comes barely a week after the Zionist Organization of America sent Milliken a 14-page letter detailing several incidents of concern at four CUNY colleges. The letter, which was copied to New York Mayor Bill de Blasio as well as several members of New York’s congressional delegation, detailed numerous instances of alleged anti-Semitism reported to the ZOA by CUNY students. Among the incidents were reports of members of Students for Justice in Palestine yelling epithets at Jewish students, including “Jews out of CUNY” and “Jews are racist sons of bitches.”
ZOA National President Morton Klein told JTA that his organization was informed that it would be meeting in the near future with the two attorneys leading the probe. Klein alleged that campus activism by pro-Palestinian students infringed on university rules that prohibit obstructing free speech rights, verbal and physical abuse, and the endangerment of anyone’s physical or mental health.
“If they were simply having rallies that Israel was an occupying force or an apartheid state, this might be within the rules,” Klein said. “But they go far beyond that.”
Klein said he was seeking to have Students for Justice in Palestine stripped of its status as a student group at CUNY.

<title>CUNY to probe anti-Semitism after 'Zionist pig' incident at Brooklyn College</title>
<date>Fri Mar 04 20:09:49 IST 2016</date>
<content>
After last month’s anti-Zionist incident at Brooklyn College, the City University of New York launched an investigation into allegations of anti-Semitism at several of its campuses.
In addition to the probe directed by CUNY Chancellor James Milliken, the university is establishing a task force to foster a more understanding and respectful environment.
The probe follows a string of recent incidents across CUNY campuses that the Anti-Defamation League characterized as featuring “anti-Israel bias” in a statement Friday, in which it also praised the university for its actions.
The Zionist Organization of America sent Milliken a letter about the incidents on February 22. ZOA National President Mort Klein told JTA that his organization was informed that it would be meeting in the near future with the two attorneys leading the probe.
On February 16, students at Brooklyn College allegedly demanded that “Zionists” leave campus and referred to a professor at a meeting as a “Zionist pig,” prompting strong condemnations of the incident by the college administration.
That Thursday, state assemblyman from Brooklyn, Dov Hikind, called on Brooklyn College to discipline the involved students.
“The university needs to act on this and enforce disciplinary action on the students that participated,” the Democrat said in a statement. “It’s nice to issue a statement apologizing for what occurred, but actions speak much louder than words.”
In November, the New York City chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine invoked what ADL called an anti-Semitic stereotype in the lead-up to the “Million Student March” rally at Hunter College when it referred to those who run CUNY as a “Zionist administration.”
The pro-Palestinian organization said its members “categorically refute all claims of racism being thrown at the Million Student March and various chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine.”
Additionally, several hate messages, including anti-Semitic, anti-gay and racist graffiti were discovered in restrooms and a classroom on the campus of John Jay College last year.
Klein alleged that campus activism by pro-Palestinian students infringed on university rules that prohibit obstructing free speech rights, verbal and physical abuse, and the endangerment of anyone’s physical or mental health.
“If they were simply having rallies that Israel was an occupying force or an apartheid state, this might be within the rules,” Klein said. “But they go far beyond that.
Evan R. Bernstein, ADL New York regional director, said, “Over the past few years, students have expressed to us firsthand a growing concern over a climate of anti-Jewish animus on some” CUNY campuses. “We are also troubled by the manifestation of anti-Israel bias that has left some Jewish students feeling singled out.”
The formation of a task force composed of members of the administration, faculty and students is “an additional step that indicates that CUNY is taking these allegations seriously,” Bernstein said.

<title>BDS activists label Israeli products in Canadian stores</title>
<date>Tue Mar 15 14:31:53 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Two Canadian corporations have promised vigilance after pro-Palestinian activists plastered their products with anti-Israel stickers.
In recent weeks, Facebook posts by those advocating the boycott, divestment and sanctions or BDS campaign against Israel have shown warning labels affixed to bottles of Israeli wine for sale in Vancouver and grocery products at a store in Calgary.
“Shopping was fun!” announced Calgary BDS activist Billie Jones on her Facebook page earlier this month. A photo there shows anti-Israel labels stuck on several grocery products.
The photo reveals the act took place at an outlet of No Frills, a chain owned by Canadian grocery giant Loblaw Corp. Ltd.
“I can confirm that an individual placed stickers on some products in a Calgary No Frills last week,” Catherine Thomas, Loblaw’s director of external communications, said in response to a JTA query.
“The stickers were removed immediately by store staff,” Thomas added. “However, no one saw the person who applied them. In instances like this, our general practice would be to ban the individual from the store moving forward.”
The stickers read: “Warning! Made in Israel: A country violating international law, the 4th Geneva Convention, and fundamental human rights…
BDS.”
They were stuck on Pampers diapers, made by Proctor & Gamble, one of the largest clients of an Israeli company that supplies diaper products; on Coffee-mate, made by Nestlé, which has a large business footprint in Israel; and McCafé coffee by McDonald’s, which BDS activists say has partnered with U.S. Jewish groups to promote trips to Israel.
Meanwhile, stickers proclaiming “Israeli apartheid, don’t buy into it” were affixed to five bottles of Efrat white wine, made in the Judean Hills, at a Vancouver liquor store.
Photos of the stickers on the wine bottles also were posted on Facebook.
Employees “immediately” removed the stickers, said Viola Kaminski, a spokesperson for the British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch.
“While this appears to be an isolated incident at this point, we are advising store managers to be extra vigilant in monitoring these wines,” Kaminski said, adding: “our corporate loss prevention team is also aware of this issue and is advising store security teams to continue monitoring these wines carefully as well.”

<title>U.K. Jewish weekly highlights concern about anti-Semitism in British Labour Party</title>
<date>Fri Mar 18 02:22:00 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Virtually the entire front page of the current issue of the Jewish Chronicle of London is devoted to a scathing editorial that takes the British Labour Party to task, saying that it "now seems to be a party that attracts anti-Semites like flies to a cesspit."
The party, which last governed Britain under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown between 1997 and 2010, is now led by Jeremy Corbyn, who since his election as party head last summer has engendered concern in the British Jewish community and elsewhere for views that are seen by some as extreme and likley to doom the party to remaining in opposition. 
Criticism of Corbyn features prominently in the editorial in the Jewish Chronicle, a Jewish weekly that is not only influential in Britain but is also thought to be the oldest Jewish weekly in the world, having been founded in 1841.
"Last summer, as Jeremy Corbyn was gliding serenely towards victory in the Labour leadership election, this newspaper asked him a series of questions about his associations with various anti-Semites," the editorial states. 
"We said that we believed we spoke for the vast majority of British Jews in expressing deep foreboding at the prospect of his election as leader, a view that was confirmed the following week by a poll of the community which showed that over 80 percent were concerned by his contacts, and by such comments as his reference to terrorist groups Hamas and Hizbollah as 'our friends.'"
The article continues: "Mr. Corbyn has now been leader for six months, and the only conclusion that can be drawn is that our fears were justified. Labour now seems to be a party that attracts anti-Semites like flies to a cesspit. Barely a week goes by without the identification of a racist party member or allegations of racist behavior by those involved in the party. And the target of that racism seems always to be Jews."
The article then goes on to cite the case of Gerry Downing, who is said to have opposed condemnation of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, and who this month was expelled from the party. It also notes the case of Vicki Kirby, a former Labour Party parliamentary candidate who took heat in 2014 over Tweets in which she reportedly stated that Adolf Hitler might be the "Zionist God” and that Jews had “big noses.” She was suspended from the party twice.
The editorial also noted the case of the Oxford University Labour Party Club. In mid-February, Alex Chalmers, co-chair of the club resigned after the body decided to support Israel Apartheid Week. He claimed many club members “have some kind of problem with Jews." The scandal deepened after the Oxford Jewish Society released further allegations of harassment against Jewish students. The Chronicle noted that Dowing and Kirby were suspended from the party, and that an inquiry into the Oxford University party branch was launched.
"But when these were first identified, party officers appeared to have almost no interest — as if the very mention of anti-Semitism was worthy of little more than a yawn," the editorial asserted. And it added: "Mr. Cobyn appears to be genuine in his rejection of anti-Semitism. And yet for all the fine words that he speaks, the plain fact is that he leads a party that anti-Semites clearly feel is their natural home. If that does not worry him then — to put it mildly — questions need to be asked."
Britain's New Statesman magazine ran a statement by the Labour Party that stated: "The Labour Party takes all allegations of anti-Semitism, racism, bullying, intimidation and candidate misconduct very seriously.  Baroness Jan Royall [a former leader of the British House of Lords] is currently leading an investigation into the conduct of individual Young Labour Party members. Baroness Royall will consider all allegations and all relevant evidence.”
For its part, however, the Jewish Chronicle editorial concludes: "If Labour is not to lose the last residue of trust from our community, it must recognize and deal with that cancer."

<title>Prominent trans activist cancels Brown Hillel speech amid 'pinkwashing' protest</title>
<date>Sun Mar 20 13:33:43 IST 2016</date>
<content>
A prominent African-American transgender activist canceled her scheduled appearance at the Brown University Hillel after facing criticism for allegedly supporting the Jewish group’s “pinkwashing” of Israeli treatment of the Palestinians.
Janet Mock announced Wednesday that she had cancelled her talk scheduled for March 21 at the Providence, Rhode Island Ivy League school, The Brown Daily Herald reported.
Moral Voices, a Jewish student group, had invited her in partnership with the Brown Center for Students of Color, Sarah Doyle Women’s Center, LGBTQ Center, Sexual Assault Peer Educators and other campus groups, along with the Brown/RISD (Rhode Island School of Design) Hillel.
In a petition on Change.org, 159 Brown students urged Mock to disassociate her lecture from Hillel because “Hillel as a corporation has consistently defended and even advocated for the Israeli state’s policies of occupation and racial apartheid. Israel’s violent policies center on colonialism, ethnic cleansing, and genocide of native Palestinians.”
The petition also claimed that Moral Voices’ focus on LGBT rights “hides the fact that for decades, the state of Israel and Israeli advocacy organizations (like Hillel) have been engaging in pinkwashing,” or allegedly highlighting Israel’s queer friendliness “to deflect attention from Israel’s colonization and occupation of Palestinians.”
The Moral Voices group, which is funded by a grant from Hillel, has said it takes no position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In a statement on its Facebook page, Moral Voices wrote, “This cancellation is the result of gross mischaracterizations of Brown RISD Hillel and the intentions of the student activists on the Moral Voices Committee who worked since last spring to bring Ms. Mock to Brown …”
In a response to the Change.org petition published March 10, before Mock cancelled, Moral Voices’s leaders wrote:
We, the MV leadership, are neither equipped for nor invested in arguing the merits of Brown RISD Hillel’s Israel/Palestine-related programming. This petition does, however, make us ask: given that Hillel is the center for Jewish life on this campus — with a mandate to support the interests and meet the needs of a very diverse constituency of Jewish students on College Hill (ranging widely in their political, religious, and cultural inclinations) — does simply engaging in a Jewish space render one unfit to do justice work?
The discussion of lateral violence within the LGBTQ+ community itself is central to this year’s topic. In challenging the legitimacy of our social justice work based on the group’s Jewish affiliation, the petition seeks to undermine our right to intersectional engagement and implies a need for us to cede spaces and relinquish causes that are very much ours.

<title>Oxford Labor Club officer steps down, citing anti-Israel motion</title>
<date>Mon Mar 21 09:24:22 IST 2016</date>
<content>
A second officer of Oxford University’s Labor Club has resigned after leveling discrimination charges.
The club’s disabilities officer, Brahma Mohanty, stepped down after claiming the club forced members to “subscribe to a radical ideology of division and isolation,” the London-based Telegraph newspaper reported Friday.
Last month, Alex Chalmers resigned as co-chair following claims that his colleagues “have some kind of problem with Jews.” Chalmers, who is not Jewish, said at the time he was leaving the “poisonous” club after it endorsed Israel Apartheid Week —  a string of activities against Israel that takes place annually in several dozen cities and especially on campuses.
Mohanty said in his resignation letter, according to the Telegraph, “I have personally experienced in recent weeks and meetings that this does not appear to be an ethos shared amongst the OULC body in light of the passing of the Israeli Apartheid Week motion and the more recent motion which essentially ‘purges’ the OULC membership and forces members to subscribe to a radical ideology of division and isolation.”
He added, “Simply put, I cannot in good faith carry out my duties in promoting access and engagement with a club that I feel is projecting itself in the complete opposite manner.”
Earlier this month, the club passed a motion to limit voting privileges to just those members who support only the Labor Party or its aims, according to The Telegraph.

<title>Leading Jewish figure in U.K. Labour Party threatens to quit over anti-Semitism</title>
<date>Tue Mar 22 11:51:19 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Lord Michael Levy, the chief fundraiser for Britain's Labour Party when Tony Blair was at its helm, issued a warning on Sunday on Britain's Sky News station that he might quit the party if it doesn't do more to confront anti-Semitism.
"Anti-Semitism in any political party cannot be tolerated, and it is for the leadership to make that absolutely clear," said Levy, who has also served in leading positions in the London Jewish community, according to the Jewish Chronicle of London. "If they don't make that clear, I will start to question that myself and actually question my being a Labour peer and a proud member of the Labour Party."
The issue of anti-Semitism in the party that most recently ruled Britain between 1997 to 2010 was highlighted last week in a front-page editorial in the Jewish Chronicle. The editorial described concerns in the British Jewish community when Jeremy Corbyn took over as Labour Party leader last year. The paper cited references that Corbyn reportedly made to the Islamic militant groups Hezbollah and Hamas as "our friends." Arguing that those earlier concerns were now found to be justified, the Chronicle said that "Labour now seems to be a party that attracts anti-Semites like flies to a cesspit."
For his part, however, Corbyn appeared on Sky News on Monday to say that Levy is well aware that he has in fact decried anti-Semitism and any other forms of prejudice on numerous occasions. He invited members of the Jewish community in Britain to come forward with any concerns that they may have.
Recently in the news over her reported reinstatement to the Labour Party was Vicki Kirby, a former party parliamentary candidate who took heat in 2014 over Tweets in which she reportedly stated that Adolf Hitler might be the "Zionist God” and that Jews had “big noses.” She was suspended at the time. She was reportedly suspended again after it was learned this month that she has since been appointed to a local Labour Party post. 
In another incident of alleged anti-Semitism in the party, Alex Chalmers, co-chair of the Oxford University Labour Party Club resigned after the group decided to support Israel Apartheid Week mid-February. He claimed many club members “have some kind of problem with Jews." The scandal deepened after the Oxford Jewish Society released further allegations of harassment against Jewish students. An inquiry into the Oxford University party branch was launched.
In response to Levy's comments on Sky television, Corbyn, told the station: "Lord Levy clearly hasn’t been listening to the seven times since I became leader I’ve absolutely condemned anti-Semitism. I've condemned Islamophobia. I've condemned any form of racism anywhere within our society. It is absolutely something I totally passionately believe in, and I’m disappointed that Lord Levy has made these remarks. He knows full well what my views are.”

<title>U.K. Labour Party member in hot water after saying Israel's Mossad is behind ISIS</title>
<date>Tue Mar 29 18:05:57 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
In another of a seemingly unending string of controversies over anti-Jewish or anti-Israeli comments by members of Britain's Labour Party, Bob Campbell, a party activist who has reportedly claimed that ISIS is controlled by Israel, denies that he has been the suspended by the party.
The London-based Jewish Chronicle and Sunday Times have reported over the past several days that Campbell was suspended pending a party investigation after allegedly posting a claim on Facebook that the Israel's Mossad intelligence agency runs ISIS. He is also said to have claimed Israel was behind this month's terrorist bombing in Brussels.
But Britain's Independent news website, which added that Campbell alleged on Facebook that ISIS has refrained from attacking Israel "because the dog doesn't bite his own tail," said the Labour Party member denied having been suspended. Media reports have said that such a suspension came at the request of his local member of parliament, Tom Blenkinsop of the Labour Party. Blenkinsop represents the Middlesborough region of northeast England, where Campbell lives.
Recent scandals involving extremism of Labour Party activists include Gerry Downing, who is said to have objected to condemnation of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. He was expelled from the party this month. Vicki Kirby, a former Labour Party parliamentary candidate, took heat in 2014 over tweets in which she reportedly stated that Adolf Hitler might be the "Zionist God” and that Jews had “big noses.” She was suspended from the party twice.

<title>U.K. Labour Party former mayor under fire over Facebook post saying Hitler killed 'six million Zionists' - Jewish World</title>
<date>Sat Apr 02 20:45:46 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
A former U.K. mayor has resigned the Labour Party after it has launched an investigation into anti-Semitic posts on his Facebook page, the Jewish Chronicle reported on Friday, in another in a seemingly unending string of controversies over anti-Jewish or anti-Israeli comments by members of the Labour Party.

In one Facebook post, Khadim Hussain, former Lord Mayor of Bradford, alleged the Israel was secretly arming ISIS. Hussain also allegedly shared a post which attacked Holocaust education in schools and said that Hitler killed "six million Zionists."
                
“Your school education system only tells you about Anne Frank and the six million Zionists that were killed by Hitler,” the post read. 
                
Hussain, who was suspended by the party after complaints were lodged over his Facebook use, said he decided to quit the party due to its handling of the matter, and claimed that he received no answer to his letter rejecting the allegations of anti-Semitism. 
                
“[The] party didn't give me a fair hearing to listen to my side before the suspension. That left me with no choice to sever my links with the party," he told the Chronicle. "I worked hard for interfaith dialogue and community cohesion. I will continue to play my role in that regard,” he added.
                
Earlier this week, Bob Campbell, a Labour Party activist, was reportedly suspended pending a party investigation after allegedly posting a claim on Facebook that the Israel's Mossad intelligence agency runs ISIS. He is also said to have claimed Israel was behind this month's terrorist bombing in Brussels.

<title>University of Chile’s Law Faculty Student Union approves Israel boycott resolution</title>
<date>Mon May 02 19:05:49 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
The University of Chile’s Law Faculty Student Union voted to approve a boycott, divestment and sanctions resolution against Israel.
The resolution approved a week ago prohibits any academic interaction with the State of Israel or its citizens.
The Simon Wiesenthal Center on Friday urged the University’s rector, Ennio Vivaldi Vejar, to nullify the resolution called “closer to the Inquisition than an institution that claims to oppose discrimination and encourage international dialogue.”
“A boycott falsely accusing the State of Israel of Apartheid, in fact, is practicing Apartheid against Israel and its Jewish and non-Jewish supporters,” said Dr. Ariel Gelblung, the Center’s Latin American representative. “Maintaining this resolution would presage a multiplier closing university ties at the whim of individual or group prejudices based upon nationality, race, religion or gender – an unthinkable fate for any campus, but especially for a law faculty.”
The students voted on two questions. When asked if the students agreed to ban “activities that involve the participation of functionaries of the State of Israel or with funding from the Israeli embassy in the law school,” 515 or 56.3 percent voted yes, and 399, or 43.6 percent, voted no.
When asked:  “Do you agree that the University of Chile should not maintain institutional links with Israeli universities that directly contribute to the violation of human rights of the Palestinian people,” some 582 or 64 percent, voted yes, and 327  or 36 percent voted no.
The Palestinian Federation of Chile celebrated the results of the election, calling it a demonstration of the law students against “Israeli Apartheid.”
The Palestinian community in Chile is believed to be the largest outside of the Middle East. At least 300,000 Chileans are of Palestinian descent, according to reports. Some 15,000 Jews live in Chile.
The University of Chile is the largest and one of the most prestigious in the country, according to the 2015 rankings from America Economia magazine and El Mercurio newspaper, and is also is one of the best Chilean universities in global rankings.
“This vote strengthens the academic boycott to keep pushing for our home of studies to be free of Israeli apartheid so that we can breathe clear and democratic air, without segregation, without oppression, without colonization,” said BDS UChile, a broad student coalition for BDS at the University of Chile.
According to the BDS movement, the academic boycott of Israel has been growing in Latin America. Earlier this year, more than 200 Brazilian professors and researchers declared their commitment to BDS. In Argentina, more than 100 professors, hundreds of students and 11 academic institutions have also signed an academic boycott pledge against Israel.

<title>Bruce Springsteen guitarist to BDS supporters: You're obnoxious idiots </title>
<date>Tue May 03 12:05:19 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
JTA – Amid rumors that Bruce Springsteen will perform in Tel Aviv this summer, he and his E Street band have come under fire from supporters of boycotting Israel.
On Monday, band guitarist Steven Van Zandt – who is also known for playing a mobster on HBO’s “The Sopranos” – responded in typically direct style. In a series of tweets, he called Israel boycotters “politically ignorant obnoxious idiots” and suggested to one: “go f*** yourself.”
Van Zandt has taken tweet heat before for the unconfirmed show. And he’s not alone among his bandmates.
Bassist Garry Tallent has been heckled by the Twittersphere. And self-described anti-Zionist Stanley Cohen, who has more than 20,000 Twitter followers, went after the Boss himself back in February.
The latest BDS brouhaha emerged unexpectedly from a seemingly unrelated Twitter conversation. On Sunday, a fan bemoaned to Van Zandt Springsteen’s cancellation of a show in North Carolina last month in opposition to the state’s recently enacted “bathroom law” – which targets transgender people by requiring bathroom use according to the gender on a person’s birth certificate.
Another Twitter user then accused Van Zandt of touring other countries “which do much worse.”
Van Zandt responded that he held the U.S. to a higher standard.
In response to a skeptic who said “not buying that one,” the rocker got testy.
When someone suggested he “quit justifying 
hypocrisy,” Van Zandt got downright mad.
After some debate about what makes America so great, and whether it’s OK to call it America, the argument came around to the boycott issue. A user asked why, if Van Zandt gave other countries a pass, had he gotten involved in the movement against South African apartheid with the 1985 protest song “Sun City.” Van Zadnt said that was about the U.S. too.
Then, a certain Patrick – whose Twitter bio reads: “I have one issue human rights for Palestine people” – brought Israel into it.
This earned a double-tweet smackdown from Van Zandt.
Told “Israel totally meets apartheid definition under under itl law,” Van Zandt averred it was complicated.
Then he said it twice more.
Replying to Van Zandt’s assertion that boycotting Israel “would accomplish nothing,” someone tweeted, “But a boycott in north Carolina will ?” Van Zandt had a simple answer for that one.

<title>How the on-campus brawl is turning young Jews off Israel</title>
<date>Mon May 09 12:00:39 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
It was curiosity, rather than strong political tendencies either way, that drew Stanford freshman Madeleine Chang to her first student government debate on sanctions against Israel. That experience served as her introduction to the nasty world of identity politics on campus – and left her pretty devastated.
“Literally, all my Jewish friends were sitting on one side of the room and all my other friends – most of whom look more like me – were on the other,” she recalls, describing the scene she encountered last year upon entering the rowdy auditorium hall. “On each side people were waving and begging me to join them, and I felt totally paralyzed.”
Rather than pick a side, Chang, whose mother is Jewish and father Korean, decided to sit in the back and simply observe. At issue was whether the California university should divest from companies active in Israel (the motion was ultimately passed by the student government, but soon thereafter vetoed by the administration). “What ensued was an awful shouting match,” she says, “and I was pretty shaken up by the lack of discourse.”
The vast majority of Jewish students on campus are not nearly as adventurous as Chang. Rather than set themselves up for what are inevitably unpleasant confrontations over Israeli policy and actions, many are simply checking out.
As University of California, Berkeley junior Dylan Noceda observes, the rhetoric has become so vile and the stakes so high that for students like him, the best course of action has been to take no action at all. “You could risk losing friends from the other side,” explains the easy-going English major. “So when I’m asked, I just say that I love all people.”
Noceda considers himself part of a growing “silent majority” of Jewish students with no strong sentiments one way or the other about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – and they prefer to keep it that way. An Orange County native, he grew up, like many Jewish college students on the West Coast, in a rather unaffiliated home. Although both his parents are Jewish, Noceda’s Cuban-born father was raised Catholic. 
But that is hardly an excuse for UC Davis junior Zoe Robinow: Her mother is Israeli and her boyfriend is a well-known Zionist activist on campus. Yet Robinow, who grew up in Hawaii and belongs to a Jewish sorority on campus, has also resisted pressure to enlist with the Israeli cheerleading forces on her campus.
“Whenever BDS comes up, it’s like, Why is this even an issue for discussion when most people have no idea what it’s about?” asks the neurobiology major, who describes herself as a “mixed feelings kind of person.”
Even here in California, the epicenter of the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, many Jewish students say they have yet to form an opinion on whether they endorse a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that involves one state, two states or no state at all.
Some simply don’t care enough to risk antagonizing friends or jeopardizing their studies. Others would rather attend fraternity parties and football games than participate in shouting matches over land disputes taking place halfway around the globe. Still others say they fear being targeted for being Jewish.
While most students differentiate between criticism of Israel and outright anti-Semitism, many say they feel uncomfortable as Jews when anti-Israel events are held on their campuses.
On a two-week tour of California college campuses spanning from late February through early March, Haaretz sought to look beyond the hysteria surrounding BDS and – through dozens of interviews with Jewish students, staff, faculty and community members, along with on-the-ground observations – determine how Jewish students are really faring on campus.
Although the stated goals of the BDS movement are to force political concessions on Israel through economic and cultural sanctions, many Jewish leaders and professionals in California tell Haaretz they believe the ultimate objective, at least on campuses, is to make Israel a toxic issue.  
“Divestment is not meant to inflict pain on Israel,” says Rabbi Doug Kahn, the executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater San Francisco. “Rather, its goal is to shape the narrative and influence future leaders as they think about the conflict today.”
Judging by that measure, says Stanford University political science professor Larry Diamond, the BDS movement has already scored significant points. “We can’t ignore it because it’s making Jewish students feel marginalized and silenced,” says Diamond, who also sits on the board of the campus Hillel. “They feel torn and besieged, and that’s neither fair nor civil.”
Disengaging from Israel
Based on estimates provided by Jewish professionals and faculty in California, anywhere between 75 to 95 percent of Jewish students on college campuses in the state belong to the “soft middle” – that is to say, they are not engaged in Jewish campus life and want no part in the debate over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And as that debate gets louder and nastier, their ranks are growing.
“Most of the students here are either ignorant or unsure and prefer to steer clear of the issue because it’s so contentious,” says David Biale, a distinguished professor of Jewish history at UC Davis. “I think most of them are being pushed away. A small minority have staked out positions. But for the vast majority, what’s happening in the Middle East is a problem without a solution, and they ask themselves why they should get involved if there are other issues they can devote themselves to.”
Gil Bar-Or, copresident of the J Street U chapter at UCLA, has witnessed this trend firsthand among his own friends and classmates. “The average Jewish kids don’t want to be associated with the debate because it’s so vicious,” says Bar-Or, the child of Israelis who volunteers that his own grandparents, still living in Israel, are very critical of their government. “There is a huge group of Jewish students here who are not involved and don’t want to be involved.”
Or as Jennifer Fineman, a second-year, pre-law student at UC Santa Cruz, puts it: “My top priority here is keeping up my GPA and doing well on my LSATs. I don’t necessarily believe I have to talk the talk and fight the fight. We don’t live in Israel, so what good does it do for us to argue about all this here?”
While California may not be representative of the entire United States, Jay Sanderson – president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles – urges American Jewish leaders to take note of developments in his home state. 
“I think the West Coast is unique in that the bigger challenges are bigger here,” he says. “Intermarriages are higher west of the Mississippi than east of the Mississippi, and so the issue of lack of affiliation and lack of connection to Israel is probably a little higher here than it is over there.”
But, as Sanderson notes, California could serve as a barometer of where things are heading. “It used to be that trends started in the East and then went west,” he says, “but today they start in the West and then go east.”
A key finding of Haaretz’s visit was that only a small fraction of Jewish and non-Jewish students – including on those campuses known for being more politically active – are actively engaged in the Israel debate. On campuses where Students for Justice in Palestine (the driving force behind the BDS movement) has a presence, there are often no more than a dozen students active in the chapter, with Jews disproportionately represented among them.
The same is true of Jewish Voice for Peace, an organization highly critical of Israel, which likes to boast that it is the fastest growing Jewish student group on college campuses. Even its most active California chapters have less than a handful of members. (At Berkeley, the JVP chapter was defunct for several years before being revived last fall.)
Ditto for the other side: Although almost all campuses have their own pro-Israel group named after the university mascot (a la “Bruins for Israel” at UCLA and “Bears for Israel” at Berkeley) and host chapters of national Jewish organizations, the number of core activists is never more than one or two dozen. And while most universities have a Hillel chapter on site, the number of students actively involved in the Jewish campus life organization is relatively small.
At campuses like UCLA and Berkeley, where the Jewish student population is estimated to be several thousand, a Hillel event is considered successful if it draws 100 students.
What’s changed?
There is no denying, however, that something palpable has changed on many California campuses in recent years. Its most visible signs are the numerous student government divestment votes against Israel in recent years and the regular disruption of Israel-themed events on campus – most recently April’s pro-Palestinian shout down of Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat at San Francisco State University.
Todd Presner, director of the UCLA Center for Jewish Studies, believes a key catalyst has been Israel’s recent wars in Gaza.
“When things happen over there, they come to roost locally,” says Presner, who has been teaching at UCLA for 14 years.
For students who lack perspective beyond the four years they typically spend on a given college campus, it’s often difficult to pinpoint what exactly has changed and why. Jonathan York, who started as an undergrad at Stanford and is now attending law school on the same campus, has a longer-range view than most.
“It seems to me that what’s changed is that it’s more OK these days to cover your ears and just yell,” he says. “It also seems that people are more comfortable surrounding themselves with people who agree with them on all things. I think that’s a shame.”
It’s not that the yelling has gotten louder, some would argue, but that those doing the yelling have changed. If Jewish groups were once able to form natural coalitions with other minority organizations, that’s no longer the case, they point out. And today, these former allies, together with their new Palestinian partners, are ganging up on the Israel-supporting Jews.
Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller, who served as director of UCLA Hillel for 40 years, dismisses this claim, noting that the old coalitions dissolved years ago unrelated to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “In the process of becoming Americanized, Jews have become whites, and they’ve lost their sense of seeing themselves as a minority,” he says.
What’s changed, in his view, are the tactics employed by the pro-Palestinian side.
“We’re seeing something we never saw before, and that something is anti-normalization – not talking to the pro-Israel side,” says Seidler-Feller. “That form of delegitimization didn’t exist before, and it’s turned this into a dirty war.”
For pro-Palestinian advocates on campus, he notes, this has come to mean that “we can say what we want because you oppressed us, and we earned that right, while you can’t say anything. And whatever you say about our suffering is not welcome, not legitimate and not sincere.”
Seidler-Feller believes another factor that has changed the dynamics of the campus debate, is the growing influence of external Jewish organizations.
“Some of them are run by well-meaning Jews for whom the historical sense of being pursued by others is the driving factor in their Jewish life – and that’s the lens through which they view the contemporary campus reality,” he says. “It’s much easier for them to promote a negative agenda than a positive agenda, and it protects them from taking a deeper inward look that would require assessing our own responsibilities for this situation and to what extent Israel has contributed to this dire situation on the campuses.”
Seidler-Feller’s own community of Los Angeles serves as headquarters to the most prominent of these organizations, StandWithUs. It is also the home of Israeli-American real estate investor Adam Milstein, who has poured a considerable amount of money into fighting BDS on college campuses, most recently through the Campus Maccabees program he founded together with casino mogul and Republican Party mega-donor Sheldon Adelson. It’s an ambitious initiative designed at convincing the world that BDS is not only bent on eradicating the Jewish state but also all of Western civilization.
The problem, according to UC Santa Cruz physics professor Michael Dine, is that the individuals running many of these organizations and initiatives are not necessarily in tune with the political sentiments of most of the students.
“They tend to be made up of people closely identified with one political party,” he says, referring to the Republicans, “trying to influence a population that is 70 percent Democrat.”
That may explain why their strategies sometimes backfire, UC Davis student Yonatan Zelnik being a case in point. “For me, it was really frustrating seeing how groups like StandWithUs were trying to make political capital out of what was happening on campus,” says the Israeli-born computer science major.
The turning point for him was a StandWithUs Facebook post that tried to link a divestment vote on campus to a swastika inscribed on the Jewish frat house where he lives. 
“There was no evidence whatsoever of any correlation,” he says, “and I found that post so misleading that it pushed me completely in the opposite direction.” Today, Zelnik has become active in the UC Davis chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace and describes himself as leaning toward being “pro-BDS.”
Over at UC Santa Cruz, senior Josh Frank had been recruited to organize an on-campus event for StandWithUs last year. A group of former Israeli soldiers were touring the United States at the time, and Frank was in charge of finding them a venue to meet with students and advertising the program. As often happens at such events, pro-Palestinian students planted themselves in the audience and disrupted the speakers, not allowing them to get a word in. Frank was devastated.
“After that experience I mentally checked out,” he says. “I later began asking myself, what was the point of it all?”
Even when things seem to be going well, the constant fighting and strategizing can be draining, acknowledges Yael Globerman, a senior communications major at UCLA and president of the local Hillel chapter.
“The first divestment vote we had here, we managed to defeat” she recalls, “and that was after 12 hours of having people yell at each other across the room. I remember walking out of there and feeling absolutely shattered, even though we had won.”
UC Santa Cruz’s Dine believes the goal of BDS is to distance Jewish students from Israel, and laments that the big Jewish organizations, despite their best intentions, are sometimes inadvertently lending a helping hand.
“I’m concerned about alienating kids with legitimate questions,” he says, referring to those Jewish students expressing reservations about Israeli policy and actions, “and in some parts of the community we are already at that stage.
“There’s been a deliberate effort to slander J Street, for example,” adds Dine, who serves as a board member of the Hillel chapter on his campus, “and it’s a little scary because that is the only organization that provides a voice to those students who love Israel but not the occupation.”
Damned if they do, damned if they don’t
Though the vast majority of students shrug off the tensions, those interested in exploring their views on Israel find themselves wedged uncomfortably in the middle. On their right, hard core Zionist activists wince when they use terms like “occupation” and “settlements” to expresses their reservations about Israeli policy. On their left, minority students and others that identify as oppressed groups on campus criticize them for opposing BDS, or at least not supporting it wholeheartedly.
It is typically members of J Street U – a left-wing Zionist organization with chapters on several key California college campuses – who say they find themselves in this impossible situation.
That would include students like Stanford’s Chang, who joined the organization soon after the ugly divestment debate she witnessed on campus last year. ”What piqued my interest was the basic refusal of Jewish students to engage with issues like occupation, and instead to call anyone critical of Israel an anti-Semite,” she said. “Fortunately, I’ve discovered a growing group of people like me willing to venture into this gray area.”
For Zoe Goldblum, another Stanford sophomore, it was actually the intransigence she discovered on the pro-Palestinian side that drew her to the more nuanced message of J Street U.
During her first year on campus, Goldblum recounts, she was active in the Black Lives Matter movement as well as other social justice causes. “But when the divestment issue came up,” she recalls, “I felt the message being put out was that if you’re pro-Israel, you’re automatically anti-social justice and believe that Palestinians should suffer, and that if I didn’t agree 100 percent with the furthest leftist interpretations of the Palestinian narrative, I wasn’t welcome into any social justice organizations.”
Over at UCLA, Bar-Or, who describes himself as a progressive Zionist, also feels torn. “I wanted to be involved with other minority groups, but it’s become an issue,” he says. “In a way, you have to choose between being pro-Israel or pro-anything else.”
Stanford freshman Matthew Wigler concurs. “I was very disappointed to discover when I came here that intersectionality doesn’t apply to Jews,” he says, citing the term popularized on college campuses to describe the bonds that exist among those identifying as oppressed groups and which pro-Palestinian groups have used to their advantage in forging alliances with other minority organizations. “Standing against hatred has come to mean standing against Israel,” Wigler adds.
Particularly painful to Zach Brenner, a J Street U activist at UC Santa Cruz, is the ignorance that drives many of his fellow student activists on both sides of the battlefield. It is rare, he sighs, to find people with a "nuanced understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
USC, Berkeley and all that’s in between
It’s hard to generalize about Jewish student life in California, because no two campuses are alike.
On one side of the spectrum is the University of Southern California (USC), in Los Angeles, a private and largely apolitical institution where the biggest threat most Jewish students face on a given day, as one campus professional notes, is being hit by an errant skateboard. And at the Jesuit-run University of San Francisco, where Hillel has only recently set up base, several Jewish students acknowledged that they had never heard the term BDS before being interviewed for this report and had never witnessed anti-Israel protests on their campus. 
“As much as I’d like to advocate for Israel here on campus, there’s really no need,” says Rya Fishman, a USF junior majoring in psychology.
UC Berkeley is clearly on the other side of the spectrum. It was there that Students for Justice in Palestine set up its first branch in 1993, and it was there that the first in the latest round of student-backed divestment motions against Israel was passed, in 2013. (Despite the relatively large number of divestment motions that have received student support on campuses around the country since then – a disproportionately large share of them in California – not one has been ratified by university administrators or boards of trustees.)
BDS has also gained a big following at UC Santa Cruz, a campus situated in the midst of a lush forest overlooking Monterey Bay, and known to attract students with a penchant for radical politics and marijuana. Unlike Berkeley, however, Santa Cruz has fewer pro-Israel organizations and fewer Jewish students’ groups active on campus.
That could explain why students there were more likely to tell Haaretz they perceived attacks on Israel as anti-Semitic and directed at them personally, and also why they were more likely to conceal outward signs of their Jewishness. So could the fact that a divestment motion had passed on their campus just a few months earlier, and they were still digesting it.  
“You can’t be visibly pro-Israel on this campus without getting dirty looks,” declares Spencer Johnswick, a senior ecology major who sports a Star of David tattoo on the back of his neck but prefers to keep the Chai (Hebrew word for “life”) pendant on his necklace tucked inside his shirt. As a high school student in the Bay Area, he recounts, he was active in various social justice organizations. But although he considers himself both “pro-Israel and pro-Palestine,” that became impossible at university.
“I wanted to get involved in those sort of spaces here too. But as soon as I told people I had been on Birthright, it really turned them off,” he notes, referring to the organized educational trip to Israel for Diaspora Jews. “It was like, ‘How could you step on that soil?’ and it really drove a wedge between us.”
Adam Lieber, a senior studying business management, agrees. “There’s pressure here not to act Jewish,” he says. As an example, he reports that a member of his Jewish fraternity, one of the few students on campus to regularly wear a yarmulke, recently removed it from his head. “He didn’t feel comfortable walking around with it any more.”
Small anti-Israel or anti-Jewish incidents on campus do tend to get blown out of proportion because of social media, acknowledges UC Santa Cruz sophomore Talia Gnessin, whose parents are Israeli.
Still, she says, as a matter of principle she avoids wearing T-shirts with Hebrew writing on them. “Not because of anything specific that happened to me or any of my friends,” she explains, “but because I know the conflict does exist and is part of who I am, and I don’t want to have to discuss it with passersby who might take offense.”
Unsafe or just uncomfortable?
In March, the University of California became the first public university in the United States to issue a statement condemning anti-Semitism on its campuses, though it stopped short of a blanket denunciation of anti-Zionism. Recognizing that some, but not all, forms of anti-Zionism are anti-Semitic in nature, the statement referred specifically to “anti-Semitic forms of anti-Zionism” as having “no place” on its campuses.
The driving force behind this landmark declaration was a small but very vocal organization operating out of UC Santa Cruz known as the AMCHA Initiative, whose declared mission is combating anti-Semitism on U.S. college campuses. In its latest annual report, published in March, AMCHA found “objective confirmation of student reports of widespread anti-Semitic expression, BDS activity, and behavior which targets Jewish students for harm,” and said those factors had created what was perceived as a “hostile environment for Jewish students.”
The AMCHA report put several of the University of California campuses at the top of its list of universities with the highest number of incidents of students being targeted for being pro-Israel. The organization and many of its partners in the pro-Israel advocacy world have come under attack, however, from groups more to the left for conflating anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism.
Among some of the more vocal opponents of the declaration was Diane Wolf, director of the Jewish Studies program at UC Davis, who says she fears it will be used to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel on campuses. 
“Why is this story of widespread anti-Semitism on the campuses being pushed and perpetuated?” she asks. “I believe it’s an attempt to quash any discussion of BDS. Personally, I am very much against boycotting Israeli academics, but I feel students should be discussing these issues."
Seidler-Feller, the former UCLA Hillel director, doesn’t deny that incidents of anti-Semitism occur on California college campuses, or that the BDS movement is fueled in part by anti-Semitism.
“But you want to know what the right policy for anti-Semitic inscriptions on the wall is?” he asks. “You get the cleaning crew to clean it off. We’ve always had incidents like that, but you have to be able to distinguish between hooliganism and anti-Semitism. And what passes for anti-Semitism these days? Students feeling uncomfortable. You know what? Maybe one of the reasons you go to university is to feel uncomfortable.”
Most Jewish students on California campuses are able to identify moments when they feel uncomfortable and even threatened because of the natural tendency to associate them with Israel. That would be on days when divestment votes are being held or during Israeli Apartheid Week – an anti-Israel event typically held in March. It could also be on days when they are forced to walk through fake “Israeli checkpoints” set up by pro-Palestinian activists as part of their efforts to give other students a taste of life for Palestinians under occupation. 
But based on conversations with dozens of Jewish students on eight California campuses, very few, if any, believe anti-Semitism is prevalent at their universities.
This sentiment is borne out by a recent University of California Campus Climate Study, which found that 84 percent of Jewish students and faculty in the state university system feel comfortable on campus – a higher rate than among both Muslims and Christians.
Only at one college did a Jewish student agree that it would be correct to describe the atmosphere on his campus as anti-Semitic.
That student was Daniel Bernstein, vice president of the UC Santa Cruz Jewish Student Union, and a member of the student governing body. Before the Santa Cruz student government approved a motion last November to divest from companies doing business with Israel, he reported being asked to sit out the vote because of his “Jewish agenda.”
Then there are students like Jacob Kaplan-Lipkin, who says he often feels uncomfortable on campus not because he's Jewish but because of his visible affiliation with what is widely perceived to be the wrong side of the conflict. A freshman from nearby Palo Alto, Kaplan-Lipkin is one of a handful of students at this elite private institution who sports a yarmulke. On this particular day he is also wearing a T-shirt with "Stanford" written on it in Hebrew lettering.
“Although this a safe place for Jewish students," he says, "I definitely feel uncomfortable here being a Zionist and pro-Israel.” Kaplan-Lipkin made this comment before the recent controversy that erupted when a Stanford student government leader declared that it was not anti-Semitic to say Jews control the media and the economy.
The kids are alright
Probably more than any other California college campus, UC Irvine has seen its reputation tarnished by allegations of anti-Semitism. In 2010, an ugly confrontation erupted there when pro-Palestinian demonstrators tried to prevent Michael Oren – at the time Israel’s ambassador to the United States – from addressing a campus audience.
The event, in which 11 activists were arrested, sent shock waves through the Jewish community. Right-wing Jewish organizations immediately responded by urging Jewish parents to keep their children away from Irvine, and their calls were heeded.
Following several years of plummeting enrollment within this demographic, however, Jewish students are heading back to the southern California campus. More importantly, they say they feel fine here.
“There is no problem of anti-Semitism on this campus,” declares Lauren Kerner, an honor’s history student active in the UC Irvine Hillel. “I wear my hamsa [a Jewish charm necklace] everyday, I feel comfortable wearing my IDF T-shirt to gym and class, and I have no problem being vocal in my support for Israel – even in classes where I know my teachers support BDS.”
Several of her fellow pro-Israel activist friends sitting around the table at a campus café during a lunchtime break echo these sentiments.
UCLA had its own big moment last year when Rachel Beyda, a sophomore active in Jewish campus life, was asked during confirmation hearings for a student government post whether her religious affiliation might affect her ability to vote objectively.
Refuting those who rely on this case to claim that anti-Semitism is rampant on U.S. college campuses, Presner – the director of the UCLA Jewish Studies department – asks: “Is this representative of something pervasive and fundamental, or is it more about a naive student asking a stupid question? I think the latter.”
Wolf, the UC Davis professor, concurs. “I get emails from Jewish mothers asking me if it’s safe to send their child here, and my response is that it is perfectly safe,” she says. “There has never been any physical threat on campus. In fact, I would be much more concerned about sending a daughter to college in this day and age.”
Even at Berkeley, many Jewish students shrug off concerns.
“My parents’ friends always ask why would a nice Jewish girl like me go to Berkeley,” says Becca Berman, a junior history major, “but it’s the best thing I’ve ever done. It helped me realize how important my Jewish identity was to me.”
With 14 different Jewish student groups active on campus, including political, social, professional interest and Greek organizations, she notes, “Jewish life here is extremely robust.”
Sonia Brin, a junior majoring in public health at UC Berkeley, agrees that the Jewish community’s hand-wringing is largely unwarranted. In her opinion, social media is to blame for perceptions about her school, which she believes have been blown completely out of proportion. 
“I think it’s funny when I see friends suddenly sharing an article on Facebook about some incident that happened at Berkeley,” says the J Street U activist. “I then have to explain to them that it wasn’t a big deal.”
In fact, most Jewish students questioned by Haaretz say the Middle East conflict is hardly an issue for them – and neither is their religious identity. Based on conversations and observations during Haaretz’s mid-semester visit, students were far more concerned with midterms and upcoming spring break trips than with attempts to delegitimize Israel on their campuses or with anti-Semitism.
On an unusually warm late February afternoon, Hillel student leaders at UCLA were hanging out at a café trying to figure out exactly what Reconstructionist Jews do and don’t believe. It was part of preparations for an upcoming event devoted to the various religious streams in Judaism. Not a word about Israel.
Just outside, the Israel advocacy group StandWithUS had just brought in a group of former IDF combat soldiers for a special tabling event. An Israeli television channel making a documentary about the BDS movement on U.S. college campuses had been tipped off that this could mean trouble.
But alas, no angry pro-Palestinian types showed up to provoke the Israelis. That evening, a lecture on the history of Zionism was delivered at the campus Hillel by a popular local rabbi. The Jewish Agency envoy at UCLA had reached out to the two sole members of Jewish Voice for Peace on campus – not usually welcomed at such events – and invited them to attend. They did – and the discussion, as later reported, was extremely civil.
At Berkeley, the scene is not much different from UCLA. Smack in the center of campus, a right-leaning, pro-Israel group called Tikvah (“Hope” in Hebrew) is set up at a table with a large sign advertising its Zionist affiliation. Two Jewish students sitting behind piles of flyers and Israeli flags scan their laptops for lack of much else to do.
The blatant symbols of the Jewish state hardly draw any attention from the throngs of students passing by on their way to class or lunch. And not because of any competition from pro-Palestinian activists, who on this particular afternoon are even less visible.
"The media discourse around BDS is 100 times greater than the reality of what’s happening on campus," sums up UCLA's Presner. “The vast majority of Jewish students are untouched and uninvolved. So when I hear reports that Jewish students are feeling unsafe, I just shake my head in disbelief.”

<title>Anti-Semitism charges cast ugly shadow on bucolic Oxford</title>
<date>Wed May 18 09:49:38 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
JTA — For a city that has made headlines recently for its anti-Semitism problem, Oxford has a pretty laid back Jewish scene.
On a recent Friday night, dozens of Jewish families and students wearing kippot were enjoying the afternoon sun as they strolled to one of Oxford’s two synagogues.
They converged at a modern building that houses a Jewish community center, complete with a kosher kitchen and a shul with a tall, sloped ceiling of white plaster that evokes the feeling of standing between the pages of a giant book. The same building has separate halls for Progressive congregants (Conservative and Reform) and Orthodox prayer, where services are held simultaneously.
Across Britain and Western Europe, worshippers more commonly cover their kippot with a hat on the way to synagogue, where they are inspected or questioned – and sometimes even frisked – at the entrance by police or military. And while the Oxford Jewish Centre has some security, visitors can often walk in no questions asked.
It’s part of living in a city with hardly any violent anti-Semitic incidents, says Jake Berger, a third-year psychology student from Manchester.
“I definitely feel safer walking around with a kippa here compared to Manchester,” Berger said.
Yet despite the rarity of physical attacks on Jews, anti-Semitic rhetoric and hate speech against Israel in Oxford has invited scrutiny and cast an ugly shadow on this bastion of the British left. A picturesque university town of 160,000 residents 60 miles northwest of London, Oxford is internationally famous for its scholastic excellence and for churning out leaders in a variety of fields. The University of Oxford was ranked as the world’s fifth best in the Center for World University Rankings this year.
Students fill the many affordable pubs here until deep into the night. On weekends, lovers and hikers walk or sail along the Oxford Canal, which intersects the city’s center and stretches for 80 miles.
Especially for Jews who are openly supportive of Israel, Oxford is “an Eden with a dark underbelly,” according to Richard Black, a fourth-year history student and former member of the local JSoc, the Oxford University Jewish Society. As a pro-Israel activist, he has been called “baby killer” several times in Oxford.
He says he overheard a classmate explaining that Jews exploit the memory of the Holocaust while committing their very own Holocaust against Palestinians, adding that Jews control American finance and media. After an argument on Israel, Black recalls, a member of the academic faculty told him that the Hebrew Bible was “genocidal” and that Black provided “the best advertisement for anti-Semitism.”
Black also recalls that at one event in 2011, a pro-Palestinian activist told him that “Adolf Hitler was a good man.” She was holding a banner supporting Palestinians and speaking with Black calmly about the factors that led to Israel’s existence, including the Holocaust.
“I was shocked back then, but I have grown accustomed,” Black said.
Like many Jewish students at Oxford, Black cites the increasingly popular pejorative of “Zio” as proof of widespread but covert anti-Semitism. Short for Zionist, “it’s shorthand, used by people who hate Jews as cover for what they’re really saying: ‘Dirty Jew,’” Black said. “The true meaning lies in context: Zio media, Zio lobby – You overhear this sort of thing here.”
Last year, African rights activist Zuleyka Shahin, during a failed campaign for president of the Oxford Union, wrote on Facebook that “Judeo-Christian white men” and “Zio white men” are “complicit in the funding of wars and the social genocide of my people.”
In February, a non-Jewish Oxford student had enough of anti-Semitic chatter. Alex Chalmers, a co-chair of the university’s Labour chapter, resigned his post over the chapter’s passing of a motion endorsing Israel Apartheid Week, explaining that he no longer wanted to be associated with a framework that has “some kind of problem with Jews.”
The word “Zio,” he wrote in an op-ed explaining his move, “was part of the [Labour] club’s lexicon.” The song “Rockets over Tel Aviv” was a favorite among a certain faction of the club. Concerns of Jewish students “were ridiculed,” Chalmers added.
His resignation triggered an internal probe by Oxford’s Labour chapter which found that the Oxford University Labour Club is not institutionally anti-Semitic, but faces “difficulties” that must be addressed, the Jewish Chronicle reported Tuesday.
More significantly, it also started a chain reaction, exposing the left-wing party to intense media scrutiny in Britain that generated one of its worst public relations fiascoes in years. Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn – himself branded untrustworthy by Jewish community leaders over his support for the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah – was forced to suspend at least 20 of the party’s members for making hateful remarks or statements on Jews and Israel.
Among those suspended this month were former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, who said Hitler supported Zionism in defending a Labour lawmaker who had been suspended earlier for making a similar statement.
Earlier this month Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, told The Times of London that Jewish students at British universities, including Oxford, face a “wall of anti-Zionism, which they feel and know to be Jew hatred.” He is scheduled to speak later this month at the Oxford Union.
For some Jewish students and faculty, the storm is “just brouhaha,” said Jonathan, a former computer science student who graduated in 2013.  He returns to Oxford regularly for JSoc activities and to attend lectures.
Jonathan, an observant Jew who did not want his last name mentioned, said: “The ones who experience anti-Semitism are the hacks,” meaning people active in student or university politics.
Most Jews in Oxford “enjoy a very good situation of safety and a robust Jewish community with excellent facilities that are actually far better than what one finds in many other British universities,” said Berger, the psychology student from Manchester. Even Black – a supporter of the Conservative Party – said that “for every negative experience” with non-Jews in Oxford, he has had “a hundred positive ones.”
While the recent scandal exposed widespread hate speech at Oxford, it also reinforced growing rejection of anti-Semitism “by the vast majority in Oxford” who understand “how criticism of Israel spills into anti-Semitism,” Black said.
Last month, four of Oxford’s six delegates to Britain’s National Student Union said their university should disaffiliate from the union following the election of Malia Bouatia as its president. Bouatia, a student at the University of Birmingham, is accused of justifying violence against Israelis and opposing a motion to condemn the Islamic State terror group lest it stigmatize Muslims. She also blamed the “Zionist-led media” for oppression in the global south.
Two British universities, Lincoln and Newcastle, this month disaffiliated with the union, citing lack of confidence in its leadership. Oxford is set to hold a disaffiliation referendum in the coming weeks.   
As for Israelis living in Oxford — there are hundreds of them, mostly students and researchers — they say they suffer no discrimination or abuse for their country of origin.
“It’s a very international place, many languages spoken, very tolerant,” said Lior Weizman, 36, a father of four who moved to Oxford last year to work as a post-doctoral fellow at Oxford specializing in medical imaging of the brain.
“I’m not a political person,” he said. “But if there are situations of people being singled out in Oxford because of their country of origin, I haven’t encountered them.”

<title>Don't believe the hype: The Israel boycott movement is a marginal phenomenon</title>
<date>Thu Jul 14 18:47:35 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
JTA — Ever since the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel began picking up steam three years ago, its proponents have brazenly declared the movement’s inevitable triumph. In April, for example, a pro-divestment group at the University of Chicago issued a statement proclaiming that by the school’s student government passing a BDS resolution, the university “finally put (itself) on the right side of history.”
BDS proponents interpreted the momentum in progressive circles, such as student government and academic bodies, as a sure sign from the political gods that BDS will gain acceptance in wider and wider swaths of American society. Eventually, they assert, Americans will realize that their supposed ally Israel is an apartheid state and will cease their support.
I must admit to the occasional bout of exasperated resignation. There’s no denying that increasing numbers of progressives were embracing the BDS cause. A number of student governments that had initially rejected BDS had later endorsed it. Momentum had turned in the movement’s favor.
Could there be, as the BDS proponents alleged, an unfolding historical dialectic at work here — one as unmistakably foreseeable as the eventual triumph over apartheid South Africa — that would culminate in Israel’s ultimate delegitimization in American society? Is it just a matter of time?
Not so fast. In the past several months, the tables have turned. Anti-BDS bills have passed in state legislatures by huge margins and BDS resolutions have gone down in defeat at several progressive institutions.
At last count, 19 states have passed anti-BDS bills in this past legislative session alone. Some of the legislation merely condemns BDS and encourages a negotiated solution. And some measures place companies that accede to a BDS campaign on a state no-buy list, forcing them to think long and hard before pulling out of Israel. In the Illinois House of Representatives, the anti-BDS bill passed by a vote of 102-2, and in the Florida Senate it was 38-0 with 2 abstentions. In every state legislative body that had a roll call taken, the anti-BDS bill passed by decisive if not overwhelming margins.
The state-level anti-BDS onslaught demonstrates that BDS is a marginal phenomena, confined to the extreme left. BDS proponents have picked their battlefields carefully, looking for places where they have a shot at winning. But once the battlefield is widened to state legislatures representing mainstream sensibilities, BDS not only fails to persuade, it is utterly repudiated.
Even in progressive circles, where BDS had been gaining ground, it has suffered a series of significant setbacks. At the Presbyterian Church (USA) General Assembly in Portland, Oregon, in June, a slanted report on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict prepared before the conference was accompanied by a series of more balanced amendments passed during the conference.
“The PCUSA pretty much endorsed Zionism,” said Ethan Felson, executive director of the Israel Action Network, a joint project of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs and the Jewish Federations of North America.
At the United Methodist’s General Conference in May, the church body rejected four divestment resolutions. In June, members of the American Anthropological Association narrowly defeated a resolution calling on the association to refrain from formal collaborations with Israeli academic institutions.
These wins show that when the Jewish community effectively organizes, builds strong ties before the vote with key people in the institutions targeted by BDS campaigns, and appeals to the sensibilities of people sitting on the fence of the BDS debate, it can prevail over Israel’s detractors. Strategic advocacy and relationship building actually work. These victories turn the BDS “right side of history” narrative on its head, for if BDS can’t win over the anthropological association, who can it convince?
This is not to say that maintaining long-term American support for Israel is any more pre-ordained than America’s ultimate embrace of BDS. Halting the BDS train is not inevitable and will not happen on its own. But the victories of the past several months should give us tremendous confidence in our ability to maintain and grow support for Israel. We, too, can be on the right side of history.
David Bernstein is the president and CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs.

<title>U.S. Green Party presidential candidate would cut military aid to Israel</title>
<date>Mon Aug 08 17:38:15 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
United States presidential candidate Jill Stein says she would put an end to American military aid to Israel if elected president.
Stein, a Jewish physician and environmental activist from Chicago, was nominated last week to lead the American Green Party in the 2016 presidential election.
As Green Party candidate in the 2012 election, Stein received just under half-a-million votes, some 0.36 percent of the ballots cast. She was an unsuccessful candidate for governor of Massachusetts in 2002 and 2010.
Continuing U.S. military aid to Israel would be "decisively against our common values, to support apartheid, to support home demolitions, to support occupation, to support violations of international law," Stein said in an interview with Newsweek, published on Friday.
Stein added that her relationship with Israel would be "ethical."
"As an American Jew, I have a relationship with Israel, she said. "Unfortunately, Sheldon Adelson contributes a huge amount of money to [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu. Why should the Sheldon Adelsons of America be messing with the politics of Israel?"
"If I was living in Israel, and I knew that one of the major funders of a very oppressive right-wing government was coming from outside of my country, I would be up in arms about it."
Stein explained that her ethical foreign policy would apply to all countries and not just Israel. "I would bring ethical foreign policy to all countries," she said.
"We should not be selling weapons or funding armies of countries who are violating our basic values of human dignity and human rights. I would go to Israel—and to Saudi Arabia—with all humility, because nobody has been a bigger violator of these rights and values than our own country."

<title>Peace activist Stanley Sheinbaum dies at 96 in Los Angeles</title>
<date>Tue Sep 13 08:43:44 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Stanley K. Sheinbaum, a former economics professor whose drive for Mideast peace had him mingling with presidents, royalty and movie stars, has died. He was 96.
Sheinbaum died of heart disease on Monday at his home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, said his assistant, Marti Maniates.
Sheinbaum gave up teaching to devote himself to what he called his quest to "create a little peace and justice in this unjust world."
He raised funds to defend Daniel Ellsberg during the military analyst's trial for releasing the Pentagon Papers, a secret study of the Vietnam War.
Never one to shrink from controversy, Sheinbaum met with late Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in an unofficial diplomatic mission to bring peace to the Middle East. The meeting propelled him into headlines and sparked protests from Israelis and the American Jewish community.
"For a while, I was the most hated Jew in America ... by other Jews anyway," he said in his 2011 autobiography. But he added, "I didn't waste time agonizing."
Still, he acknowledged, his mission for peace failed.
Sheinbaum "was a tireless advocate whose courageous stances breathed life into monumental change on both the local and global stages," Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a statement.
"His work will forever inspire everyone who believes in bringing people together to transform our world for the better," he said.
Sheinbaum's causes ranged from reforming the LAPD to urging California universities to divest from their holdings in South Africa during apartheid.
His book, "Stanley K. Sheinbaum: A 20th Century Knight's Quest for Peace, Civil Liberties and Economic Justice," was written with a co-author when he was in his 90s. It contained book jacket testimonials from President Bill Clinton, Barbra Streisand, Jane Fonda and Norman Lear, who summed up his friend's legacy by saying: "He's addicted to fairness and justice."
In 1971, hearing that Ellsberg was to be prosecuted, Sheinbaum saw a cause that meshed with his anti-Vietnam War sentiments. He volunteered to organize Ellsberg's legal team and raise money for his defense. He and his wife Betty moved to Los Angeles for the trial and never left. He recruited Hollywood celebrities to hold fundraisers and he signed up two of the most prominent civil liberties lawyers in the country, Leonard Boudin and Leonard Weinglass.
After many months of legal drama, the case was dismissed for governmental misconduct involving a break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office and the judge's meetings with members of the Nixon administration.
In the 1980s, Sheinbaum became obsessed with the cause of peace in the Middle East. He managed to arrange a meeting with Palestinian Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat and the picture of him with his arm around Arafat that appeared on the front page of the Los Angeles Times set off a firestorm of protest within the Jewish community. He was booed when he spoke at synagogues. But he continued his mission, meeting with Arafat several more times and trying to negotiate peace with Israel.
When Arafat died, he said hope of a peace agreement died with him. His dream of peace had failed.
"My failure is the greatest disappointment I have ever experienced," Sheinbaum said, "and I can only take solace from the knowledge that I really, really tried. I really did."

<title>James Mattis, Trump's reported pick for defense post, sees Israel turning into apartheid state</title>
<date>Thu Dec 01 23:35:17 IST 2016</date>
<content>
James Mattis, a former Marine General reported to be U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s choice for Defense Secretary, has said West Bank settlements are turning Israel into an apartheid state.
Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, who was known as “Mad Dog,” also has said that the United States pays a price for its support of Israel, the Times of Israel reported.
Mattis met with Trump Saturday at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey
An unnamed official “familiar with the transition process” told CNN that Mattis can be considered a leading candidate for secretary of defense.
When Trump was asked by reporters whether Mattis is a candidate to lead the Defense Department, Trump said, “All I can say is he is the real deal. He is the real deal.”
Mattis ran U.S. Central Command in from August 2010 to March 2013. In that position he had command authority for all U.S. forces in the Middle East.
“I paid a military security price every day as the commander of CentCom because the Americans were seen as biased in support of Israel, and that moderates all the moderate Arabs who want to be with us, because they can’t come out publicly in support of people who don’t show respect for the Arab Palestinians,” Mattis said in 2013 at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado.
At the same forum he criticized Israel for settlement building, saying that the settlements “are going to make it impossible to maintain the two-state option.”
He said the settlements would undermine Israel as both a Jewish and Democratic state, and said the settlements would lead to apartheid.
“If I’m in Jerusalem and I put 500 Jewish settlers out here to the east and there’s 10,000 Arab settlers in here, if we draw the border to include them, either it ceases to be a Jewish state or you say the Arabs don’t get to vote — apartheid,” he said.
Mattis was an outspoken critic of the Iran nuclear deal, which exchanged a nuclear rollback for sanctions relief.
Also on Saturday, Trump met 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney for over an hour, fueling speculation that Romney could be Trump’s choice for secretary of state.
Following the meeting Romney told reporters that he and Trump “had a far-reaching conversation with regards to the various theaters in the world.

<title>Israeli BDS activist a top candidate for president of U.K. Union of Jewish Students</title>
<date>Tue Nov 22 20:20:02 IST 2016</date>
<content>
One of three candidates nominated for the presidency of Britain's Union of Jewish Students is an Israeli-born activist in BDS, a movement that calls to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel, the London-based Jewish Chronicle reported Tuesday.
The candidate, Eran Cohen, has also been involved in promoting pro-Palestinian events related to Palestinian Apartheid Week on his campus, the University of York, the Chronicle said.
The Chronicle made reference to a Facebook post by Cohen explaining his support for BDS as in keeping with his view that there should be one state in what is now Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
"I support it because I believe it will bring about a secular state for all its citizens from the river to the sea. Some people equate that with the destruction of Israel. I don't."
A spokesperson for the Union for Jewish Students quoted by the Chronicle said the nomination for presidency required the three candidates to secure support from at least 10 students from five British campuses. Voting ends December 9.
"Our students have nominated three very different candidates for the UJS presidency. We are excited about the levels of engagement in our representative cross-communal union this dynamic and contested election should generate," the UJS said.
“UJS should represent all Jewish students, Zionist or not," Cohen said, according to a statement the Chronicle received from his campaign team.
"I am a Diasporist. I believe the focus of Jewish life is wherever Jews live, and excessive focus on Israel damages the U.K. Jewish community. There are many left-wing Jewish students, both Zionist and not, who support my campaign. Jewish students are diverse, and UJS is supposed to be democratic. It doesn’t stand for anything other than what Jewish students want at any particular time,” Cohen said.

<title>Elie Wiesel, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and renowned Holocaust survivor, dies at 87</title>
<date>Sat Jul 02 22:09:06 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Holocaust survivor, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, prolific author and outspoken activist Elie Wiesel died Saturday at the age of 87. Wiesel was perhaps best known for his major role in promoting Holocaust education, and for perpetuating the memory of the Holocaust in the post-World War II era with his memoir “Night,” based on his experience as a teenager in the Auschwitz concentration camp.
Eliezer “Elie” Wiesel was born on September 30, 1928 in the Romanian town of Sighet, to Sarah and Shlomo Wiesel. His maternal grandfather, Dodye Feig, was a member of the Vishnitz Hasidic sect; his strong influence over Wiesel was seen later in some of his writings. Wiesel received a traditional religious education while growing up in Sighet; many years later, in 2002, he returned to his hometown to dedicate the Elie Weisel Memorial House at the site of his childhood home.
The Wiesel family’s lives were seriously disrupted in 1940, when Hungary annexed Sighet and all the Jews in town were forced to move into one of two ghettoes. In May 1944, the Nazis, with Hungary’s agreement, deported the Jewish community of Sighet to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. The teenage Wiesel was sent with his father Shlomo to the Buna Werke labor camp, a sub-camp of Auschwitz III-Monowitz, where they were forced to work for eight months before being transferred to a series of other concentration camps near the war’s end.
The malnourished and dysentery-stricken Shlomo Wiesel died after receiving a beating from a German soldier on January 29, 1945, several weeks after he and Elie were forced-marched to the Buchenwald camp. Wiesel’s mother Sarah and younger sister Tzipora also perished in the Holocaust. He would later recount those and other events in his 1955 memoir “Night.”

After the war, Wiesel was sent with other young survivors by the French Jewish humanitarian organization Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants to an orphanage in Écouis, France. He lived for several years at the home, where he was reunited with the only surviving members of his immediate family: his older sisters Beatrice and Hilda.
In 1948, the 20-year-old Wiesel pursued studies in literature, philosophy and psychology at the Sorbonne, but never completed them. Around the same time, after working a series of odd jobs including teaching Hebrew, Wiesel – who mostly wrote in French throughout his life – became a professional journalist, writing for both French and Israeli publications. In 1948, he translated Hebrew articles into Yiddish for Israel’s pre-state Irgun militia. Wiesel visited the nascent State of Israel in 1949 as a foreign correspondent for the French newspaper L’arche. He was subsequently hired by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth as its Paris correspondent, and also worked for the paper as a roving correspondent abroad. He also covered the 1961 trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann for the New York-based Yiddish newspaper The Forward.
It was during his time in Paris that Wiesel was said to have studied with a mysterious and renowned Jewish scholar known simply as Monsieur Chouchani (also spelled Shushani in certain sources) after meeting him at a synagogue. Wiesel described Chouchani in an article in Yedioth Ahronoth as “a modern legend,” and after the man’s death, went on to pay for his tombstone in Montevideo, Uruguay, and wrote his epitaph: “The wise Rabbi Chouchani of blessed memory. His birth and his life are sealed in enigma.”
Despite or perhaps because of the major traumatic impact the Holocaust had on his life, Wiesel did not write about those experiences until encouraged to do so during a conversation with French Nobel Laureate for Literature Francois Mauriac, in 1954. The original version of his first memoir was over 800 pages, written in Yiddish and entitled “Un di velt hot geshvign” (“And the World Remained Silent”). He wrote a much shorter version in French, published in 1958 as “La Nuit” and it was translated into English as “Night,” two years later. Despite, its eventual popularity, “Night” sold less than 2,000 copies in its first 18 months in the United States. However, the book did attract much attention among reviewers and created a higher media profile for Wiesel; it has gone on to sell more than six million copies.
In 2006, popular talk-show host Oprah Winfrey selected a new translation of “Night” by Wiesel’s wife Marion for her book club, helping to push the book to a top spot on The New York Times’ best-seller list for nonfiction paperbacks. The book now appears in 30 languages.
“Night” would form the first part of Holocaust memoir trilogy that would include “Dawn” and “Day.” All told Wiesel wrote more than 40 works of nonfiction and fiction, including “A Passover Haggadah” and “Wise Men and Their Tales: Portraits of Biblical, Talmudic, and Hasidic Masters.”
In 1955, Wiesel moved to New York to cover the United Nations. During his time in the city he was hit by a taxi, requiring a prolonged convalescence in the hospital. Following his recovery, Wiesel applied for permanent residency and in 1963 became a U.S. citizen; this was the first citizenship he held since becoming stateless during the Holocaust.
A longtime bachelor, Wiesel eventually met his wife to-be, divorced Austrian Holocaust survivor Marion Rose, in New York. They married in Jerusalem in 1969. Marion served as the English translator for Wiesel’s subsequent books.
The world-renowned Holocaust survivor received numerous awards and honors over the years, including the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom and the rank of Grand-Croix in France’s Legion of Honor, and he was knighted as Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Perhaps the highest honor of all was the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986 for his role in speaking out against violence, repression and racism. Wiesel was also the recipient of over 100 honorary doctorates, and received France’s distinguished Prix Medicis for his 1968 book “A Beggar in Jerusalem,” describing the Jewish response to the reunification of Jerusalem following the Six-Day War.
In Israel, in 2007, then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reportedly suggested nominating Wiesel as candidate for president of Israel on behalf of the Kadima party, but Wiesel was said to have declined the offer. Olmert eventually selected Shimon Peres as Kadima’s candidate for president; Peres would later award Wiesel the President’s Medal of Distinction in 2013.
Despite his life experiences, Wiesel was not without a sense of humor, which he displayed, for example, when given the World Jewish Congress’ Theodor Herzl Award by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2013. “There were two great men in Europe at that time: Herzl and Freud,” Wiesel was quoted as saying, by The Forward. “Luckily they never met. Just imagine Herzl knocking on the door of Dr. Freud: ‘I had a dream.’ Freud would have said, ‘Sit down. Tell me about your mother.’”
In addition to his writing, Wiesel enjoyed a second career as an academic. From 1972 to 1976, he was professor of Judaic Studies at the City University of New York. Thereafter, he was Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities at Boston University, and a member of both its philosophy and religion departments. Wiesel was Henry Luce Visiting Scholar in Humanities and Social Thought at Yale University (1982-83), and visiting professor of Judaic studies at Barnard College of Columbia University from 1997 to 1999.
It can be said, however, that Elie Wiesel was best known for his role in keeping alive the memory of the Holocaust and for promoting Holocaust education. Over the years, he spoke of these subjects innumerable times, before countless audiences, around the globe.
In 1978, U.S. President Jimmy Carter appointed him as chairman of the Presidential Commission on the Holocaust (later renamed the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council), a role in which he served until 1986. In that capacity, Wiesel became a major, driving force behind the establishment of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. His words, “For the dead and the living, we must bear witness” are engraved in stone at the entrance to the museum.
In 1986, after receiving the Nobel, he and his wife established the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity to combat intolerance and injustice around the world through dialogue in general, and via programs for youth. The following year Wiesel served as a witness during the trial of war criminal Klaus Barbie in Lyons, France, during which he spoke of his bitter experiences in Auschwitz.
In 2003, Romanian President Ion Iliescu appointed Wiesel to lead the International Commission for the Study of the Holocaust in Romania. This group, later referred to as the Wiesel Commission, was tasked with setting the record straight regarding the involvement of Romania’s fascist Iron Guard regime in Holocaust atrocities against Jews, Roma and others. The Romanian government recognized the commission’s findings, as published in 2004, including the assessment that between 280,000 and 380,000 Jews and over 11,000 Roma died during World War II as result of policies advanced by the Romanian authorities.
Following the commission’s work, the Romanian government also decided to mark October 9 – the day in 1941 that Romanian Jews were deported to ghettos and forced labor camps – as the country's annual day for commemorating the Holocaust.
In 2012, Wiesel gave back the Grand Cross Order of Merit award he had received from Hungary in 2009, in protest of what he called the “whitewashing of tragic and criminal episodes” that happened in that country during the Holocaust.
In early 2006, around the time “Night” was re-issued, Wiesel took talk-show host Oprah Winfrey on a well-publicized trip to Auschwitz. Three years later, he accompanied President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on a trip to the Buchenwald concentration camp.
Also in the latter years of his life, Wiesel was in the headlines for an entirely unrelated reason: as one of the more prominent victims of Wall Street financier Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity lost $15.2 million it had invested with Madoff, and the Wiesels lost their own life's savings, reported to be around $1 million. The foundation later managed to raise about one-third of the money it lost to Madoff from sympathetic donors, and to continue to function. When asked to describe Madoff by a New York Times journalist, Wiesel said, “Psychopath – it’s too nice a word for him.”
Elie Wiesel was noted during his lifetime for using his celebrity appeal to promote Holocaust remembrance, but also to speak out on various political issues, including instances of genocide around the world. In September 2006, for example, he appeared with Hollywood actor George Clooney before the UN Security Council to bring attention to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. In 2007, the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity issued a letter criticizing the denial of the Armenian genocide at the hands of the Ottoman Turks; it was signed by Wiesel and 52 other Nobel laureates.
Wiesel was concerned about human rights in general, serving on the International Council of the Human Rights Foundation and he spoke out against South African apartheid, Argentina’s policy of “disappearing” people during its Dirty War, and the Bosnian genocide during the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. In 2010, he came out publicly against the Netanyahu government’s decision to deport 400 children of migrant workers from Israel.Weisel was an advocate when it came to a host of Jewish issues, and in particular was stridently pro-Israel. Following a visit to the Soviet Union in 1965, he wrote about the plight of Soviet Jews in a book called “The Jews of Silence,” and spoke out in favor of the struggle to allow them to emigrate; he was also a vocal supporter of the immigration of Ethiopian Jews to Israel. In April 2010, he took out advertisements in four major newspapers, criticizing the Obama administration for pressuring the Netanyahu government to halt construction in Jewish neighborhoods located across the Green Line in East Jerusalem. Wiesel repeated that tactic in 2013 when he took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling on the U.S. administration to demand the total dismantling of the nuclear infrastructure in Iran because that country had called for Israel’s destruction.
In a 2012 interview with Haaretz, Wiesel said he would bequeath the archive of his writings to Boston University, where he had taught for decades. Wiesel is survived by his wife Marion, their son Shlomo Elisha Wiesel, and his stepdaughter Jennifer and two grandchildren

<title>Catholic bishops prevented from reaching separation fence near Bethlehem</title>
<date>Wed Jan 13 21:18:17 IST 2016</date>
<content>
A number of Catholic bishops were prevented from reaching a construction site on the separation barrier on the West Bank near the Cremisan Monastery just south of Jerusalem, the London-based Catholic Herald reported on Wednesday. 
Israeli security forces asked the bishops to leave the construction area and before being escorted away, they "prayed together for peace and justice in the Holy Land." They said they came to see for themselves the effects of the construction on the local farmers. 
Bishop Stephen Brislin of Cape Town told journalists who accompanied the bishops: “It breaks my heart to see what has happened here… we had been here for about five minutes just to have a look and compare with last year before the police came and it just reminded me so much of apartheid times, the type of intimidation, the exhibition of power," reported the Catholic Herald. 
The bishops were part of the annual Holy Land Coordination pilgrimage of 14 members of the Bishops Conferences from Europe, North America, and South Africa. The group is visiting local parishes, schools and aid and development organizations to show the support of the worldwide Christian community and gain insights into the complex problems underlying Israeli-Palestinian relations.
The group will visit in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and Jordan from January 9-14.

<title>Israeli academics feel shunned as boycott movement gains steam</title>
<date>Mon Feb 01 11:04:53 IST 2016</date>
<content>
AP - Israeli anthropologist Dan Rabinowitz is a leader in his field, heading a prestigious school of environmental studies at Tel Aviv University, authoring dozens of publications and holding visiting teaching positions over the years at leading North American universities.
But the British-educated Rabinowitz fears that his younger counterparts may not enjoy the same professional opportunities for a very personal reason: They are Israeli.
As a global boycott movement against Israeli universities gains steam, Israeli professors say they are feeling the pressure from their colleagues overseas. Although the movement ostensibly targets universities, not individuals, Israeli academics say they are often shunned at the personal level. They experience snubs at academic conferences, struggle to get recommendations and can experience difficulty publishing their work in professional journals.
"This is highly personal and personalized," said Rabinowitz.
The academic boycott is part of the broader pro-Palestinian BDS campaign, which advocates boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel. Inspired by the anti-apartheid movement, BDS organizers say they are using nonviolent means to promote the Palestinian struggle for independence.
Israel says the campaign goes beyond fighting its occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and often masks a more far-reaching aim to "delegitimize" or destroy the Jewish state. But the BDS movement's decentralized organization and language calling for universal human rights have proven difficult to counter.
The BDS website says "the vast majority of Israeli intellectuals and academics have either contributed directly to the Israeli occupation and apartheid or at the very least have been complicit through their silence."
And yet Israeli universities are widely seen as liberal bastions, and their professors are some of the most vocal government critics.
Already enjoying significant support in the U.K., the academic boycott has chalked up a series of accomplishments in the United States.
In recent years, the Association for Asian American Studies, the American Studies Association, the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association and the National Women's Studies Association have approved boycott measures.
In November, a meeting of the American Anthropological Association overwhelmingly endorsed a motion supporting a boycott of Israeli universities.
Domino effect
Peretz Lavie, president of the Technion, Israel's premier science and technology university, said the effect of such decisions has so far been minimal.
Lavie, who chairs the Association of University Heads in Israel, said relations between Israeli and American universities remain strong at the institutional and leadership levels, and praised this month's decision by the Association of American Universities reaffirming its opposition to the boycott. The group, which represents 62 leading U.S. universities, said the boycott "violates academic freedom."
Nonetheless, Lavie said the boycott movement has become a top concern for Israeli university leaders, particularly as it gains support at the "ground level" from U.S. student unions and academic associations.
"There may be a domino effect," he said. "If we do not deal with it, it will be a major problem."
Lavie is now leading a battle against the boycott. While acknowledging that Israeli government policies are open to criticism, he said that holding universities responsible for them is unfair and asked why countries with abysmal human rights records, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, have been spared.
"We have the feeling that these movements treat Israel differently than any other country in the world," he said.
Rabinowitz counts the November vote by the anthropological association as one of the most painful chapters of his career. He said he personally tried to alter the boycott resolution twice — only to be rejected with little or no debate. He said the rejection by his colleagues was a "defining moment" for him. In a statement, the association confirmed Rabinowitz's account, noting that the meeting was "highly charged."
Ed Liebow, the association's executive director, said the organization felt "a strong commitment" to take some sort of action. "The one thing we can't do is nothing," he said. The measure goes to the association's more than 10,000 members for a vote this spring.
Although the American anthropologists have never before proposed a boycott of academic institutions, the association said it commonly takes public stands against governments accused of restricting academic freedom. It recently sent a letter to leaders of Turkey, criticizing them for allegedly curbing scholars there.
Ilana Feldman, a professor of anthropology at George Washington University and a boycott supporter, said the proposal, if passed, would not impede professors "in any way" from working with Israeli scholars.
Rabinowitz, however, said it is impossible to distinguish between a person and his institution, which becomes part of one's professional identity.
Israeli academics say such feelings are increasingly common.
Rachelle Alterman, a professor emeritus of urban planning at the Technion, said she still has strong working relationships with colleagues around the world, but the pro-boycott camp is a "rising minority" in academia. She said it is less of an issue in the hard sciences like medicine and physics, and much more palpable in more subjective social sciences. Younger academics trying to establish a reputation are especially vulnerable.
Alterman said she has begun to feel a "coldness" from some colleagues at conferences that was not there in the past. She said some colleagues refuse to attend conferences in Israel, and editors at professional journals tell her it is difficult to find people willing to review papers by Israeli academics.
"I call it the dark matter. It's there all the time, but elusive, hard to spot," she said.
In one recent case, a British colleague coolly rejected a request to assist one of her graduate students.
"I am afraid that as part of the institutional boycott being observed by some academics in relation to Israeli organisations I am unable to help with your request," the British professor wrote in an email.
Rabinowitz said the boycott efforts will backfire by undermining Israeli moderates and playing into the hands of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government.
"It is the best present they can give Netanyahu and the radical right in Israel," he said.

<title>BDS founder urges Hollywood A-listers to reject Israel's Oscar swag bag 'bribe'</title>
<date>Wed Feb 10 12:58:57 IST 2016</date>
<content>
The offer of a free 10-day trip to Israel, valued at $55,000, in the swag-bag provided to select Oscar nominees has raised the ire of the international boycott movement, which on Wednesday called on the actors and actresses to decline the offer.
The trip to Israel, underwritten by the Israeli government, is just one of numerous goodies provided to the nominees. Also included is a walking tour of Japan, a year's worth of unlimited Audi rentals, private fitness sessions and a bizarre item described as a Vampire Breast Lift.
Twenty-six film stars, among them Jennifer Lawrence, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, are eligible for the luxury vacation. "Their visit will have enormous resonance among millions of fans," Tourism Minister Yariv Levin said on Sunday.
But BDS founder and Palestinian activist Omar Barghouti called on the nominees on Wednesday to reject the gift.
“Israel is desperately trying to fight its increasing international isolation through bribes and intimidation rather than by ending its occupation and apartheid,” Barghouti said.
"There are no Hunger Games in Gaza but there is real hunger," he added.
Lash Fary, founder of Distinctive Assets, the company that puts together the bags, said in a press release that this year’s bag is “once again a blend of fabulous, fun and functional items meant to thrill and pamper those who may have everything money can buy but still savor the simple joy of a gift.”
The bags are reportedly worth more than $200,000 each, and are only offered to nominees in the main acting and directing categories.
"In this year of 
OscarsSoWhite and 
FeelTheBern, there is something even more unsavory than usual about this shameless attempt to shower excessive wealth on the excessively wealthy," wrote Matt WIlstein in The Daily Beast.
"When companies feel the need to pay off celebrities who 'have everything money can buy,' then really, no one wins."
As for the Vampire Breast Lift, The Daily Beast describes it as a "procedure which uses blood-derived growth factors to revive rounder cleavage without implants. Women can now also soften implant scars and irregularities (and restore sensation). Using technology used by plastic surgeons for years to help correct post-mastectomy scarring and to heal wounds, the Vampire Breast Lift procedure uses a woman’s own blood to improve appearance."
Now we know.

<title>Netanyahu's 'wild beast' quote was apartheid-speak, says chief Palestinian negotiator</title>
<date>Wed Feb 10 18:52:46 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of "adopting the laws of the jungle" on Wednesday, after the premier said that Israel needed to surround the country with fences and barriers "to defend ourselves against the wild beasts" in neighboring countries.
Netanyahu's statement was "the same as those of the heads of apartheid in South Africa," said Erekat, who is also the general secretary of the PLO.
Netanyahu made his statement on Tuesday, while on a tour of the construction site of a barrier on Israel's eastern border.
"At the end, in the State of Israel, as I see it, there will be a fence that spans it all," said Netanyahu. "I'll be told, 'this is what you want, to protect the villa?' The answer is yes. Will we surround all of the State of Israel with fences and barriers? The answer is yes. In the area that we live in, we must defend ourselves against the wild beasts."
Netanyahu added that the government was preparing a multi-year plan to surround all of Israel with security barriers, as well as a plan to close the breaches in the separation barrier between Israel and the West Bank.
"This thing costs many billions, and we're working on a multi-year plan of prioritization so it would be spread out over years in order to gradually build it, but to complete it to defend the State of Israel," Netanyahu added.

<title>U.K. to bar publicly funded bodies from boycotting Israeli goods </title>
<date>Tue Feb 16 10:06:08 IST 2016</date>
<content>
The British government is set to announce procurement guidelines that will prevent publicly funded bodies from boycotting Israeli goods, the Guardian reported on Monday.
Matthew Hancock, the Cabinet Office minister, will announce the regulations on his upcoming visit to Israel. According to the Guardian, the government is concerned that such boycotts could fuel anti-Semitism.
“We need to challenge and prevent these divisive town hall boycotts," said Hancock about the plans, which were first announced in October. He added that the new guidance "will help prevent damaging and counterproductive local foreign policies undermining our national security.”
The regulations make exempt from boycott any signatory to the World Trade Organization government procurement agreement and provide for potentially severe penalties for violating the guidance. According to the guidance, ministers deem procurement boycotts by public authorities “inappropriate, outside where formal legal sanctions, embargoes and restrictions have been put in place by the government,” the Guardian reported.
The Labour party assailed the plan as restricting democracy and freedom of expression. “This government’s ban would have outlawed council action against apartheid South Africa," a spokesman for party leader Jeremy Corbyn told the Independent. "Ministers talk about devolution, but in practice they’re imposing Conservative party policies on elected local councils across the board.”
The Leicester city council voted in 2014 to boycott goods from Israeli settlements.

<title>Netanyahu asks Britain to remove anti-Israel posters hung in underground trains</title>
<date>Mon Feb 22 19:23:33 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Israel has asked the British government to remove hundreds of pro-Palestinian posters hung in London underground trains over the weekend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday.
The city's transport authority said the posters were unauthorized and would be removed,
“It is fly posting and therefore an act of vandalism which we take extremely seriously," a spokesman for Transport for London said, according to the Evening Standard website.
“Our staff and contractors are working to immediately remove any found on our network.”
The posters were hung by London Palestine Action, a pro-Palestinian activist group, which said it was part of their Israeli Apartheid Week campaign.
“It’s to highlight the illegality of Israel’s occupation of Palestine and the involvement of British companies there,” one of its activists said.
The number of posters hung in the trains is unclear. Estimates range from 100 to 500. In many cases, they were hung on top of existing advertisements.
Many of the posters targeted the BBC, which activists maintain is biased in favor of Israel. Several included mock-ups of BBC reports.
Others targeted security company G4S, which operates some prisons in Israel and the West Bank, according to the Jewish Chronicle. The posters accused the firm of “securing Israeli apartheid” and doing “whatever it takes to secure profits.”
Yet another, which was headlined “Apartheid is Great Britain,” said British-made arms were allegedly being used by Israel in Gaza.
“These posters are awful smears that do nothing to contribute to peace and dialogue, placing significant strains on inter-community relations across London," said a spokesman for the London Jewish Forum.
“They are an act of vandalism, seeking to undermine the UK’s relationship with Israel and designed to foster discomfort. We welcome Transport for London’s commitment to quickly remove them.”
Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid criticized the government for "doing nothing" in response to the posters.
"Since the Israeli government did nothing, as usual - nothing at all - I contacted the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson - a great friend of Israel - and I explained to him that Israel will not tolerate this [propaganda] and that we're asking him to intervene," he told a party meeting.
"Whoever said that we're not taking action is lying," Netanyahu responded. "I spoke earlier with |Foreign Ministry Director General Dori Gold, who is in London, and asked him to demand from the British government that the posters be removed," he told a meeting of his party's Knesset caucus, according to a report in Maariv..

<title>Pro-BDS groups urge Oscar nominees to skip free Israel trip</title>
<date>Thu Feb 25 16:51:43 IST 2016</date>
<content>
Oscar-nominated celebrities were urged on Wednesday to skip a $55,000 trip to Israel offered as part of an awards gift bag.
Two U.S.-based groups campaigning for an end to Israel's occupation of the Palestinian Territories made the plea in a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times that appeared five days before the Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday.
"
SkipTheTrip. Don't endorse Israeli apartheid," said the ad, sponsored by the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation and Jewish Voice for Peace.
The ad said the trip, which is partially paid for by the Israeli government, was part of a larger "'Brand Israel' strategy to distract from almost 50 years of illegal occupation of Palestinian land."
"As was the case many years ago in South Africa, celebrities are being asked to refrain from whitewashing apartheid policies," Yousef Munayyer, executive director of the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, said in a statement on Wednesday.
The trip is one of the most expensive items in a swag bag handed out to the five Oscar-nominated directors and 20 lead and supporting actor and actress nominees, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Sylvester Stallone, Mark Rylance, Cate Blanchett, Jennifer Lawrence, Matt Damon and Kate Winslet.
The gift bag is not affiliated with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organizes the Oscars.
The Academy last week filed a lawsuit against Los Angeles-based Distinctive Assets accusing the gifting group of promoting the bag as official Oscars swag.
The Israeli government earlier this month confirmed it was funding $15,000 to $18,000 of each 10-day trip as a means of offsetting news coverage of the country's troubles.
"These are the most senior people in the film industry in Hollywood and leading opinion-formers who we are interested in hosting," said Israeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin. "They will experience the country first-hand and not through the media."
It was not immediately known whether any of the Oscar-nominated directors, actors and actresses will take up the offer, which must be declared to U.S. tax authorities.
"Creed" supporting actor Stallone signed a pro-Israel petition during the 2104 Gaza war, while "Bridge of Spies" nominee Rylance has signed a petition circulated by Artists for Palestine UK which calls for a cultural boycott of Israel.

<title>Britain reportedly cuts funding for charity behind 'Israeli Apartheid Week' </title>
<date>Sun Apr 03 17:15:08 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
The British government has halted funding to the War on Want charity for its sponsor of events accused of promoting hatred and violence against Jews, the Telegraph reports.
The charity helped pay for Israeli Apartheid Week in February.
War on Want reportedly received some 260,000 pounds ($370,000) from Britain's Department for International Development in the past two years, the newspaper writes.
A spokesman has said that it has ceased funding War on Want, with the exception of a small project in Northern Ireland.
However, in response, War on Want dismissed the report, saying it was a "fabrication."
"War on Want has not sought any U.K. government support for its operations for a number of years now, so it is absurd to suggest that we have had our funding 'pulled,'" said John Hilary, the group's director. "The insinuation that we have been criticized by the government for standing up for the rights of the Palestinian people is equally bogus. We will be contacting the Telegraph to help it set the record straight."
At a rally sponsored by War on Want, a speaker was said to have alleged there was a "rumor" that Israelis were harvesting dead Palestinians' organs, the paper reported.
In a related development, the newspaper says it has obtained undercover recordings of events where academics and others from prestigious universities have expressed anti-Semitism, demands for Israel's destruction, or support for terrorism.

<title>Israeli film on prejudice against Arabs wins Tribeca foreign feature award</title>
<date>Sun Apr 24 11:45:35 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
The film "Junction 48" by Israeli director Udi Aloni about prejudice against Arabs in Israel won Best International Narrative Feature at the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival on Thursday night in New York City, Army Radio reported.
The film follows the story of an Arab rapper as he forges his artistic path in the mixed city of Lod. It deals with anti-Arab bias in Israeli society as well as violence and conservatism among members of its Arab minority. In February, the film won the top audience award at the Berlin International Film Festival. According to Channel 10, the film was produced in part with state funding.
“A heartbreaking portrayal of the intersection of personal and political tragedies, 'Junction 48' questions to what extent music can be dissociated from politics,” a synopsis of the film on the festival’s website read. It will be screened on Sunday at Manhattan’s Regal Cinemas Battery Park 11.
Aloni, the son of the late Meretz party leader Shulamit Aloni, said during the screening that Germany should stop extending military aid to Israel and called its government fascist.
He has said that its government has racial segregation worse than South Africa’s apartheid and opposes its definition as a Jewish state. He also opposes the two-state solution, arguing instead for the creation a country where Israeli Jews and Palestinians from the West Bank, Gaza and Israel would live as part of one nation.  This, he argued in a 2010 interview with Yedioth Achronoth, “would liberate Israel from Zionism.”
“Instead of the dream of a Jewish state, we need to broaden this dream to Jews and Palestinians,” he said in 2010 during a television interview. In it, he also said that Israel “is like Pakistan, which was founded by secular Muslims but gradually became a Taliban state as they lost control of power. The same thing is happening in Israel.”

<title>Lawmaker: If Israel took revenge against Palestinians, Jewish attacks could have been preempted</title>
<date>Fri May 06 19:16:09 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
A leading right-wing lawmaker said Friday that if Israel had pursued appropriate acts of revenge against the Palestinians in the past, it could have prevented subsequent Jewish attacks on Palestinians, including a July 2015 arson attack that killed three members of a Palestinian family.
MK Bezalel Smotrich (Habayit Hayehudi) claimed that revenge is an “important and moral value” that must be carried out only by the state, not by citizens taking the law into their own hands.
Smotrich is no stranger to controversy. His past comments include calling for segregating Jewish and Arab birth-mothers, insisting that the Duma arson was not an act of terrorism, and for organizing the anti-gay "Beast Parade" in 2006.
In the post on Facebook on Friday, Smotrich explained that if the state had taken revenge and deterred the Palestinian enemy, it could have prevented later events such as the arson attack on the Dawabsheh family home in Duma, which killed three people, including an infant boy, or the July 2014 immolation of the Palestinian teenager Mohammed Abu Khdeir in East Jerusalem.
Revenge “has certain ways and goals against which it can be turned,” Smotrich wrote. “It is not given to the individual and cannot be aimed at every target identified with the enemy.”
Smotrich also criticized the government for not taking the initiative for reprisals “in legitimate ways.”
“It is possible to assume that if the State of Israel had not erased, under the influence of twisted Christian morality, the word revenge from its lexicon and had done things in legitimate ways and deterred the enemy, we would not have been faced with these harsh incidents of private individuals taking the law and revenge into their own hands,” he wrote.
In his long and carefully reasoned post, Smotrich made clear that the Abu Khdeir and Dawabsheh murders were not the result of racism, but came from justified aspirations for revenge.
“Steps of revenge are improper. ... The murder of the youth Mohammed Abu Khdeir and the murder in Duma (if it was carried out by Jews) are serious and forbidden, but they do not stem from racism – whose meaning is the hatred of the other only because they are different – or from the desire of someone in Israeli society to destroy the Arab people. They reflect anger and a desire for revenge, justified in their own right, on the basis of the hostility and war of annihilation the Arabs are conducting against us,” he added.
Smotrich called such acts of revenge a mistake and even a crime, noting that whoever commits such acts must be punished.
“If the Arabs had not fought against us, not a single Arab would have been killed here. If the Arabs had not murdered us night and day, not a single Jew here would have wanted to harm them. War is a bad thing, and during it we are required sometimes to take unpleasant defensive measures. It happens sometimes that mistakes are made as part of it, and even difficult mistakes that are almost criminal. But it is light years away from racism and apartheid,” wrote Smotrich.
Smotrich also addressed the speech by IDF Deputy Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Yair Golan on Holocaust Remembrance Day, in which Golan seemingly compared recent developments in Israeli society to events that unfolded in Europe before the Holocaust.
“Really, truly, there is no connection whatsoever between negative phenomena that occur today in Israel – and which, it seems, the deputy chief of staff referred to – and the Holocaust and its lessons.
“Marking with a yellow star and limitations on movement and place of residence were one of the signs of Nazi anti-Semitism in Germany. Racial segregation on buses and in schools were signs of the unacceptable apartheid policies in the United States and South Africa. Erecting barriers, placing limits on movement and the separation on buses conducted in [the West Bank] between Jews and Arabs for security reasons resulting from the situation of war that exists here, even though from a technical aspect there are similarities between these and the previous examples, are something completely different. That the same sun shone here and in Germany does not mean the Nazis and we are the same,” wrote Smotrich.

<title>Prime minister's Twitter campaign 
AskNetanyahu draws more cackles than questions</title>
<date>Thu May 12 03:24:10 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Social media users took up the gauntlet laid down by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, flooding his 
AskNetanyahu hashtag with negative comments.
"Ever wanted to ask me a question? Now's your chance!" the 
AskNetanyahu page proclaimed, inviting people to tweet their questions for a live Q&A session at 3:30 P.M. Israel time, just ahead of Israel's Memorial Day and Independence Day.
Almost immediately, the hashtag was flooded with accusations of Israel being an apartheid or terrorist state. User sent questions like "When will Israel stop murdering children?" or "When are you going to end illegal settlement on West Bank & end the occupation of Palestinian land?"  Some questions focused on problems in Israeli society like, "Why are so many Holocaust survivors living in poverty in Israel despite you scrounging over $3 billion from the US?" One user took a more humorous tone. Raz asked, "Who do you identify with the most: Voldemort, Darth Vader or Hannibal Lecter?"
Netanyahu did have his share of supporters. "@IsraeliPM love this great man," wrote Carolyn G, while Yoel Mukalay chimed in, "the only question I can have, how is it that some people can't appreciate you!? You are the right man on the right place."
According to Middle East Eye, the failure of the 
AskNetanyahu campaign "harks back to a failed Hamas campaign in March 2015," in which the 
AskHamas hashtag drew "more ridicule and abuse than genuine questions."

<title>Amid Israeli Independence Day celebrations, thousands of Arabs rally to mark Nakba </title>
<date>Thu May 12 18:05:17 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Thousands of Arab Israelis marked Nakba Day on Wednesday with a march near the Negev Bedouin town of Rahat, the main event of which was a mass vow to preserve Bedouin lands and not to concede the “right of return.”
Nabka Day, which commemorates the flight or expulsion of more than 700,000 Arabs during Israel’s War of Independence in 1947-49, is usually observed on Israeli Independence Day as well as its official date of May 15. The right of return refers to the Palestinian demand that both the original Palestinian refugees and all their descendants be allowed to resettle in Israel.
Wednesday’s event was attended by Arab Knesset members, the heads of the Higher Arab Monitoring Committee, which constitutes the unofficial leadership of the Israeli Arab community, and thousands of people displaced from their original villages by the War of Independence.
“For the Palestinians, the Nabka isn’t just a historical event, but a personal wound in the heart of every refugee and displaced person,” said Mohammed Barakeh, head of the Higher Arab Monitoring Committee, at the event. “People didn’t flee, as some claim, but were uprooted. Yet even if they fled, they fled out of fear and suspicion, due to the crimes that were committed. And this doesn’t cancel out their right to return.”
“What happened in the Nakba was a crime of slaughter and displacement, and it’s impossible to correct this injustice without ensuring the right of return,” he continued. “What’s happening today is clear. Israel is degenerating into an apartheid state, but still, the world praises Israeli democracy.”
MK Ayman Odeh, chairman of the Joint Arab List, sounded a similar note in his speech. “The question of the Nakba isn’t a question of the past, but a question of the future,” he said. “Recognizing the Nakba, this terrible crime, and working to correct the injustice is the only path to true reconciliation between the two peoples.
“I’d like to stress the importance of our being here in the Negev today to mark the Nabka and express our determination to demand recognition of the injustices that were done and achievement of a just solution that will ensure the people’s rights,” he added.
Gadi Algazi, a history professor at Tel Aviv University, told the gathering that anyone who manages to make the public forget the Nakba and the right of return would also be ignoring the Gaza Strip with its large population of Palestinian refugees. It is impossible to talk about a peace agreement without negotiating over the refugee problem and the right of return of the refugees to what is now Israel, he said. 
Sources at the National Committee for the Defense of the Uprooted, which has organized the march in support of the right of return for the past 19 years, said the decision to hold the events in the Negev this year is also meant to convey the message that the Israeli Arab public has concerns about the situation in Israel's south and over government plans to resettle Bedouin living in unauthorized communities in the region.

<title>Ehud Barak’s top 12 zingers and putdowns of Netanyahu and Co.</title>
<date>Fri Jun 17 04:21:07 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
1. “Who, in the name of God, authorized Netanyahu and his government to take us to the edge of the abyss with their continuous, deceptive and calming murmur that supposedly broadcasts the complete opposite?”
2. “For over a year we have been led by a prime minister and a government who are weak, feeble and clamorous, deceitful and extreme, who have failed again and again.”
3. “Obtuse extremism, hubris and blindness have taken control of the prime minister and the government of Israel, in the name of an ostensibly hidden agenda with a touch of messianism. It is dragging us all into an moral and functional abyss, the bottom of which cannot be fathomed.”
4. “There’s been a hostile takeover. A fanatic core of extreme ideology has taken control of the Likud and purged the party leadership of anyone who preferred democratic values over populism or momentary gain. Netanyahu bears responsibility for the actions of his ‘hijacked’ government and its failures, whether it’s because of his weakness of will or personality, a ‘Stockholm Syndrome’ or his own positions, inspired by his family and his close circle.”
5. “The prime minister’s Hitlerization of the transient regional threats, dangerous as they may be, is Holocaust degradation at its worst.’
6. “We are at the beginning of a road that will lead to an inevitable aftermath like Belfast/Bosnia or old Johannesburg – perhaps all three of them together – through blindness, internal strife and stupefaction that can rival only the tragedies that peer at us from archeological remains, the pages of the Talmud and [Josephus Flavius’] “The Jewish War.”
7. “The hidden agenda will inevitably create one state, which will either be an ‘apartheid state’ that will face resistance from those it controls and be ostracized by the entire world and ultimately collapse. Or it will be a binational state with a minority of Jews in a generation or two, which will most likely descend into a protracted civil war between its two sides.”
8. “At the top of their true agenda, Netanyahu and his government don’t have the country’s security, safeguarding democracy or internal unity, but rather a devious and creeping advancement of a ‘one-state’ agenda, from the Jordan to the sea, which constitutes a direct threat to the very identity and future of Israel and the entire Zionist project.”
9. “In world capitals, in London and Washington, in Berlin and Paris, in Moscow and Beijing – no leader believes even one word from Netanyahu and his government. The government’s hidden agenda will enlist the entire world against us, undermine Israeli society and tear it from within and sever us from the young generation of American Jews.”
10. “Out of reckless frivolity, Netanyahu squandered a rare opportunity to anchor generous force-building agreements with the United States [following the Iran deal]. In my opinion we will get $7-10 billion less than we might have gotten last year.”
11. “Why do we see in the government and its leader pessimism, passivity, anxiety, paralysis – instead of self-confidence, courage and a determination to act? Wailing victimhood steeped in self-pity, instead of pride in every Israeli’s heart? Division and discord, incitement of one against the other, instead of genuine fostering of national unity as well as the right to disagree? Preferential treatment for ‘big money’ instead of the citizen, his family, his right to earn a living and the future of his children? Rabble-rousing and brutalization rather than a tolerant and attentive discourse that recognizes the numerous varieties and culture that we harbor?”
12. “Only a blind, disingenuous, ignorant or kowtowing person will fail to recognize that the [government’s proposed laws] are a process of eroding democracy and the roots of fascism that have taken hold in this government. If it looks like the roots of fascism and walks like the roots of fascism and barks like the roots of fascism, then it is the roots of fascism.”

<title>Will Marwan Barghouti be the Palestinian Nelson Mandela?</title>
<date>Tue Jul 05 02:20:21 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
1. RAMALLAH, 2002
On April 15, Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz called the defense minister, Benjamin Ben-Eliezer. “The Shin Bet has tracked him down. We know where he’s hiding,” Mofaz told the minister.
“I don’t want him liquidated – just arrest him,” Ben-Eliezer implored Mofaz. In his view, the most-wanted individual would be the next leader of the Palestinians, after the Yasser Arafat era.
“If he tries to resist and fight, we will shoot him,” Mofaz told his boss, “but I’m willing to bet he will give up without a fight. He has no guts.”
In the months before he was located, Marwan Barghouti behaved like a hunted man. “We tried to eliminate him twice, we wasted his people right and left,” Avi Dichter, the head of the Shin Bet security service at the time, told Haaretz.
On March 29, 2002, the IDF launched Operation Defensive Shield, to conquer the Palestinian cities in the West Bank. The month that heralds spring would be remembered in Israel as “Black March”: 110 civilians and soldiers were killed in terrorist attacks, mostly in suicide bombings.
After the army took control of Ramallah again, Marwan Barghouti, a member of the Palestinian parliament, secretary general of Fatah and leader of the Tanzim militia – the “chief of staff of the intifada,” from Israel’s point of view – disappeared as though the earth had swallowed him up. “We were told something we rarely heard,” Capt. A., from the undercover Duvdevan unit told Haaretz, “namely that the order to capture him was a directive of the prime minister, Ariel Sharon.”
Wiretapping revealed that Barghouti was hiding in a safe house. The commander of the army’s Ramallah Brigade at the time, Brig. Gen. (res.) Ilan Paz, told Haaretz: “When the intelligence arrived that he was in a building in the heart of a Ramallah neighborhood, [forces from] an armored brigade surrounded the site and the baton was passed to me. The Duvdevan unit was under my command. We understood that he was in the building. One of the soldiers saw him through the window, taking cover close to what looked to us, at least, like an old woman who was lying on a bed. We removed everyone from the building. I called the division commander, Yitzhak Gershon, and told him that if I were in his place, I would reconsider the whole matter.
“To take a political leader into captivity is no trifling matter,” Paz continued. “At the end of the day, he had not murdered anyone with his own hands. I wondered to myself about the need for the operation, which might end with him being killed. The reply I got was: ‘Moving ahead.’ In cases like these we implemented the ‘pressure-cooker’ procedure. You gradually degrade the event, in order not to risk soldiers’ lives, until antitank fire is directed at the house or bulldozers are called in. In this case, the event ended when we went, armed and with dogs, to the door of the building in which he was hiding. He came out, looking frightened.”
Gershon, the division commander, took Barghouti’s hand and led him out of the apartment building. “I put him in the command car,” Gershon related in a conversation with Haaretz. “I took out my canteen and gave him water. He was kind of flipped out. Very frightened. I said to him: Don’t worry. We will not do to you what you would have done to us.”
Added Gershon: “In my opinion, he should be released unconditionally at this point. And not as a collaborator with us, but as someone who will see to the [future of the] Palestinian people, if there is even a small chance that he may become a leading figure on the other side. I say this even though I know he has blood on his hands, as the leader of the Tanzim in the second intifada. Peace is made with powerful enemies whose honor has not been trampled.”
‘The myth will grow’
The army officers who captured Barghouti are convinced that he should now be set free. The same view was held by Ehud Barak. Shortly after Barghouti was captured and taken in for interrogation by the Shin Bet, Barak – the prime minister at the time the second intifada erupted, but by then a private citizen – spoke to Chief of Staff Mofaz. “Have you lost your mind? What’s the story with Barghouti?” Barak asked rhetorically. “If it’s part of your struggle against terrorism, it’s meaningless. But if it’s part of a grand plan to make him a future national leader of the Palestinians, then it’s a brilliant scheme, because what’s really missing in his résumé is direct affiliation with terrorism. He will fight for the leadership from inside prison, not having to prove a thing. The myth will grow constantly by itself.”
Prime Minister Sharon, who gave the order to kill or arrest Barghouti, agreed to free him for a different reason: as part of a potential deal with the Americans in return for the release of the spy Jonathan Pollard. But that didn’t work out. Yuval Diskin, deputy chief of the Shin Bet during the intifada, said in private conversations that Barghouti’s release was definitely possible as one step within the framework of negotiations with the Palestinians. (Diskin did not reply to a query from Haaretz on the subject.)
In contrast, former Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon, who was deputy chief of staff at the time of Barghouti’s capture, believes that his place remains in prison. That opinion is shared by Avi Dichter, who headed the shadow organization that came up with the information about Barghouti’s whereabouts. “When I was head of the Shin Bet,” he says, “there were ministers in the Sharon government who tried to pressure me to take a stand in favor of his release. I told them not to bother. A very senior Israeli political figure described him to me as ‘Mandela.’ [Former Meretz leader] Haim Oron saw him as the future of the Palestinian nation. I told them all that he had bought his leadership with the blood of Jews.”
The Israeli civilian and military leadership that was dealing with the second intifada was thus split on the fraught question of whether to release Barghouti. But that entire story is but a promo to the drama that could ensue when the current Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) steps down. Ill, tired and faring disastrously in the polls (65 percent of the Palestinian public wants him to go), Abbas might declare his resignation soon. “He has no support,” says Yossi Beilin, who co-authored a draft peace agreement with Abbas in 1995. “He is functioning as in other regimes that we know: by means of presidential edicts, loyal security forces and a significant diminishment of human rights. His regime is weak, and therefore the circumstances of his leaving are not necessarily related to the state of his health.”
In the meantime, Barghouti has already announced that if Abbas steps down and a presidential election is held, he will run from his cell in Hadarim Prison, near Haifa, where he is serving five life sentences. .
“He [Barghouti] has been well ahead of his rivals in every public opinion poll conducted in recent years,” Dr. Khalil Shkaki, director of the Ramallah-based Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, told Haaretz. In the center’s most recent poll, conducted this month with the participation of 1,200 interviewees in the West Bank and Gaza, support for Barghouti stood at 40 percent, as compared with 20 percent for Abbas and 35 percent for senior Hamas figure Ismail Haniyeh.
In a poll conducted last March, which posited a scenario of an election fought between Barghouti and Haniyeh, the former received 57 percent, the latter 39 percent. The poll found that in a contest between Haniyeh and Abbas, the Gaza-based leader would win handily, by 52 percent to 41 percent.
According to Shkaki, it’s important to bear in mind that the majority of the Palestinian public doesn’t believe that an election will be held anytime soon. Nevertheless, he says, in a scenario in which Abbas’ term suddenly ends, Fatah and PLO institutions will have to take immediate steps to bring about the election of a successor. “There is no doubt that Marwan Barghouti is in a better opening position than any other candidate,” Shkaki concludes.
Mass nonviolence
Even if he wakes up to a prison rollcall every morning for the rest of his life, Barghouti today appears to present a complete conceptual alternative to Abbas when it comes to key issues: reconciliation with Hamas, the immediate cessation of security cooperation with Israel, Palestinian Authority support for nonviolent mass protest against Israel and a boycott of Israeli goods. Barghouti thinks that the “intifada of knives” is a fatal mistake. In a conversation via a mediator who visited him in prison in late June, he told Haaretz that a popular protest should encompass hundreds of thousands of people from all the Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The protest has to be persistent and systematic, in order to create international pressure on Israel to return to the negotiating table and end the occupation.
“There is readiness for a struggle among the Palestinian people; they need someone to lead them,” Barghouti told his interlocutor. “I still unequivocally support the idea of two states for two nations. The PA can proceed in one of two directions today: to serve as an instrument of liberation from the occupation, or to be an instrument that validates the occupation. My task is to restore the PA to its role as an instrument of national liberation.”
Barghouti is regularly visited by Arab Knesset members, some of whom see him as a future leader. “He has an 86-percent support rating among the Palestinians,” says MK Ayman Odeh, head of the Joint List of Arab parties. Odeh recently brought Barghouti the massive 1999 biography of Nelson Mandela by the British journalist and writer Anthony Sampson.
MK Jamal Zahalka, chairman of the Balad party, a faction within of the Joint List, visited Barghouti a week ago and relates that the latter viewed the collective run of the Arabs in the last Knesset election as a model for emulation, “for his aspiration to unite Fatah and Hamas in a nonviolent protest revolution. He is the best candidate for president. He has an enlightened worldview about women’s rights, for example,” Zahalka notes.
Barghouti’s close friend and lawyer, Elias Sabbagh, visits him weekly. Last week they met at Gilboa Prison, to which Barghouti was abruptly moved when the Hadarim Prison authorities received “intelligence information about a planned disciplinary infraction,” according to an Israel Prison Service source.
“For Barghouti, the nonviolent struggle is an instrument, and not a goal,” Sabbagh explains, “as long as the settlements continue to be built and Jerusalem to be Judaized. He told me that negotiations are possible if Israel expresses readiness to end the occupation and return to the 1967 lines within a time frame of a year.”
But Barghouti is pessimistic about that happening in the foreseeable future. “No de Gaulle or de Klerk has yet arisen in Israel,” he noted from his cell.
A document in Haaretz’s possession, which was drawn up by the intelligence department of the IPS, states that Barghouti “initiated, taught and institutionalized the idea of underground academic studies for security prisoners, recruiting Arab universities for this goal. The prisoner is in ongoing contact with political figures in Fatah on the outside by various means, including visits by lawyers who are a conduit for receiving and transmitting messages and dealing with coordination on his part. The prisoner was involved in organizing and coordinating violent and active protest measures against the IPS, mass hunger strikes … This prisoner has a senior status within and outside the detention facility, he is a self-styled candidate for the leadership of Fatah, and as such is a subject of interest on the part of figures in the Israeli political arena and elsewhere.”
2. RAMALLAH, 2016
“The idea is to mobilize hundreds of thousands of people, who will march to Jerusalem,” former PA Minister Qadura Fares tells us as he stubs out another Rothmans cigarette. Fares is considered a close associate of Barghouti, his representative on the outside. He too is very familiar with Israeli prisons, having spent 15 years in them for his membership in a Fatah armed squad. He was released in the wake of the Oslo accords. Recently, the journalist Avi Issacharoff revealed the existence of understandings that were reached earlier this year between Fares and senior Fatah officials close to Barghouti, and Hamas, concerning the renewal of the Palestinian struggle in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi.
“Another way is for tens of thousands of people to sit on the bypass roads [in the West Bank] from dawn to sunset,” Fares says. “And let’s say a settler fell into the hands of the masses? There is no need to harm him, only to say to him: ‘Leave this place.’ I am talking about an intensive popular revolution that will disrupt the settlers’ lives. I want to play chess with my friends? We will sit on the road. Someone wants to have a wedding celebration? It will be held on a bypass road.”
You have consistently failed to conduct a nonviolent struggle, and instead were tempted into suicide attacks.
Fares: “Okay. It will require a few months of training and preparation. But I can reveal to you that all the people I have spoken with in the top ranks of Hamas agree to the idea of an intensive, nonviolent mass protest.”
A photograph in Fares’ office shows Barghouti, in a prison uniform, powerfully gripping the hands of a young prisoner named Thaer Hamed, the two of them flashing victory smiles. Here they are, the two symbols of the second intifada.
At 6 A.M. on March 3, 2002, Hamed lay in ambush on a hill overlooking an army checkpoint in Wadi Haramiya, between Ramallah and Nablus. Armed with an old Mauser rifle, he shot and killed seven IDF soldiers and three civilians, before escaping and becoming a folk hero in the territories. Legends arose about the identity of the mysterious sniper, who was not arrested until two years later. “In my eyes he is a hero, like all the Palestinian prisoners,” Fares told us. “He killed soldiers who caused suffering and humiliation to tens of thousands of Palestinians, and he vanquished them with one outmoded weapon.”
How do you resolve the contradiction between admiring the sniper and urging nonviolent protest? Are we to conclude that you believe the second intifada was a mistake?
Fares: “In the course of our history, we have fought with our blood far more than with our heads.”
International struggle
Attorney Fadwa Barghouti, the prisoner’s wife, has an office on the sixth floor of a gleaming office building in the center of Ramallah. On the walls are photographs of and paintings by her jailed husband. Since Barghouti’s incarceration, Fadwa has managed a PA-financed fund whose purpose is to create international pressure to bring about his release and in general to cultivate his myth, which has much in common with the aura that developed around Mandela in South Africa. She travels widely, meeting with foreign ministers and shapers of public opinion.
The campaign for Barghouti’s release was launched in 2013 from Nelson Mandela’s cell on Robben Island, in South Africa, where many leaders of the anti-apartheid struggle were imprisoned. Squeezed with Fadwa Barghouti in the tiny cell on the occasion was Ahmed Kathrada, another fighter against the racist regime, who also served an extended sentence in the prison. 
Signing the Robben Island declaration calling for Barghouti’s release were eight Nobel Peace Prize laureates, including former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Desmond Tutu, himself a veteran of the South African campaign. This year, Tutu sent a letter to the Nobel committee, urging it to bestow the Peace Prize on Barghouti. Adolfo Perez Esquivel, the Argentine human-rights activist who himself won that prize in 1980, together with several Belgian members of parliament, has also proposed that the prize be given to the man now serving five life sentences in Israel, after being convicted of murder – noting his commitment to democracy, human rights and equality between men and women. 
In his first years of imprisonment her husband was in solitary confinement and she was not allowed to see him, with the exception of one dramatic visit that was authorized by the bureau of Prime Minister Sharon. In recent years, she has been allowed two 45-minute visits a month. Phone calls are prohibited. She brings him books he requests (she’s allowed to bring one book a month). In addition to obsessive reading of books (eight to 10 a month, according to his confidants, including, recently, David Landau’s biography of Sharon), he has a subscription to Haaretz English Edition, watches the daily current-events program “London and Kirschenbaum” and Israeli newscasts religiously, exercises in the small courtyard and gives talks to prisoners.
Marwan Barghouti was born in Kobar, a small village near Ramallah, in 1959. He was arrested for the first time at age 15, for taking part in demonstrations against the occupation. In 1978, at age 19, he was tried and sentenced to five years in an Israeli prison for being a member of Fatah squads. During his prison term he completed his high-school studies. After his release he married Fadwa, a distant relative; their wedding was postponed time and again because of Barghouti’s frequent interrogations and arrests. “He wasn’t by my side in any of the births of my four children,” Fadwa Barghouti relates. The couple’s firstborn was named Qassam, after Iz al-Din al-Qassam, a pioneer of the Palestinian national struggle.
Barghouti studied political science at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank and was elected chairman of the student union. “In those years he lived between interrogation and arrest, an underground life,” his wife says. “The university was the core of national Palestinian agitation.”
In May 1987, Barghouti was expelled to Jordan. His deportation, along with some of the university’s leaders, was meant to be an Israeli “preemptive strike,” to contain ferment. However, seven months after the wave of arrests, the first intifada erupted, stunning the Shin Bet and the Israeli intelligence community – and Yasser Arafat and the PLO leadership in Tunis, as well. Fadwa Barghouti joined her husband, and their family moved back and forth between Jordan and Tunisia. According to a former senior Shin Bet official, during the intifada, there was at least one case of the murder of a settler that showed involvement by Barghouti, who was in Jordan at the time.
In 1994, following the signing of the Oslo Accords and the advent of PLO leadership in the Gaza Strip, Israel allowed Barghouti to return.
“In contrast to others, he really and truly believed that Oslo would be a five-year period after which the Palestinian state would be established,” Fadwa Barghouti recalls. “But the assassination of [Prime Minister Yitzhak] Rabin caused tremendous damage to the process. After the rise to power of [Benjamin] Netanyahu, he understood that the process would not be realized. Contrary to your description, Barak’s offer at Camp David was not generous. The growth in settlement construction and the building of the bypass roads showed us that you had no interest in reaching an agreement.
“My and Marwan’s generation still harbors a spark of a hope that the conflict will end with a two-state solution,” she adds. “My children don’t believe in that; they aspire to a single, democratic state.”
In the period between Oslo and the second intifada, Barghouti forged an extensive network of social ties with Israeli politicians. One of Barghouti’s close friends at the time was Haim Ramon, a former cabinet minister.
“We used to meet every week, usually on Fridays in Tel Aviv,” Ramon recalls. “He was one of the most moderate figures in the PA. He told me then that it was possible to conclude an agreement, including the refugee issue. In our conversations, he said that it was clear that not one refugee would return to Israel, other than those in the camps in Lebanon, who he said were the most wretched of all. He had a pathological hatred of the settlers. In the second intifada, he adopted terrorism. After he was jailed, I received messages from him in the spirit of, ‘Why doesn’t Ramon come to visit me?’
“There is no doubt that he will be the next Palestinian president,” continues Ramon. “He’s the consensus. He is very much accepted by Hamas. When that happens, strong international pressure will be exerted on Israel, which will be forced to release him.”
In 1996, the first election for the Palestinian parliament, the Legislative Council, was held. “At that time, Barghouti issued leaflets in favor of the political process, Oslo and an agreement, but that was an anomalous, one-time case,” says Dr. Matti Steinberg, an expert on Palestinian politics and an adviser to four Shin Bet directors. “Barghouti’s life embodies the hope and the disappointment in a political agreement with Israel. I anticipate a crisis in the wake of Abu Mazen’s departure, after which they will call on the savior from prison. We may well see a development similar to what happened in South Africa: a Palestinian leader in prison. That is a very dangerous situation, which will lead to international pressure for his release.”
During Barghouti’s years of flirtation with the Zionist left, he occasionally made statements that fractured his image as an optimal partner, and perhaps augured the future. Examples are his suggestion to the Palestinian parliament to send condolences to the family of a terrorist who blew himself up in Café Apropos in Tel Aviv in 1997, and a reference to the Gaza-based bomb-maker, Yahya Ayyash, known as “the Engineer,” as a shahid, or martyr for the cause. “It is an internal Palestinian discourse,” Barghouti explained to Israelis who felt he was deceiving them. In those years he established the Tanzim, a political organization that reflected the status of the local population as against the suited, cigar-smoking figures who arrived from Tunis.
“The Tunis group viewed us as soldiers, and Marwan wanted them to see us as partners,” Qadura Fares notes about the internecine feud within Fatah. “He had been deported and was familiar with both worlds, so he was acquainted first-hand with the huge disparity between the standard of living of the leadership in Tunis and the poverty in the territories. He fought for equality and democratization. He worked to integrate people from the territories into the PA apparatus.”
Barghouti opposed the security mechanisms created by Arafat, and accused their chiefs publicly of thuggery and corruption.
“His office in Ramallah was a residence, with children peeing in the stairwell. That was the setting he chose in order to underscore the fact that he came from the ordinary people,” says the journalist Danny Rubinstein, who was a close friend of Barghouti’s. “The Tanzim was a civilian militia loyal to him. He was the major opposition to the Tunis group. That was his political calling card, and it was meant to take him to the leadership after Arafat. He was totally in favor of an agreement. I met with him two days before he went into hiding and the hunt for him began. It was in the lobby of the Park Hotel, in Ramallah. He told me that the place might be blown up – he was afraid that he was about to be liquidated.”
In 2000, on the eve of the Camp David conference, Barghouti declared that, “Arafat does not have the right to forgo the refugees’ right of return.” The conference ended in failure, with Ehud Barak declaring that there was “no partner” for peace. Two months later, on September 28, 2000, MK Ariel Sharon, the leader of the opposition, visited the Temple Mount. Riots broke out across the territories. The IDF, which in the months preceding Camp David had trained for a Palestinian-initiated war, reacted aggressively.
“Initially, the proportion of those killed was 15:1 against the Palestinians,” former Shin Bet director Diskin noted in an interview with the Channel 10 program “The Source,” which dealt with the lessons of the second intifada. Diskin disagreed with the claim by the heads of the IDF that the Palestinians had planned a war.
But the IDF’s two top officers at the time, Mofaz and Ya’alon, put forward a narrative suggesting just that. They claimed that the so-called Al-Aqsa intifada had been planned long before and that Sharon’s visit to the Temple Mount was only an excuse. A few months earlier, Barghouti had lost to Hussein a-Sheikh in the election for Fatah secretary general. Arafat ignored the results. Ya’alon was convinced that it was a sly, deliberate move by Arafat, who had designated Barghouti – considered a charismatic, militant figure – to lead the intifada. The deputy chief of staff saw a clear portent of things to come in the events in 2000 that marked the Nakba (what Palestinians regard as “the catastrophe” of the establishment of Israel in 1948), which were spearheaded by Barghouti, a few months before the Camp David summit. During the commemoration of the Nakba in demonstrations that continued for three days, stones and Molotov cocktails were thrown at soldiers. Eight Palestinians died in the subsequent exchanges of fire between Israeli troops and Tanzim militiamen. To this day, Ya’alon is convinced that this was the promo, and that Barghouti was then, and more particularly during the intifada, “Arafat’s alter-ego.”
Arafat’s right hand
Three days before Sharon’s visit to the Temple Mount, and the subsequent outbreak of disturbances in the territories, Carmi Gillon, a former Shin Bet director who was then head of the Peres Center for Peace, met with Barghouti in the lobby of the Hyatt Hotel in Jerusalem, in order to plan joint projects for Israeli and Palestinian youth.
“He didn’t look like someone who was spending his nights planning the intifada and his days in initiating peace projects,” Gillon recalls. “My impression was that he advocated an agreement. The eruption of the intifada surprised him, as it did Arafat. And then he rode the tiger. Barghouti understood that the political track of supporting an agreement would not help him to become leader. There is no doubt that he is very much liked by the people and is a serious candidate for president. We had a clear interest to release him. There is nothing to release him for now, because there is no momentum toward an agreement.”
This line is endorsed by another former Shin Bet head, Ami Ayalon: “In the first week of the intifada, Barghouti and his associates were as surprised as everyone else. The Shin Bet’s analysis was spot on: It was a popular uprising. And then, he [Barghouti] started to shape the operative and political logic of the second intifada. He became Arafat’s right-hand man and he believed that the intifada was the way to reach the goal of two states for two nations. When I was a cabinet minister in the government of Ehud Olmert, I told [the prime minister], during the negotiations on the release of [kidnapped soldier Gilad] Shalit, that we should release as many prisoners as possible who were Fatah assets, and above all, Barghouti. Olmert wasn’t cut out to listen to ideas of that kind.”
In the early days of the second intifada, Barghouti led mass demonstrations. When the confrontations escalated, he declared, “The time when only we sacrifice victims is past. We must take revenge. We must kill Israelis. Yes. We have bullets. We have rifles, and they will be aimed at the occupation.”
He was then considered the leader of the militant stream. Some senior IDF personnel claimed at the time that he overshadowed Arafat in his power and influence, and that the Tanzim he led were armed, contrary to the Oslo Accords. “Maybe you can send him to Alaska for a few weeks for a cooling-off period?” Foreign Minister Shimon Peres suggested to Arafat in a meeting.
Subsequently, the Shin Bet received intelligence to the effect that Barghouti, through people loyal to him in the Tanzim and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, provided funding and arms that were used in a series of terrorist attacks in the territories against soldiers and settlers. A Greek monk was killed because assassins mistook him for someone else.
“The second intifada started as a popular struggle, and the Israeli army drowned it in blood,” Qadura Fares tells us in his Ramallah office. “We attended funerals in which people called on Barghouti to take revenge. Marwan, a leader with direct ties to the grass roots, could not ignore those calls, as opposed to the behavior of members of the [Fatah] Central Committee [such as Abbas]. He understood that a serious competitor to Fatah had arisen in the form of Hamas. Marwan wanted to keep Fatah strong. He was 100 percent coordinated with Arafat in the second intifada. That doesn’t mean that they sat up at night planning every detail. Barghouti understood what Arafat wanted, from hints and body language. If Arafat had wanted to stop the shooting, it would have stopped.”
Probably the most highly charged moment of the second intifada came in January 2002. The American envoy Gen. Anthony Zinni had arrived in Israel a few weeks earlier and negotiated a cease-fire, which collapsed when the IDF assassinated Raad al-Karmi, from the Tanzim, by means of a bomb. Karmi, who had carried out dozens of terrorist attacks against Israelis, was on his way to his lover at the time. The assassination, which provoked a fierce debate within the Israeli defense establishment, led to Black March and Operation Defensive Shield in April. Barghouti, who had been Karmi’s patron, called for revenge. Some Tanzim attacks were perpetrated within the Green Line, including the shooting of three people at Tel Aviv’s Sea Food Market restaurant. Barghouti would later claim that he had given instructions that the attacks be carried out only in the West Bank.
This was the juncture at which the decision was made to intensify the effort either to arrest or assassinate the No. 1 wanted Palestinian.
After his arrest, Barghouti underwent intensive interrogation by Shin Bet agents “Mofaz” and “Smith.” The memoranda that the interrogators wrote to sum up the conversation with Barghouti constitute his narrative about the origins of the second intifada.
“It was meant to be popular in character, and I was among its initiators,” he admitted. “But things lurched out of control.” Sharon’s visit to the Temple Mount “was only the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he maintained, and went on to list the factors that led the Palestinians to foment disturbances: “Expansion of the settlements, loss of hope in the wake of the failure at Camp David, loss of hope for independence and Arafat’s failure to bring it about, the corruption of the PA and the refugee problem.”
Barghouti admitted to the interrogators that his involvement in the violence was partly due to the power struggle in the Palestinian street, “in order to force out Hamas and Islamic Jihad,” and inter-generational struggles for control among the Fatah leadership.
From his point of view, he said, the violence was not a strategic but a tactical move that was intended to bring about the Palestinian state. “The second intifada,” he predicted, “will be the last round of violence, because the Palestinians have a feeling that they restored their self-respect through the attacks. A balance was created between the sides, as happened to Israel with [Egypt’s President] Anwar Sadat after the Yom Kippur War.”
He told the interrogators that he assumed full responsibility for the Fatah attacks, but not for those inside Israel, to which he was adamantly opposed.
In his long conversations with Shin Bet agents, Barghouti showed himself to be an ambitious, calculating politician. He took part in the cycle of blood, he related, in part so that “in the future, he would be able to say of himself that he acted for peace and also in war, whereas other leaders did not dirty their hands. Thus he would gain the sympathy of the Palestinian people.”
The interrogators noted that “the interrogee has a well-developed sense of humor and regaled us with several amazing jokes.”
They were probably not referring to the following remark that he made: “I will soon be released in a prisoner exchange, like in the Jibril deal of 1985.”
Four months after his arrest, the state accused Barghouti of involvement in 37 terrorist attacks and acts of terror. The justice minister at the time, Meir Sheetrit, suggested that his trial, in a civilian court, be televised, “like the Eichmann trial” (which was broadcast live on the radio). Barghouti declined to defend himself or summon witnesses, claiming vehemently that he did not recognize Israel’s right to try him. He was convicted on five counts of murder and sentenced to five cumulative life terms in prison plus 40 years for attempted murder and membership in a terrorist organization.
The judges found that Barghouti had led terrorist squads of the Tanzim and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, provided the squad commanders with funds and arms, and in a number of cases had approved the attacks in advance. “I thought that his trial was very problematic for Israel,” Ami Ayalon says, adding, “If I believed in conspiracy theories, I would think that possibly it was an Israeli conspiracy aimed at forging a leader who believes in the two-state solution. But I had a professor at Harvard who said that conspiracy theories should always be left to the end as a last resort. Most of what we see is random or dumb.”
Beilin agrees that “the trial was a mistake,” noting that “even the presiding judge, Sara Sirota, thought it was wrong. The trial turned him into Mandela, and Barghouti is not Mandela. He’s a street cat who in large measure was behind the second intifada. He thought he could control the flames, but no one ever controls any flame.”
Postmortem
Following Yasser Arafat’s death, in November 2004, Mahmoud Abbas, who opposed the path of armed struggle followed by Arafat and Barghouti, was appointed his temporary successor. From his isolation cell, Barghouti declared that he himself intended to run for president. Information reached the Israeli leadership that the two people closest to Barghouti – his wife Fadwa and Qadura Fares – were opposed to the idea, and they convinced him to withdraw. Unusually, the Prime Minister’s Office allowed the two to visit Barghouti, who had been in total isolation in the Be’er Sheva Prison for two years. “I went to see him at Abu Mazen’s request. Today I admit that I made a mistake when I pressured him not to run,” Fares admits, and recalls the dialogue between them.
Fares: Marwan, let’s say that on January 10, 2005, we get up in the morning and you are the president of Palestine. What will you do for us? You are in solitary here in Be’er Sheva.
Barghouti: And what will Abu Mazen do?
Fares: I am under no illusions that Abu Mazen will succeed in establishing Palestine. But he can rehabilitate the home after the destruction of the intifada, rebuild the institutions, promote democracy and continue the political process.
Barghouti: Remember, Qadura, the Israelis will not give us anything. They will not allow you to achieve anything.
Fares: Why?
Barghouti: When a leader has only one option, there is no reason for the Israelis to give him anything. And Abu Mazen will go only for the diplomatic option, for negotiations. We’ve tried a struggle without negotiations, and negotiations without a struggle, and it didn’t help. Only negotiations and a struggle will assure the liberation.
In 2004, Barghouti supported the Israeli government’s plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. He later sent a letter from prison asking the Palestinians not to react with violence when Israel evacuated the Gaza settlers. On the eve of the dramatic move by Sharon, an imagination-firing Israeli initiative was put forward by the ambassador to Washington, Danny Ayalon.
“I received Sharon’s tacit agreement before the disengagement for the following move: Barghouti’s release in return for Pollard,” Ayalon recalls. “To that end, I met with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. I knew that the Americans supported Barghouti’s release, in order to strengthen Fatah. I asked her: ‘Would you be willing to release Pollard in exchange for Barghouti?’ She replied: ‘Danny, don’t go there.’”
The Barghouti-for-Pollard initiative under Ariel Sharon sank like a rock. Barghouti was placed in the top slot on Fatah’s list of candidates in the legislative election of January 2006. When the results came in, Abbas was forced to appoint Ismail Haniyeh as prime minister. Amid what looked like incipient signs of an impending civil war among the Palestinians, Barghouti drew up an ambitious document to block the currents that were flowing outside. He entered into a lengthy dialogue with security prisoners from the various Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The result was the “prisoners document.”
That formative text calls for the establishment of two states alongside one another, based on pre-1967 boundaries, implementation of the right of return and adoption of previous agreements between the sides, abandonment of the armed struggle within Israel proper, and the introduction of democracy as well as equal rights for women.
However, on June 25, 2006, the day on which Hamas Prime Minister Haniyeh was supposed to announce the document’s acceptance in the name of the organization, members of Hamas’ military wing kidnapped Corp. Gilad Shalit along the Gaza border. The signing ceremony was suspended. It would be another five years before Netanyahu, who became prime minister for the first time in 2009, would sign an exchange-of-prisoners deal for Shalit – without Barghouti’s inclusion. Earlier, the Olmert government had also left him incarcerated.
Haim Oron, the former Meretz leader, relates that Defense Minister Ehud Barak told him that he considered Barghouti’s arrest to have been a fundamental mistake. Nonetheless, the Olmert-Barak government did not free him, either.
Barghouti supported the negotiations conducted by Olmert. He told confidants at the time that if it depended on him, he could sign off on a final-status agreement “within a few days.” Some in the Israeli establishment believed that Barghouti’s support for negotiations was authentic. As proof, they noted that Barghouti’s closest confidants, led by Fares, had signed the Geneva Initiative, an unofficial framework for an agreement worked out by teams of Israelis and Palestinians, a few years before. “I would not have signed it if I were against it,” Fares told Haaretz.
Others suspected that the moderation Barghouti displayed in his prison conversations had a personal motivation: his release as part of an agreement, after which he would resume his militant line. “I know that Abu Mazen put forward Marwan’s release as a condition for an agreement,” Fadwa Barghouti says, “and later also to the U.S. secretary of state, John Kerry. I was told this personally.”
Other Israeli governmental sources, however, maintain that Abbas has always behaved duplicitously. “We know that he occasionally asked the Americans for his [Barghouti’s] release, including in a tete-a-tete with President Obama,” says a knowledgeable source. “But there were also assessments that, for fear of his own survival, Abu Mazen preferred that Barghouti remain in prison.” According to MK Zahalka, “There were years when they didn’t want to hear his name in the Muqata” – the Palestinians’ headquarters in Ramallah.
“Over the years, Abu Mazen did not make the required effort for my release,” Barghouti himself told Haaretz.
In recent months, Jerusalem Affairs Minister Zeev Elkin has met with academics to discuss the situation that will ensue after Abbas’ departure. Most of his interlocutors told him that Barghouti is the only Fatah figure who could defeat Hamas in an election. This has not led Elkin to join the chorus of those urging his release.
“On the day after Abu Mazen, the PA will collapse, and we need to be ready for that,” Elkin tells Haaretz apocalyptically. “In my estimation, Fatah will not risk an election, which it might lose to Hamas, and even if it takes the chance, the Netanyahu government will not allow the Arabs of East Jerusalem to vote.” Elkin sees a likely situation of chaos and violence in the immediate post-Abbas period, and also believes that Barghouti will rot in prison.
In the view of some, Abbas’ three posts (PLO chairman, Fatah chairman, PA president) will be divided among three different individuals. The PLO chairman will be the senior figure and will spearhead political moves, the PA president will be a technocrat who will handle administrative affairs, and the Fatah leadership will be taken by a third person from the organization. And what will happen if there is an election and Barghouti wins it? “The [Israeli] security cabinet has not yet held a discussion relating to that question,” a cabinet minister tells Haaretz.
President Reuven Rivlin, who is today against Barghouti’s release, has held a few meetings with political figures in which the question arose of what Israel should do if Barghouti is elected president. Rivlin said in those conversations that the country’s leaders should, in that event, recalculate their course and do what meets Israel’s interests best. In Rivlin’s opinion, if the international community sees him as a Mandela-like figure and exerts pressure for his release, it will be against Israel’s best interests to have him remain in jail.
Barghouti himself recently told one of his visitors that he is vehemently opposed to having Abbas’ successor chosen in an election in the style of the Arab states. “The only way is a completely democratic election under international supervision,” the prisoner said. “Anyone who thinks that the next Palestinian president will not be elected via the ballot box is living under illusions.”

<title>Africa has no better friend than Israel, Netanyahu says during Kenya visit</title>
<date>Tue Jul 05 19:00:20 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Africa has no better friend than the state of Israel for the practical needs of security and development, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday on the second leg of a four-country tour to pursue better relations with the continent.
Netanyahu is the first ruling Israeli prime minister to visit Kenya. He met with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on counter-terrorism, energy and agriculture, amid tight security. Netanyahu is also visiting Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia.
Israel played a prominent role in assisting newly independent African countries in the 1960s, but those relations crumbled in the 1970s, when Arab countries, promising aid, pressured African nations to limit or cut ties with Israel. African states were also opposed to Israel's close ties to South Africa's apartheid government.
In exchange for its expertise in security and other fields, Israel now wants African states to side with it at the United Nations, where the General Assembly overwhelmingly recognized Palestine as a non-member observer state in 2012.
Israel and the region also have a shared interest in confronting Islamic extremists.
"Things are changing in the world, things are changing in the Middle East, and things are changing in the relations between Israel and many of our Arab neighbors. A similar change is now undergoing our relation with African countries," Netanyahu said.
He said Kenyatta told him that African leaders would work to restore Israel as an observer to the African Union. "I think that it will have very considerable effect regarding Israel's international relations in the future, vis-à-vis our effort to bring about a very great number of countries that support Israel," Netanyahu said.
Kenyatta said the threat of extremism demands partnership with nations with a common position against it.
"That's why I strongly believe it's critical for us reevaluate our relationship ... with the state of Israel given the challenges that in we in the African continent are faced with today," Kenyatta said.
Kenya has long been a target of extremist attacks which have hit Israeli interests. In a near simultaneous attack in 2002, Al-Qaida extremists blew up an explosives-laden vehicle at an Israeli-owned hotel on the Kenyan coast, killing 11 people, while others shot at an Israeli jetliner.
Kenyatta also said his country supports talks between Israel and the Palestinians.

<title>Netanyahu visits Rwanda genocide memorial, noting similarities to Holocaust - Israel News</title>
<date>Wed Jul 06 18:35:07 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday toured a memorial for victims of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda during the first visit by a sitting Israeli prime minister to sub-Saharan Africa in three decades.
                
Netanyahu laid a wreath at the mass graves honoring the more than 800,000 victims of the genocide perpetrated by Hutu extremists against the Tutsi ethnic group and moderate Hutus.
                
"We are deeply moved by this memorial to the victims of one of history's greatest crimes and reminded of the haunting similarities to the genocide of our own people," he and his wife, Sara, wrote in the visitors' book.
                
Netanyahu, who is pursuing closer security and other ties with African nations, has already been to Uganda and Kenya this week and was moving on to Ethiopia later Wednesday.
                
In exchange for its expertise in security and other fields, Israel wants African states to support it at the United Nations, where the Palestinians were recognized as a non-member observer state in 2012.
                
Israel played a prominent role in assisting newly independent African countries in the 1960s, but those relations crumbled in the 1970s, when Arab countries, promising aid, pressured African nations to limit or cut ties with Israel.
                
African states were also opposed to Israel's close ties to South Africa's apartheid government.

<title>On Palestinians, Elie Wiesel had nothing to apologize for</title>
<date>Sun Jul 10 13:48:26 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
He had suffered unimaginably, persevered, fought incredible odds and won. But while he was regarded by most of the enlightened world as a hero, he also had a tendency to overlook the crimes of his allies and disregard those suffering under them.
This could describe Mohandas Gandhi, his “Dear Friend” letters to Adolf Hitler and attempts to build an alliance with the Axis nations against the British. It could be Nelson Mandela who, after becoming South Africa’s president, bestowed honors on tyrants who had supported him in the past such as Kadaffi, Castro and Suharto. How about Muhammad Ali, favored guest of African dictators, of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran? When Mandela died in 2013 and Ali last month, you heard nearly nothing about their unsavory friendships in the chorus of adulation for their greatness.
Compare that with the small but vocal corner of public opinion and punditry which over the last week since Elie Wiesel passed away, seems to be obsessed with the fact that he didn’t care much for the Palestinians. I’m no fan of the “don’t speak evil of the dead” school and there are enough examples of me trashing the reputations of the dearly departed in the archives of this newspaper, but why exactly are Wiesel’s views on the Israel-Palestine conflict even relevant to summing up his life’s work? I suppose if you were writing a 10,000-word obituary this might warrant a couple of sentences somewhere towards the end. But for a disturbing number of people, some of whom should at least know better, Wiesel’s views on Palestinian statehood were the litmus test by which they judged him.
But then, it was hardly surprising that there would be those who, in the immediate aftermath of his death, would seek to besmirch Wiesel’s record. For decades he was accused of being the showman of the Shoah business. Of hobnobbing with presidents and potentates. Of selling out to big money. Of being a fraud and a hypocrite. After all, he made too many people uncomfortable with his constant reminders that not long ago Jews were an endangered and hunted-down species. What was easier than using the ancient tactic of framing him as a money-grubbing Jew. And it was hard not to detect a tinge of schadenfreude in the reports that Wiesel’s own foundation was among those that had lost nearly all its millions investing in Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. Excoriating him for his perceived callousness towards the Palestinians is just another more fashionable way of taking that uppity dead Jew down a few pegs.
There were always those who would never forgive Wiesel for not remaining a young poor survivor on the wooden bunk in Buchenwald. Just as there are those who can’t accept that in the 70 years since over a third of the Jews were wiped out, the survivors and their children are now living prosperously in the comfortable communities in the West or in their homeland and sovereign state. But Wiesel had to pay the price for his success and for playing the role of the man who made the Holocaust real for millions who knew nothing about it.
Someone had to be the most famous Holocaust survivor in the world, the Shoah’s celebrity. It would have to be someone living in the United States, comfortable appearing alongside presidents and movie stars. He would have to be something of a showman, with a deft turn of phrase, a certain talent for public relations and the flexibility to adapt the trauma of his personal experiences, originally written in 900 pages of Yiddish, to a Hollywood script. It was inevitable that in becoming the face of his people’s genocide, one man representing six million dead men, women and children, as well as those who had survived, Wiesel was also setting himself on a pedestal from which some would try to knock him down.
In the decades that passed between the war and his transformation into Elie Wiesel, the writer and philosopher of the Holocaust, he was a journalist, writing mainly in Hebrew and French, neither his mother tongue. He was moderately successful as a journalist because he knew how to write both for his editors and his audience, which was not necessarily what he might have chosen to write for himself. He learned that a popular writer needs to make compromises. Wiesel was aware that he wasn’t the best survivor-writer. On a literary level he was nowhere near as good as fellow Auschwitz inmates Primo Levi and Imre Kertesz. This probably bothered him, but at least he sold many more books than they did and besides, they didn’t have the public role that had been thrust upon him. They didn’t have to act as a “voice of world’s conscience” and represent six million without a voice. Kertesz’s Nobel Prize was for literature; Wiesel’s was for peace. While you could argue whether his work advanced the cause of peace in the world, Yasser Arafat and Henry Kissinger also got Nobel Peace Prizes.
So Wiesel was not interested in speaking out against injustices done to Palestinians. After the Holocaust, he felt that Israel’s war for independence was his own. He feared, with good reason, that once again the Jews would lose and another genocide of 600,000 would take place should the Arab armies invading the new state succeed. He visited in 1949 while Israel was still barely hanging by a thread, while absorbing millions of survivors like him and Jewish refugees from Arab lands. His political conclusion was that Israel must never concede ground to its enemies. I expect younger Israeli politicians to adapt their views, but what right did we have to expect that of Wiesel?
It would have been wonderful if he had used his voice to urge Israelis and Israel’s supporters to seek a better way of solving the conflict with the Palestinians. But that wasn’t his role. Had Wiesel returned to live in Israel in his old age, I’m pretty certain we wouldn’t have been voting for the same party or the same candidates in the Knesset election. So what? He saw Israel as the haven that must be protected at all costs and though I and many others believe that Israel will be safer living aside a Palestinian people with rights and dignity, he thought otherwise. To blame him for holding this view is as churlish as insisting that Mandela should have shunned those dictatorships that supported him during his incarceration and long battle against apartheid. Blame the politicians who feted Wiesel and used him for their purposes, not the man who had seen his family and community destroyed and felt that Israel should take no risks in ensuring that Jews would have a place somewhere to ensure that it never happened again.
Wiesel played a role in giving both those who died in the Holocaust and those who lived through it a face and a voice. He enjoyed fame and fortune for doing so, but also had to pay a price by enduring ridicule and often unfair criticism for shedding his anonymity and putting himself up on the world stage. His goals were to make sure the Jews who had died were not forgotten and that those who lived could survive and prosper. He still found time to speak out on behalf of Cambodians, Bosnians, Rwandans and other victims of genocides. But he wouldn’t do so for those who he saw as endangering his own people. I think he was wrong in that but in no way does that invalidate his life’s work. Those who upon his death are rushing to tar him for that are no different than those who during his life criticized his financial success and fame. Elie Wiesel paid the price for his victory and had nothing to apologize for.

<title>After stormy debate, Knesset approves law allowing ouster of lawmakers</title>
<date>Wed Jul 20 00:43:59 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
The Knesset passed into law a bill that lets it oust a sitting lawmaker – legislation that critics say targets Arab lawmakers deemed to be inciting against Israel’s interests.
According to the law, which was passed with a majority of 62 votes against 45, the Knesset can oust a lawmaker for incitement to racism and support of armed struggle against the state. The expulsion requires a majority of 90 lawmakers, while to launch expulsion proceedings, the votes of 70 of the Knesset's 120 members are required, including 10 from the opposition. The original version of the bill only required 61 MKs to launch the proceedings, and not necessarily anyone from the opposition.
Members of the Joint List of Arab parties said they intend to appeal the Supreme Court against the law. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated the new legislation, saying in a Facebook post that it "puts an end to the absurdity: Those who support terrorism against the State of Israel and its citizens – won't serve in Israel's Knesset."
"Like in any democracy in the world, Israeli democracy also has the right and the duty to defend itself," he added.
Opposition leader MK Isaac Herzog slammed the law, saying on Twitter that it is a "dark mark on Israel's face. The hate-filled government is busy widening the rift that threatens Israel more than any outside enemy."
MK Nissan Slomiansky (Habayit Hayehudi) rejected claims that the law is targeting the Arab lawmakers. "You know that in actual fact, the only time this calling card has been activated was against Jews," he said, referring at the rightwing extremist Meir Kahana, who was disqualified from running for Knesset in the 1980s. 
"The Knesset will no longer be a shroud for terrorism and racism. Members of the Knesset whose paycheck is funded by the state cannot use it to undermine its foundations," Slomiansky said earlier. MK Yousef Jabarin (Joint List) said the law would turn the Arab lawmakers into "MKs on probation," adding: "This is apartheid legislation, which paves the way for a political transfer of the Arab public's elected officials."
Coalition Chairman MK David Bitan, who had been trying to shelve the bill due to concerns over the difficulty of its implementation, said after the vote that the Knesset has spoken with an absolute majority, and termed the law "a whip against those who think they can exploit Israeli democracy to undermine the State of Israel." 
On the other side, MK Dov Henin (Joint List) said the law is an example of the tyranny of the majority, and "directly targets the Arab public's elected officials, chosen to voice their stances."
"This law is a black page on Israel's code of laws, which reflects anti-democratic policy and maneuvers by an anti-democratic government, which will go on to harm more and more populations," he said.
Ahead of the vote, some in the coalition also voiced dissatisfaction with the law, albeit with the limits placed on its usage. “This law is a failure. It will be impossible to implement,” a senior Likud official said. “They’ve raised the threshold of MKs so high that there’s no longer any point to it.”

<title>Black Lives Matter endorses BDS: Israel is 'apartheid state'</title>
<date>Thu Aug 04 10:49:16 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
The wide-ranging new platform of a coalition growing out of the Black Lives Matter movement includes harsh criticism of Israel, which it describes as an “apartheid state” that, it claims, perpetrates “genocide” against the Palestinian people, endorsing the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign.
Released Monday, the platform of the Movement for Black Lives calls for “an end to the war against Black people” and is the campaign’s first comprehensive document addressing specific federal policies.
Black Lives Matter Network is one of over 50 black-led organizations in the coalition.
While the majority of the document addresses issues other than Israel, the section on foreign policy, titled Invest-Divest, objects to U.S. military aid to Israel, which it describes as “a state that practices systematic discrimination and has maintained a military occupation of Palestine for decades.”
While the section addresses other foreign policy issues, particularly the movement’s objections to the drug war and the war on terror, it criticizes no foreign country other than Israel.
The section also argues that the U.S., because of its alliance with Israel, is “complicit in the genocide taking place against the Palestinian people.”
According to the platform, “Israel is an apartheid state with over 50 laws on the books that sanction discrimination against the Palestinian people.”
The platform claims Palestinian property is “routinely bulldozed to make way for illegal Israeli settlements” and that Israeli soldiers “regularly arrest and detain Palestinians as young as 4 years old without due process.”
“Everyday, Palestinians are forced to walk through military checkpoints along the U.S.-funded apartheid wall,” the platform adds, referring to the security barrier Israel erected in response to a wave of terrorist attacks committed by Palestinians from the West Bank.
The section expresses support for the BDS campaign against Israel, and credits Adalah-The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, as one of its “authors & contributors.”
Formed in response to growing outrage over the criminal justice system’s treatment of African Americans — particularly police violence against them — the Movement for Black Lives describes itself on its website as “a collective of more than 50 organizations representing thousands of Black people from across the country.”

<title>Jewish groups condemn Black Lives Matter platform for accusing 'apartheid' Israel of 'genocide'</title>
<date>Fri Aug 05 11:53:09 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
A new platform associated with the Black Lives Matter movement that describes Israel as an “apartheid state” committing “genocide” against the Palestinian people has triggered critical responses from Jewish organizations — even its allies.
“[We] are extremely dismayed at the decision to refer to the Israeli occupation as genocide,” a statement from T’ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, read.
Since Black Lives Matter took shape in 2013 to protest police killings of African Americans, Jewish groups across the country have struggled to strike the right tone in their responses to the movement. Activists aligned with Black Lives Matter have frequently visited the occupied Palestinian West Bank in what some call “solidarity tours,” as recently as July 30.
Black Lives Matter has again risen in prominence in the run-up to the presidential election and amidst a spate of video-taped killings, grimly detailed, of African Americans by police. Now the platform, announced on July 3, has prompted several Jewish organizations to more precisely define their relationship to the movement.
T’ruah is one of several Jewish organizations that have stood with the grassroots movement to end police brutality against African Americans.
The organization also praised “the leaders of Black Lives Matter for insisting that the United States meet its human rights obligations, and for concretizing these into specific policy recommendations.”
“I am struggling with ‪
‎BlackLivesMatter‬ but I believe black lives matter,” wrote Rabbi Ari Hart, from the Bayit Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, on his public Facebook page.
Other groups, including Boston’s Jewish Community Relations Council, had harsher words — saying they would be disassociating themselves with any group aligned with Black Lives Matter from now on.
“We cannot and will not align ourselves with organizations that falsely and maliciously assert that Israel is committing ‘genocide,’” a statement from the group read. “We reject participation in any coalition that seeks to isolate and demonize Israel singularly amongst the nations of the world.”
For some Jews of color, particularly African American Jews, who had embraced the popular movement, the language of the new platform was especially troubling.
“It broke my heart,” said Stacey Aviva Flint, a student at Chicago’s Spertus Institute who is African American and Jewish and writes on parallels between black and Jewish nationalist movements.
“I understand what Zionism was about when it first started. You had a group of people who were seeking self determination. And self determination was also something that African Americans desperately needed and wanted,” said Flint.
“[In past months], I really thought, ‘a movement is starting, I want to support this, as African Americans are being targeted by the police,’” Flint said.
“This dashed my hopes.”
Flint said that calling Israel an apartheid state would only “muddy” Black Lives Matter’s message. “Now people don’t see Black Lives Matter as a legitimate platform.”
Jews of color have taken center stage in a series of Black Lives Matter-inspired protests happening in New York City. The Jews of Color Caucus, which is a smaller body within Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, most recently staged a protest of more than 100 in Downtown Brooklyn.
Speaking on the topic, but before the new platform was released, founding member of the caucus Yehudah Webster said, “It’s important for white Jews and Israelis to recognize, yes, the Palestinian-Israeli situation is unique, but still it does play into this global system of white supremacy.”
“I consider myself a Zionist,” said Webster, “but being a patriot means pushing your government and people to be better. That’s why I want Israel to be the best it can be.”
The platform of the “Movement for Black Lives,” a coalition under the Black Lives Matter umbrella, calls for “an end to the war against Black people.” It is being called the campaign’s “first comprehensive document” addressing specific federal policies.
Most of the document has nothing to do with Israel. But the section on foreign policy (called “Invest-Divest”) criticizes American military aid to Israel. Israel is “a state that practices systematic discrimination and has maintained a military occupation of Palestine for decades,” the platform reads.
The section dealing with Israel also calls on activists to “build invest/divestment campaigns” to end “US Aid to Israel’s military industrial complex” and credits Adalah, an Israeli advocacy group for Arab rights, among its “authors & contributors.”
Right-wing Jewish groups, including the Zionist Organization of America have condemned Black Lives Matter since the movement’s early days.
The Anti-Defamation League’s Jonathan Greeblatt has said that racial justice for African Americans is one of “the struggles of our time,” and the ADL includes educational material about Black Lives Matter on their website.

<title>World sees Israel as a pariah state, senior gov't official says</title>
<date>Sun Aug 07 12:49:00 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Israel is perceived a "pariah state" in the international community, Strategic Affairs Ministry Director General Sima Vaknin told lawmakers on Sunday, adding that the ministry intends to reverse this stance in the next decade.
Vaknin said that a team of 10 officials from a various ministries has been created to agree on a desired alternative narrative they would like to see in the world regarding Israel. Vaknin's comments were made during a meeting of the Special Committee for the Transparency and Accessibility of Government Information headed by MK Stav Shaffir (Zionist Union).
"Victory for me will be a change of narrative in the world toward Israel - that the narrative in the world won't be that Israel equals apartheid," Vaknin said. "[T]oday in the countries of the world, Israel is a pariah state. Our goal is that in 2025 no one in the world will question Israel's right to exist."
Shaffir requested that Vaknin reveal the ministry's budget, strategy and work plan regarding its fight against the delegitimization of Israel. Vaknin agreed to divulge little details and said that she would be able to offer more information only in a closed discussion with the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
Vaknin, who until a few years ago served at the chief military censor, said she wanted her ministry to work in greater secrecy and she even asked Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan to avoid public comments regarding the ministry's work.
"We want most of the Strategic Affairs Ministry's work to be classified," she said. "There is great sensitivity and I can't even discuss in an open forum why there's sensitivity... A large part of what we do is under the radar."
Some two weeks ago, during an open discussion in the State Control Committee, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel had "defeated" the movement to boycott, divest and sanction Israel, known as BDS. Vaknin denied that Netanyahu said anything of the sort, but agreed with Netanyahu's assessment that supporters of the movement are on the defensive, unlike in the past.
"There is strategic competition between us and our opponents," said Vaknin. "We are shifting from containment and reaction to initiative and attack... BDS activists are on the defensive because we announced publicly and showed through back channels that we will fight back."
One of the only details that Vaknin agreed to reveal was the ministry's budget. According to her, the ministry's day-to-day budget amounts to 44 million shekels ($11.4 million) for 2016 and the budget specifically allotted for taking action against delegitimization in 2016 was 128 million shekels.
In the course of discussion, Shaffir asked Vaknin how the ministry defines delegitimization against Israel. Vaknin responded that the cross-ministry team is currently working on establishing a legal definition of the term. In the meantime, she said, the ministry is using the definition established a few years ago.
Vaknin's deputy, Zachi Gavrieli, read the current definition out loud, noting that "Delegimization is the gathering of organizations and ideas around a contemporary theme to reject the idea of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people."
On this note, Vaknin said that the Strategic Affairs Ministry believes "that any harsh criticism against Israel is legitimate but the denial of Israel's right to exist isn't." She said the ministry would like to collaborate with different organizations according to the principle of the "widest possible tent" and welcome in both staunch Israel supporters and critics, as long as all recognize Israel's right to exist.
"I'm a civil servant and I'm not addressing political issues," Vaknin said. "But in my view... whoever accepts our existence here - including the biggest critics - is our partner. Whoever does not - he is an opponent. If an organization says that we need to return all of the [occupied] territories but recognizes Israel's existence as a nation-state [of the Jewish people] - as far as I'm concerned it is a partner, even if there is those who won't like it."
Vaknin told the panel that the diplomatic-security cabinet decided to allow the Strategic Affairs Ministry to move offices from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. She noted that the grounds for the move were confidential and said that part of the ministry will remain in Jerusalem. Despite Vaknin's claims, Minister Erdan already revealed several months in a similar discussion in the Knesset that the reason for moving part of ministry is the need for physical proximity to military headquarters at the Kiryah complex and other intelligence organizations.

<title>N.Y. venue nixes Black Lives Matter benefit over Israel-bashing platform</title>
<date>Sat Sep 10 01:52:43 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
A New York venue cancelled a concert raising money for Black Lives Matter over a recent policy platform by an affiliated group, which called Israel an “apartheid state” perpetuating “genocide” against the Palestinian people.
An email sent to ticket holders this week said that the owners and managers of Feinstein’s/54 Below had “become aware of a recent addition to the BLM platform that accuses Israel of genocide and endorses a range of boycott and sanction actions.”
The cabaret club, which is located close to Times Square, “would have preferred to hold the concert in support of the 
BlackLivesMatter movement, without endorsing or appearing to endorse the entirety of the Black Lives Matter organization and its platform but we’ve found that a distinction impossible for us to effect,” the email read, according to Playbill.
“As we can’t support these positions, we’ve accordingly decided to cancel the concert,” it continued.
According to the venue’s web site, it is owned by a team of Broadway producers, including Tom Viertel, Marc Routh, Richard Frankel and Steve Baruch. The site says the venue has a “creative partnership” with singer and pianist Michael Feinstein.
The concert was scheduled for Sept. 11 and was to be directed by Tony Award-winning actress Tonya Pinkins.
Last month, The Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of groups affiliated with Black Lives Matter, released a wide-ranging platform calling for “an end to the war against Black people.”
The majority of the document addressed issues other than Israel,, including discrimination and police violence directed at African Americans,  but the section on foreign policy objected to U.S. military aid to the Jewish state.
The section criticized no foreign country’s policies other than those of Israel.
The statements on Israel drew strong criticism from many Jewish groups, including T’ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, which said it was “extremely dismayed” that the platform accused Israel of genocide.

<title>Ex-PM Barak: Netanyahu's interference in U.S. politics cost Israel a better aid deal</title>
<date>Thu Sep 15 20:44:45 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak severely criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a Washington Post op-ed published on Thursday, saying that the PM's "irresponsible management" of relations with the White House damaged the defense aid deal signed with the U.S. on Wednesday. 
According to Barak, the deal – which would see Israel receive $3.8 billion annually until 2029 – was an "important contribution" to Israel's security but "far less than what could have been obtained before the prime minister chose to blatantly interfere with U.S. politics."
Barak, who served as defense minister under Netanyahu between 2007 and 2013, also said that the rising cost of arms means that the sum represents no greater purchasing power since the last 10-year agreement. 
Barak also wrote that Netanyahu has allowed his party, the Likud, to be been taken over by a "militant, nationalist minority," which has hijacked the national agenda in the service of a "messianic drive" toward a one-state solution. 
"This overarching ambition is bound to culminate in either a single, binational state, which, within a generation, may have a Jewish minority and likely a Bosnia-like civil war, or else an apartheid reality if Palestinian residents are deprived of the right to vote. Both spell doom for the Zionist dream," Barak wrote.
Likud called Barak's op-ed "nonsense penned by the most failed prime minister in Israel's history." In a statement, the party said that the aid deal with the U.S. was the biggest in U.S. history, and that the op-ed proves that Barak isn't interested in what is best for the country or for Israel's security, but only in his own interests. 
Barak has since responded to the Likud, telling Army Radio that if Netanyahu had conducted himself appropriately facing the U.S., Israel could have gotten $4.5 billion more. 
This was not the first time Barak has attacked Netanyahu recently. About a month ago Barak said that a series of events in recent months caused damage to Israel's security as a result of Netanyahu's mistaken judgment and his rocky relations with U.S. President Barack Obama. Barak noted in his speech that he could give no further details as to the incident because of its sensitivity. Earlier this month, billboards were put up in Tel Aviv calling on Barak to return to politics. "Barak you must run, Netanyahu is ruining the country," read the billboards.

<title>Watch //Obama: Peres understood the Jewish people 'were not born to rule another' - Israel News</title>
<date>Fri Sep 30 12:02:14 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
U.S. President Barack Obama eulogized Israel's former President Peres on Friday by quoting the statesman as having said that "the Jewish people weren't born to rule another people."
                
"He would say: We are against slaves and masters." Obama said.
                
Obama said further that he saw Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' presence at the late statesman's funeral "is a gesture and a reminder of the unfinished business of peace."

Obama said that the younger generation remembers only Peres' unsuccessful quest for peace, and was shaped by the critics who said he "refused to recognize the wickedness of the world and called him naive."
                
But, as Obama saw it, Peres' "pursuit of peace was never naive." He thought that Peres must have found it amusing that the critics who called him naive "depend on the defense architecture that he himself helped to build.
                
Peres, he said, "learned from hard earned experience that true security comes from making peace with your neighbors."
                
Obama compared Peres' campaign for peace to that of anti-apartheid activist and former president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
                
"Even in the face of terrorist attacks, repeated disappointments at the negotiating table, he insisted that Palestinians must be seen as equal in dignity to Jews and therefore equal in self-determination."
                
"He believed that Israel would be best protected when Palestinians had a state of their own." 
                
Obama applauded Peres' range of contributions to Israel and the wider world.
                
“I could not be more honored to be in Jerusalem to say farewell to my friend, to Shimon Peres, who showed us that justice and hope are at the heart of the Zionist idea," Obama said.
                
"A free life in homeland regained, a secure life of a nation that can defend itself by itself, a full life of a friendship with nations who can be counted on as allies, always…. this was Shimon Peres's life. This is the state of Israel. This is the story of the Jewish people.
                
"Shimon once said the message of the Jewish people to mankind is that faith and vision will triumph over all adversity," Obama said, adding that "It is a full life, driven by the simple pleasures of family and by big dreams. This is Shimon Peres' life. This is the State of Israel."
                
"We won them all he said of Israel’s wars, but we did not win the greatest victory we aspire to, release from the need to win victories.
                
“For a younger generation Shimon is possibly viewed more as leader of a peace process that never reached its endpoint. He understood this volatile region where Arab youth are taught to hate Israel at an early age… His pursuit of peace was never naive,” Obama said.

<title>Obama loves Israel à la Peres, not Netanyahu</title>
<date>Sat Oct 01 11:43:20 IDT 2016</date>
<content>
President Obama's eulogy for Shimon Peres was a work of love. One didn’t need the funeral to know that the American president was fond of the former Israeli leader: you could see it in his eyes from the first moment they met. But the full extent of Obama’s affection was evident in his moving initial statement upon receiving the news of Peres’ death, in his bold decision to lower U.S. flags to half mast, in his participation in the Jerusalem funeral early on Friday morning at the head of an impressive U.S. delegation and in his exquisite farewell, part political manifesto and part poignant lament. 
It was an ode to an idealized and sanitized version of Peres, for sure, but that’s the way of the world. Obama’s comparison of Peres with Nelson Mandela, for example, was laced with irony. When Mandela was in his second decade in jail on Robben Island in the mid-1970s, Peres was swearing allegiance to the “shared ideals” of Israel and apartheid South Africa and reportedly trying to sell it nuclear weapons. Ten years later, in the midst of his conversion from hawkish to dovish, Peres tried unsuccessfully to cajole Pretoria to release Mandela in a transcontinental prisoner swap that would have included Prisoner of Zion Natan Sharansky. By the time the Oslo Accords were concluded, Mandela was out of prison, Peres was a changed man and the two hit it off famously. It was this latter-day Peres that Obama was eulogizing.
The president drew a stark contrast between Peres and those who “posture or traffic in what’s popular at the moment." He asserted, somewhat naively, that Peres, unlike lesser men, had no more need for polls and sound bytes. Obama didn’t mention the current Israeli prime minister by name, but he didn’t have to. You knew whom he was thinking about, even if he didn’t. Jeffrey Goldberg, who has the president’s mouth, has repeatedly reported how Obama regards Netanyahu as a “political coward” who has the ability to bring about a two-state solution but “is too fearful and politically paralyzed to do so.”  
Obama conveyed a rueful sense of missed opportunity: if only Peres had been the Israeli leader that I engaged with, we could have changed the world. The feeling, of course, is mutual: Netanyahu must also fantasize about the good times that he lost because Mitt Romney wasn’t elected president, leaving him stuck, twice and (hopefully) thrice in a row, with Democratic presidents who couldn’t stand him.
Israel, good and bad
Obama spoke of Peres as a comrade in arms, as one speaks of a dear departed family member and at times, despite the huge gaps between them in years, background and temperament, as an alter ego of himself. “Our friendship was rooted in the fact that I could somehow see myself in his story, and maybe he could see himself in mine,” Obama said. He would never dream of saying that about Netanyahu, of course, despite the fact the two are much closer in age, education, background and embrace of American culture. With Netanyahu, it is a clash of their undistilled core.
It is in this sense, and in this sense alone, that Obama is “anti” Israel, though disdainful might be a better word. He loves the kind of Israel that Peres embodied but detests the one that Netanyahu represents. Obama is a Zionist but his Zionism is imbued with liberal values, embracing “a moral and ethical vision” that he ascribed on Friday to Peres. Peres believed that “human beings should be filled not with fear but with hope," Obama said, striking dread in Netanyahu’s heart. Take away the fear factor, and Netanyahu, the hope-killer, will evaporate into thin air.
Much more than his pursuit of the Iran nuclear deal or a Jewish settlement freeze, it is this differentiation between a “good” Israel and a “bad” Israel that drove Netanyahu and his fans crazy from the day Obama took office. Although the feelings were mutual – Netanyahu, after all, feels the same scorn towards liberal America as Obama does towards rejectionist Israel – the U.S. president’s distinctions were perceived as both a personal insult as well as a political liability. Reluctant to admit to the Israeli public – and possibly to himself as well – that Obama had a personal and ideological problem with him in particular and with his political camp in general, Netanyahu opted to inspire his mindless disciples to paint the U.S. president as a Muslim-loving, anti-Semitic enemy of the Jewish people. It’s not Netanyahu that Obama has a problem with, they claimed, it’s with Israel itself.
Existentialist fight
The fact that Obama had been inspired by American Jewish liberals such as Chicago’s Rabbi Arnold Jacob Wolf didn’t mitigate Netanyahu’s scorn but inflamed it. Netanyahu grew up in a home where Jews with agendas such as Wolf’s were viewed as the worst of the worst, destroyers from within, leftists, as Netanyahu once said, who’ve forgotten what it means to be a Jew. The fact that Obama probably knows more Yiddishkeit than Netanyahu or that he steadfastly and conspicuously marked Passover, Hanukkah, Jewish Heritage Month and other Jewish events more than any previous president meant nothing to Netanyahu’s political camp. If you don’t support settlements, if you utter the words “Tikun Olam," if you’re overly concerned with the plight of the Palestinians, if you dare to compare Jewish suffering with African American travails and declare them both “universal," as Obama did, you’re putting Netanyahu and his nationalist, fundamentalist and restrictionist coalition on notice that they are in your sights, and they react accordingly. Not in kind, but with everything they’ve got: it’s not a conflict of views that Obama has with the hard core Israeli right, but an existentialist fight to the death, as far as they’re concerned. They’re not here to argue with Obama; they’re mostly out to destroy him.
The past few weeks have shown just how craven the relentless eight-year campaign against Obama, inspired by Jerusalem but carried out by Netanyahu’s moneymen and media groupies in America, truly was. By Netanyahu’s own belated testimony, Obama contributed more to Israeli military might than any previous president, concluding his tenure with, love it or loathe it, an extraordinary long-term American commitment to Israel’s security. Peres’ passing then gave the president an opportunity to show skeptical Israelis, drunk with the right-wing’s toxic brew of anti-Obama bile, just how genuine and deeply-felt his commitment to Israel really is. True, Obama’s feelings don’t extend to Netanyahu’s Israel but the same can be said of a large chunk of Israeli society as well.
Obama probably lacks a proper grasp of the Weltanschauung of the Israel that Netanyahu represents and he certainly couldn’t have picked it up at Peres’ funeral. There were no right-wing ministers on hand proposing little apartheid-style Bantustans as a permanent solution, no settler vigilantes uprooting olive trees and shouting “death to the Arabs," no ultra-Orthodox politicians espousing Jewish supremacy or demanding regressive Iran-style legislation and no Netanyahu cabinet ministers or Likud and Habayit Hayehudi parliamentarians explaining how the U.S. president is out to destroy Israel because he wants an independent Palestinian state or believes that diplomacy can contain a nuclear Iran. True, there were no Israeli Arabs there either, but that’s another story altogether.
This is the second time that Obama is capturing Israeli hearts and minds: the first was in his 2013 visit. It happens when he takes the trouble to address the Israeli people directly, rather than through the distortive filters of the prime minister and his spinners. Gifted orator that he is, if Obama devoted more time and effort to presenting his case for a two-state solution to the Israeli people in the first place, he would have had a fighting chance of breaking through. Unlike Netanyahu, however, Obama didn’t deign to get his hands dirty or to appear to be delving in another country’s politics. Perhaps if he had been less aloof, if he had emulated Peres’ indefatigable pursuit of peace and plodded on, regardless of the pushback and pitfalls, Obama’s might have celebrated on Friday the fulfillment of Peres’ dream rather than helplessly marking its burial in the ground beside him.

<title>Roger Waters urges Chemical Brothers to cancel show in Tel Aviv 'hipster bubble'</title>
<date>Fri Nov 04 17:22:16 IST 2016</date>
<content>
British rock star Roger Waters called on the Chemical Brothers this week to cancel their upcoming show in Tel Aviv.
The former Pink Floyd bassist signed an open letter penned by the Artists for Palestine organization telling the electronic music duo that while they may think that playing in Tel Aviv "is a cool thing to do," in fact the city's "hipster vibe is a bubble on the surface of a very deep security state that drove out half the indigenous Palestinian population in 1948 and has no intention of letting their descendants back in."
The Chemical Brothers are set to perform at the Tel Aviv Convention Center on November 12. As of November 3, tickets for the British duo's show were still on sale and the performance was still listed on the band's website.
The open letter was also signed by 10 other British artists, including actress Maxine Peake ("The Theory of Everything") and playwright Caryl Churchill.
In addition to the letter, more than 7,000 people signed a petition urging the Chemical Brothers to withdraw from the show.  
"Artists both on stage and in the media make pious comments about 'peace' and 'coexistence,' whilst hinting that the occupied and occupier should 'live side by side,'" the petition says. "This doesn’t change the fact that artists that are performing in Israel are actually taking part in whitewashing the occupation and apartheid."
Last month, The Chemical Brothers' Ed Simons told the Israeli news site Walla that the band has not been pressured to cancel the show. "We go anywhere young people want to see us playing," he said. "We are not really involved in all the rest."
Also in October, the New York Post reported that American Express pulled out of a $4 million sponsorship of Waters’ 2017 tour in North America following his partisan and anti-Israel rhetoric at the Desert Trip festival that the credit giant sponsored.
Waters had also joined former Pink Floyd members David Gilmour and Nick Mason in supporting the women's flotilla that sought to break the Gaza blockade last month. The flotilla, which sailed from Barcelona, was ultimately intercepted by the Israeli navy off the coast of Gaza. On Facebook, the band said it "stands united in support of the Women of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla, and deplores their illegal arrest and detention in international waters by the Israeli Defense Force."

Attendance is limited to students and young professionals in their 20s & 30s. “Too often, ignorant voices try to equate our conflict with the South African racist policies of the past,” said Jay Shultz of the Tel Aviv International Salon, which organized the series.  “Thankfully, every South African government representative I have had the pleasure to connect with in Israel over the years has been clear that comparing Israeli political realities to South African apartheid is factually and intellectually dishonest.” For more info, visit the Tel Aviv International Salon Facebook page.

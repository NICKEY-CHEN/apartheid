<title>The Zionist Union is the poor man’s Likud</title>
<date>Fri Feb 13 12:17:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
	The election campaign waged by the Zionist Union belies the declarations of its leaders, Yitzhak Herzog and Tzipi Livni, who state their wish to replace the current government. The slogan “It’s us or him” was recently changed to “Only a sucker would vote for Netanyahu,” but the essential message remains unchanged: the problem with the Likud government lies in Benjamin Netanyahu’s personality, not in his destructive policies.
	Livni and Herzog are marketing themselves as people who will do a better job than Netanyahu in carrying out the foreign and defense policies of the Likud, covered in a patina of empty promises such as “we’ll return money to the public” or “free land for an apartment of your own.”
	This week, Herzog and Livni joined right-wing parties in supporting the disqualification of MK Haneen Zoabi (Balad) from running for the Knesset, thus also aligning themselves with the Likud on issues of democracy, respect for minorities and the guaranteeing of freedom of expression. One could argue that this is only a tactic for luring Likud voters who are disenchanted with Netanyahu, but it increasingly seems that the Zionist Union’s tactics are also its strategy.
	The main objective of the right-wing government, led by Netanyahu, Naftali Bennett and Avigdor Lieberman, is the annexation of the West Bank and the consolidation of an apartheid regime in which millions of Palestinians devoid of civil rights live alongside increasing numbers of settlers who conduct themselves as lords of the land.
	A secondary objective is the suppression of the political and communal aspirations of Israel’s Arab citizens. Anyone wishing to replace this government must first of all take a strong stand against the transformation of Israel into an apartheid state, while striving to incorporate its Arab citizens into an egalitarian state. These are the fateful issues facing Israel, not the cost of apartments or pre-school child care.
	On the Zionist Union’s website, the section dealing with ‘political horizons’ promises to “mobilize the world’s support in our combat against terror and our neighbors” — in other words, to manage the conflict with the Arab world better than Netanyahu. Herzog and Livni have even given up on claiming to strive for peace with the Palestinians, implicitly agreeing with Netanyahu and Bennett that there is no partner and that we need to live with (in Bennett’s words) “shrapnel in our backside.” If these are their positions, it’s no wonder that Netanyahu is beating them in opinion polls. People who support Likud policies prefer the original to the poor imitation offered by Herzog and Livni.

<title>The real existential threat to Israel</title>
<date>Wed Mar 04 03:04:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
	Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to the U.S. Congress on Tuesday brought the humbug that has characterized all the candidates in this election to a climax. All of them are ignoring the real existential threat to Israel and its ability to survive as a “Jewish and democratic state”: the unending occupation of the territories. Israel’s insistence on ruling over millions of Palestinians in the West Bank who lack civil rights, expanding the settlements and keeping residents of the Gaza Strip under siege is the danger that threatens its future.
	Israel is mortgaging its national resources to maintain a dual regime of democracy for Jews and apartheid for Palestinians. But the illusion that the occupation is comfortable and quiet, and that most Israelis are isolated from it, is fated to explode.
	In recent years, during which relative security quiet prevailed in the West Bank, Israel embarked on three wars in Gaza that killed thousands of Palestinian civilians – solely in order to maintain the status quo. These periodic “operations,” along with the cessation of negotiations with the Palestinian Authority led by Mahmoud Abbas, have left a moral stain on the Israel Defense Forces, and on the statesmen who sent them into Gaza and on policing missions in Ramallah, Nablus and Hebron.
	Calls for boycotting Israel and recognizing Palestine even without an agreement have moved from the political fringes to center stage in the West. Instead of the Palestinians giving up their national aspirations, Israel is being forced to contend with claims that Zionism and democracy are mutually exclusive.
	During the six years of Netanyahu’s tenure, the occupation’s seepage into the heart of Israel has intensified. Internal tensions between Jews and Arabs have risen, and right-wing parties have vied among themselves in pushing anti-democratic laws designed to institutionalize discrimination against the minority and deprive it of the right of political expression. While Netanyahu was planning his speech in Washington, right-wing thugs attacked MK Haneen Zoabi at a political conference in Ramat Gan. This was the natural continuation of the nation-state bill and the attempts to oust Zoabi and her colleagues from the Knesset, and more proof that democracy has trouble flourishing or even functioning alongside apartheid and military occupation.
	But the current election campaign is being conducted like a Purim carnival. The political parties are ignoring the occupation and its dangers and choosing instead to don masks: Iran, housing prices, personal rivalries. Nobody dares to talk about the conflict with the Palestinians, its heavy price and the necessity of ending it. But topping them all is the prime minister, who wasted the great opportunity and the enormous attention he received on Capitol Hill and didn’t even mention the real danger Israel faces.

<title>Save Meretz, save your soul</title>
<date>Tue Mar 10 06:03:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
	Meretz is at risk of not reaching the electoral threshold. In the last election, it received 176,000 votes. But in the last election, there was no battle over the position of prime minister. This time there is. As a result of a shift by some Meretz voters to Zionist Union, Meretz is expected to get only around 150,000 votes — only 20,000 votes above the minimum — giving it around five Knesset seats instead of the six it has today. If, as in past elections, significantly more Meretz supporters switch to Zionist Union at the last moment “to save the homeland,” the homeland will suffer.
	The size of the biggest party is critical this time, but if four Knesset seats are “lost” because Meretz fails to pass the vote threshold, there will be no electoral upset. It’s cut and dried. Therefore, supporters of both Meretz and the Joint List — who were justifiably appalled by the alliance of Arab parties’ separatist error of refusing a surplus-votes agreement with Meretz — must see to it that Meretz exceeds the threshold, for the sake of the upset.
	The importance of Meretz in achieving the upset goes hand in hand with what it would mean for the party to miss the threshold: Imagine the crowing of Baruch Marzel the Kahanist and others of his ilk, and it’s clear that must not be permitted.
	But anyone who says the size of the biggest party doesn’t matter this time is wrong. Size does matter, in this election. When one side has 61 true supporters in the Knesset — a simple majority — it’s the bloc that counts. This time, neither does. There will be fewer than 50 MKs to the left of Zionist Union head Isaac Herzog, and even fewer to the right of Prime Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud. That means the government will be decided by the centrist parties, according to the results for the big parties. If Herzog and Netanyahu are close, Netanyahu might stay in power. But if Herzog has a significant lead, there will be an upset. That lead will allow the centrist parties that aren’t crazy about Netanyahu, starting with Moshe Kahlon’s Kulanu, to join a Herzog-led government.
	This time it’s possible: The desire not to vote for Netanyahu is enormous. All that’s needed is for everyone who wants an upset to vote for Herzog.
	If I were the brother of Yesh Atid head Yair Lapid, or even Yair himself, I’d vote for Herzog. Anyone recognizing the existential importance of the upset must do so. Lapid won’t sit in a Netanyahu government, but he would be a key cabinet member under Herzog.
	A too-big Yesh Atid would also hinder the upset, which will be mathematically impossible without the ultra-Orthodox parties. When Herzog wins, the Haredim will gladly join his coalition and take over Habayit Hayehudi’s footholds in the rabbinate.
	After former Mossad chief Meir Dagan’s speech at Saturday’s rally in Tel Aviv, this point is surely clear to all. Anyone who remained dry-eyed at the sound of this Israeli hero’s choked voice has a heart of stone.
	Dagan came from the right. He was with Ariel Sharon during “Arik’s” right-wing days. In Gaza. In Lebanon. He grabbed a grenade with his bare hands. He also killed with his hands. When Dagan tears up talking about his grandfather in the Holocaust and pleads, “just not apartheid,” any non-messianist who fails to join the regime-change campaign surely has no soul. The only possible ballots for the upset are Zionist Union or Meretz.
	Historically, the military establishment is nearly always to the right of the political leaders, ready to attack. Only in rare cases, that end in apocalypse, does the military find itself to the left of the government. That’s what happens in messianic eras.
	More than 95 percent of Israel’s top brass has joined the regime-change campaign. With the exception of his own government appointees, almost none have stayed with Netanyahu.
	Given these circumstances, if there is no upset there will be a lot of crying. Anyone who fails to enlist in the effort will bear responsibility for destroying the dreams of future generations. The weakness and cowardice of anyone who fails to call out, loud and clear, “Choose Herzog and an upset,” because of a professional friendship with the Lapid-Ofer Shelah gang, shall never be forgiven.
	When Dagan weeps, a rain of upset ballots should follow. This is no time for hesitation or idle chatter. Either you help Meretz pass the threshold or you vote for Herzog. There is no other choice. If even one person who wants an upset to stop the extremism votes Lapid, heaven will have no mercy on us.

<title>Violence doesn't erase the legitimacy of grievances – in Baltimore, Tel Aviv or the West Bank</title>
<date>Thu May 07 15:15:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
	Last weekend, Ethiopian Israelis — enraged by police brutality, racial discrimination and state neglect — threw stones, bottles and chairs at Israeli police, injuring 56. In response, Israeli leaders condemned the violence while acknowledging the grievances that had sparked it. “We must look directly at this open wound — we have erred, we did not look, and we did not listen enough,” declared President Reuven Rivlin. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that, “We must all line up against racism, condemn it and work to eradicate it.” He pledged to convene a committee to work on the problems Ethiopian Israelis face in education, housing and employment.
	In the United States last week, when Baltimore erupted in flames after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, political elites responded the same way. Hillary Clinton insisted that, “The violence has to stop.” But she also said, “There is something profoundly wrong when African-American men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than are meted out to their white counterparts.” 
	Illegitimate means do not erase legitimate grievances. Leaders can condemn violence while still acknowledging, and working to overcome, the injustice that helps fuel it. When the perpetrators committing the violence are Ethiopian Israelis or African-Americans, the distinction seems obvious. So why it is so hard for the Israeli government and its defenders to grasp when the perpetrators are Palestinian? Why can’t Israeli leaders condemn Palestinian violence without using that violence to excuse Israel’s unjust and undemocratic control of the West Bank?
	I can already hear the objections. Hamas rocket attacks or suicide bombings are worse than throwing bottles in Tel Aviv or burning a CVS in Baltimore. That’s true. But the point is that denying people basic rights doesn’t become OK because some people respond to that denial in violent, even grotesque ways. In South Africa in the 1980s, supporters of Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress forced alleged government informants to wear rubber tires filled with gasoline, and then set them on fire. In 1986, Mandela’s then-wife, Winnie, declared that, “With our boxes of matches and our necklaces we shall liberate this country.” The practice was hideously barbaric. But it didn’t make apartheid any less wrong. (No, I’m not arguing that Israel is the equivalent of apartheid South Africa, only that an immoral response to injustice doesn’t justify that injustice).
	Besides, even when Palestinian violence is more equivalent to the violence that broke out in Baltimore and Tel Aviv — when West Bank teenagers throw rocks at Israeli troops, for instance — the Israeli government’s defenders still seize on it to delegitimize Palestinian grievances. Last year, the Israel Defense Force’s English-language webpage published a blog post entitled, “What ‘Non-Violent’ Palestinian Protests Really Looks Like.” It declared that, “As Israeli soldiers do their best to keep the region secure, Palestinians throw rocks in unprovoked attacks against IDF forces.”  Rock-throwing is wrong. But calling people who have lived for almost a half-century under military law and without free movement, citizenship or the right to vote for the government that controls their lives “unprovoked” is absurd. When Ethiopians threw rocks in Tel Aviv, Rivlin didn’t call their actions “unprovoked.” To the contrary, he condemned the violence while chastising his own government for not addressing the grievances underlying it. Yet the rioters in Tel Aviv enjoy Israeli citizenship, due process of law, the right to vote and the right to travel freely. They have, in other words, been far less provoked than the Palestinian rock throwers whose plight elicits no sympathy from the Israeli government at all.
	Another objection might be that the African-American rioters in Baltimore weren’t trying to destroy the United States, nor were the Ethiopian rioters in Tel Aviv trying to destroy Israel. Hamas, by contrast, seeks to eliminate Israel as a Jewish state. The difference, in other words, isn’t the type of violence used; it’s the outcome sought. But this misses the point too. First, not all Palestinian violence is aimed at eliminating Israel. Yes, Hamas doesn’t recognize Israel’s right to exist. But Marwan Barghouti, a key orchestrator of the second intifada, is on record calling for “a Palestinian state, whose capital is East Jerusalem, and which coexists in peace with Israel.” http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/05/marwan-barghouti-fatah-palestine.html
 More fundamentally, the fact that people use violence in service of an immoral political agenda still doesn’t delegitimize the grievances underlying it. Malik Zulu Shabazz, one of the organizers of the protests that turned violent in Baltimore, has a history of blatant anti-Semitism. But that doesn’t make police brutality in Baltimore any less unjust. Hamas is even more anti-Semitic than Shabazz. But that doesn’t make it any less unjust that Israel makes leaving Gaza almost impossible, even for relatives seeking to attend a funeral or wedding. 
	After the riots of the summer of 1967, Martin Luther King quoted the French novelist Victor Hugo as saying, “If a soul is left in the darkness, sins will be committed. The guilty one is not he who commits the sin, but he who causes the darkness.” Determining who causes the darkness, of course, is not simple. In Gaza, Israel creates darkness by denying ordinary Palestinians the right to leave and Hamas creates darkness by spreading its hateful ideology. But King’s point was that when people respond to injustice in violent, even vile, ways, people in power must address not only the violence, but the injustice as well. When African Americans or Ethiopian Israelis perpetrate violence, that’s not a particularly controversial point. But when it comes to Palestinians, Israeli leaders and their American allies apply a very different standard: Unless Palestinians emulate Ghandi, they have no legitimate grievances at all.

<title>Stop whining. Long live Israel's new and honest government</title>
<date>Sun May 10 02:33:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
The 34th government will deserve Israel; Israel will deserve the 34th government. This is an authentic and representative government, the true manifestation of the spirit of the times and the deepest feelings of most Israelis. It will be a true government, without pretense, without makeup and without self-justification. What we’ll see is what we’ll get. Welcome to the fourth Benjamin Netanyahu government.
They won’t talk haughtily and they won’t spout hollow slogans. Not about peace and not about human rights; not about two states and not about negotiations; not about international law, justice or equality. The truth will be thrust in the faces of Israelis and the world. And the truth is this: The two-state solution is dead (it was never born), the Palestinian state will not arise, international law does not apply to Israel, the occupation will continue to crawl quickly toward annexation, annexation will continue to crawl quickly toward an apartheid state; “Jewish” supersedes “democratic,” nationalism and racism will get the government stamp of approval, but they’re already here and have been for a long time.
Neither Netanyahu, nor Habayit Hayehudi’s chairman MK Naftali Bennett nor that party’s faction members MK Ayelet Shaked and MK Eli Ben-Dahan, started this whole thing. They only expedited things. And there should be no shock or outrage, no bewailing the bitterness of fate. This government is a government of continuation, not a government of change.
True, some of its members are more extreme than their predecessors, but that is mainly about rhetorical differences. Even the most inflammatory appointment, of Shaked as justice minister, which reverberated throughout the world over the weekend, is less revolutionary than it seems. Shaked is blunt and violent, whereas Zionist Union MK Tzipi Livni, her predecessor, was delicate and proper. But Justice Minister Shaked will not have to work hard to break open cracks in our democracy; they opened a long time ago.
The best test of the nature of the regime in Israel is the test of the occupation and the war crimes: the foundations of apartheid are already deep and the war crimes remain uninvestigated. From her office in the heart of occupied Jerusalem, Livni has not made Israel more just in that respect. True, Shaked’s ideas are more nationalistic and her understanding of the essence of democracy is nil. True, many in the world were shocked that a person who identified with one of the most violent articles ever written here against the Palestinian people (by Uri Elitzur), was appointed minister of Israeli justice. But there’s no place for such sanctimoniousness. Elitzur expressed what many people are thinking.
The appointment of another racist, Eli Ben-Dahan, as deputy defense minister, responsible for the Civil Administration, should not be earth-shattering either. True, Ben-Dahan said that “the Palestinians are animals, they are not human” – but don’t these statements reflect the true attitude of many Israelis? Ben-Dahan will speak for them. That is how Israel has been treating the Palestinians for almost 50 years; Ben-Dahan is only saying things overtly. Now he will be responsible for the Civil Administration and the whole system of “humanitarian gestures” will be torn up. Ben-Dahan is the right man in the right place at the right time. An excellent appointment.
A person who proudly says “I killed masses of Arabs” and calls them “shrapnel in the buttocks” will be education minister – and who in Israel doesn’t think that? The general of Operation Cast Lead, with its crimes, the man who contravened building restrictions, Yoav Galant, will be construction minister. Is that not a fine appointment? MK Uri Maklev of United Torah Judaism is to head the Knesset Science Committee? Does that not correctly reflect the attitude of some Israelis to science?
Stop whining. Maybe Israel’s shadow government should be more enlightened, but not its real government. It is what the Israelis chose, it reflects their true stands. And so, long live the new government.

<title>Just say no to the censorship of culture in Israel</title>
<date>Wed May 20 06:00:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
When it was announced that Miri Regev was to be the culture and sports minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s fourth government, some people made jibes about her suitability for the position, based on her reputation as a loud and inflammatory politician who sees the world in clear terms of good and pure (us) and evil and impure (the entire world, including groups in Israel that don’t think “as we do.”)
In her remarks immediately before taking office, Regev reinforced her image as someone with a simplistic view of reality who lacks a comprehension of basic concepts in the areas for which she is responsible.
Regev praised Israeli society as a “large variety of subcultures, colors, sounds and styles that together create the unique Israeli experience that is our glue, which unites and strengthens us.” In the name of pluralism, Regev promised that during her term in office, culture would come to “all parts of Israel,” including “Judea and Samaria.” But “pluralism” means, first and foremost, the ability to include — and even encourage – sounds, styles and above all “opinions” — which are absent from the variety noted by Regev —– that deviate from the “glue” and challenge the cluster of “us.”
The new minister went on to say that “in the name of that pluralism I won’t lend a hand to undermining the image of the State of Israel, Israel Defense Forces soldiers or the state’s heritage as a Jewish and democratic state.” The image of the State of Israel, IDF soldiers or the state’s heritage as a Jewish and democratic state are damaged every day — not by state-sponsored cultural institutions that sometimes present controversial plays, but by the policies of the Israeli government, the reality of occupation that forces those soldiers to deal with difficult moral challenges and creates de facto apartheid, the religious bureaucracy that controls civil society, corruption that has become the norm and the ultranationalist and racist trends in Israeli society itself. If anything, the liberal local culture is a successful ambassador for the state.
The value of cultural activity is measured by its willingness to examine and to shatter images, both genuine and fasle, out of freedom of thought and of expression. That is how culture differs from propaganda, which is also under Regev’s authority.
Upon taking office, Regev said, “if it is necessary to censor, I will censor.” A culture minister who believes “it is necessary to censor” and is willing to do so is a fearful thing to contemplate, and the worry is that she could do great damage to her domain.

<title>Segregated buses are only the tip of the occupation's iceberg</title>
<date>Wed May 20 00:15:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
The fact that a plan to segregate Jews and Palestinians on buses in the territories has now been frozen admittedly brings a sigh of relief. But it’s impossible to conclude from this that Israeli policies in the territories are free of moral shame and disgrace.
This impression is strengthened by what Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon, who proposed the plan, said on Wednesday: that he has no intention of canceling it. Ya’alon’s claim that the plan is meant to serve security needs is unconvincing. That’s because it was drafted first and foremost to appease the settlers, who wanted not to have to share buses with Palestinians.
Segregation on buses has great symbolic power: It recalls the trauma of racism against blacks in the United States and South Africa. Therefore, removing it from the agenda was important to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, because he didn’t want to cause a global outcry.
A move so blatantly racist would have sparked harsh criticism of Israel’s policy of occupation, and the world would have understood this decision in the only way it could be understood – that Israel had decided to institute an apartheid regime in the territories.
But despite the fact that this insane decision has been iced, it’s clear that segregated buses are just the tip of the iceberg. Beneath this visible tip lies an established policy of separation, anchored in the very foundations of Israel’s rule over the territories. This rule stipulates freedom of movement for Jews but restrictions for Palestinians; permits for houses only in specific communities, rather than an egalitarian permit system based on just and fair criteria; eligibility for social benefits and welfare services for one side only; dispossession of the other side from its lands; and of course, different legal systems for people who live in the same territory, including different court systems, different punishments and more.
Segregated buses attract attention that the daily practices of the occupation don’t manage to attract. For instance, the dispossession of Palestinians from the village of Sussia in the South Hebron Hills, which was recently approved by the High Court of Justice, hasn’t sparked an outcry similar to that sparked by the bus plan, even though it is tainted with the same injustice.
Thanks to the ostensibly temporary nature of the occupation, the international community assists the Israeli segregation regime by averting its eyes. Such injustices would not be viewed with understanding if they were directed at Jews anywhere in the world. Moreover, the expansion of the settlements and the strength of their supporters in recent governments prove that the occupation is far from ending. Therefore, it must be treated as a permanent intrusion.
And the defense minister’s dangerous plans must be rejected immediately.

Liberal Zionism has been voted out
In response to “Government on a flight to nowhere” by Ari Shavit and “Herzog is no leader” by Gideon Levy (Opinion, May 21).
Ari Shavit wrote about the disaster that befell Zionism with the swearing in of the worst government in our history, which features the most right-wing ministers ever. On the same day, Gideon Levy wrote about the weakest opposition ever, led by a man with no leadership ability. Shavit laments Zionism and Levy laments democracy and the hope for peace. They’re both right.
Despite this, they should make their claims to Benjamin Netanyahu or Isaac Herzog. The latter was elected by his party members, and as long as he doesn’t exhibit the kind of failure that would warrant resignation (see the Carmel forest fire), his continuing to serve in his post is a party matter. On the other hand, Netanyahu was chosen by the people. His policy, and his government’s policy, faithfully reflect the will of the public. For a few of us, this choice constitutes the extinction of the Zionist idea, but it is the right of the people to choose as they see fit.
It could be that the idea of liberal Zionism, championed by a good many since the days of Ahad Ha’am, is nothing more than an illusion, and like Antony Lerman wrote in the New York Times last year, perhaps Zionism today is xenophobia and extremist nationalism, achieving its goals by colonization and racism. If that is truly the will of the people in Zion, they have the right to carry out that policy. U.S. Congress has been bought on this issue by American Jewish money, and Europe is indifferent. When the final bill comes, we will have no one but ourselves to present our claims to.
The Israeli left will continue its impossible struggle, and not only to be able to say “we had no part in this.” I would be very happy to be proven wrong.
Prof. Aharon Eviatar, Hofit
 
This is not apartheid 
In response to “Apartheid is about more than buses” (Opinion, Aeyal Gross, May 26).
The issue of Palestinians traveling on separate buses has nothing to do with apartheid and everything to do with security. Do I really want to travel on the same bus as a potential murderer? The number of attacks by Arabs on Jews by ramming them with their cars is on the increase, so why should we put ourselves in danger by traveling on the same buses with them?
Come to think of it, why don’t we put up a wall separating us from them, they stay on their side we stay on our side. Oh, we did that. Why don’t we extend the idea and make it permanent? It’s called the two-state solution.

Outrage over Belgian academics’ boycott call
Collectif Dialogue & Partage, a Belgian organization that for years has been fighting for a true dialogue between Jews and Muslims as well as between Israelis and Palestinians, is absolutely outraged by the petition of Belgian academics in favor of a boycott of Israeli universities and artists. Boycott as a weapon was used in the 1930s against Jews by the Nazis, then (and that time rightly) against South Africa during apartheid and now against Israel. Boycott has never been imposed on Vladimir Putin’s Russia after the invasion of Crimea nor against China, which simply absorbed Tibet decades ago, nor against any of the bloody dictatorships all over the world. Boycott is used against people not for what they do, but for what they are. One of the most shocking aspects of this boycott is that it targets institutions where you find the largest number of people who fight for peace.

<title>Europe must  not back down from labeling West Bank settlement products</title>
<date>Tue Jun 09 01:21:00 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
The most important statement about the European Union’s potential decision to label settlement products was actually made by Dani Dayan, a former leader of the Yesha Council of settlements who still works to promote the settlement enterprise in the occupied territories. In a conversation with Nir Baram, Dayan related that a U.S. State Department official once told him, “For years we perceived you as agents of Israeli government policy, but suddenly we realized that you are the autonomous one and the Israeli government is the agent of your policy.”
Indeed, the settlement enterprise has succeeded in taking over Israeli politics. Dayan also explained why he isn’t worried about an EU boycott on settlement products: It “won’t make much difference – because the settlement enterprise is not based on industrial zones, but on the number of inhabitants. And that number is rising all the time. Bear in mind: when all is said and done, that is the only consistent trend.”
Anyone who thinks the settlement enterprise is illegitimate and causing Israel to lose its own legitimacy must be pleased that Israel was compelled to accept a committee under the auspices of FIFA (the world soccer federation), which, among other things, will discuss the question of whether soccer teams from the settlements can legitimately play in Israeli leagues.
The EU’s plan to publish guidelines for labeling settlement products should also be viewed favorably. Any international move that makes it clear to Israel that this “consistent trend” of growth in the number of settlers is destructive to Israel itself bolsters the chance that, someday, Israel will also have a government that understands this.
The EU must not back down. It has considerable power, because it helps finance the Palestinian Authority through its donations. And the time may soon come when it has to decide whether this financing effectively enables Israel’s diplomatic rejectionism.
It’s convenient for the right to claim that the pressure to boycott Israel stems from anti-Semitism rather than opposition to its insistence on continuing the settlement enterprise and its refusal to make progress, in good faith, on an agreement with the Palestinians. But this is a fundamentally false claim that is meant to mobilize Israelis to defend the settlements. It’s true that one goal of the BDS movement is to return the Palestinian refugees to Israel. But it’s also clear that this isn’t the goal of serious players worldwide that are beginning to lose patience with the Israeli delusion: on the one hand, its desire to belong to the world’s advanced democracies; on the other, its insistence on keeping the Palestinians under an apartheid regime.
The response by opposition leaders was especially disappointing. Instead of claiming there’s no left and right when it comes to boycotts, divestment and sanctions, opposition leaders Isaac Herzog, Tzipi Livni and Yair Lapid should have explained to the public that the prime minister’s policy, throughout his years in office, is what has turned many people worldwide against Israel, and that this policy is leading Israel itself to disaster.

<title>Israeli justice minister's goal: Weakening democracy</title>
<date>Thu Aug 06 01:01:30 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked plans to reexamine the possibility of splitting the attorney general’s role into two: a general counsel whose job is solely to act as chief legal adviser to the government; and head of the public prosecution system.
Shaked’s intentions are cause for concern. Her idea isn’t new. It has been raised in recent years by Daniel Friedman and Yaakov Neeman, two justice ministers whose terms were marked by their efforts to undermine the most vital element of democracy – the separation of powers – and to weaken the judicial authority and rule of law.
Splitting the attorney general’s post is clearly a move to damage the rule of law. The attorney general’s combined duties today ensure comprehensive protection for the rule of law, both because the government’s actions are subject to the law and because steps are taken against those who break it. If the post is split and the attorney general decides, for example, that some government act isn’t legal, while whoever heads the prosecution agrees to defend that act in court, the advisory capacity to the government will in fact be obliterated.
The High Court of Justice highlighted just how important the attorney general’s post is in a detailed ruling laying the foundations of Israeli democracy: “The attorney general’s opinion on a legal matter reflects, for the government, the existing, current legal situation,” it stated, adding, “The government and its authorities’ position regarding the existing law is determined by the attorney general.”
The court made clear that the attorney general and his representatives are not “advisers” in the standard sense of the word, and that “their opinion is binding to the government.”
The Shamgar Commission, which looked into the attorney general’s position following the 1997 Roni Bar-On/Hebron affair, also examined splitting the attorney general’s duties. Retired Justice Meir Shamgar said at the time, “Splitting the duties will weaken both of the position’s divisions and generate a worse reality than the one we know.”
The justice minister’s intention to consider weakening the attorney general’s position – and, in reality, weakening the one whose job is to protect the rule of law – must also be seen as part of the intention of the political wing the minister represents to weaken Israeli democracy in general.
One would have thought the ideological differences between right and left regarding state affairs could be debated and determined with both sides strictly preserving democratic principles. This is how things were when the right wing was headed by Menachem Begin. But things have changed. Maintaining the status quo of occupation and apartheid, and the refusal to advance a peace agreement leading to a Palestinian state, are creating a blatantly undemocratic situation in the territories occupied and controlled by Israel.
In these circumstances, a strong attorney general who insists that the government act legally will become a hindrance.

<title>Letters to the Editor: Come home, Sayed </title>
<date>Mon Sep 07 01:29:25 IDT 2015</date>
<content>
Come home, Sayed
I tried, I really tried, to find a way of contacting you in person, but I didn’t manage to, so I hope you read this.
I’m so sorry you decided to give up, or so it seems. Left behind are me and tens of thousands of readers who took so much pride in and gained so much hope from your columns, waiting each week to read your/our thoughts on the life of every Arab in this country.
All of a sudden you decided to leave. I don’t wish to interfere in your private decisions, but Sayed – you’re no longer a private citizen. You’re a well-liked public figure, an author and screenwriter and, yes, a source of national pride. For me and many others like me you were and are a kind of power and strength of the better kind, eloquent as only you can be. You caused me and my friends to walk around with our heads held high.
You left. Since then I’ve reflected on whether maybe this isn’t the right place for me and my family as well. But for now I’m staying, since there is no better place to raise children than in one’s homeland. But I’m a bit angry with you, like a brother I found who then abandoned me. I think as you do but I don’t have the talent you have to express what I feel. I found my dreams in your writing. When you stopped believing it would be good here, I started having doubts as well.
You were never afraid of writing what you thought and felt, but your battles here aren’t over yet. You were the one who blazed the trail, and every week I’m the first to read your columns from America. How I pray that you write me from here, from your home.
Let’s meet at Mohammed’s barber shop. I don’t need a haircut and don’t walk around in shorts, but for you I’m willing to do that, and more. Just come back.

If this is apartheid ...
In response to “Why Israel is an apartheid state” (Opinion, Roy Isacowitz, September 6.)
In his counter to Benjamin Pogrund’s article, Roy Isacowitz points out that Israeli actions over the years may fit with definitions of apartheid according to a UN statute. The rest is not, as he claims, “just semantics.” Like Israel, many countries in western Europe, Asia and the Americas may also fall under the apartheid statutes when they committed and continue to commit racially inspired “inhumane acts“ against refugees trying to find safer havens in their countries. Moreover, to claim that Israeli governments undertake “systematic oppression and domination of other racial groups“ in order to “maintain their regime” is apparent nonsense, given the comparatively benign state of affairs between Israel’s Jews and the other racial groups (e.g. Palestinian Arabs, Druze or Circassians) within the Green Line.
The fact that Palestinian opposition to the state has been largely violent, both before and ever since the UN partition resolution was approved in 1948, also has some bearing on Israel’s repressive counter-actions. Isacowitz’s hysterical description of Israel’s leadership as “a fanatical cult bent on ultimate glory or suicide” gives his formal blessing to the many Arab nations and Iran, which are still actively trying to remove the legitimacy of the state, rather than encourage a negotiated settlement.
Finally it is his kind of biased outbursts that unfortunately drive the saner elements in the Israeli electorate away from voting for left-wing parties that might conceivably lead us out of the current mess. Less extreme self-flagellation, more reasoned arguments and reasonable actions are the only way forward.

<title>Netanyahu's apartheid vision for Israel's future</title>
<date>Thu Oct 29 06:39:29 IST 2015</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented his current political vision to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee this week. While saying that that he does not want a binational state, Netanyahu stressed that Israel “must control the entire area for the foreseeable future.” He explained that he was prepared to divide the land but “the other side is unwilling,” and that the Middle East is subject to Islamic religious influences that preclude any possibility for peace. 
On the face of it, this position does not seem extremist. It’s accepted by most Israeli Jews, according to multiple surveys that have been conducted over the last 15 years, ever since the Camp David summit. Most people support the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, but believe that it is not practical since there is “no partner” on the other side. The same majority, including Netanyahu, opposes the notion of a binational state with equal rights for all its citizens, Jews and Palestinians alike.
Netanyahu has cleaved to this line for his entire tenure: Verbal consent to dividing the land – which distinguishes him from the extreme right and from settler leaders – while in practice adopting policies that thwart the realization of such partitioning. He has consistently refused to talk about future borders with the Palestinians, demanding that they recognize Israel as “a Jewish state,” developing and expanding settlements across the West Bank and presenting Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas as an enemy and instigator to violence. 
In the real world, outside the realm of speechmaking, Netanyahu is only ready to hold empty and aimless talks with the Palestinians, or to discuss “small steps to reduce tension,” without relinquishing any control on the ground. 
His words this week acknowledged Israel’s total domination over the territories, discarding the dual pretense of a “temporary war-like situation,” which the state has regularly presented to the High Court of Justice for decades, and the pretense of a Palestinian Authority supposedly enjoying autonomy in managing Palestinian affairs, as Israel likes to present things.
Netanyahu’s opposition to a binational state leads to a clear conclusion: As long as “Israel’s control of the area” continues, millions of Palestinians in the territories will remain in the inferior status of subjects devoid of civil rights. Their settler neighbors, meanwhile, enjoy such rights unhampered. 
The regime described in Netanyahu’s vision has a name – it’s called apartheid. There is no other term for two populations living in the same area, one with political rights and the other under perennial military occupation. No security argument or warnings about the effects of Islam can whitewash the implications of this vision. Netanyahu’s words should shock anyone who is concerned about the justice of Israel’s cause and the country’s future. Concerned people should unite and form a national salvation front that will work to replace this government.

<title>Bill Maher: Islamophobe or one of the last true liberals?</title>
<date>Thu Nov 26 14:00:00 IST 2015</date>
<content>
Bill Maher finished the 13th season of his HBO show ‘Real Time’ with a bang this past weekend. Currently one of the most controversial, if not most hated, men in America, Maher is often referred to as arrogant, smug and profane - and that's by people who like his show. A dyed-in-the-wool liberal, who gave Obama $1 million in 2012 and works to flip Republican-held Congressional seats to the benefit of Democrat contenders, Maher in the past year has become a target of liberal anger, who have often called him xenophobic, a pseudo-intellectual and a bigot.
Maher is no stranger to controversy. His first late night comedy show, 'Politically Incorrect', was cancelled in 2002 after he disagreed with President George W. Bush’s assertion that the 9/11 hijackers were “cowards.” He came back to the airwaves unshackled a year later with 'Real Time' on HBO, attracting A-list celebrities and politicians (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been a regular guest) to his weekly panel where he discusses and satirizes the news to a live studio audience and over a million cable viewers.
In this final episode, Maher focused his commentary and comedy on ISIS, Islam and the Syrian refugee controversy.  Maher discussed a new opinion poll showing a majority of Americans believe the values of Syrian refugees seeking asylum are at odds with their own, noted, ‘“If you are in this religion, you probably do have values that are at odds. This is what liberals do not want to recognize. You may be from a country—as there are many, many Muslim countries—that either have Sharia law or want Sharia law. Those values are not our values.” (His comments are backed up by research from the Pew Research Center whose 2013 poll found that overwhelming percentages of Muslims in many countries want Islamic law (sharia) to be the official law of the land where they live).
This line of reasoning has been grabbing Maher headlines and ratings since October 2014, when, with author Sam Harris (the 'New Atheism' advocate) at his side, he tussled live on air with Hollywood star Ben Affleck.
During the exchange Harris asserted that Islam is “the motherlode of bad ideas,” while Maher exclaimed that Islam is the only religion that acts like the mafia, “that will f--king kill you if you say the wrong thing, draw the wrong picture, or write the wrong book.” To which, Affleck, getting visibly upset, shot back, denouncing Maher’s take as “gross” and ”racist.’” "It's like saying, 'you shifty Jew!'" he declared.

Maher’s critics accuse him of simplistic generalizations that amount to racism. On CNN, Reza Aslan slammed Maher, saying that on religion he is not very “sophisticated in the way he thinks,” noting that Maher makes broad generalizations about the planet’s 1.6 billion Muslims based on the acts of a few. “We're using two or three examples to justify a generalization. That's actually the definition of bigotry."
For his part, Maher responds to these critics, many of whom sit across from him during his show, with the simple refutation that: “I’m not demonizing, I’m just reporting! We’re saying the ideas need to be changed.” In his own defense Maher attempts to separate individual Muslims from the practices of Islam; he time and again asserts he is not talking about all Muslims, but is criticizing instead the ideas within Islam that go against ‘universal liberal values' – standing up for the rights of women, gays, apostates, democracy, and his favorite - freedom of speech. 
A voice like Maher’s has been seen on the American left before in the face of an existential threat. In 1949, historian Arthur Schlesinger coined the term ‘doughfaced progressives’ to label those on the left that he saw as soft on emerging communist totalitarianism, either because they felt sympathetic to its underlying ideology or because they believed that progressivism required the tolerance of otherness. Schlesinger dubbed these doughfaced progressives “democratic men who support totalitarian principles.” Schlesinger, the proto-Maher, fought within the American left at the beginning of the Cold War for liberals to address Soviet communism for what it was – illiberal. 
In the aftermath of the Paris terror attacks, John Kerry stirred controversy that fed straight into Maher’s argument about liberal America’s blind spots, or lack of courage. Kerry was quoted as saying that it was possible to find “legitimacy” or “a rationale” behind the January 2015 attacks on Charlie Hebdo (which openly satirized the prophet Mohammed) as opposed to the most recent attacks in Paris which were in Kerry's words “absolutely indiscriminate.”
The night of the Paris attacks, Maher happened to be taping live and in an interview with Muslim feminist author Asra Nomani. They both urged liberals in America to wake up. “How could liberals, who stood for black people getting to go to college in the 60’s and then when I was in college they were protesting apartheid in South Africa… How can they not stand up against sharia law, which is the law in so many Muslim countries, which is a law of oppression?”
Exactly where Maher falls in the divide between bigot and truly enlightened, it's hard to say. Bill Maher, as a devout atheist, slams all religions. Having been raised Catholic, despite having a Jewish mother, Maher left his faith at a young age and has since been poking religion in the eye, exposing its hypocrisies and every week, to his HBO audience, has been calling out religious believers for holding 'fairy tales' above science and fact.
Is Bill Maher bigoted against Islam? I don’t think so. He takes broad aim at Islam as an ideology (which certainly does leave him open to intellectual criticism), and just like someone who has factual, value-based disagreements with capitalism or communism or any other ideology that governs people’s way of life, it is perfectly legitimate to criticize and make a case for why an ideology contains bad, damaging ideas.  (When it comes to Mormonism however, a faith he refuses even to acknowledge as a religion and likes to simply call “stupid,” Maher might be a bit of a bigot, but that’s another story.)
Maher has undoubtedly made an enemy of the PC left on this issue; Steven Colbert and Maher got into a heated exchange on Colbert's late-night show last week, after Colbert berated Maher for his willingness to leave no joke untouched. "Bill, they say at a dinner party you should never talk about sex, politics or religion. Have you ever been invited to a dinner party in your life?" To which, Maher retorted, "I probably wouldn't be invited to your dinner party." The exchange deteriorated quickly from there with Colbert concluding, “My religion teaches me humility in face of this kind of attack,” before switching to ‘safer’ topics.
At the end of last year, Maher was disinvited from giving the commencement address at UC Berkeley after 6,000 students signed a petition to that effect.  Maher eventually gave the address amid protests, in which he began by saying, "C'mon, it's Berkeley. I think I can speak freely here. I mean, I hope I can."
The same day that Maher finished his season, Pew published a survey showing that 40% of Millennials agree with censoring speech offensive to minorities, an all-too real exemplar of the PC culture inundating America that Maher has so long fought against. It's just too bad Maher didn't have one more episode left to make a joke, or ten, about that finding.

<title>Musicians: Boycotting Israel fans the flames of conflict</title>
<date>Thu Nov 26 14:45:48 IST 2015</date>
<content>
On November 17th, Vice published a piece by Brian Eno and Ohal Grietzer calling for musicians to boycott Israel "until Palestinians are free." The piece is the latest attempt by the boycott divestment sanctions movement, also known as BDS, to gain legitimacy by preying on musicians’/artists’ natural affinity for those perceived as victimized, and appealing to a call for “human rights” for the Palestinians.
While we have sympathy for all of those that are downtrodden, unfortunately, these musicians and artists have fallen prey to a narrative that is filled with untruths and distortions and that has its basis in the BDS movement's lack of support of ‘two states for two peoples’. Indeed, the boycott movement's founder and other central BDS leaders have said "they oppose a Jewish State in any of part of Palestine," and their definition of Palestine includes all of Israel.
Let's address some of the familiar accusations and examine why they don't hold water.
The first accusation is that Israel is an "apartheid" state. Anyone who has been to Israel knows that it is a western style democracy (indeed the only one in the region) and by definition cannot be considered "apartheid." Arabs make up approximately 20 percent of the citizens living within Israel and have always had the right to vote, and the right to a free press. Further, Arab Israelis serve in Israel's parliament (the Knesset) and serve in Israel's court system. Indeed one of the judges who convicted former Israeli President Katsav was George Karra, an Arab Israeli. 
Just as America grapples with Ferguson and charges of racial discrimination, there may be instances of injustice to Arabs that occur in Israel. However to try to brand Israel as an “apartheid” state is simply untrue and libelous. It is also important to note that Arabs living in the West Bank are governed by the Palestinian Authority, while Arabs living in Gaza are governed by Hamas.
Further inflammatory language used by Eno includes charges that the Palestinians are the areas only "indigenous people" and have been "ethnically cleansed."  It doesn't require much study of history to know the Jews have a long history of living in Israel, including having Jewish populations not just in Jerusalem, but in many cities claimed by the Palestinians (Hebron, Jaffa, and others). The term “ethnically cleansed” is patently false and inflammatory.
Perhaps most troubling is the timing of this piece and of the call for boycotting Israel when terrorism is striking at western democracies around the world.
Why is it acceptable to only blame one side in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and fail to question why Palestinians have rejected various peace offers dating from 1948 to the more recent offer of former Prime Minister Olmert? Why is it acceptable for Palestinians and their leadership to take no responsibility for inciting terrorist attacks? Why are they not holding their own governments responsible for lack of elections, and supporting a government in Gaza whose charter calls for the destruction of the State of Israel?  This gives a "free pass" to behavior that those who support democratic values should question.
We believe that music and the arts can indeed build bridges and should not be used as a political weapon if conditions don't justify. That's why artists, including Alicia Keyes, Jon Bon Jovi, the Rolling Stones, Rihanna, Enrique Iglesias, Justin Timberlake, Justin Bieber, and many others continue to perform in Israel for audiences that can include Israeli Arabs, Christians, Muslims and Jews. Over 30,000 people have signed Creative Community for Peace's Anti-Boycott Petition.
While we lament the loss of all innocent life, when artists function as a bullhorn for spreading untruths and misinformation they only fan the flames of conflict rather than seek to use the power of music and culture to unite.
David Renzer is chairman of the Spirit Music Group. Steve Schnur is the Worldwide Executive and President of Electronic Arts Music Group. Both are co-founders of the Creative Community for Peace.

<title>Fiddling with flags while Israel burns</title>
<date>Wed Dec 16 20:03:08 IST 2015</date>
<content>
Israel’s politicians are, once again, up in arms.
What got them all riled up this time? No, it’s not the wave of terror that has so far killed 22 Israelis and injured hundreds.
Nor is it the entrenched poverty that continues to cripple Israeli society, or the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has undermined every democratic institution and principle in his determination to drive through a controversial deal for Israel's natural gas.
It isn't even Israel’s diminishing democracy, which is being chipped at by the very politicians now expressing anger. They’re fine with that, thank you very much.
No, Israel’s right-wing and centrist politicians have much bigger things to worry about. Did you hear, for instance, that Palestinian head negotiator Saeb Erekat spoke at the Haaretz conference in New York without an Israeli flag behind him?
Erekat, who has played a central role in peace negotiations with Israel since the early 1990s and was a major force behind the Oslo Accords, also gave a fascinating, bitter speech, in which he pleaded with Israel “not to give up” on a two-state solution in favor of the apartheid regime (“one state, two systems”) that is fast becoming reality on the ground. Visibly upset, he spoke about his nephew, who was shot and killed in a West Bank checkpoint after shooting and wounding two Israelis earlier this month.
Overall, it was a vitriolic speech, one that was clearly emotional for Erekat, who choked up when discussing his nephew and sarcastically “congratulated” Netanyahu for “destroying a culture of negotiations, a culture of dialogue, a culture of peace.”
But it wasn’t the substance of what Erekat said that caused a scandal in Israel. it was that he refused to say it underneath an Israeli flag.
Here's looking at you, Donald
In an improbably-still-ongoing scandal that could be called “flag-gate”, Haaretz was slammed for acquiescing to Erekat’s request to remove the Israeli flag that had been hanging minutes earlier, as Israeli President Reuven Rivlin made his own speech.
Rivlin himself was already the subject of controversy for his agreement to participate in a conference co-hosted by Haaretz and New Israel Fund, two of the most maligned organizations in Israel today, that also included the left-wing NGO Breaking the Silence (the new favorite punching bag of the Israeli right).
The umbrage wasn't confined to the far right. “The far left has finally lost all sense of national pride,” claimed former Finance Minister Yair Lapid, chairman of the centrist Yesh Atid party, on his Facebook page. Likud Minister Ze'ev Elkin, who is on the far right, argued that Erekat’s request to remove the Israeli flag while he spoke “showed once again how little Palestinians are willing to seek a peace agreement.”
The pro-Bibi daily Israel Hayom devoted the majority of its cover page yesterday to "flag-gate", with an op-ed that stated “only the far Left would fold its own flag.”
Sadly, this is what has become of Israel’s democracy: With little actual content, all that’s left seems to be a pathetic, empty race to determine who’s the most Zionist.
The health of a democracy can be measured by the issues that rule its public debate. In Israel, a country in crisis that is currently dealing with deep-rooted problems, visionless politicians prefer to argue over flags than offer real solutions that might cost them their careers.
This is not a unique problem to Israel by any means (here’s looking at you, Donald Trump), but Israel has developed a unique obsession with trivial nonsense as a way to avoid a debate about the real issues. If it’s not the latest chapter in the saga of Sara Netanyahu then it’s Culture Minister Miri Regev declaring she doesn’t read Chekhov, or a Likud MK who said something nasty to another MK, or it might be a Swedish Foreign Minister who said something unflattering, or simply the prices of chocolate pudding in Berlin.
Israel, as a country, will soon need to make difficult choices about its identity, its values and its future. With the “peace process” dead and buried and over three million Palestinian still under its control, Israel will have to decide between its Jewishness and its democracy. With a society that is already among the most unequal in the OECD, it will have to change course, or risk instability.
But you wouldn’t know any of this if you listen to right-wing or centrist politicians. Theirs is a world where the most pressing issue Israeli voters have to decide every four years is who is best equipped to deal with unpatriotic flag placements.
Some might say Israel is a country heading fast toward a giant iceberg. Some (among them the author) will say it has already hit the iceberg, and is simply, deliriously oblivious. Regardless of how far along Israel is in its course of decline, though, it seems its current rulers have no idea how to turn it around, or even that it needs to be turned around. Otherwise, why would they be sitting casually on the deck of the Titanic, arguing about the placement of flags?

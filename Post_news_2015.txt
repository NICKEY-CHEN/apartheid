<title>Abbas: Netanyahu’s election remarks ‘harmful,’ but I’m willing to meet with him</title>
<date>4/4/2015</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s pre-election talk against the establishment  of a Palestinian state was “harmful and bad,” Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas said on Saturday.However, Abbas said that he was prepared  to negotiate and deal with Netanyahu because he represents Israel.




In an  interview with Al-Arab TV, Abbas said Israel stands to gain if it agrees to the  Arab Peace Initiative.“I have no problem negotiating with Netanyahu,  because he represents the state of Israel,” he said. “My hand is always  stretched out.“We made great headway in the negotiations with [then prime  minister Ehud] Olmert, in which we discussed everything, and suddenly he was  distanced from the political arena [when he resigned in 2009].“We say to the nation in Israel: Our  hands are stretched out for coexistence between the two countries; do not chop  off the hand that is stretched out in peace, because the alternatives do not  help anyone. The alternatives are destructive,” Abbas said.In the  interview, he said that even the US had expressed reservations about Netanyahu’s  statements against a Palestinian state.“If you say you are opposed to  the two-state solution, then what kind of solution do you want?” Abbas  asked.“Do you want racial discrimination or apartheid or a one-state  solution? What exactly do you want?” Abbas said he did not know whether  Netanyahu would change his position regarding a Palestinian state. But he  stressed that the Palestinians would not change their position and would  continue to demand a state alongside Israel.“The Israeli people needs to  know that such policies won’t bring stability and peace,” Abbas added. “We want  peace and security for the Israeli people, the same as we want them for  ourselves. Netanyahu’s policies won’t lead to security and peace.”The  Palestinian leadership was opposed to the one-state solution and continues to  demand an independent Palestinian state, he said.“We say, two states –  the state of Palestine and the state of Israel. Period,” he said. “We won’t  accept anything else.”Abbas reiterated his refusal to recognize Israel  as a Jewish state.“We have accepted and recognized Israel a long time  ago,” he said. “If Netanyahu wants to change the status of Israel, he can go to  the United Nations and ask for that. This is not our business.”Solving  the Palestinian issue would rid the region of all the terrorist groups that have  popped up over the past few years, Abbas said. “The Israelis need to be aware  that this could reach them at any time,” he said, referring to the  terrorists.Abbas accused Israel of trying to “kill” the Oslo  Accords.“They have started backtracking on the terms of the Oslo  Accords,” he claimed. “Nothing has been left of the accords. That’s why we  decided to revise the accords and other agreements with Israel. They have  damaged the Oslo Accords.”Israeli violations of the accords included IDF  incursions into areas A and B in the West Bank and the withholding of tax  revenues belonging to the Palestinians, Abbas said.Construction Minister  Uri Ariel (Bayit Yehudi) said Abbas’s call for negotiations was “nothing short  of chutzpah.”“After he unilaterally violated the agreements signed by  the Palestinian Authority by turning to the International Criminal Court in The  Hague, he dares say his hand is outstretched in peace?” Ariel asked. “Israel  should say clearly to Abbas that to return to the negotiating table, he must  take back his violations. He must be made to understand that Israel will not  seek an agreement while surrendering its values.”In the interview, Abbas  accused Hamas leaders of conducting negotiations with Israel over the  establishment of a Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip.He said that he  planned to visit the Gaza Strip, but that Hamas did not allow him to do  so.“There is a dialogue and meetings between Hamas and Israel up to this  day,” Abbas claimed, without elaborating.He said that Hamas leader  Khaled Mashaal was in favor of a Palestinian state on the pre-1967 lines, while  the movement’s representative in the Gaza Strip, Mahmoud Zahar, supports a  Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip.An Israeli government official  responded by saying that if Abbas’s hand was outstretched in peace, “why was he  holding Hamas’s hand with the other.” You can’t do both, the official said,  adding that this was “a fundamental problem.”
“If Abbas wants to move the  process forward, he has to understand that he has responsibilities,” he said.  “He can’t avoid responsibilities, play lowest denomination politics and say it  is all Israel’s fault.”

<title>‘A better future for Palestinians will benefit Israel’</title>

“It had been a long, drawn-out struggle for liberation when we  went to the polls in 1994... and South Africans dedicated to bury centuries of  discrimination and repression. We sought to build a new society on freedom and  this foundation offered an opportunity for all to work together.”This  was the message delivered Tuesday by the South African representative, N.W  Makalima, to the Palestinian Authority before a crowd of some 250 at Ramallah’s  Movenpick Hotel on the occasion of Freedom Day, which marks the day that  apartheid in South Africa transitioned to democracy.




For those present,  including Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, the words rang  true and seemed to echo their own struggle for statehood.“Speaking on  behalf of President [Mahmoud] Abbas, we honor your celebrations and give  compliments,” he said. “We came to celebrate with you; we seek to have a  democratic nation; we are resisting occupation.”He spoke of rebuilding  Gaza and thanked South Africans for supporting Palestinian boycotts of Israeli  goods.Last week Israel denied South African Minister for Higher  Education and Training Blade Nzimande entry to the country. He had expected to  attend the ceremony and cement relations between institutions of higher  education in his country and Bir Zeit University. Makalima noted that it was  unfortunate Israel had denied him entry, but said partnership work would  continue.“We remain steadfast in support for the Palestinian people; we  support a free, democratic, territorially contiguous Palestinian state living  side by side with Israel in international borders, based on those of June 4,  1967, with east Jerusalem as capital,” Makalima said.South African  Ambassador to Israel Sisa Ngombane said after the event that he hopes that,  despite the denial of a visa to Nzimande and the ensuing “disappointing  controversy,” that Israel should see that the developing Palestinian  institutions will benefit both peoples.
Palestinian politician Nabil  Sha’ath was more harsh in his criticism, condemning Israel for its “stupid”  behavior.

<title>Analysis: Are EU labels on settlement products triggering anti-Semitism?</title>
<date>8/12/2015</date>
<content>
Nearly a month after the European Union imposed special sanctions on Israeli products from disputed territories, there is a growing sense that the penalty is a shot in the arm for hardcore anti-Israeli groups.Has this EU measure, however, to label Israeli goods from the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights unleashed a new wave of anti-Semitism? Writing about US academic boycotts targeting Israel, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charles Krauthammer said, “Discrimination against Jews has a name. It’s called anti-Semitism.”




A small number of German politicians view the EU measure as a form of unequal treatment unfairly targeting the Jewish state. Jan Korte, an MP from the German Left Party and one of the few pro-Israel voices within that historically anti-Israel party, told The Jerusalem Post on Monday: “I consider Israel’s settlement policy wrong. But due to of historical reasons, I also personally reject the labeling mandate.”He added that the EU label system represents “double standards, when one views the international dealing with other comparable cases, for example, Cyprus.”The EU considers North Cyprus to be territory occupied by Turkey, but refuses to specially label products from North Cyprus or penalize Turkey with consumer sanctions.German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to support the labeling of settlement products on Monday sent a jolt through the anti-label camp.After all, Germany was the first European country to ostracize Jewish businesses in the 1930s. The German philosopher Theodor Adorno said, in commenting on post-Holocaust Germany in 1959, “We will not have come to terms with the past until the causes of what happened then are no longer active. Only because these causes live on does the spell of the past remain, to this very day, unbroken.”Prof. Gerald Steinberg, head of the Jerusalem-based NGO Monitor, told The Jerusalem Post: “Now, through the mechanism of product labeling, as a form of BDS-lite [Boycott, Sanctions, Divestment], EU policy- makers and its NGO allies have expanded the radius of demonization, erasing Israel’s democratic framework and the complexities of the conflict.”He added, “We have already seen obsessive anti-Israel rabbles in European cities, particularly Germany, marching through stores, intimidating customers and store employees, and appointing themselves as violent enforcers of what the EU claimed were simply ‘technical guidelines.’ These entirely predictable consequences should have been considered by the EU officials and by groups such as the European Center for Foreign Relations, which single out Israel for punishment.”Eugene Kontorovich , a professor at Northwestern University School of Law and a leading expert on the EU labeling system, told the Post, “I would not say the labeling ‘triggers’ anti-Semitism, but it has made many anti-Semites happy, and gives some impetus and legitimization to anti-Semitic groups. “ He added, “By adopting a unique rule of geographic origin that requires saying ‘who’ made something and not just where, and only applying it to a Jewish population, labeling validates the basic anti-Semitic narrative of Jews as the ultimate ‘other.”’ The debates about the EU labels have veered from, on the one hand, echoes of fascist Germany to a practical way, on the other hand, to pressure Israel to make concessions to the Palestinians as part of the peace process.EU policy makers, according to critics, have ignored the hyper anti-Israel environment unfolding in Europe. Steinberg said, “The constant drumbeat of anti-Israel demonization in Europe is widely reflected in anti-Semitism and even terror attacks targeting against Jews. False allegations such as ‘war crimes’ and ‘apartheid’ become fodder for hate, not only against Israelis, but also against Jews in Europe. “ The spike in German BDS activity over the last few weeks, including the removal of Israeli wines from the shelves of the high-end department store KaDeWe, suggests that Israeli products may face a new form of economic warfare.

<title>Analysis: Israel must prepare for Palestinian Authority's collapse</title>
<date>20/9/2015</date>
<content>
The winds that are now blowing through the region are reminiscent of those first few days of the first intifada in 1987. These are bad winds, winds of disorder and unrest, winds that are moving masses of people who are leaderless to seek ways to do harm, to kill, to set things on fire, and to undermine the status quo.After the Kalashnikov era was put down and defeated during the second intifada and Operation Defensive Shield, the Palestinians are going back to their roots - fireworks, Molotov cocktails, and stones. It’s a return to the stone age.




Israel’s response is also a not-too-unfamiliar one. There’s talk of iron fists, zero tolerance, and easing up the rules of engagement. In the late 1980s, Israel’s leadership also spoke in these tones, and acted upon them. The end result was a heads-on clash that changed the rules of the game, eventually bringing Israel to the Madrid peace conference and the Oslo Accords. This doesn’t mean that we are on the verge of another intifada. Then, like now, the atmosphere was explosive, and the circumstances led to mayhem.Another element complicating matters is desperation. An overwhelming majority of Palestinians are in despair. They’ve had it with the overall situation, they’ve had it with themselves, they’ve had it with Mahmoud Abbas, they’ve had it with the intifada, and they no longer believe there is a chance for peace. That is why there hasn’t been an explosion of violence until now.The Palestinians are in despair because all of the diplomatic steps taken by the Palestine Liberation Organization have been nothing but kalaam fadi - “empty words” in Arabic. They are in despair because they know that the Palestinian flag flying at the United Nations, the boycott against Israel, and recognition of a Palestinian state haven’t moved anything on the ground.There is also the matter of the rising tide of Islamism sweeping through the Middle East, putting pressure on the Palestinians. “Where are you?” the Islamists are saying. “What have you done against the occupation? What have you done for Al-Aksa?”The finger of blame is being pointed at the Palestinians, and it is having an impact on the masses. Its echo reverberates through the alleyways of the West Bank and Gaza. It also rouses the heart to action, representing the spirit of awakening, a personal desire on the part of terror operatives to do something and not just sit idly by. As a result, we have returned to the stone age, because that is the easiest, most logical destination. A young Arab who feels the need to do something goes out and picks up a stone. From that point, he’s in.These ill winds are accompanied by the smell of danger in the air, and its origins can be traced back to the extremist religious elements that threaten to undermine the Western norms to which we adhere. It is a lethal cloud that hovers over the entire Middle East. For a number of reasons, some of them circumstantial, it has yet to be fully felt in the Palestinian territories.The creeping rise of radical Islam has been stymied for the most part due to the fact that the Palestinian leader, Abbas, has consistently refused to support the use of violence and terrorism. He has done so both out of principle and also due to the cold, hard calculation that such a move would have fatal consequences for the Palestinians.Another reason that Islamism has for the most part been halted in Judea and Samaria can be traced to the fact that the Fatah movement is in a fight for its very survival. It knows that failure would spell the end for it, and Hamas would show it no mercy. When it comes to religious fanaticism, the formula of “bad is good” applies. This formula is what guides the spread of radical Islamism. It is the source of horror and shock that is generated by the specter of Shi’ite Islam as represented by Iran and the Revolutionary Guards. The Islamic Republic has spent a great deal of money financing terrorism as well as a costly nuclear program. The extremist Sunni organization, Islamic State, took things a step further. Its actions dwarf the brutality of the Al Quds Force. Even al-Qaida looks like a cute, cuddly teddy bear in comparison. Have the people who have come under ISIS rule seen their lives improve? The answer is no. Bad is good.If we were to take a peek at what is going on with our neighbors to the northeast, we are left to wonder - is there anyone enjoying the situation in Syria now? No. There is a brutal civil war there in which a quarter million people have been butchered. As a country, Syria is in ruins. Its infrastructure is crumbling. Its economy is in shambles. Its citizens are being slaughtered, and those who survived are witnesses to acts that will stay with them as personal and national traumas for generations to come. Millions have become refugees who have streamed into Jordan and Turkey. Now, wretched and without any possessions, they knock on the doors of Europe. Is this Arab pride? Is this Syrian courage? Hezbollah has lost 1,400 guerillas, more than one-tenth of its fighting force. ISIS is conquering territory and losing some as well, bombing and being bombarded. Things are bad, for everyone involved.And this is precisely the goal. For extremist Islam, bad is good. Only the destruction of the foundations of contemporary Western culture and a return to the stone age - in its simplest and historic meaning - will usher in the rule of sharia, the austere form of Islam that was in effect 500 years ago. That will pave the way for the establishment of the Islamic caliphate.It is quite an ambitious goal - taking apart the artificial entities imposed by the West, including statehood, institutions of law and order, economic structure, and norms of morality and regulations. The goal is to destroy everything and wash it over with Islamism, some of whose adherents believe is engaged in a war of armageddon.This toxic mix could easily merge with the rising tide of terror and rebellion percolating in the Palestinian territories. With despair the dominant theme, the Palestinians could decide to take everything apart. Even Abbas, the serial threatener, is planning a provocation of his own by announcing at the United Nations that he is handing back the keys to the Palestinian Authority. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is unmoved. Nonetheless, such an act could be the one that breaks open the dam. The dismantling of the Palestinian Authority, a scenario that is viewed with favor of senior Likud ministers and other right-wing politicians, could be the signal for the Palestinians to unburden themselves from any obligations, leading to a heads-on clash with the army and the complete breakdown of Palestinian order. On the Israeli right, there are quite a number of individuals - some of whom were involved in setting government policy - who claim that one more massive military confrontation - brutal, bloody, and large in scope - will enable Israel to unilaterally set its permanent borders. No more agreements. No more negotiations. No more compromises and peace processes. War, terrorism, deaths, coffins, military processions, and, finally, surrender. This is a dangerous fantasy. This is a plan that - if it is indeed a plan and if it is one that should one day be realized - will come with a tremendous cost. If it wishes to maintain a separation between Israelis and Palestinians, then cold, hard-headed calculations dictate that Israel must keep the Palestinian Authority on its feet as a semi-state entity. All those who support the ideology of Greater Land of Israel - those who screamed in protest at suggestions that Israel take in a small number of Syrian refugees - need to ask themselves if they would be agreeable to instead take in masses of Palestinian refugees who will storm the fences and demand some kind of status. Either they be recognized as Israeli citizens, or they accept a status of second-class citizens that will only confirm Israel’s standing as an apartheid state.Without annexation of the West Bank and conferring citizenship on the Palestinians, there is only one option - preserving separation while allowing for Palestinian autonomy and a functioning PA. This interim solution would eventually yield a demilitarized, limited Palestinian state.Until then, Israel’s rightist government will try to maintain the status quo, if at all possible. Perhaps it would be wise of the government to take decisions on what contingency plans it wishes to implement in case there are initial signs of the Palestinian administration’s disintegration. That’s because no one is waiting. Nobody will give us time. Russia’s involvement in Syria is clear proof of this. The Russians are nearing the border with Israel. This requires a new set of understandings with a clear delineation of red lines.Israel’s freedom of operation and its room to maneuver has now been limited. Israel, a country that for all intents and purposes is considered an American forward operating base, is one fatal mistake away from becoming the next point of friction in US-Russian relations. This is a very real threat. The volatile northern border could give ulcers to the two superpowers who well weapons to their friends in the region and want to control energy sources without paying too heavy of a price.Netanyahu is scheduled to travel to Russia to meet with President Vladimir Putin on Monday. This is an important trip. But whoever thinks that the premier will return to Israel with maps marked with areas outlining where the Russians will be operating simply doesn’t know the Russians well. Just a reminder - ten years ago, after Israel presented definitive proof that lethal, Russian-manufactured Kornet anti-tank missiles were being used by Hezbollah during the Second Lebanon War, the Kremlin ordered a commission of inquiry to investigate. To this day, the commission has yet to complete its discussions.

<title>Canadian FM Baird to 'Post': ICC move an effort to tie Israel’s hand behind its back</title>
<date>22/1/2015</date>
<content>
Canada is the second-largest country in the world, has the 11th-largest economy,  is No. 37 in population and – since 2008 – has contributed over $350  million to the Palestinian Authority.None of that, however, kept PLO  chief negotiator Saeb Erekat from penning an op-ed last Friday in The Globe and  Mail calling on Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird – who arrived in Israel  that day for a five-day visit to the region – to apologize to the  Palestinians.




And what was Baird’s sin? His spokesman said Erekat himself  owed an apology for “offensive and ridiculous” comments equating Israel with  Islamic State.Earlier this month, Erekat said there was “no difference  between the terrorism practiced by the group [Islamic State] led by Abu Bakr  al-Baghdadi and Israel’s terrorism.” Ending settlement activities, he insisted,  “is a prerequisite for eliminating terrorism.”These words elicited a  sharp response from Baird’s spokesman, Rick Roth: “Mr. Erekat should instead  focus his efforts on negotiating a peaceful solution for the good of the  Palestinian people, and spend less time working to inflame tensions in the  region.”Erekat’s pointed non-apology came in the Globe and Mail op-ed,  under the headline, “It is John Baird who needs to apologize to the Palestinian  people.”“After spending the past few years listening to Mr. Baird going  out of his way to legitimize the banality and brutality of a 50-year-old Israeli  occupation, I tell Mr. Baird: enough. If there is anyone that has to apologize,  it is Mr. Baird himself,” he wrote. “He should first apologize to his own  citizenry, many of whom are God-loving Jews, Christians and Muslims who would  never condone nor cheer for an Israeli government that stretches support to  Israeli settlers who attack churches and mosques.”“Mr. Baird should  apologize for his active encouragement of Israel’s brute and ugly occupation and  its apartheid policies,” Erekat continued. “He should apologize for failing to  promote those things Canadians hold dear such as freedom, dignity and human  rights, and for replacing those ideals with an outspoken support of Israel’s  clear and undisputed violations of international law.”And then on Monday  morning, when Baird went to Ramallah to meet Palestinian Authority Foreign  Minister Riyad al-Maliki, Erekat issued another statement, saying, “We regret  the Canadian government’s decision to stand on the wrong side of history, by  blindly supporting the Israeli occupation and its apartheid  policies.”According to the statement, Baird “contributed to Israeli  violations of Palestinian inalienable rights, including our right to  self-determination, by systematically lobbying against all Palestinian  diplomatic initiatives.”The Palestinian people as well as the rest of  the Arab and Muslim countries, the statement thundered, “deserve an apology from  the Canadian government, for years of systematic attempts at blocking the right  of the Palestinian people to a state of their own.”And then, when Baird  emerged from his meeting with Maliki in Ramallah and entered his motorcade for  the trip back to Jerusalem, Palestinian protesters – some of them calling Baird  a terrorist – pelted his car and convoy with eggs and shoes.“I didn’t  see the shoes,” he quipped in an interview Tuesday with The Jerusalem Post. “I  heard there were shoes, but I didn’t see any.”As to the splattered eggs,  Baird – arguably the most pro-Israel foreign minister in the world – said that  didn’t faze him much.“I’m a big boy,” said Baird, who was in the country  for the sixth time since becoming foreign minister four years ago. “A few eggs  are not going to intimidate me or Canada from the moral clarity with which we  approach these issues.”And it is that “moral clarity” which, indeed, has  won him and Ottawa great appreciation and applause in Jerusalem.Before  their meeting Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Baird and Canada  precisely for that moral clarity.“You have consistently demonstrated a  willingness to stand up for what is right and to oppose what is wrong,”  Netanyahu said. “To fight Islamist terrorism, we need clarity and courage;  Canada has both.“You know who is the aggressor; you know who is the  defender. You know that Israel legitimately defends itself against the war  crimes of Hamas and other terrorist groups. You know that it’s a travesty of  justice to haul Israel to the dock in The Hague, and you know that the entire  system of international law could unravel because of this travesty.”And  if all that does not find favor in Erekat’s eyes, then Baird – as he made clear  – can live with it.“I’m not going to get into a debate with Saeb  Erekat,” he said, dismissing Erekat’s criticism. “The other day he likened  Israeli government actions to Islamic State beheadings of journalists and  religious minorities. It is just deeply offensive.”As to the impact the  protesters in Ramallah will have on him, Baird – who said he has faced much  worse in his political career – acknowledged that “it certainly doesn’t do  anything to strengthen” Canada’s relationship with the PA.The PA’s  filing a petition to the International Criminal Court in The Hague against  Israel is also not doing much to improve those relations.“This is wrong  on so many levels,” said Baird, whose country was one of the founders of the ICC  and is a significant donor.“First and foremost, Israel – every time it  comes under attack – seems to have to have one hand tied behind its back. And  what this seems to do is tie the other hand behind its back.”And  secondly, he said, the ICC is not to be used where there are mechanisms for  domestic judicial processes and review. “And obviously, Israel has one of the  most independent judiciaries in the world,” he said.Baird said that  Canada has “filed an objection” with the court, explaining its opposition to  opening a preliminary investigation against Israel, but said the chances of that  having an impact are “a long shot.”“We are going to speak out forcefully  against this decision, and try to get it turned around,” he said.“It’s  tough, but we just fundamentally have a major problem with this  decision.”Baird was noncommittal, however, on whether Canada might be  willing to withhold funds to the court, as Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman  suggested – saying that was his government’s decision to make, and not his  alone.Asked his advice on how he thought Israel should deal with the ICC  threat, Baird said it was clear after meeting with Israeli officials from across  the political spectrum that everyone is taking the threat “very seriously” and  are speaking out on it very forcefully, something he characterized as a “good  start.”“I noted in my meetings that the one thing which serves Israel  well is that it speaks with one voice on this, regardless of the party. That is  a strong signal at a sensitive time.”Baird said the verdict was still  out whether the attacks in Paris two weeks ago would make the world more  understanding toward Israel’s plight.“These types of things  unfortunately happened in this region and in this country on a more regular  basis,” he said. “It reminds us how small the world is and how terrorism is the  great struggle of our generation, and that humanity has to work successfully to  tackle it.For Canada, obviously, our Israeli friends and Jewish friends  are too often on the front lines of that struggle, and that is why we stand  shoulder to shoulder with them.”Baird diplomatically danced around  questions about whether Israel has become more isolated internationally under  Netanyahu, and what the country needed to do to it improve its standing in the  world, saying these were election- related issues. When going to the polls, he  maintained, the Israeli people “do not need color commentary from the Canadian  foreign minister.”But Israelis will not be the only ones going to the  polls in 2015; so will Canadians, due to have elections in October. Asked if he  thought Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s rock-solid and unflinching support of  Israel will cost him and his party at the polls, Baird said, “We don’t support  Israel because it gets us votes.”“The Jewish population in Canada is  small, and a fraction of the Arab and Muslim population,” he noted, adding that  the present government supports Israel so strongly “because it is the right  thing to do. I think when you do the right thing, in the end you will meet with  success.
“We don’t do it for political gain, that is for sure.”

<title>BDS movement takes to social media to urge Lauryn Hill to cancel Israel show</title>
<date>4/5/2015</date>
<content>
It’s been a problematic month for R&B singer Lauryn Hill.On Friday,  the famed ex-Fugees superstar was set to perform in Lagos, Nigeria, but bowed  out after travel delays forced her to cancel. Though the singer has since  apologized by filming an acoustic version of her pop classic “Doo Wop (That  Thing),” titled “A Message to Nigeria from Ms Lauryn Hill,” this isn’t her first  cancellation misdemeanor. In 2009, festival organizers said the singer had  canceled tour dates in Europe because of health reasons, while similar issues  caused her to cancel a 2014 performance in New Jersey.




Snafus other than  stomach bugs might prevent Hill from performing this Thursday at Rishon Lezion’s  Live Park Amphitheater.A tweet last month by the US Campaign to End the  Israeli Occupation read: “@MsLaurynHill 11,000 people asking you to boycott  Israel. Please respect Palestinian call.”In an action alert, the US  Campaign said that “the presence of artists is routinely used by Israel to  legitimize its policies and maintain its reputation as a normal member of the  international community.” The group has continued to coax followers to join the  campaign demanding that Hill boycott Israel and cancel her  show.Alongside these efforts, the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and  Sanctions movement (BDS) has been putting added pressure on Hill by creating a  widespread social media campaign incorporating memes, hashtags and a YouTube  video.Appropriating the early-’90’s Fugees hit “Killing Me Softly,” BDS  pulled out all the stops: an online petition, a 
KillingMeSoftly hashtag, a meme  depicting an image of Lauryn Hill with the words “Hey Lauren You’re  
KillingMeSoftly,” as well as a video of pro-Palestinian activists singing their  version of the hit song.In two days, the video reached 4,328 views.  While concrete hits aren’t reflected on Twitter, a simple search of the hashtag  
KillingMeSoftly only raises a handful of tweets.Armed with the lyrics,  “Killing me softly with your bombs,” a letter from the Palestinian Campaign for  the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel further warns Hill, “Performing in  Israel today is the equivalent of performing in Sun City, South Africa during  the apartheid era.”The letter references declarations from Archbishop  Esmeritus Desmond Tutu and former South African government minister Ronnie  Kasrils about how “Israel has created a form of racial apartheid that is far  worse than anything that existed in South Africa.”In recent years,  musicians such as Sinead O’Connor, Talib Kweli and, more recently, Sonic Youth’s  Thurston Moore have come under pressure from pro-Palestinian organizations to  boycott Israel.In a recent statement, the Israel show’s producers have  acknowledged receiving messages from Hill’s camp about her desire to cancel, but  have said that despite pressure, they will continue to take every possible  measure to ensure the show will go on.As of today, there is still no  statement confirming the show has been canceled. If the most recent set list  from Hill’s “Rough Trade” performance in New York this past February is anything  to go by, “Killing me Softly” won’t be on the bill anyway.
Ready or not,  here she comes. Maybe.

<title>'Bennett, your hands are stained with blood' - Bayit Yehudi alleges incitement by leftists</title>
<date>5/8/2015</date>
<content>
Bayit Yehudi filed a police complaint about growing incitement against Education  Minister Naftali Bennett on Wednesday.The party said that since the  Jerusalem Gay Pride Parade stabbing and the firebombing in Duma, Bennett’s  Facebook page has been flooded with calls to harm him and other right-wing  politicians.




Commenters called Bennett “Hitler” and a “murderer,” as well  as saying that the blood of Shira Banki, who was fatally stabbed at the parade,  is on his hands because he let Bayit Yehudi members “speak their dark opinions  freely.”“Naftali Bennett, you will not be able to wash off the  bloodstains.They will remain on your soul,” a commenter named Or  wrote.

(Religious assailant stabs six at Jerusalem Gay Pride march)Bayit Yehudi Youth Forum chairman Yonatan Dobov, who submitted the  complaint, said he was shocked that “a moment after the two horrific murders,  some people want more blood,” and he criticized those who spread hate and who  blame an entire population group for the attacks.“Bennett is regularly  attacked by the defenders of freedom of speech and pluralism,” Dobov  quipped.“Last year, he was physically attacked at the Haaretz peace  conference.”The complaint came after social media users photoshopped  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Reuven Rivlin and Defense Minister  Moshe Ya’alon in SS uniforms and produced doctored videos of them speaking  German. Rivlin has been the target of a wave of violent comments on social media  in recent days.MKs on the Left mocked Bennett’s “whining” about  incitement, while criticizing his opposing views on gay marriage, in addition to  controversial statements by Bayit Yehudi MKs about LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual  and transgender) people.MK Tamar Zandberg (Meretz) wrote on Facebook  that she “believes that [Bennett] was alarmed by the commotion around him, but  instead of taking a deep look inside, he decided to cynically act like the  victim and try to turn the actual victims into scapegoats. No one is as talented  at inciting while whining as Naftali Bennett.”According to Zandberg,  Bayit Yehudi made homophobia and racism its open agenda, and then cried when it  was criticized, because its words had “murderous results.”She shared  images of violent comments she had received on Facebook, many of which called  her a traitor and said she should be hanged or decapitated.MK Yoel  Hasson (Zionist Union) called Bennett “infinitely egocentric,” and he suggested  he should have complained about the incitement against Rivlin or the LGBT  community.“He should be ashamed. A week hasn’t passed since the murder,  Shira Banki’s parents are still sitting shiva [mourning period], and Bennett  hasn’t even called them because he’s too busy. But the Right’s bulldozer is  turning pain into demagoguery...working non-stop,” Hasson  said.Hadash activist Alon-Lee Green, a former aide to Joint List MK Dov  Henin, filed a complaint to the police about Bennett and Bayit Yehudi MKs  Bezalel Smotrich, Yinon Magal and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked in response to  the education minister’s complaint.“We cannot let them turn us into  those who incite. We cannot let them lie and claim that we are the ones who  incite and not, for example, Smotrich, from their party, who in recent days,  after the attack, continued to call us an abomination that needs conversion  therapy and called the whole Arab population our enemy,” Green wrote on  Facebook, as part of a caption to a photo of him outside a Tel Aviv police  station. “We did not incite against anyone or any population group or community.  We did, however, hear how they incite, how they turn entire population groups  into illegitimate and enemies.”He did not specify who “we” refers to,  but his party is one of several that make up the Joint List.Joint List  MKs routinely call Israel an apartheid state and the Right fascists.They  have praised Palestinian suicide bombers, Hamas for launching rockets as well as  rock-throwers.
They have also made derogatory comments about LGBT people.

<title>Bill giving life sentence to terrorist kidnappers clears hurdle</title>
<date>8/7/2015</date>
<content>
Legislation that would require all kidnappers with nationalist motives to be sentenced with life in prison passed a preliminary vote in the Knesset Wednesday.The bill by MK Motti Yogev (Bayit Yehudi) would prohibit courts from giving kidnappers a lighter sentence, and specifies that it applies to someone who abducts another person with nationalist motives to endanger that person's life or in order to use him as a negotiating card.




Yogev proposed the bill in light of the kidnapping and murder of three teenage boys in Gush Etzion last summer."We need to strengthen our deterrence by increasing the punishment, so that such actions will not pay," Yogev said in the plenum, ahead of the vote.MK Issawi Frej (Meretz) said the bill is "from the dark ages" and that Yogev should be ashamed of it."Every nationalist bill is creeping apartheid that comes from your stupid bills," Frej added.Yogev responded that the law would reply to a Jewish nationalist kidnapper, as well.The bill passed its preliminary vote with 46 in favor and 18 opposed.

<title>'Bon Jovi stands with Israeli settlers who burn Palestinian babies,' Roger Waters says</title>
<date>2/10/2015</date>
<content>
Pink Floyd co-founder and bassist Roger Waters continued his long-standing tradition of publicly calling out a big-name pop star for agreeing to perform in Israel.In a letter written by the legendary British rocker and obtained by the online magazine Salon, Waters wrote that Jon Bon Jovi, who is bringing his act to Tel Aviv for a much-anticipated concert scheduled for this Saturday night, "stands shoulder to shoulder with the settler who burned the [Palestinian] baby" in the West Bank village of Duma last month.




"Often in the past I have written detailed, and sometimes even persuasive, letters to colleagues in the music business, encouraging them not to give succor to the Israeli government’s apartheid policies by performing in Israel," the creative brains behind such seminal works of music as The Wall and Dark Side of the Moon wrote. "Having read Jon’s comments last week...I won’t waste my time drawing parallels with Apartheid South Africa and the moral stand that so many artists took then and that thousands are taking now in the face of decades of Israeli oppression of Palestinians."Bon Jovi joins a lengthy list of high-profile names whom Waters has publicly scolded due to their associations with Israel or Israeli-linked activities. Waters has criticized actress Scarlett Johannson for her endorsement of SodaStream and he has also urged other musicians like Neil Young, Robbie Williams, and the Rolling Stones to cancel gigs in Israel.With Bon Jovi set to play Tel Aviv this weekend, Waters yet again takes advantage of the opportunity to denounce Israeli policy.Waters has asserted that the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel is “the most effective way to go.”
In an interview with The Electronic Intifada, he accused Israel of being an “apartheid regime.”

<title>British pro-Palestinian activist group to PM Cameron: Cancel Netanyahu visit</title>
<date>7/9/2015</date>
<content>
The Palestinian Solidarity Campaign announced on Monday a protest scheduled to take place at the welcoming ceremony planned for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's official visit to the British Parliament later this week.In a letter sent to Prime Minister David Cameron, signed by over 10,000 people, the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign called on Cameron to cancel Netanyahu's visit scheduled for Wednesday and instead impose sanctions and an arms embargo on Israel.




The organization claimed Netanyahu "bears direct responsibility for the war crimes identified by the UN Human Rights Council following Israel’s brutal assault on Gaza last summer, which killed more than 2,000 Palestinian women, children and men in the space of seven weeks."According to the letter, Netanyahu is also responsible for the Israeli violation of the 1949 Geneva Convention as settlements continue to expand under his leadership. "In further breaches of international law, Mr. Netanyahu presides over the Israeli military occupation of East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank and the blockade of Gaza," they accused."Palestinians suffer under the segregationist, apartheid policies imposed on them by the Israeli state, while living in constant fear of Israeli attack."Netanyahu is immune from prosecution on war crimes charges as a head of state, but the organization called on Cameron to make "clear he is not welcome here," by imposing "an immediate arms embargo and sanctions on Israel until it complies with international law and ends the occupation and the siege on Gaza."

Protesters planned to wear masks bearing the likeness of Netanyahu and Cameron while holding photos of Palestinian children killed in last summer's Operation Protective Edge at the diplomatic welcoming ceremony.

<title>De Klerk in Israel says: The most intractable problems can be resolved by strong statesmen</title>
<date>23/11/2015</date>
<content>
Strong statesmen can peacefully resolve even the most intractable problems by negotiation and compromise, former South African president Frederik Willem de Klerk said on Monday.De Klerk, 79, who won the Nobel Peace Prize together with Nelson Mandela in 1993 for their leadership in ending apartheid, was the keynote speaker at a daylong conference on combating racism, hosted by the Berl Katznelson Foundation at Tel Aviv University.




Without referring directly to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, de Klerk said that other countries could learn from the South African experience.“During the past 25 years, ladies and gentlemen, we South Africans have learned that even the most intractable problems can be resolved peacefully,” he said, earning warm applause from a packed auditorium.“It can be done through negotiations and compromise.”During his presidency, between September 1989 and May 1994, de Klerk held difficult but ultimately successful negotiations with Mandela, who he freed in 1990 from a 27-year-long prison term for treason, on ushering in a new democratic South Africa.Among the lessons he said could be learned from South Africa’s transition, de Klerk said, were that strong leaders were required to see the historic window of opportunity and be prepared to make genuine concessions and painful compromises.“History sometimes opens a window of opportunity, when all the forces involved are ripe for negotiations,” de Klerk said.“It is the task of statesmen to recognize such windows and to lead their followers through before history once again slams them shut. We learned that leadership was important. It was equally important for parties to take their constituencies with them. Strong and determined and committed leadership was essential.”De Klerk said he and Mandela had succeeded in building a relationship of trust, despite the fact they were political opponents.“Personalities also play an important role. The main role players in the negotiating parties have to be able to develop personal relationships based on mutual trust and confidence. They also have to develop a strong sense of patience and fortitude to deal with the frequent frustrations and obstacles,” he said.“Nelson Mandela and I had such a relationship, despite the stormy altercations that inevitably arose between us.”True leaders, he added, also had to take risks and sometimes even “a leap of faith.”“Ultimately, the negotiators have to be prepared to take risks to assure a successful outcome. Few agreements will ever be absolutely water-tight, and at some juncture a leap of faith will usually be unavoidable,” de Klerk said.De Klerk paid tribute to the leadership of assassinated prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, whose daughter Dalia and son Yuval, were in the audience.“The impact of great historic forces is undeniable,” he said. “However, I believe and have witnessed the enormous role that gifted individuals can and do play in directing historic forces toward positive destinations. One such man was Yitzhak Rabin. He sees the forces of the time, he wrestles with them and he directed them towards the purposes of peace. “ De Klerk rejected what a notion of history being the more or less predetermined product of “great economic, social and demographic forces.“We South Africans know something of the great forces of history. We’ve also had wrestles with them. Sometimes we have failed. At other times, we have succeeded,” he said.After giving a brief history of the birth of apartheid in South Africa, de Klerk explained some of the ingredients needed for social change.“Our approach was based on the following reality: Whether we liked one another or not, there could be no long-term solution that did not involve all the greater parties and population groups of our country. Our problems could be solved only through negotiation; any attempt by any party to continue to impose its will on its opponents by force would simply lead to the restructuring of the country and the economy,” he said.De Klerk said he and Mandela had realized that they would have to put the bitterness of the past behind them and search for genuine national reconciliation, and stand in each other’s shoes.“We needed, on the one hand, in the negotiations, for the main parties sitting around the table to understand the core interests of the other party. In the case of Mandela, he and I went out of our way to understand what the minimum would be with which the other one would have to leave the negotiations table. We actually tried to put each other in each other’s shoes, and that helped us the necessary and sometimes painful compromise.“Secondly, we needed a strong constitution that would provide the basic rules for our new society, that could guarantee the rights and security of all our individuals and communities,” de Klerk said.In order to reach a peaceful solution, he added, certain key requirements were necessary – including a genuine commitment by the parties and the right timing.“There had to be a genuine commitment to a negotiated solution by all the main parties,” he said. “The balance of forces had to be such that no party could successfully impose its will on the others. Timing was crucial.“Had we started our negotiation initiative earlier, say in the middle seventies, it is doubtful that we would have been able to take our followers with us. If had launched our initiative too late, we might have entered the negotiation process when the balance of power had begun to shift against us, as Ian Smith did in Zimbabwe.”The negotiating parties also had to learn to deal with extremists, de Klerk said.“Throughout the process there are extremists on the Right and on the Left who wanted to derail negotiations,” he said. “They did so by initiating violence and adopting some other strategies. It was terribly important not to give such extremist elements the power to stop the peace process.”The process of negotiations, de Klerk said, never ends.“Perhaps the main lesson that we have learned from our demographic transition is that the process never ends. It is not possible to rest on one’s laurels and imagine that one has solved all one’s problems. It is just as important to entrench constitutional values as it is to reach agreement on them.Our new Constitution was not an end in itself, but a framework within which we all must continue our search for a much fairer and a much more equal society.“We have learned that the success of all our communities is dependent on our willingness to accommodate one another’s reasonable concerns and interests, and we have learned that the process never ends. We will continue to wrestle with the great forces that change history, and we shall continue to search for leaders who can direct those forces towards peace and prosperity for all of us.”De Klerk was applauded loudly when he rejected discrimination of all kinds.“In a multiracial country like ours, where we have 11 official languages, one of the cornerstones of the negotiation which is now encapsulated in our constitution is that there shall not be discrimination on the basis of race or color or gender or whatever other basis,” he said.
“We are struggling to make that Constitution a living document because although by law you can forbid racism, you cannot easily eradicate it from the hearts of individuals. And therefore, apart from legal processes, it is fundamentally important that communities in multicultural societies shall find ways and means of building bridges instead of destroying them, of taking hands and of uniting behind common goals.”

<title>Deputy Defense Minister finds out mid-speech bus segregation was suspended</title>
<date>20/5/2015</date>
<content>
Deputy Defense Minister Eli Ben-Dahan was surprised mid-speech as he defended  segregated buses for Israelis and Palestinians Wednesday, only to find out that  the policy was put on hold.Ben-Dahan took the stand in the Knesset to  answer a query by MK Oren Hazan (Likud) about security arrangements on public  transportation, when MK Tamar Zandberg (Meretz) told the Deputy Defense Minister  about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon’s  change in policy, which was made public shortly before the speech.




“I  admit that I’m surprised by the suspension and say openly that I didn’t know and  no one updated me,” Ben-Dahan admitted, pointing out that it was his first day  on the job. “I think it is inappropriate to send me to give an answer without me  knowing.”Soon after, Ben-Dahan and Ya’alon’s offices discussed the  incident, with the latter saying it was a mistake. A senior adviser to  Ben-Dahan, Idit Druyan, said it was a result of “labor pains,” and that the  minister and his deputy will work on coordinating better.Still, another  Bayit Yehudi source hinted that Ya’alon intentionally did not inform Ben-Dahan,  saying: “The situation can make you understand why Ya’alon’s own colleague,  Likud MK Avi Dichter, refused to serve as a second deputy in the Defense  Ministry.”Ben-Dahan defended separate buses for Israelis and  Palestinians in the Knesset, even though the decision was suspended, saying:  “This is not apartheid. Stop blackening Israel’s name.“Unfortunately, we  had difficult years and over 1,500 people were killed just because they’re  Jewish and just because there are people who have a desire to murder Jews,” he  added.According to Ben-Dahan: “I didn’t say all Palestinians are  terrorists, but I am saying all terrorists are Palestinians.”Hazan  tweeted after the reversal that “the public is confused, and so are we [in the  Knesset],” and added eight minutes later: “Turns out the deputy defense minister  is confused, too.”In the plenum, Hazan said separating buses affects  Palestinians, “some of whom are murderers and terrorists. Stop comparing them to  Israeli Arabs!” According to the Likud MK, the plan was put on hold because of  pressure from leftwing extremists, but that this government was elected to  promote a right-wing agenda.Still, Zandberg called the proposal  “apartheid that cannot be hidden” and said Ben-Dahan should not hide behind  security as an excuse and should join Ya’alon in stopping to give in to demands  of “racist factors.”
Yesh Atid MK Ofer Shelah asked if it’s the Defense  Ministry’s policy to “have a serious discussion, make a stupid decision, face  all the international criticism and then cancel it?” “It turns out that despite  the work done, two comments on Facebook by the former interior minister [Gideon  Sa’ar] and others makes you cancel everything,” he added.

<title>Despite lackluster performance, Yisrael Beytenu meets voting threshold with 5 seats</title>
<date>17/3/2015</date>
<content>
Dozens of Yisrael Beytenu loyalists and members convened for a subdued gathering  at a banquet hall in Jerusalem’s Ramada Hotel Tuesday night to take in the  party’s lackluster showing after garnering a mere five seats in the day’s  election.According to numerous polls, the party was in jeopardy of not  procuring the four seats necessary to reach the minimum threshold. Still, after  the preliminary results were broadcast on three large projectors, the mood was  anything but celebratory.




“Of course it’s a disappointment from two  aspects,” said MK Dr. Shimon Ohayan, as talking heads broadcast live from the  ballroom. “It’s disappointing from the national point of view, which stated that  we were the leading party, and from the social aspect.”Stating that  Yisrael Beytenu was on the forefront of socioeconomic matters, including  prohibitive housing costs, nursery assistance and promoting the status of  teachers in the country, Ohayan described the event as an “Irish  Wake.”Nonetheless, he said he held out hope that the party’s anemic  numbers may look up by the morning.“We have to wait until tomorrow  because right now it’s only a poll,” he said. “I hope that by the morning things  will improve.”During the drawn-out campaign, party leader Avigdor  Liberman said the party’s list of 34 MKs represented “the whole spectrum of  Israeli society,” including “men, women, Druse, Muslims, Jews, mayors,  kibbutzniks and professors.”As recently as January 15 Liberman claimed a  poll sponsored by his party indicated it would garner eight seats in the next  Knesset, although he said his goal was a lofty, if not entirely unrealistic, 16  seats.During a January press conference, Liberman focused on the current  conflict, stating that it is not between Israel and the Palestinians, but rather  between Jews and Arabs.However, citing Muhammad Zoabi – the Israeli-Arab  teenage cousin of MK Haneen Zoabi (Balad) who spoke out as a Zionist during  Operation Protective Edge, and subsequently went into hiding due to death  threats – Liberman emphasized that there is a place in Israeli society for loyal  Arabs.Declaring that “the norm has to change,” Liberman said Arab’s  loyal to Israel must no longer be vilified in their communities as  pariahs.“We talk about Jews in Europe who are afraid to wear a kippa or  peyot [side locks]... What angered me [about this case] is that a supporter of  Israel had to run away with no protection and was made an anathema to his  society,” Liberman said.Accordingly, Liberman said Israeli Arabs who are  loyal to the nation can remain Israeli, but that “there is no reason for  [Haneen] Zoabi, [UALTa’al MK Ahmed] Tibi or the northern branch of the Islamic  Movement to remain Israeli citizens” when a Palestinian state is  formed.During the campaign, Liberman contended that his party was best  equipped to champion Jewish interests.“Yisrael Beytenu is the only party  with a pragmatic approach from the Right – the nationalist camp – that will have  a Jewish state in the maximum amount of land and [Jewish] people,” he  said.Moreover, Liberman claimed his rivals were not up to the  task.“[Labor leader Isaac] Herzog proposed his ideas at Camp David with  [then prime minister Ehud] Barak [in 2000], and [Tzipi] Livni did at Annapolis  [in 2007], and they failed,” he said. [Bayit Yehudi leader Naftali] Bennett’s  plan will lead to either a binational state or apartheid.”In the  meantime, Ashley Perry, who was number 20 on Yisrael Beytenu’s list, said he was  at least heartened the party’s turnout defied predictions of political  ruin.“We’re still waiting for the final results, but what’s clear is  that those who tried to write us off the political map did not succeed,” he  said.

<title>Erdan on LGBT, Duma attacks: Slamming political rivals isn't the way to bring change</title>
<date>4/8/2015</date>
<content>
A discussion of last week's attacks on the Jerusalem LGBT parade and Palestinian homes in Duma grew heated in the Knesset Wednesday, with left-wing MKs calling for the Right to take responsibility and right-wing MKs saying they are not to blame.MK Tzipi Livni (Zionist Union) opened the discussion: "For a moment, it seemed that everyone was shocked together and that we would understand we need serious self-examination...but then came the after-shock.




"I hear voices from [the Right] that say they feel like they did after [former prime minister Yitzhak] Rabin was assassinated," she stated. "We will not let you ignore us, blame us and turn yourselves into victims. It's easy to say this is a fringe phenomenon; I don't accept that."According to Livni, the line between the fringes and the mainstream blurred because of a lack of leadership by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who allowed it to happen."I will not cooperate with this victimhood. The victim is Shira Banki who was murdered at the parade and not someone who wasn't allowed to speak at a demonstration," she added, in reference to Education Minister Naftali Bennett who was banned from an LGBT rally Saturday night.Livni proposed that the Knesset pass "Shira's Law" - immediately approving LGBT unions.Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid pointed out that the vast majority of the coalition's seats in the plenum were empty for the discussion saying that those who were absent were running away from responsibility, because they're worried taking part will hurt them in the next party primary.Shas and UTJ, the only coalition parties that had zero lawmakers present at any time in the meeting, do not hold primaries, though Bayit Yehudi does and their only MK there was Agriculture Minister Uri Ariel - elected by the Tekuma central committee - who left after a few minutes."We cannot stand silent in the face of the leadership vacuum that allowed violence to happen last weekend. The government and the Knesset are not an empty chair. They must stand up against the forces of evil," Lapid stated.MK Erel Margalit (Zionist Union) was brought to tears during his speech, in which he talked about raising three children in Jerusalem during the intifada. He quoted Psalms in a warning to right-wing MKs who he said have created an atmosphere that legitimizes racism and incitement: "Who is the man who wants life?...Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from fraud. Stay away from evil and do good; ask for peace and pursue it."MK Aida Touma-Sliman (Joint List) said Ali Dawabshe, the baby who was burned alive in the firebombing attack, was "murdered at the hands of right-wing fascists who plan day and night to harm Palestinians, but the matches...were given to them by the occupation policy."The Joint List MK expanded the blame for the attack in Duma to the entire State of Israel and all its institutions, calling it an apartheid state, and did not mention the stabbing at the parade at all.Meretz lawmaker Esawi Frej said that deadly racism against Arabs has become legitimate, and now it has moved to the entire Left."People keep talking about a small group, but now that group has become the majority, the mainstream. The prime minister is responsible, and in my eyes, this is mostly his fault," Frej stated.Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan responded, representing the government, and was met with loud shouts from Meretz MKs."We as a society must do soul-searching and think about how to encourage more tolerance and restraint and how we can all improve as a society and a country," Erdan said. "In a place where books - or a bilingual school or a church - people will be burned."Erdan said it is foremost the government's responsibility to try to prevent the next incident and exhaust all legal tools it has to be more proactive, put the murderers on trial and make sure they are punished to the full extent of the law.Of the Right, Erdan said "the political camp that I am part of also needs to find ways to fix and improve and make sure there are no such people among us."However, Erdan told those who spoke before him that he thinks they did not react in the right way to the attacks."To say this isn't a minority, to try to hunt down the opposing political camp is not what will bring a change. I heard statements here that simply ignore reality," he added, calling the Left hypocritical."You are apathetic time and again when Molotov cocktails are thrown at settlers. When did any of you last demand that those throw throw firebombs in east Jerusalem or Route 443 every day be arrested?" Erdan asked. "MK Frej, when you visited [Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas] did you ask him why he pays terrorists who were proven to have killed innocent families? I don't remember any of you being shocked at an atmosphere of incitement and encouragement of terrorism against settlers like there was when people blamed the kidnapping of the three teens [last summer] on the fact that they hitchhiked or lived in settlements."Erdan's speech was peppered with shouts from Meretz MKs Tamar Zandberg, Ilan Gilon and Frej of "shame on you.""You can't handle the truth," MK Oren Hazan (Likud) shouted at the Meretz legislators."Shut up," was Gilon's response.Erdan told the Meretz MKs that laws can be changed but the immediate thing politicians can do is set an example."What I have done here is put a mirror in front of you and showed you what you did earlier. I'm glad to see that this annoyed you, because that is exactly what you did to earn political points by only blaming the other side," he said.MK Ahmed Tibi (Joint List) said the government's policies politically back the arsonists."He who says Arabs are flowing to the voting booths knows that he is considering the Palestinians to be a lowlier breed, which means they are not human, and are worthy of being burned," he stated.Tibi compared the attack to Kristallnacht and called its perpetrators "neo-Nazis living in settlements."Hazan interrupted, shouting that Tibi used to be an advisor to an arch-terrorist, Yasser Arafat, and when he took the stand, he accused Tibi of cheapening the memory of the Holocaust."When MKs from the Left say these extremists are part of the Right, they are the ones legitimizing them, instead of saying they are outside of either camp," Hazan said. "There are MKs sitting here who don't blink an eye at the rivers of Jewish blood that was shed...I didn't see Tzipi Livni criticize the incitement against the prime minister through [doctored] photos of him in Nazi uniforms or the incitement we heard here."Hazan added: "We didn't kill Rabin, we didn't stab Shira and we didn't burn Ali...We will not take responsibility for actions that we didn't take. We will reject and criticize them, just like we criticize you for spewing hate time after time."

<title>PA: We hope election will help push international community to revive peace process</title>
<date>18/3/2015</date>
<content>
The Palestinian Authority on Wednesday expressed hope that the election in  Israel would prompt the international community to revive a “serious and  effective” peace process.The PA said that it would deal with the next  Israeli government “regardless of its coalition makeup and who would head  it.”




A statement issued by the PA Foreign Ministry said that while the  Palestinians did not intervene in the internal affairs of Israel, they were  hoping the elections would provide the international community with an  opportunity to restart the diplomatic process.The ministry said that the  peace process should be based on the international terms of reference for peace  – the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002, halting settlement construction and  establishing an independent Palestinian state on the pre-1967 lines with east  Jerusalem as its capital.The Palestinians would pursue their political  and diplomatic efforts to preserve Palestinian rights and “expose Israeli  violations against our people, our land and our holy sites,” the PA ministry  said.It vowed to continue working toward prosecuting Israelis for war  crimes at the International Criminal Court.Chief PLO negotiator Saeb  Erekat said that the results of the election “show the success of a campaign  platform based on settlements, racism, apartheid and the denial of the  fundamental human rights of the Palestinian people.”Such a result would  not have been possible had the international community held Israel to account  for its “systematic violations of international law,” Erekat said.He  urged the international community to support Palestinian efforts to  “internationalize our struggle for dignity and freedom through the International  Criminal Court and through all peaceful means.”One Israeli government  official responded to Erekat by saying that it was “difficult to take him  seriously,” since his government “signed a pact with Hamas, a brutal terrorist  organization committed to Israel’s destruction.”The official added that  it was also difficult to take Erekat seriously as the PA “conducts a propaganda  campaign encouraging hatred of Israel and denying the very legitimacy of the  country.”Nabil Abu Rudaineh, spokesman for PA President Mahmoud Abbas,  said that the Palestinians would continue to deal with any government in Israel  that abides by international resolutions and the two-state solution.“We  are not interested in who becomes the prime minister in Israel,” Abu Rudaineh  said. “What we want from any government is to recognize the two-state solution,  with east Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian state. Without that, there  would be no chance for the peace process.”Several PLO officials in  Ramallah called on the PA leadership to pursue its efforts to file war crime  charges against Israelis with the International Criminal Court in wake of the  results of the Israeli election. They called on the PA to endorse a recent PLO  Central Committee decision to halt security coordination with Israel.The  PLO said in a statement that the results of the election show that Israel has  chosen “racism and occupation” instead of negotiations with the  Palestinians.PLO Secretary-General Yasser Abed Rabbo said that the  Palestinians do not see any difference between various Israeli  parties.“All the parties are faces for the same coin of terrorism,” he  added.Hamas described the results of the election as a declaration of  war against the Palestinians. Ahmed Bahr, a senior Hamas official in the Gaza  Strip, said that the results show that Israeli voters support “extremism and  crime.”Bahr called on Abbas and the PA leadership to cut off their ties  with Israel and “return to the option of resistance and unity.”Another  Hamas official, Izzat al-Risheq, predicted the collapse of the peace process in  wake of the election.
“The victory of [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu  shows that the Zionist society is headed toward more extremism,” he said.  “Netanyahu is a terrorist and those who voted for him are like him.”

<title>Erekat: Recognizing 'Palestine' as a state is best response to 450 new settlement homes</title>
<date>30/1/2015</date>
<content>
PLO chief negotiator Saeb Erekat called on the international community to recognize Palestine as a state in response to a Lands Authority publication on Friday morning of tenders for 450 new homes in West Bank settlements.“We call on the international community to recognize the State of Palestine," Erekat said. He also asked the international community to “ban all settlement products and to divest from companies and institutions linked directly or indirectly with the Israeli occupation and apartheid policies.”




The new tenders are for projects in the following West Bank settlements; 156 in Elkana, 114 homes in Geva Binyamin (Adam), 102 in Kiryat Araba and 78 in Alfei Menashe.In addition, a tender was published for a hotel in the Ma’aleh Adumim settlement as well as for business buildings in that city and in the Emmanuel settlement.According to Peace Now, a plan to construct 93 new homes in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Gilo was deposited for public review with a municipal planning committee.Many of the building projects are not new. The tenders have been unsuccessfully issued for in the past, but contractors did not buy them.Still Erekat said that the publication of the tenders proved that the Palestinians must seek a two-state solution through the international community and not by directly negotiating with Israel.“This should serve as yet another reminder that empty calls for resumption of negotiations are not a substitute for justice and will not save the two-state solution.” Erekat said. The US opposes Jewish building over the pre-1967 lines, because it believes it is detrimental to ongoing US efforts behind the scenes to return Israelis and Palestinians to the negotiating table.On Tuesday, US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, “We continue to believe that final status negotiations are the only way for the parties to reach a peaceful resolution, and we continue to work to move forward that objective.”The last US led round of Israeli Palestinian negotiations  ended in April 2014, with no tangible signs of progress. Since then, the Palestinians have increased their efforts solicit the international community to impose on Israel a two-state solution at the pre-1967 lines.Israel has insisted that settlement building has no relationship to the peace process and that such construction continued during past periods of negotiation such as Oslo in the 1990s, Camp David in 2000 and Annapolis in 2008.It has further noted that the ten-month moratorium Netanyahu imposed on settler housing starts from November 2009 to September 2010 did not led to renewed negotiations.The Palestinians, in turn, have said that settlement activity is illegal under international law and must be halted. “Once again we call upon the international community to stop treating Israel as a state above the law and to support our diplomatic initiatives which aim to preserve the two-state solution and to end the Israeli oppression of our people,” Erekat said.Opponents of Netanyahu, immediately attacked him over the publication of the tenders for new settlement building.The non-governmental group Peace Now, which opposes any Jewish building over the pre-1967 lines, immediately charged that it was yet one more attempt by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to embarrass the President Barack Obama."It is a pre-election grab to establish facts on the ground made by the Netanyahu Government. After embarrassing the Obama administration with the invitation to the congress, Netanyahu adds another slam in the face of the Americans, and showing no respect to Israel's closest ally,” its Executive Director Yaariv Oppenheimer said.Former US ambassador to the US Michael Oren, who is running for the Knesset on the Koolanu ticket said it was a mistake for Israel to announce new settlement units."In light of the events of this week [Hezbollah's attack on the northern border}, a more appropriate Zionist response, would have been to build in the  Golan Heights and northern communities rather than in Kiryat Arba,” Oren said."This move certainly does not contribute to our relationship with the United States. It does not strengthen Israel's ability to defend itself, nor does it allow it to garner international support for that defense,” Oren said.Labor MK Stav Shapir slammed both Netanyahu and Economic Affairs Minister Naftali Bennet who heads the Bayit Yehudi party.
Both men, she said, have a “distorted sense of priorities” in which they focus attention and funds on a small sector of Israeli society rather then looking out for the greater good.

<title>Exclusive: Shaked urges Europeans she meets to quit funding pro-BDS groups</title>
<date>14/10/2015</date>
<content>
When Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked meets with counterparts from around the  world she checks which NGOs accused of being anti-Israel that these countries  fund, she told The Jerusalem Post in an interview on Wednesday.She  presents these ministers with a list of the NGOs and then asks to stop funding  them, she said.




“I do this with every European minister I meet,” Shaked  said. “Sometimes they have no idea. They think these are human rights  organizations and don’t realize they are working with BDS.”Shaked gave  the Post a copy of the list she showed Spanish Justice Minister Rafael Catala  Polo in July, who told her he opposes attempts to boycott, divest from or  sanction Israel.The list included six organizations, six in Israel,  which the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation (AECID) provides with an  annual NIS 1,622,202.Another three groups on the list, also funded by  AECID, operate in West Bank areas under Palestinian Authority  administration.Among the Israeli organizations on Shaked’s list were  Breaking the Silence, a group founded by former IDF combat soldiers that  criticizes Israeli policy in the West Bank.Shaked’s chart says the group  engages in “war crimes allegations, lobbying the EU and UN.”The chart  accuses Bimkom, another Israeli left-wing NGO which helps Palestinian towns in  Area C, of involvement in “apartheid rhetoric [and] Beduin campaigns.” The group  received more than a million shekels in funding.Hamoked, an NGO funded  by AECID in the name of defending human rights, is accused by Shaked’s list of  supporting “apartheid rhetoric and legal actions” against Israel.The  Palestinian organizations listed include Applied Research Institute Jerusalem,  Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committees and Al-Haq, all accused of being  active in BDS campaigns.Shaked’s chart also shows Al-Haq as having ties  to the PFLP terrorist group.Asked about the topic of administrative  detention, Shaked called it a “very draconian” measure that should “only be used  in extreme circumstances.”Israel has been criticized for years for  carrying out administrative detentions, a measure used against Palestinians  suspected of involvement in terrorism, sometimes putting hundreds at a time  behind bars without trial.Right-wing politicians who traditionally  support the measure have criticized it since August when three Jewish settler  activists were jailed without trial after an arson attack in Duma that killed  four members of a Palestinian family.Activists have exploded in anger  against the settlers being detained without fully knowing the charges against  them.Shaked, expressing a view unpopular with many backers, said she  supported the measure being implemented “after Duma,” which she called a serious  “attack.” She added that the law enforcement establishment had cited evidence  pointing to the three who were jailed as posing a “danger to the  state.”Shaked added that the state may also approve administrative  detention in the future for Palestinians or Israeli-Arabs who post plans on  social media sites to “become a shahid [martyr].” But she said the measure would  only be used under “very extreme circumstances.”She demurred at legal  expert Mordechai Kremnitzer’s suggestion of providing detainees with a means to  challenge arrests by naming a special defense counsel to review classified  evidence.“To tell you the truth, it’s not very simple, once you do it”  and decide a case is “very extreme” she was “not in favor of” opening up such  follow-up processes, Shaked said.Moving on to the status of efforts to  legalize unauthorized Jewish settlements and outposts in the West Bank, Shaked  was lower key than expected.A committee chaired by cabinet secretary  Avichai Mandelblit had a mid-September deadline to resolve the issue.But  nearly a month since that deadline has passed, Shaked suggested no immediate  announcement or report would be issued, saying the committee “was working on the  issue on an ongoing basis.”A source in the Prime Minister’s Office said  the committee has met seven times, including on Tuesday, “that the legal issues  are complex” and the “work is ongoing.”
Shaked will speak at The  Jerusalem Post Diplomatic Conference in Jerusalem on November 18.

<title>Ex-Mossad chief pans Netanyahu's 'bulls---' speech to Congress</title>
<date>6/3/2015</date>
<content>
Meir Dagan, the former head of Mossad, eviscerated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress this past week.In an interview with Channel 2 that aired on Friday evening, Dagan is seen watching the speech while using harsh, blunt language to describe some of the claims made by the premier before US lawmakers in Washington.




When Netanyahu said that Iran could sprint to a nuclear device in less than a year, Dagan said that the assessment was "bullshit."“It will take more time than that,” he said.The former Mossad chief also ridiculed Netanyahu’s assertion that Iran posed a threat to the United States."Iranian missiles will never be able to hit the United States," Dagan said.When Netanyahu remarked that Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, “spews the oldest hatred of anti-Semitism with the newest technology,” Dagan shook his head, remarking: “That’s not true. [Khamenei is disseminating] the old doctrine of Khomeini.”As the prime minister was being applauded by US lawmakers for declaring that “Israel’s soldiers have boundless courage” and that “Israel was capable of defending itself,” Dagan said: “That’s a threat to attack.”The former Mossad chief said that Netanyahu’s appearance before Congress was “a political speech that caused diplomatic and defense damage to Israel.”He said that while a nuclear-armed Iran would pose “an almost intolerable threat” to Israel, the public manner in which Netanyahu has challenged US President Barack Obama has hurt attempts to curb the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program.When asked whether he believed Obama was serious in promising to never allow Iran to gain a nuclear weapon, Dagan said: “We have no choice but to believe him.”He said that “there were days of dealing with” the Iranian nuclear program without resorting to a military operation. Dagan said that while he would not rule out a military strike at some point in the future, “we are not there yet.”Dagan told Channel 2 that during the previous Netanyahu administration, he was under the impression that the premier and his defense minister at the time, Ehud Barak, were on the verge of ordering a military strike on Iran.“I thought we were very close to it,” he said. Dagan said that he and other defense chief voiced their opinions on the matter at the time behind closed doors.He also charged Netanyahu will failing to “defeat” Hamas this past summer during Operation Protective Edge.The former Mossad director, who will be the keynote speaker at a mass anti-Netanyahu rally planned for Saturday night in Tel Aviv, said that the prime minister’s policies “will bring about an end to the Zionist dream.”“On the Palestinian matter, his policies are leading to either a binational state or an apartheid state,” Dagan told Channel 2.“I served this country 45 years, fighting for this country to be a Jewish and Zionist state. I don’t want this to disappear. I don’t want this to happen. It could lead to the end of the Zionist dream.”“The manner in which the prime minister and Mr. [Naftali] Bennett are leading us will bring about a binational state. I think that would be a disaster.”

<title>FIFA ban would be a 'tsunami' for Israeli soccer, former top official says</title>
<date>29/5/2015</date>
<content>
Jacob Erel, the Israeli official who once headed UEFA’s Operations Committee, is still one of the most well-versed and knowledgeable people who can explain the complex legal conundrum that will be decided on Friday when FIFA’s Congress votes whether to suspend Israel.“The danger of Israel being expelled certainly exists, particularly because this has nothing to do with athletics and everything to do with politics,” Erel told The Jerusalem Post’s Hebrew-language sister publication Ma’ariv Hashavua. “[Palestinian Football Association chief] Jibril Rajoub wants to make noise, and there is no more prominent place to do it than the FIFA Congress. I assume he also has personal reasons.”




A vast majority of the 54 European members are likely to vote against the proposal, meaning it is likely the Palestinian proposal will be defeated, as 75 percent – 157 members – of the 209-member body are needed for it to pass.Nonetheless, Erel warns that the motion’s failure is not guaranteed.“I hope that we do not come to this awful moment [when Israel is voted out of FIFA], because this would be a tsunami for Israeli soccer,” he said. “Israel is a member of two organizational bodies - UEFA, which is the European soccer confederation, and FIFA, which is the global umbrella organization.”“UEFA chief Michel Platini could certainly decree that since FIFA’s decision was political, Israel could stay in Europe, but we wouldn’t be able to participate in the World Cup qualifiers, for example,” Erel said. “We will also have a huge problem with refereeing since all of the international referees have FIFA badges.”“I say this with great caution, since such a situation would be unprecedented,” he said. “We will be isolated, without the capacity to compete in any tournament belonging to UEFA. Israeli players won’t be able to play on teams outside of the Israeli Premier League, and foreign players won’t be able to play here.”The Israel Football Association is concerned that FIFA’s corruption scandal could hurt its chances in the vote.“Undoubtedly there is a lot of politics going on here, and unfortunately Israel’s position is not great,” Rotem Kamer, chief executive of the IFA, told Walla. “We are being portrayed as an apartheid state.”Kamer said the confluence of a reelection bid by Blatter and the arrest in Zurich of seven senior figures in the organization on US corruption charges was not helping Israel.“There is no way of knowing which way the vote will go when Blatter is seeking reelection.
There is no doubt that he can be pressured, also because of the affair that has just exploded,” Kamer said. “He needs the Arab votes and it could be that to this end, Israel will have to be sacrificed.”

<title>Force-feeding law is 'license to kill Palestinian prisoners,' PA says</title>
<date>30/7/2015</date>
<content>
Legislation allowing prisoners on hunger strike to be force-fed violates the  prisoners’ human rights, Arab MKs, the PLO and several NGOs said on Thursday,  after the bill became law that morning.The Public Security Ministry bill  passed into law with 46 in favor and 40 opposed shortly after 6 a.m., after more  than four hours of speeches as part of a filibuster that fizzled out almost 10  hours earlier than expected.




Knesset Interior Committee chairman David  Amsalem (Likud) argued that the bill “creates the correct balance between the  state’s interest to defend the life of the prisoner and his right and  sovereignty over his own body.”The law allows the prisons commissioner  to ask the attorney- general and the president of a district court for  authorization to have a doctor force-feed a prisoner on a hunger strike – if the  doctor finds that the strike would cause irreparable damage or the prisoner is  in immediate, mortal danger. The request can only be made after trying to get  the prisoner to agree to the treatment, and the court must hear the prisoner’s  position on the matter. The force-feeding would take place via a feeding tube or  infusions, and a prison guard can use reasonable force if the prisoner  resists.MK Basel Ghattas (Joint List) said a hunger strike is a  prisoner’s last resort after all his rights are taken away.Fellow Joint  List MK and former physician Ahmad Tibi agreed: “A hunger strike is the last  thing a prisoner feels he can do between the prison walls, certainly when it  comes to someone under administrative detention,” he explained.“Using a  feeding tube is very rough for the patient... I call on every doctor in Israel  not to cooperate with this terrible law, which is meant to torture  prisoners.”After the law passed, MK Haneen Zoabi (Joint List) said it  tramples basic human rights and came from “cold, calculated political  considerations.”“This is an apartheid state and I don’t understand those  who insist on closing their eyes while barbaric laws are authorized that let the  state treat humans, imprisoned for political reasons and held in inhumane  conditions, like animals,” she continued. “The Israeli public sits in silence  and lets its government fatten up people [like animals], choosing to be  blind.This blindness will strike back at Israel like a  boomerang.”The force-feeding law is tantamount to a license to kill  Palestinian prisoners, Issa Qaraqi, head of the Palestinian Authority’s  Prisoners Commission, said on Thursday. The legislation is also a form of  “immoral torture” against the prisoners and a “very dangerous precedent,” he  said.Qaraqi warned that force-feeding could lead to death, as happened  in 1980, when three inmates who were on hunger strike died after authorities  tried to feed them by force.The PA official claimed that this was the  first law of its kind in the world. He called on the international community to  “assume its responsibilities toward the Palestinian prisoners,” adding that the  legislation violates international laws and conventions.PLO Executive  Committee member Hanan Ashrawi also condemned the law, saying it “affirms  Israel’s racism and arrogance.” The law will allow Israel to “continue  committing its crimes” against Palestinian prisoners, Ashrawi said.A  spokesman for Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel said  the legislation authorizes torture and is meant to break the hunger-striker’s  spirit by violating his right to autonomy over his body. And a spokesman for  Amnesty International Israel said it does not believe the government’s claim  that the measure is meant to save the lives of prisoners, rather, it is  political and meant to silence protest.“Since the Israeli occupation,  thousands of Palestinian prisoners sat in Israeli prisons and dozens went on  hunger strike.Five died while being force-fed [one in 1970, two in 1980,  one in 1984 and one in 1992]. When [Public Security Minister Gilad] Erdan, says  ‘We won’t let anyone threaten us and we won’t let prisoners die in our prisons,’  he means that the Prisons Service will decide how the prisoner will die –  through force-feeding,” the Amnesty spokesman said, calling for Israel to  eliminate what the NGO said is the main problem: administrative  detentions.Israel Medical Association chairman Leonid Eidelman plans to  petition the High Court of Justice against the law.Eidelman sent a  letter to doctors calling the legislation a “badge of shame in the Israeli law  books” and pointing out that a district court can only authorize a doctor to  force-feed a prisoner, but not require him or her to do  so.“Force-feeding is a serious danger to [the prisoner’s] health and  opposes four principles of ethics. It is against the IMA’s ethical code and  those accepted in the world,” the letter reads.“Doctors should continue  treating those on hunger strike as they did until now, professionally and  according to the ethical code.“Force-feeding is torture. A doctor may  not take part in torture,” Eidelman wrote.Physicians for Human  Rights-Israel commented: “The Knesset this morning took a shameful vote that  exposes the anti-democratic face of its members. This is a law that forces the  Israeli medical community to violate in the most serious way medical ethics for  political goals as used to be done in the past in dark regimes. We will continue  to struggle against this law and its implementation.”The organization  added that “the test of the medical community is on the day after the passage –  in doctors’ absolute refusal to serve as a fig leaf for torture. We will not  leave alone individual doctors and nurses or wait for one of them to give in to  force-feeding. This is a shocking law that turns the medical profession into a  tool for policing, punishing and suppressing. We will support everyone who  refuses to carry it out and will stand against all attempts to force feed hunger  strikers.”

<title>Israel slams small US church for passing divestment measure</title>
<date>1/7/2015</date>
<content>
The Foreign Ministry slammed the million- member United States-based United  Church of Christ (UCC) on Wednesday for passing a resolution calling for the  boycott of settlement products and the divestment from companies that “profit  from the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.”“The UCC resolutions on  the Middle East conflict have reflected the most radical politics for more than  a decade, and in no way reflect a moral stance or reality based position,” a  ministry statement said. “People of faith ought to be acting to help Israel and  the Palestinians to renew efforts to achieve peace, rather than endlessly  demonizing one part in the conflict – in our view, the aggrieved  party.”




One of the more well-known churches affiliated with this movement  is Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, which for many years was headed  by controversial pastor Jeremiah Wright. US President Barack Obama attended  Trinity for years, before quitting during the presidential campaign in 2008 as a  result of a series of incendiary statements made by Wright.The  divestment decision was taken at the liberal denomination’s biennial General  Synod. Two other Protestant churches – the Episcopal Church, with under 2  million members, and the Mennonite Church USA, with under 100,000 adherents –  were scheduled to take up similar divestment resolutions this week.“The  UCC believes that the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is one of the  most enduring conflicts of our time, and remains deeply concerned about the  violence perpetuated through acts of terror and by the occupation,” a statement  issued by the church stated. “The church considers Tuesday’s actions a next step  in the UCC’s involvement with peace in the Middle East.”The resolution  passed by a vote of 508 to 124. Another resolution, characterizing Israel’s  actions in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as “apartheid,” received 51% of the  vote, but did not pass because a two-thirds majority is needed for  passage.The UCC has position statements for five issues listed on its  website: marriage equality and LGBTQ rights; the Middle East; racial justice;  social responsible investing; and literacy.The position paper on the  Middle East addresses only the Israeli-Palestinian issue, and says nothing about  the slaughter of tens of thousands of people, including Christians, in the  region over the last five years.UCC membership has declined sharply over  the last 50 years, going from some 2.1 million members in 1965, to just under a  million today – a steep decline of 52 percent. The church is concentrated  heavily in Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Connecticut, and  Massachusetts.
Like other mainline Protestant denominations, the UCC  declined significantly in the last decade, and according to its own statistical  abstract lost 696 congregations and some 319,000 members from 2000 to 2010.

<title>Glick: We’re here to protest against apartheid on the Temple Mount</title>
<date>14/7/2015</date>
<content>
Nearly 10 months after being shot four times by a terrorist for his staunch advocacy of Jewish prayer and visitation rights on the Temple Mount, Yehudah Glick on Tuesday evening led a protest in the Old City reaffirming his controversial position.“We’re here calling out for the recognition that Jews are also human beings, and we’re here to protest against the apartheid on the Temple Mount, where there is a total difference between if you are a Muslim or you are any other person,” he said at the gathering near Dung Gate.




Glick called for the protest amid a police-enforced closure to non-Muslim visitors to the contested holy site for security reasons during Ramadan.While the police announced that the Temple Mount will be closed to non-Muslim visitors for the last 10 days of Ramadan, Glick cited three weeks.“And we’re here to call out the Israeli government to stop the discrimination against Jews and non-Muslims in general on the Temple Mount for freedom to pray, freedom to breathe, freedom to move your lips, freedom to bow down – freedom to just move with respect to all the other people on the Temple Mount.”Glick continued, “There is no reason in the world why Jews should not have basic human rights.”Although the Supreme Court has upheld Jewish prayer rights at the Temple Mount – which is overseen by the Wakf Muslim religious trust – it also allows police to prevent any form of worship there if they believe such activities will incite a “disturbance to the public order.”This caveat has resulted in a contentious debate among religious Jews and the government, as any form of public prayer among Jews there – including moving their lips to appear to be praying – is considered a “public disturbance,” and has resulted in detainments.Glick contends that the police-enforced closure for Jews represents a capitulation to terrorism.“We see this as an escalation, because in the past Ramadans they would close it for three days,” he said. “Now this year they’re closing it for three weeks, and the situation on the Temple Mount is becoming unbearable because every single Jew who goes up the Temple Mount becomes a victim of harassment and violence and we have to put a stop to this.”Asked his core demands from the government, Glick cited two key variables.“We want Jews to be protected against violence and against the radical Muslim incitement, hate and terror,” he said. “And we want to recognize Jewish human rights on the Temple Mount.”In terms of his health, Glick – who underwent numerous surgeries to stem the grievous damage he sustained during his October assassination attempt – said that while he is still in the midst of physical therapy sessions and other treatment, he remains undaunted in his mission.“My last checkup in the hospital found that my lungs are functioning 70 percent, but my motivation is 200 percent,” he said. “As for my mission, my energy is multiplying itself every single day.”Yaacov Hayman, who leads a Temple Mount prayer rights NGO, echoed Glick’s sentiments regarding Jewish prayer and visitation rights.“We are not willing to allow a situation where our civil rights are violated – where we can’t go up to the Mount freely in groups 24-hours a day, seven days a week, and pray there freely,” he said.Noah Abramowitz, a 20-year-old IDF conscript who attended the protest, said the issue comes down to religious freedom.“I think this is a basic right of the Jewish people to pray at the holiest site [in Judaism] and express their religious sentiments in their state,” he said. “The fact that such a right is denied us is a little short of a travesty.”
In the meantime, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has remained unmoved by such protestations, repeatedly stating that the present status-quo on the Temple Mount limiting Jewish visitation and prayer rights will not be amended.

<title>Hotovely to Brazil: Approve Dayan, or face 'crisis in relations' with Israel</title>
<date>27/12/2015</date>
<content>
Brazil’s continued failure to approve the appointment of ex-settlement leader  Dani Dayan as Israel’s ambassador will lead to a diplomatic crisis between the  two countries, Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely warned on  Sunday.Hotovely, in a an interview on Channel 10, said the current  ambassador to Brazil, Raed Mansour, returned to Israel last week, and that  Jerusalem has no intention of naming anyone to replace him other than  Dayan.




If Dayan is not approved, Israel will be represented in Brasilia  by its No. 2 diplomat there.Hotovely and Foreign Ministry  director-general Dore Gold met in the Prime Minister’s Office on Sunday with  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s foreign policy adviser Jonathan Schachter to  discuss what steps to take in light of Brazil’s’ continued failure to approve  Dayan’s appointment.Netanyahu did not take part in the  meeting.The prime minister announced Dayan’s appointment in August, but  Brazil has since refused to approve it, with the government there coming under  pressure from Palestinians, and from far-left circles in Israel and Brazil, not  to accept the appointment because Dayan lives in Ma’aleh Shomron – beyond the  Green Line – and is the former head of the Council of Jewish Communities of  Judea and Samaria.Hotovely said there has never been a case where an  Israeli ambassadorial appointment has not been accepted by a host country  because of the candidate’s ideological positions.She attributed the  situation to the deep political crisis in which Brazil currently finds itself,  with President Dilma Rousseff facing impeachment proceedings and needing all  votes – including from the far-left that is championing the move to keep Dayan  out – to remain in power.Hotovely said Israel was now bringing its  campaign to get Dayan approved out from behind the scenes and into the open, and  will use all the means at its disposal to get it approved, including waging a  public campaign in Brazil, mobilizing the Jewish community there, and not naming  a replacement for Mansour.These steps will be taken, she said, to tell  Brasilia that Dayan is “a man who is respectable, worthy, and accepted across  Israel’s political spectrum.” Jerusalem, she said, will use these steps to say  to Brazil, “Approve him, because if not we are talking about a crisis in  relations between the two countries, and it is not worth going  there.”After months of remaining silent on the matter, Dayan said on  Saturday night in an interview on Channel 2 that the issue was not a bilateral  matter between Israel and Brazil, but rather a “classic BDS” (boycott,  divestment and sanctions) issue that BDS activists in Israel, among the  Palestinians and in Brazil have pounced upon.He called in that interview  for Israel to change its tactics on the matter, and to move from a position of  “sitting and doing nothing,” in the hope that the matter will be quietly  resolved, to taking a more aggressive stance.Dayan said there was “an  optical illusion here,” and that at issue was not whether he would be Israel’s  next ambassador to Brazil, but rather whether any resident of Judea and Samaria  would ever be able to be an ambassador for Israel.Brazil’s refusal to  approve him was tantamount to labeling people from the settlements, not products  from the settlements, he said.If, indeed, settlement residents are  disqualified from serving as ambassadors because of where they live, then former  ambassador to the US Sallai Meridor, a resident of Kfar Adumim, would not have  been able to serve, nor would have Alan Baker, a resident of Har Adar, been able  to serve as the envoy to Canada.Dayan said the initial assessment in  Jerusalem that if the issue were just kept quiet, it would go away and he would  get the appointment, has turned out to be false, and that now new tactics were  needed.“I think that just as Israel reacted sharply about labeling  products, it has to react to labeling people. Labeling people is worse than  labeling goods,” Dayan said.Following the EU’s decision to label  settlement products last month, Netanyahu directed the Foreign Ministry to  suspend contacts with EU institutions when it comes to the diplomatic process  with the Palestinians. “I think the government, the state, has to take a stand  on this issue,” Dayan said.“The question is not whether I will be the  ambassador to Brazil or not, what will be determined now is whether the next  settler, the next resident of Judea and Samaria who is chosen to be an  ambassador, can fill a diplomatic role, or whether we will agree that the  700,000 Israelis [living beyond the Green Line] are not eligible to be  ambassadors.”Dayan said that while Israel has taken a quiet approach on  the matter, the Palestinians have been actively trying to torpedo his  appointment, with PLO chief negotiator Saeb Erekat “up to his neck in the  matter.”The San Paulo newspaper Folha De S. Paulo quoted Erekat last  week as saying Brazil would lose trust if it agrees to the “war crimes,  apartheid and colonization, which is what Dani Dayan represents.”Erekat  said Dayan was an “illegal settler whose work is to justify Israel’s criminal  colonization of Palestine.”Meanwhile, Folha reported on Friday that the  Brazilian military has come out against continuing to hold up the appointment,  saying this could disrupt the transfer of military technology from Israel to  Brazil.Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon has actively been lobbying  Brazil’s defense minister in an effort to get Dayan’s appointment  approved.Folha quoted a senior Brazilian army officials as saying that  continuing to hold up the appointment showed a “lack of geopolitical vision and  objectivity of action. For the Armed Forces, it was a very sensitive situation,  since our partnership with Israeli hi-tech firms is huge.”This led Celso  Amorim – Brazil’s foreign minister from 2003 to 2011, and then defense minister  from 2011 to earlier this year – to retort, according to the paper, that it is  “time the Brazilian Armed Forces reduced its dependence on Israel.”“We  can’t continue to be overly dependent on Israeli technology. It’s time to  diversify our suppliers,” Amorim was quoted as saying. “To accept as ambassador  a person who was a leader of settlement policies in Israel would be a tacit  acceptance of this policy, which Brazil opposes.It’s not possible to  approve this ambassador.”Amorim also raised another sore point in the  appointment: that it was announced publicly by Israel without consultation with  Brazil.
Dayan is a political appointment who was selected by Netanyahu,  and the announcement of the appointment was made over the summer by the Prime  Minister’s Office.

<title>I know what apartheid was, and Israel is not apartheid, says S. African parliament member</title>
<date>24/8/2015</date>
<content>
A South African member of parliament said in an interview with Channel 10 Monday that Israel does not resemble the apartheid regime he grew up under, and spoke out against the BDS movement in the wake of a recent controversy involving Matisyahu.Kenneth Rasalabe Joseph Meshoe, President of the African Christian Democratic Party, who is currently on a week-long visit to Israel, expressed his great admiration for the Jewish State in a brief interview with channel 10 and explained why it was inaccurate to call Israel an apartheid state.




"There are many Christians that support Israel, but they don't come out...Those who know what real apartheid is, as I know, know that there is nothing in Israel that looks like apartheid," Meshoe said, adding that those who voice support for Israel are usually faced with threats and "intimidation."

(S. African MP Kenneth Meshoe says Israel is not apartheid)Meshoe went on to say that calling Israel an apartheid state "is an empty political statement that does not hold (any) truth," adding,"You see people of different colors, backgrounds and religions," interacting with each other everyday.   The topic of conversation then touched upon the recent controversy concerning American Jewish singer Matisyahu, who was disinvited then reinvited to perform at a Spanish reggae concert after BDS organizers attempted to block the artist from performing. "The BDS movement is a real pain... to us in South Africa who love the truth, (the) BDS movement is not a democratic movement; they are a movement of intimidation, a movement that performs hatred," the parliamentarian said. "People who don't believe in hatred should not allow the BDS movement to stop them from doing the right thing."Meshoe is a well-known advocate of Israel in South Africa, battling the the narrative purported by the BDS movement that the Jewish State is an apartheid regime, and recently released a short video claiming that "slander" against Israel as an apartheid state is "malicious."  
"There is a widespread allegation, really a slander, that Israel is an apartheid state. That notion is simply wrong. It is inaccurate and it is malicious."

<title>Iran propaganda clip shows what a Muslim invasion of Israel would look like</title>
<date>19/8/2015</date>
<content>
What would an Islamist invasion of Israel look like?A new video disseminated by an Iranian extremist organization depicts masses of jihadist operatives from organizations including Hamas and Hezbollah just as they are about to march on Jerusalem.




The chilling propaganda clip calls on Muslims to unite for the "inevitable" destruction of Israel, which is to be "erased from the annals of history."The video shows soldiers and operatives from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, the Iranian-backed Shia Badr Organization, Hezbollah, and the Hamas movement's Kassam Brigades."The youth will definitely see that day when it comes," the graphic reads.Earlier this month, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei released a new book titled Palestine, which outlines his case for why Israel must be wiped out and how. "The solution is a one-state formula," he writes.He said this "practical and logical mechanism"  would have Israel under Muslim rule with some Jews being allowed to stay as a "protected minority" but only after proving "genuine roots." He advocates strict apartheid against Jews saying that they would not be allowed to vote in a future Muslim state while Arabs would have full rights.
He claims that his plan would promote "the hegemony of Iran" while removing "the West's hegemony" from the Middle East.

<title>Iran on Israeli election: Zionist regime's political parties are all aggressors</title>
<date>18/3/2015</date>
<content>
There is no difference between Israeli political parties following the electoral victory of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, Iran's foreign ministry spokeswoman was quoted as saying by semi-official Mehr News Agency on Wednesday."For us there is no difference between the Zionist regime's political parties. They are all aggressors in nature," Marizeh Afkham told reporters at a weekly news conference in Tehran.




Hamas said similarly that there is no difference between Israeli political parties, because there is a consensus among them to deny the rights of the Palestinian people and continue aggression against them.Hamas spokesman Sami Abu-Zuhri said the "Palestinian resistance is strong and capable of making its mark. The leaders of the occupation must think again about their stances after the failure in Gaza."Saeb Erekat, chief Palestinian negotiator in peace talks with Israel that collapsed in April, said in a statement that Netanyahu's win showed "the success of a campaign based on settlements, racism, apartheid and the denial of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people."During much of the campaign, Netanyahu had focused on security issues and the threat from Iran's nuclear program, a message that appeared to gain little traction with voters.The Zionist Union's focus on socio-economic issues, including the lack of housing and the high cost of living in Israel, appeared to be generating much more momentum.
But Netanyahu's move to the right, playing up fears of the spread of Islamist groups, promising no concessions to the Palestinians and raising alarm about growing support for Arab-Israeli parties, looks to have spurred his base into action.

<title>Irish dance competition canceled due to BDS pressure</title>
<date>12/7/2015</date>
<content>
For many years Marina Frumkin and Pavel Kolesov dreamed of hosting a feis, or  Irish dance competition, in Israel. While many may associate Irish dance with  the bewildering stepping of Lord of the Dance, competitive performance is at the  heart of the art form.The two teachers/dancers, directors of the  prestigious Carey Academy Israel, an international chain of Irish dance studios,  were nearing the realization of their dream with a feis scheduled for next  month. However, last week, due to intensifying pressures from various  international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) groups, Frumkin and  Kolesov put out the following statement on the academy’s Facebook page:  “Unfortunately we have to announce the cancellation of what would have been the  first Israeli Feis. Not long ago the feis page started to be attacked by a  radical political group called Irish Palestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC) led by  Raymond Deane, Kevin Squires and Amanda Crawford. Threatening messages were sent  not only to our teachers, but also parents and students.




“Age,  nationality, or religious beliefs do not matter to us. Unfortunately, there was  a protest outside of our dance studio. We do not want to risk safety of anyone  connected to the Carey Academy. The feis was not meant to be anything more than  what it really is – a celebration of dancing, friendship and joy. We are sorry  for any inconvenience caused to people who may have already booked tickets but I  am sure you understand the safety of our dancers is our number one  priority.”The IPSC quickly posted a number of celebratory messages  including, “Victory Declared – another decisive battle in the war against  apartheid.”The feis was set to host dancers aged six to 60 from around  the globe in mid-August in Tel Aviv. A deflated-sounding Frumkin explained over  the phone, “We put a lot of work into organizing this event, which we hope will  happen in the future. And though we are very disappointed, we had to put the  emotional and physical safety of the dancers first.”“We’ve been  traveling the world participating in Irish dance competitions for many years,”  added Kolesov, “representing Israel. We wanted to show people in Israel what  real Irish dance is and can be.”
Frumkin and Kolesov have, for the time  being, shelved the idea of an Israeli feis.

<title>Netanyahu shelves Ya’alon’s travel ban for Palestinians after the Left screamed apartheid</title>
<date>20/5/2015</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon on  Wednesday to shelve a controversial pilot program that would have resulted in  the prevention of Palestinian workers from traveling home on Israeli public  buses in the West Bank after their daily work in the country’s  Center.“The proposals are unacceptable to the prime minister. He spoke  to the defense minister this morning and it was decided to shelve the entire  program,” a senior official in the Prime Minister’s Office told The Jerusalem  Post.




Ya’alon had agreed on Tuesday to implement the threemonth pilot  program, a move that appeared to have caught Netanyahu by surprise. He then  ordered Ya’alon to cancel it, but no one informed Deputy Defense Minister Eli  Ben-Dahan (Bayit Yehudi), who had started a speech defending the program in the  Knesset plenum. MK Tamar Zandberg (Meretz) then told him it had been  shelved.Earlier in the morning, Meretz Party head Zehava Gal- On  attacked the pilot program, stating: “This is what apartheid looks like. There  is no other polite definition that could fall more pleasantly on one’s  ears.”Ya’alon said the issue had been misunderstood.“There is no  separation between Jews and Arabs on the public transportation system in Judea  and Samaria. We did not discuss doing that. We didn’t decide to do it, and we  don’t plan to decide to do it,” he said.He explained that he had ordered  a pilot program to address security issues that related to the fact that there  is no oversight system to ensure that Palestinians who work within the pre-1967  lines in Israel return home at the end of the day.The pilot program, he  said, was limited to four crossings in Judea and Samaria.“Every well-run  and responsible country, particularly those with sensitive security issues,  checks people as they enter and exit,” Ya’alon said. “That is all we were  talking about. We weren’t talking about anything else.”Samaria Regional  Council head Gershon Mesika warned that Wednesday’s cancellation of the program  endangers the Israeli public, irrespective of their political  opinions.“When the next terror attack occurs in Tel Aviv, the Left will  have only themselves to blame,” Mesika said.His council and its settler  leaders had long urged the Defense Ministry to tackle security issues that  relate to the way Palestinian workers return to their West Bank homes at the end  of the day.Palestinians with Israeli work permits who live in the West  Bank head to their jobs in areas of the country within the pre- 1967 lines  through crossings in the security barrier, which are some distance away from  public bus lines. In addition, they often have to wait on long security  lines.To ease the situation, the Defense Ministry, years ago, allowed  the West Bank Palestinians to head home through any crossing.This means  that Palestinians can make use of Israeli public bus lines that travel to the  settlements but that have stops near their jobs and their homes.Use of  the public bus lines also is less time consuming because it spares Palestinians  from having to undergo lengthy waiting periods that come from an additional  security check on the way out.Mesika has warned that this system makes  travel on the buses dangerous for Israelis who have complained about criminal  activity by Palestinians.It also encourages Palestinians – including  those involved in terrorist activities – to illegally enter areas of Israel  within the pre-1967 lines, because they have a risk-free method of leaving,  Mesika said.In October, Ya’alon promised settlers in the Samaria region,  near the center of the country, that he would mandate that Palestinians return  through the same crossings, a move that would effectively keep them off the  public bus system in the West Bank.But, until this week, he had taken no  action on the matter.Attorney-General Yehuda Weinstein on Wednesday said  Ya’alon’s travel ban, if enforced, “would have raised serious legal  difficulties,” and he praised Netanyahu’s decision to shelve it.Already  in October 2014, Weinstein wrestled with Ya’alon over the issue. At the time, he  instructed Deputy Attorney- General for Legislative Affairs Dina Zilber to write  Defense Ministry Legal Adviser Ahaz Ben-Ari, demanding clarifications and an  explanation.Zilber demanded that the Defense Ministry explain what gave  it the authority to unilaterally make such a decision, present a review of the  security factors involved and relay what alternate options had been  investigated.Asked on Wednesday about what information the Defense  Ministry had provided in response, the Justice Ministry did not  comment.MK Moti Yogev (Bayit Yehudi), who chaired the Knesset Foreign  Affairs and Defense Subcommittee on Judea and Samaria in the last government,  said it is unfortunate that Netanyahu allowed “hysterical pressures from the  Left to continue to influence policy.”Ya’alon’s original plan to tackle  security issues relating to the buses was a professional, not a political, one,  adopted after many meetings of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Subcommittee on  Judea and Samaria and his Defense Ministry staff, Yogev said.But the  plan, which in effect would have kept Palestinians off the public bus lines in  the West Bank, had many opponents on the Right.President Reuven Rivlin  spoke to Ya’alon against the pilot program. Former interior minister Gideon  Sa’ar, a close ally of Rivlin who is still an influential figure in the Likud  and thought to be a possible successor to Netanyahu, took to Twitter to express  his opposition. He tweeted that the plan “causes great harm to settlements in  Judea and Samaria and to Israel’s image in the world. It cannot  remain.”Sources in the Knesset said Rivlin and Sa’ar’s comments  influenced Netanyahu’s decision to shelve the plan.Rivlin said, ”We have  to fight to the death against terrorism, while defending our democratic values  as a state and a nation. As someone who loves the Land of Israel, I can only  find the voices that supported a ‘separation’ between Jews and Arabs based on  inappropriate considerations to be unfortunate.”The president added that  such a separation goes against the basic values of the State of Israel and  cannot exist in a Jewish and democratic state.They harm the State of  Israel and settlements, he added.
Opposition leader Isaac Herzog, who  heads the Zionist Union, said the plan “only adds fuel to the fire of hate  against Israel in the world.”

<title>Israel heading into 2015: Strong on tactics, weak on strategy</title>
<date>1/1/2015</date>
<content>
In the euphoric years between the Six Day War in 1967 and the Yom Kippur War in  1973, the leaders of Israel, with defense minister Moshe Dayan chief among them,  had a tendency to boast that “our situation has never been better.” Within a  relatively short time, reality flipped on them and the illusion died at the  painful price of some 2,700 fallen soldiers.Since then, the same turn of  phrase has been avoided.




Nonetheless, there is not a better definition to  encapsulate Israel’s military situation in 2014. According to most estimates,  evaluations, and analyses by experts and all those correctly viewing reality –  without any personal, political, or ideological bias – Israel’s military  situation improved in the past year and its qualitative edge over its enemies  has grown.In all actuality, Israel is the strongest military power, not  only in the Middle East, but in the entire region stretching from the Indian  Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea.There is not a single state or coalition  of states that has the military ability to threaten Israel’s existence or defeat  it on the battlefield.In the East, the two large armies that made up  this front in the past, Syria and Iraq, which in the past were considered major  threats by Israel, have completely receded. Iraq today is a country  deteriorating into three or four parts. Despite the tens of billions of dollars  invested by the US in Baghdad’s army, it collapsed like a house of cards in the  battles of the past half-year against Islamic State.In Syria, the civil  war continues and March 2015 will mark four bloody years of conflict with no end  in sight.Syria is a completely dismantled state. Bashar Assad’s regime  controls about a quarter of the country’s territory, mostly Damascus and its  surroundings, the coast, a few other cities, and the roads connecting them.  Assad’s army has suffered heavy losses in battles with the various rebel groups,  both on the battlefield and through the desertion of tens of thousands of  soldiers, including high-ranking officers.Led by the Americans, the  international community rid the regime’s army of its chemical weapons, which  were developed and produced in order to answer the nuclear capability attributed  to Israel. Even if the Syrian regime retains some “residual” chemical ability  with Sarin gas, as is estimated among Israel’s intelligence community, it still  does not pose a real threat. This is evidenced by the fact that the defense  establishment stopped producing gas masks and distributing them to the  public.In the North, Hezbollah has been significantly weakened over the  past year. The group is up to its neck in the Syrian civil war, in which it  serves as Iran’s military wing and spearhead in defense of the regime in  Damascus.However, the price that Hezbollah is paying for becoming more  and more of an Iranian proxy and less and less of a Lebanese Shi’ite group is  very heavy.Hezbollah has lost hundreds, if not more than a thousand of  its best fighters in the Syrian war. Among those lost are senior commanders with  abundant battle experience. They are being buried in the dead of night in order  to hide the ugly reality from the group’s supporters. The morale of the group’s  members is down. Many in Lebanon, especially within the Shi’ite community on  which the group relies, are asking the key question: Why do young Lebanese men  need to sacrifice their lives for a foreign regime? In a certain manner, Syria  is Hezbollah’s Vietnam.At the same time, the war in Syria is crossing  over into Lebanon itself. Islamic State and and extremist Sunni organizations  such as Jabat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al-Qaida, are transferring the war  to Lebanese territory.They are blowing up car bombs in the heart of  Shi’ite strongholds, including Dahia, the “Kiriya” of Hezbollah in Beirut,  planning ambushes on the Shi’ite group’s fighters, and forcing Hezbollah to take  cover and defend its home.In the South has occurred perhaps the most  interesting and important development of 2014. Israel and Egypt have developed  military, intelligence, security, and operations cooperation the like of which  has not been seen before, not even at the height of secret contacts between the  countries when Hosni Mubarak was president and intelligence minister Gen. Omar  Suleiman was at home at the Mossad’s Glilot headquarters. Israel and Egypt,  under the leadership of Gen. Abdel Fatteh al-Sisi, see eye-to-eye on everything  connected to Gaza, Hamas, and terrorism in Sinai.The regime in Cairo  sees Hamas as a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, which it hates with all its  soul, and treats the group as an enemy that it must humiliate, subjugate, and  isolate. Egypt accuses Hamas of increasing terrorism in Sinai by helping Ansar  Bayit al-Maqdis, al-Qaida’s local branch, which has recently pledged allegiance  to Islamic State.Egypt’s army and security forces, with strong backing  from Israel – only a little of which is made public – are waging an  uncompromising war of destruction on the terrorist organization in Sinai. In the  past year they have had important achievements, but have also suffered heavy  losses. The war on terrorism in Sinai will continue in 2015.The  cooperation and understanding between Israel and Egypt were seen last summer in  the war against Hamas in Gaza. The IDF struck a painful blow to Hamas, something  that also contributed to Israel’s military strength. Hamas of 2015 is not just  another terrorist organization as the Israeli government and the IDF call  it.It is a regime that controls a territory and organizes its forces as  a semi-regular army.It is a mix between a guerrilla organization and an  actual army. But it is a weakened army, that lost two-thirds of its rocket  capabilities (some 6,000 rockets were destroyed or launched), that had almost  all of its attack tunnels into Israel, which served as a strategic tool in war,  exposed and destroyed from the air, by detonation, or by flooding with  sewage.Hamas is trying to rehabilitate its military power and to get out  from under the blockade it has surrendered to, by swallowing its pride and  crawling back into the arms of Iran, which is not rushing to take it back into  its bosom.Hamas is internationally isolated, subject to naval and land  blockades from Israel and Egypt that are choking it with a strong grip, and it  is also gradually losing its main source of support, Qatar, which has recently  been trying to make peace with the Egyptian regime.Militarily, Israel is  challenged, at least potentially, by three things: radical Islam, Hezbollah and  Iran.The extremist Islamist terrorist groups are near Israel’s borders.  Jabat al-Nusra, al-Qaida’s Syrian branch, controls almost all of the border  strip from Jordan to Mount Hermon in the Golan Heights. Ansar Bayit al-Maqdis is  active in Sinai, not far from Israel’s border, and Islamic State is trying,  unsuccessfully for now, to infiltrate Jordan. All of these are threats, but as  of now, there are no signs that these terrorist groups are showing interest in  Israel and their interest is in acting against the states they are currently in:  Syria and Egypt.Despite becoming weaker due to its involvement in Syria,  Hezbollah is still considered a serious military power. The group has tens of  thousands of missiles that cover almost every point in Israel, including  airports, the nuclear reactor in Dimona, army bases, and power  stations.Hezbollah fighters are also gaining experience on battlefields  in Syria, which will give them improved military capability in the case of a  conflict with Israel. However, the Israeli deterrence which has existed since  the Second Lebanon War is still holding. Hezbollah does not want war with  Israel.The second threat to Israel comes from Iran. It has hundreds of  Shihab-3 missiles, which can hit any target in Israel. Iran is Hezbollah’s  patron. In recent months, Hamas leaders led by Khaled Mashaal have been making  an effort to make peace with Tehran in order to again get financial and weapons  aid, even if it means they will be humiliated and have their status damaged. But  they have no choice. Iran, however, which is finding it difficult to forgive  Hamas for its disloyalty upon the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, has not yet  answered the group’s entreaties.In the eyes of the Netanyahu government,  Iran, which is trying to obtain a nuclear weapon, is an existential threat to  Israel. There are senior experts in the defense establishment who believe  differently: that more than Iran is really an existential threat to Israel, the  leadership, chiefly Benjamin Netanyahu, make Iran into such a threat for  domestic political reasons.Iran is already a nuclear threshold state,  anywhere form a matter of months to a year away from having the ability to build  its first bomb.If Iran wanted to, it could have already built a  bomb.However, as of now, Iran is not interested in building a nuclear  bomb, mainly due to the economic crisis it is facing due to UN and Western  sanctions, and also due to the falling price of oil, which is its main source of  income.The first months of 2015 will be focused on the nuclear talks  between the P5+1 group of world powers and Iran to reach an agreement that will  end the nuclear crisis, which has continued for the past nine years. If an  agreement is reached and Iran allows tight inspections and limitations for a  number of years on its ability to enrich uranium, it will probably be the most  interesting development in the international arena in the coming year.If  Washington renews relations with Tehran, Netanyahu’s foreign relations and  security policy – which is built on inflating the Iranian threat, frightening  the Israeli public, and abusing the memory of the Holocaust – will be rendered  useless.But there is still no guarantee that such an agreement will be  reached. The ball is in the court of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who  has the power to decide to compromise at the cost of “national pride,” and in  doing so save his country from economic crisis and isolation.Israel’s  unquestioned military superiority stems from the deterioration of states in the  Arab world (Libya, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq) from the radical Islamist threat on  Arab regimes and mainly from its constant efforts to preserve its technological  and scientific advantage over regional opponents.This qualitative edge  was created with the help of the strategic alliance with the US, but in the past  year there have been cracks in this alliance.True, relations and  cooperation in the field of security and intelligence on the operative level of  both states have been preserved and even improved. But Netanyahu’s  confrontational approach to President Barack Obama and his government, as well  as Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon’s overheard insults that he makes sometimes  (and then half-heartedly apologizes for), are damaging Israel’s most important  asset: its intimate relations with the US.As a result of the policies of  Netanyahu-Ya’alon (ironically, Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman has exhibited a  serious and responsible approach on this matter and has looked like the  gatekeeper), Israel is having difficulty leveraging its military advantage into  strategic achievements, which combine military ability with foreign policy and  international status.Strategically, Israel has gotten weaker in 2014  because of the deterioration in relations with the US and, as a result, and  perhaps even to a greater degree, with European states. This deterioration stems  firstly from the government’s lack of desire to advance the peace process with  the Palestinian Authority and from the expansion of settlements in the West  Bank, to the point that, soon, any chance of an agreement that includes  evacuating settlements and withdrawing from territories in exchange for security  arrangements and an end to the conflict will be blocked.On this matter,  the end of 2014 saw the dam burst: European states, including Israel’s  traditional friends, such as France, are prepared to recognize a Palestinian  state and are not afraid of being blamed for having an anti-Israel or  anti-Semitic approach.
The Palestinian issue remains Israel’s No. 1  problem and it will also be an important challenge, perhaps an existential one,  in 2015. Without the breakthrough of a diplomatic agreement, one of two  scenarios is liable to occur – or perhaps both of them together: a popular  Palestinian uprising in the west bank, whose buds we already saw in the outgoing  year; or Israel falling into a situation that will resemble the former apartheid  regime in South Africa. This would mean the deepening of Israel’s international  isolation, possibly to the point of sanctions being levied against it, without  the US rescuing it with the help of a veto.

<title>Israeli Arabs mark 39th Land Day with protests</title>
<date>30/3/2015</date>
<content>
Israeli Arabs observed the annual Land Day and waved Palestinian flags on Monday  with protests held in Jerusalem, the Galilee and the Negev.The  Monitoring Committee of the Israeli-Arab Leadership, which organizes the  protests, did not call a general strike in the Arab sector as it did last  year.




Land Day is held on March 30 to commemorate the deaths, in the 1976  riots, of six Galilee Arabs over a government decision to confiscate  land.A major event was held in Deir Hanna in the Galilee, which included  various Joint List MKs, Israeli-Arab leaders and political activists.In  Jerusalem, around 80 Arabs stood chanting slogans and waving Palestinian flags  outside of the Old City’s Damascus Gate, to protest Israel’s land  policies.
The demonstration was “relatively calm” in the capital, police  spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld told The Jerusalem Post, stating that only two people  were arrested and that both were quickly released.“There were no major  incidents,” he said.The protesters at the Damascus Gate, who according  to the police had not obtained a permit, attempted to march down the street but  were quickly dispersed by riot police, some mounted on horseback and others  carrying launchers for gas grenades.Several times protesters burst into  the street, yelling, but were chased down by police, to the jeers of several  teenage girls standing nearby.
“We are here to show solidarity with the  Palestinian people and we came today to show our support,” said Mark Mullan from  Derry, Ireland, who attended the protest with a number of other Irishmen bearing  a large flag proclaiming that they were “Celts against apartheid.”Asked  why he thought there was such a small crowd, he said that he “would imagine that  a lot of people would be afraid to make their political views known in this  country.”Israel is “a racist state,” accused Raziq, one of the  protesters, asserting that the small number of demonstrators could be explained  by fear of the police and of being arrested.Despite the signs of normal  life going on around the protesters, with school buses full of children driving  past and shoppers haggling at outdoor stalls, most of those living in the area  were supportive of their cause, he said.As a nearby mosque blared its  call to prayer, however, Ra’ed, the owner of a baked goods cart, seemed  unimpressed with the demonstration, saying he is “not a politician.”“We  sell pretzels,” he said.One protester suddenly burst into the road, a  squad of police at his heels. He was quickly subdued as the media swarmed around  the tussle, and those who had come to protest gradually made their way  home.At the demonstration with hundreds of protesters in the city of  Rahat in the Negev, Ta’al party chairman Ahmad Tibi said that “67 years have  passed since the establishment of Israel and there still is no equitable  allocation of land.”Instead, he said, “there is continued expropriation  of Arab land in favor of the Jewish majority.”In addition, Tibi asserted  that there is a lack of planning and construction. He also raised the issue of  the unrecognized Beduin villages of the Negev.“The issue of land remains  the major obstacle in relations between the state and the Arab minority which  aspires to be equal,” he added.Land Day symbolizes, more than anything,  the exclusion and discrimination against Arabs, said Tibi, adding that the Arab  minority would “continue to fight for its fundamental rights.”“We bow  our heads to the martyrs who fell in ’76 and we continue to make their voices  heard,” he said.Balad MK Jamal Zahalka, also in Rahat, said, “We will  not allow a second nakba in the Negev.”Any attempt to impose a  settlement in the Negev “will encounter stubborn resistance and the government  will be responsible for the deterioration of the situation,” Zahalka  warned.Newly elected Joint List MK Osama Sa’adi, who holds the second  spot in the Ta’al party, said at the event in his village of Arrabe, “We will  fight for the land and equality and against the policy of exclusion and  discrimination.”
Ari Briggs, the international relations director of  Regavim, an NGO that seeks to ensure responsible, legal and accountable use of  Israel’s national land, told the Post that instead of protesting, “as we  approach the 68th year since independence, it is about time the Arab sector act  as full citizens, understanding that entails not only rights but also  obligations to the state.”

<title>Israeli Arabs show solidarity, defiance amid ongoing violence</title>
<date>8/10/2015</date>
<content>
Israeli Arab  politicians and a political activist rallied around their community on  Wednesday, arguing that Israel’s actions and the “occupation” have led to the  recent surge in violence.Joint List MK Yousef Jabareen (Hadash) told The  Jerusalem Post that the main source of the latest violence is “the continuation  of the Israeli ‘occupation’ with no hope for the establishment of a Palestinian  state.”




Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is acting to  perpetuate the “occupation” and adopting “apartheid” practices in the “occupied  territories,” he asserted.“Israel cannot claim to be a democracy if it  continues to oppress millions of Palestinians.”The Joint List MK also  called for international intervention in the Israel- Palestinian conflict in  order to push for a two-state solution based on the 1949 cease-fire  lines.“Otherwise, I am afraid that the region will continue to boil,” he  added.A Joint List political source told the Post that there are no  talks going on behind the scenes between the Joint List and the government or  security forces in order to calm the situation.In general, there is  little contact between the government and the Joint List, said the  source.Joint List MK Aida Touma- Sliman also blamed Netanyahu’s  government for the recent escalation in violence, arguing that “settler crimes,”  and “rampant violence by the army and police” in Jerusalem and the West Bank led  to the current situation.In addition, complained the Hadash MK, the  police are not allowing people to protest and express their support for their  own people, which has also led to increased violence.“The strong angst  from the continuing ‘occupation’ is causing an escalation on the ground,” she  said, adding the “only way to calm the situation is a real effort to end the  ‘occupation’ and the opening of genuine peace negotiations.”Rami Younis,  who describes himself as a Palestinian citizen of Israel and is a political  activist and writer, told the Post that he did not think the latest outbreak of  violence was religiously motivated.“It is a fight for our lives,  literally. Our youth in Jerusalem and the West Bank feel they just cannot take  it anymore,” said Younis, who had until recently worked with MK Haneen Zoabi  (Balad).He added that “the army and ‘settlers’ cannot keep committing  crimes and not expect a struggle in return.”If the third intifada is  starting, it will be one led by the youth, he argued.“The gap between  the Palestinian puppet regime [of the Palestinian Authority] and the street  could not be bigger.”“We know the state is against us, and we know the  police are against us.We are not going to take it any more,” exclaimed  Younis.Meretz MK Esawi Frej called for further protests against the  “occupation” on Wednesday, but called on protesters not to use violence or break  the law.“This is not our way,” he said.
“The expectation that we  will close our eyes in the face of oppression and violence is unfair and  disconnected from reality,” argued the Arab Meretz MK.

<title>'Israeli blood is no cheaper than French blood,' Danon tells UN</title>
<date>24/11/2015</date>
<content>
NEW YORK – “The heinous murder of 20 innocent Israelis, just because they are  Israelis, is no different than the cruel massacre of innocents in France,”  Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon told the General Assembly.“Terror is  terror is terror, and it must be fought against, not justified,” he  said.




Danon made the comments Monday during a debate on “the Question of  Palestine” ahead of the UN’s International Day of Solidarity with the  Palestinian People.In his speech to the UN Committee on Exercise of  Inalienable Rights of Palestinian People just a few hours before Danon’s  address, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the “angry uprising” is the  result of “diminishing hopes, the continued situation of strangulation, siege  and pressure, and the lack of sense of security and safety” Palestinians  feel.According to him, these factors generate “tremendous frustration,”  and that the stabbing attacks are “an inevitable result” of Israel’s “incessant  violations and crimes against the Palestinian people.”Danon said the day  of solidarity is “a shameful day for the United Nations,” which is used “as a  platform to attack Israel.”“Over the years, this assembly has passed  countless one-sided resolutions blaming Israel for any and all problems  confronting the Palestinians,” he said on the podium. “Let’s be honest – for  those members states who constantly engage in demonization and delegitimization  of Israel, every day here at the UN is a day of solidarity with the  Palestinians.”Danon added that if the Palestinians had accepted the  existence of a Jewish state alongside a Palestinian one, “Israelis and  Palestinians would have been spared decades of needless conflict, of unnecessary  pain and suffering, and of the devastating loss of life on both  sides.“Let’s stop avoiding the real, pressing question of Palestine, and  ask ourselves: If the Palestinian leaders really want peace, why do they refuse  to sit in the same room with the Israeli prime minister?” Abbas had told the UN  earlier that “it is not logical to waste time in negotiations for the sake of  negotiations; it is urgent to act now to salvage the prospects for  peace.”He also accused Israel of using many rounds of negotiations to  gain more time in order to build more settlements, perpetuate apartheid on  Palestinian land and steal Palestinian’s natural resources.The  Palestinian president added that the authority will continue its accession to  international conventions and membership of international  organizations.He also reiterated that the Palestinians consider  themselves no longer bound by agreements signed with Israel in the past due to  “Israel’s destruction of the foundations upon which the political, economic and  security agreements were signed.”Danon said, “You can raise a  Palestinian flag here in the UN, but as long as the Palestinians fail to raise a  generation committed to peace and reconciliation, there will be no end to the  violence.“As long as those in this chamber do not demand that  Palestinian leaders make the difficult decisions needed for peace, no rhetoric  and no theatrics will improve the lives of the Palestinian people.”Danon  also read out loud the names of 22 Israelis who were killed in attacks by  Palestinians since September.
The UN will mark International Day of  Solidarity with the Palestinian People on November 29, the day the General  Assembly adopted resolution 181 (II) on the Partition of Palestine, in 1947.

<title>Israeli Left divided while Right unites to denounce Abbas speech</title>
<date>1/10/2015</date>
<content>
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’s address to the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday frustrated some leaders of the Israeli Left, while others endorsed what he said.The Left, which initiated the Oslo Accords that Abbas said he wanted to negate, reacted with different voices to the Palestinian leader’s announcement. Zionist Union leaders Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni and Yesh Atid head Yair Lapid expressed disappointment, while Peace Now secretary-general Yariv Oppenheimer praised Abbas.




“Speeches, accusations and flags will not create a Palestinian State, only direct negotiations with Israel,” Livni said. “The time has come for the Palestinian leadership to realize that a Palestinian state can only arise through agreements that guarantee Israeli security. Attempts to get the international community to force Israel to make concessions that will harm Israel’s interests will not succeed and are doomed to failure.”Herzog said statements by Abbas accusing Israel of apartheid were twisted and served only the extremists in both nations. He said that both Abbas and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were letting their people down.“The Israelis and Palestinians deserve hope and normal lives,” Herzog said. “Abbas and Netanyahu are leaders who are afraid of making decisions and prefer slogans and mutual recriminations, while leaving our future hanging in the wind. Instead of taking advantage of a rare chance for creating alliances with moderate countries who want to partner against Islamic terror, they are drowning in their own useless rhetoric.”Speaking to the Israel Policy Forum in New York, Lapid accused Abbas of uttering “terrible words of incitement.”“Maybe it comes from frustration, but it is frustration of their own doing,” Lapid said.Former minister Yossi Beilin, who initiated the Oslo process, said both sides were to blame for the peace process not advancing.“He didn’t offer practical solutions, nor did he deliver the bombshell he promised,” Beilin said. “I wish he would have called for dismantling the PA, which could have persuaded the world to become involved again in the Palestinian issue.”Oppenheimer said Israelis would miss leaders like Abbas, who still believes in the twostate solution. He said he is afraid that the next Palestinian leader would prefer only one.“The content of the speech was the narrative of the Palestinian people, which reflects reality,” Oppenheimer said. “It is the reality that is frustrating, not the speech. Israel really isn’t doing what it needs to bring about two states.”Joint List head Ayman Odeh said he agreed with Abbas that Israel in general and Netanyahu in particular violated every agreement, made the occupation endless, deepened the settlements, and destroyed Oslo.“The occupation is a disaster not only for the Palestinians but also for the citizens of Israel, who should join together to fight the occupation and for the formation of a Palestinian state,” he said.The Right expressed hope that Abbas’s speech would wake up the Left to the hopelessness of pursuing a peace process with him.“The opposition should come its senses and realize that there is no true Palestinian partner for peace,” said Tourism Minister Yariv Levin (Likud). “Abbas shattered the remnants of the illusion of Oslo. The Palestinians long ago chose the path of terrorism. The PA was never a solution but always the heart of the problem.”Bayit Yehudi leader Naftali Bennett said Abbas has “returned to his bad old days as a Holocaust denier with a speech that revises history.”He noted that in the speech Abbas called for the release from prison of murderers of men, women and children.“At a time when Europe is dealing with a wave of refugees and the Middle East is on fire and coming apart, Abbas will also be replaced and will be remembered by history as just another terrorist – and not one of the most successful ones,” Bennett said Yisrael Beytenu head Avigdor Liberman called Abbas an inciting hypocrite.“Just as his threat of a bombshell was empty, so were his attacks and lies against Israel,” he said. “The sooner he leaves his job, which he does not hold democratically, the better it will be for everyone.”Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev noted that while Abbas was speaking, IDF soldiers were wounded by rocks in Hebron. She said the speech showed that Abbas could not be a partner for Israel.“Abbas is not interested in a diplomatic agreement,” she said. “He reminded everyone tonight that he is the heir to the mass-murderer Yasser Arafat. He is part of the same axis of evil with [Syrian leader Bashar] Assad.”Immigrant Absorption Minister Ze’ev Elkin said Abbas was the last person who could scold Israel, because he pays the salaries of murderers and incites against the Jewish state.Elkin said the PA had violated Oslo by encouraging terror and taking unilateral steps in international organizations.“If you want to leave, leave now,” Elkin said. “The Israelis and Palestinians will only be better off.”
Agriculture Minister Uri Ariel (Bayit Yehudi) said Israel should react to the speech by exercising its sovereignty over all the Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria and annexing the area known in the Oslo Accords as Area C, where all the settlements are located.

<title>Israeli military action against Iran would be 'huge mistake,' Kerry says</title>
<date>24/7/2015</date>
<content>
Any unilateral Israeli military action against Iran’s nuclear facilities would be a mistake, US Secretary of State John Kerry told NBC, ahead of Tuesday’s hearing by the House Foreign Affairs Committee on a deal reached earlier this month to curb Tehran’s ability to produce atomic weapons. “I think that would be an enormous mistake, a huge mis- take with grave consequences for Israel and for the region,” Kerry said in response to a question on the matter by NBC’s Matt Lauer on Friday. 




“If they [Israel] bombed them, sure, I presume Iran would then have a reason to say, ‘Well, this is why we need a bomb.’ And what Iran will decide to do is dig deeper because Israel does not have the ability, nor do we, to stop – unless we went to all-out war and literally annihilated Iran, which I don’t hear people talking about,” Kerry said. The Prime Minister’s Office had no response to Kerry’s statement. The interview is part of what will be a prolonged campaign by the Obama Administration to sway Congress to vote for the deal by mid-September. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the agreement worked out between Tehran and the six world powers – the US, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom – a historic mistake, and warned that the deal, which rolls back sanctions, allows Iran to maintain its ability to produce nuclear weapons and emboldens it to continue to support global terrorism. He has urged the world powers to continue to use sanctions to halt Iran’s nuclear program. Earlier on Friday, Kerry told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Israel would be further isolated in the international arena if it continued to oppose the Iran deal. “I fear that what could happen is, if Congress were to overturn it, our friends in Israel could actually wind up being more isolated and more blamed, and we would lose Europe and China and Russia with respect to whatever military action we might have to take because we will have turned our backs on a very legitimate program [the Iran deal] that allows us to put their program to the test over these next years,” Kerry said. The deal, which allows for the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect Iran’s nuclear sites, would be good for Israel, Kerry said. “I believe Israel is safer, I believe the region is safer, I think the world is safer,” he said. The deal, he added, is the only viable alternative to a military solution, which, at best, would slow the program down for a few years. “The president has made it pretty clear that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon. He’s prepared to use military force if necessary in order to prevent that,” Kerry said. But, he said, “war should be the last resort, not the first.” When the six world powers began negotiating with Iran, it was two months away from possessing enough fissile matter to start production of nuclear weapons, Kerry said. “We’ve now pushed that breakout time up to maybe six months or so, and with this agreement, for 10 years, the breakout time will be one year or more. One year or more. Let me ask you a very simple question: Is Israel safer with a one-year breakout time or a two-month breakout time? Frankly, two months is more than we need, but we want the cushion, the safety,” Kerry said. Sanctions were effective in bringing Iran to the negotiating table but cannot halt its nuclear program, Kerry said. Without a deal, Iran would continue enriching uranium and there would be no inspections. Netanyahu warned last week that “this deal paves Iran’s path to an entire nuclear arsenal within a decade or so because, at that point, Iran will be free of any constraints of producing as many centrifuges as they want and they can enrich as much uranium as they want.” Kerry is expected to testify again in support of the deal at the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Tuesday. Both House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Ed Royce (R-California), as well as Eliot Engel (D-New York), the committee’s top-ranking Democrat, have expressed serious concern over the outcome of the negotiations. “While I’m still reviewing the agreement, I must say I do have some serious questions and concerns about certain aspects of the deal,” Engel said at a hearing on the issue, noting his “fundamental concern that 15 years from now, Iran will essentially be off the hook.” “If they choose, Iran’s leaders could produce weapons-grade, highly enriched uranium without any limitation,” Engel continued. “The truth is, after 15 years, Iran is legitimized as a threshold state.” MK Michael Oren, former Israeli ambassador to the US, said that, “If American legislators reject the nuclear deal, they will do so exclusively on the basis of US interests. The threat of the secretary of state who, in the past, warned that Israel was in danger of becoming an apartheid state, cannot deter us from fulfilling our national duty to oppose this dangerous deal.” Opposition leader Isaac Herzog said that, despite Israel being strong in the face of its many challenges, Netanyahu has for many years been using what he called “Tisha Be’av syndrome” to fill the nation with fear. Herzog also compared Israel to a ship in stormy waters and Netanyahu to a captain who persuades his passengers to panic. The Likud responded that Netanyahu faces Israel’s security realities realistically and addresses them responsibly and determinedly to guarantee Israeli security. The party said that from what Herzog said, one might get the false impression that Iran was developing a nuclear capability for peaceful purposes and Hezbollah was working on a plan for tourism in the North. Separately, on Saturday, the Lebanese Hezbollah group said it could still count on Iran’s support. In his first public remarks since the agreement was reached this month in Vienna, the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said he is sure Tehran would confound critics who say it will end support to Hezbollah. “We deal with every trust and complete assurance over this,” Nasrallah said in ceremony to honor sons and daughters of fallen Hezbollah fighters. “Iran’s relationship with its allies is based on ideological grounds and come before the political interests,” Nasrallah said. US sanctions against three Hezbollah military leaders whom Washington said were involved in operations in Syria would have no impact on the group, he said. “We have no investment accounts... these measures will not change things either way,” he added. The three leaders – Mustafa Badr Al Din, Ibrahim Aqil, and Fu’ad Shukr – were named for their roles in coordinating or participating in the group’s support for the government in Syria’s civil war, a US Treasury spokesman said. The group also included a businessman in Lebanon who was sanctioned for procuring weapons for Hezbollah and shipping them to Syria. The new sanctions following the nuclear deal and Washing- ton’s continued designation of Hezbollah as a terrorist group showed that US policies have not changed toward it, Nasrallah said,  adding, “The United States is the Great Satan before and after the deal.” Nasrallah said the targeting of Lebanese businessmen was meant to undermine Lebanon’s economy and said monetary authorities should not cave into US Treasury efforts to blacklist local businessmen. The Treasury said it had taken action in June against Hezbollah front companies. US President Barack Obama and Kerry have said they are troubled by support from Iran for regional proxy groups such as Hezbollah. Nasrallah said his group is proud of Tehran’s financial backing, which allows it to stand up to Israel and US policies in the region. “The support we get from Iran is enough,” Nasrallah said.Hezbollah’s support has been crucial to Syria’s President Bashar Assad in the four-year long Syrian conflict.

<title>Israeli NGO charges US union over BDS efforts</title>
<date>14/10/2015</date>
<content>
Shurat HaDin-Israel Law Center on Tuesday filed a complaint with the National  Labor Relations Board accusing the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers  of America (UE) of violating the US National Labor Relations Act, which  “prohibits labor unions from encouraging workers to take part in boycotts during  the course of their work duties, commonly known as ‘secondary boycotts.’” The  NGO is seeking injunctive relief against the UE to “prevent it from engaging in  these unfair labor practices, which single out and discriminate against Israelis  and Israeli companies.”According to Shurat HaDin, UE, at its national  convention in Baltimore in mid-August, passed the resolution that it claims  addresses Israel’s alleged long history of violating the human rights of  Palestinians and which is designed to pressure Israel “to end its apartheid over  the Palestinians just as similar tactics helped to end South African apartheid  in the 1980s.”




The complaint was filed by attorneys David Abrams of New  York and Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, Shurat HaDin’s director.“While cast as  a human rights effort, the BDS Movement makes no attempt to boycott countries or  entities which hang homosexuals; torture political opposition; or deny voting  rights to their citizenry...Instead, the BDS Movement remains lock  focused on Israel exclusively, with prominent supporters having ‘admitted that  their goal is to put an end to the Jewish State,’” the charge  states.Shurat HaDin alleges that labeling BDS resolutions as secondary  boycott violations is a new legal strategy for challenging the racist and  anti-Semitic policies that seek to economically isolate Israel.
The NGO  accuses UE of encouraging workers to boycott Israeli enterprises and  institutions during the course of their work, similar to the BDS Movement’s  public encouragement of dock workers to refuse to unload ships arriving from  Israel and academics to refrain from participating in joint projects with  Israeli institutions.

<title>Israeli party leaders butt heads in televised debate</title>
<date>26/2/2015</date>
<content>
The leaders of eight parties – Bayit Yehudi, Yisrael Beytenu, Koolanu, Yesh  Atid, the Joint List, Meretz, Shas, and Yahad – participated in the first debate  of its kind on Israeli television, moderated by Channel 2 News anchor Yonit Levi  Thursday night.Absent from the debate were Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu, leader of the Likud Party, and Zionist Union chairman MK Isaac  Herzog.




The debate format pitted individual candidates against one  another, debating the issues that divide them most.Bayit Yehudi’s  Naftali Bennett and Meretz chairwoman Zehava Gal-On debated the twostate  solution.“We are the only ones who say clearly that we will not allow a  centimeter of land to be given to Arabs,” Bennett declared.“We will  apply sovereignty to Ariel and Ma’aleh Adumim.”Gal-On said Bennett  thinks “five million Palestinians will just disappear,” and that his positions  will cause apartheid.“Everything Zehava says may sound good, but it’s  all wrong. A Palestinian state will destroy Israel’s economy. One rocket closed  our airport last summer,” Bennett said.“Bennett is doing what he does  best, fear-mongering,” Gal- On stated.“Who do you want to give the Golan  to, Nasrallah or Islamic State?” the Bayit Yehudi chairman  retorted.Bennett also slammed Yisrael Beytenu chairman Avigdor Liberman  and Koolanu chairman Moshe Kahlon for supporting a Palestinian  state.Referring to his populated land swap proposal, as opposed to  Bennett’s plan to annex Area C, Liberman said: “Bennett wants as many  Palestinians as possible in the country, and we want as many  Jews.”Bennett said he is confident that the demographic threat can be  tackled by increased aliya and the birth rate, and Liberman responded that only  Yisrael Beytenu has aliya as a central tenet of its platform.Kahlon  said: “I have been in the national camp my whole life, but I think we need to  reach an agreement. There are lines I won’t cross, like dividing Jerusalem or  giving up the Jordan Valley.”However, Kahlon added that talking about  negotiations is pointless, because there is no one to talk to on the Palestinian  side, so the government should focus on lowering the cost of living,  instead.Gal-On posited that if Israel stops “ruling another nation,”  then the cost of living would drop.Shas chairman Arye Deri and his  party’s former leader and founder of the Yahad Party, Eli Yishai, argued over  the legacy of the late Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef.Deri was  visibly agitated, while Yishai grinned the entire time, but the former got in  more points, saying that the latter broke off from Shas only because Ovadia  died.“He is destroying [Ovadia’s] life’s work,” Deri  accused.“This is not how [Ovadia] taught us to behave,” Yishai  responded. “You wouldn’t speak like that in front of him. I won’t be dragged  into mudslinging.”Yishai posited that what Ovadia wanted was for the  Jewish people to be united, and Deri responded that Ovadia would not have worked  with Kahanists or people from Bayit Yehudi, both of which are on Yahad’s  list.Yisrael Beytenu chairman Liberman butted heads with Joint (Arab)  List leader Ayman Oudeh.“He threatens people who want to do national  service and is still a citizen. What kind of country allows that?” Liberman  asked.Oudeh responded that he feels like Liberman is “from the 1930s”  and called for “dialogue, not mudslinging” between Jews and Arabs.“We’re  20 percent of the country,” Oudeh pointed out.“For now,” Liberman  retorted.“What are you even doing here? You call yourself Palestinian,  not Israeli, so you should go to the Palestinian parliament so Abbas can pay  you.”Oudeh responded that, considering recent polls – in which his party  would get seats in the teens and Yisrael Beytenu gets single-digits – he doesn’t  think that he’s the one who’s unwanted.Yesh Atid’s Yair Lapid debated  Koolanu chairman Moshe Kahlon on housing, with the latter saying prices went up  17% while the former was finance minister.Lapid emphasized how many new  homes are being built.“Maybe the bureaucrats didn’t tell you this. Do  you know how many [new homeowners] got keys last year? 7,800. There are no new  houses,” Kahlon said.Lapid also debated Deri, bringing up his corruption  charges.“Why are felons allowed back in the Knesset?” Lapid  asked.“You are a convicted felon and you need rehabilitation. Don’t come  back to politics!” “You’re going to rehabilitate me? What is this  condescension?” Deri asked.Deri said that Lapid was condescending to  him, because “I’m named Arye Machlouf Deri and I was born in Meknes (Morocco)” -  in other words, because he is Sephardic.Deri also said that he does not  reject Lapid as a person, but in light of his unwavering political stances –  requiring haredim to study the core curriculum and enlist in the IDF – Shas and  Yesh Atid cannot sit in a coalition together.Liberman and Gal-On each  said they would not sit in a government with the other.“Liberman is a  racist. He doesn’t deserve to sit with the center-left bloc,” Gal-On  stated.
Also in the debate, Oudeh, despite being asked directly, refused  to commit to recommending or not recommending Zionist Union chairman Isaac  Herzog to form the next government, saying only that he wants the right to lose  power.

<title>Israel slams German bank for hosting talk on destroying Jewish state</title>
<date>8/9/2015</date>
<content>
BERLIN – Israel’s embassy in  Berlin sharply criticized on Tuesday Germany’s Sparkasse savings bank network –  and various NGOs – for allowing an opponent of the existence of Israel, who has  likened the Jewish state to the Third Reich, to deliver a talk in its office  space titled “Jew against Zionism.”“We regret that certain organizations  provide a platform for hatred. It is important and would have been beneficial if  institutions would have double-checked before allowing their resources to be  used as platforms to spread hatred. Actions are being taken,” the embassy told  The Jerusalem Post.




Lilian Rosengarten, an activist from New York, spoke  on Sunday in a Sparkasse office of the town of Düren, near Aachen. She is a  member of the International Anti-Zionist network and accused Israel on the Düren  municipal museum’s website of “ethnic cleansing,” “racism” and  “apartheid.”“Zionism has been successful in activating a growth in  anti-Semitism,” she said.The Darmstädter Echo, a regional paper in the  city of Darmstadt, reported that a Protestant community pulled the plug on a  talk by Rosengarten scheduled for September 2 because in the past she likened  Israel to the Hitler movement.Hildegard Förster-Heldmann, a Green Party  politician who heads the Darmstadt municipal cultural affairs committee, said,  “A comparison between Israel and Nazi Germany is absurd, disrespects the  descendants of the Nazi victims and belittles the criminality of Nazi  Germany.”Rosengarten’s talk in Darmstadt was relocated to the Hoffart  Theater. She is conducting a Germany-wide speaking series.She signed a  2014 Huffington Post petition supporting a boycott of Israel and called for “the  complete dismantling of Israel’s apartheid regime, throughout historic Palestine  – from the River to the Sea.” Rosengarten authored an article titled “Zionist  Israel’s Final Solution for Gaza” on the website Intifada: Voice of  Palestine.Dirk Hürtgen, a spokesman for Sparkasse, wrote the Post by  email that the “Sparkasse Düren supports the Düren municipal museum [by  providing it space] because engaged citizens in Düren seek to preserve the  history and development of Düren and the inhuman events of the Second World  War.”Sparkasse “could not establish that anti-Semitic thoughts were  expressed in connection with the Düren municipal museum,” Hürtgen said. “We note  that Sparkasse Düren always refrains from intervening in the projects which it  sponsors as regards to content.”He added that the bank will continue to  sponsor projects in the museum and will not cancel its contract for the  space.A photograph obtained by the Post shows the Sparkasse banner in  the room as Rosengarten spoke.Asked on the telephone if he agreed with  Rosengarten’s statement that Israel is an apartheid state, Hürtgen said, “I  can’t judge that.” He asked “why is it relevant whether anti-Semitism took  place” in the room and noted that there are “different opinions.”Efraim  Zuroff, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s chief Nazi-hunter and head of its  Jerusalem office, told the Post the role of organizations involved in supporting  Rosengarten “reveals a dismal ignorance of reality in the Middle East, and their  reluctance to identify anti-Semitism paves the way for attacks on Israel that  are groundless.” The fact the problem has cropped up in Germany is particularly  infuriating given the past, he said. The people at Sparkasse “should know  better.”The Ostfriesen paper wrote earlier this year about an exhibit  addressing the banking network’s role under the Third Reich, saying that  “Sparkasse loyally served the Nazi regime.”Zuroff said there is  “legitimate criticism of the State of Israel, and totally unfair attacks on the  State of Israel that stem from anti-Semitism.”Dr. Robert Neugröschel,  the head of the 1,000-member Jewish community in greater Aachen, which includes  Düren, told the Post on Saturday that the Rosengarten talk is a “disgrace and of  course anti-Semitic.”Jutta Wagemann, a spokeswoman for Josef Schuster,  the head of Germany’s Central Council of Jews in Germany, wrote the Post by  email, “I believe Mr. Schuster has nothing to add to the statements of the  representatives of the Jewish community in Aachen.”Prof. Gerald  Steinberg, the head of the Jerusalem-based NGO Monitor, told the Post on  Tuesday: “This speaking tour is yet another moral stain on Germany, and  specifically for the sponsors. Catholic NGOs that exploit a fringe Jewish  anti-Zionist to promote hate for Israel are shamefully reviving theological  anti-Semitism in Germany. And other NGO sponsors, including the Israel-based  ICAHD [the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions], are contributing to  this hatred.”Rosengarten is slated to speak in Berlin, Frankfurt,  Bremen, Hanover, Heidelberg, Hagen and Gissen. The German-Arab Society (DAG) has  advertised her talk against Zionism on its homepage. Harald Moritz Bock, the  society’s general secretary, told the Post by email that Rosengarten’s talk was not  anti-Semitic. She does not talk about “resentments against Jews, rather a lot  more about the great sadness that Jews themselves use such methods,” he  said.The German-Arab society will not remove the advertisement on its  homepage for Rosengarten because “the DAG does not engage in censorship,” Bock  said. He said there are no comparisons on the DAG’s webpage between Israel and  Nazi Germany.Bock said he couldn’t find any comparisons between Israel  and Nazi Germany by Rosengarten in the Internet. Rosengarten has a right to  express her views, he said.After the Post sent him the article showing  Rosengarten’s Israel parallel with Nazi Germany, he declined to respond specifically to the comparison.
Steinberg said," there is no excuse for the role of the German-Arab Friendship society in promoting this form of hate. The use of Rosengarten, whose obscene comparison between Israel with Nazi Germany, is a form of Holocaust denial. "

<title>'It's not politically correct to be anti-Semitic, but it's super-in to be anti-Israel'</title>
<date>3/6/2015</date>
<content>
The boycott, divestment and sanctions movement is the new anti-Semitism and  wants to destroy Israel, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said on Wednesday, in  response to a motion to the agenda from coalition and opposition MKs calling to  fight those who seek to delegitimize Israel.The discussion was marked by  shouting matches over whether BDS is an anti-Israel and anti-Semitic movement or  simply seeks to bring an end to Israel’s presence in areas liberated in  1967.




“BDS opposes Israel as the Jewish state. It wants to blacken us and  destroy us as a Jewish and democratic state,” Shaked explained. “The boycotters  don’t talk about Judea and Samaria, they talk about the State of  Israel.”According to Shaked, “It’s not politically correct to be  anti-Semitic today, but it’s super-in to be anti-Israel,” and as such, “People  used to delegitimize the Jews and now they do it to our country.“BDS is  anti-Semitism in new clothes,” she said.Shaked called to fight back  against BDS and “boycott the boycotters,” and listed the many government  ministries, including hers, that are taking part in the efforts to fight  delegitimization, bringing MK Basel Ghattas (Joint List) to interject: “It won’t  work.”“Israel will continue to be a light unto the nations,” Shaked  vowed.Minister-Without-Portfolio Ophir Akunis posited: “Maybe, when  radical Islam takes over Europe, people there will understand the real meaning  of occupation.”After incessant interruptions from Joint List  legislators, Akunis shouted to them: “Your narrative is a lie. It is violent and  it encourages terrorism...""Your narrative was based on terrorism even  before the State of Israel was founded!” Referring to the ambassadorial  appointment Akunis is seeking, MK Ahmad Tibi (Joint List) shouted to Akunis to  “go to the UN.”“OK, you go to Arafat’s grave and I’ll go to the UN. I’m  not going to let someone who was an adviser to Arafat lecture me,” Akunis said  to Tibi, who used to work for the PLO chairman.MK Nachman Shai (Labor)  opened the discussion by saying that diplomatic pressure on apartheid South  Africa began with its ejection from the FIFA world soccer federation, and that  is what the Palestinians are trying to do to Israel.“We cannot let  history repeat itself. If we do not act here and now, if we do not initiate  diplomatic processes to break the blockade on use, we will be left alone,” he  warned.Yesh Atid MK Aliza Lavie said that the government does not have a  “clear policy, no action, no strategy, no plan with a budget” to fight  delegitimization.“Israel is on the verge of the abyss, yet we’re putting  out fires instead of taking initiative,” she lamented.MK Michal Rozin  (Meretz) repeated statements that BDS is “not against the occupation, they’re  anti-Semitic” in a mocking tone, adding “Oy oy.”“The real issue is the  policy of continuing the occupation and managing the conflict,” she  claimed.MK Michael Oren (Kulanu), former ambassador to the US, responded  that “this isn’t about settlements. BDS wants to erase Israel from the  map.”Oren credited NGOs such as StandWithUs, CAMERA and AIPAC for doing  “holy work” to combat BDS, but criticized the government for “abandoning an  important topic for our security.”“We have to take our security into our  hands and launch a campaign against this strategic danger, which could become  existential,” he said.Tibi, who took the lectern next, asked Oren if he  thinks it’s all right that, in his words, Israel doesn’t let Palestinian  athletes play and whether politics and sports should mix.“Do you oppose  BDS?” Oren retorted.“Like a real Jew, he answers a question with a  question,” Tibi quipped.MK Anat Berko (Likud) pointed out that there is  precedent of athletes and other VIPs being allowed out of the Gaza Strip and  taking part in terrorist activities; therefore, athletes must go through  checkpoints, as well.The Likud MK recounted that when she and Oren  started a caucus to fight delegitimization, the only factions whose members  would not join were Meretz and the ones that now make up the Joint  List.“We will fight delegitimization from the inside and the outside,”  she said.“What does that mean?” Rozin asked.“That you wouldn’t  join the battle,” Berko retorted. “You’re delusional. You think no one tried to  delegitimize Israel before 1967?” Meretz chairwoman Zehava Gal-On took umbrage  at some MKs’ rhetoric, saying her party “opposes boycotts of Israel, we just  can’t stand how you act like victims! “You act like whoever criticizes the  occupation is an anti-Semite. Calm down. Netanyahu’s policies are what  encourages those who boycott us,” she said.Zionist Union MK Eyal  Ben-Reuven pointed out that it was Unity Day, in memory of the three teens  murdered by Palestinians last year, and called for lawmakers to unite to fight  delegitimization. “There is no coalition and opposition on this matter,” he  said.Ghattas disagreed.“Even some people on the Left need to  wake up,” he said.“The world is sanctioning Israel because of the  occupation.”
In his usual flippant fashion, MK Oren Hazan (Likud) said to  Joint List legislators: “You’re Arab citizens of Israel. If you don’t like it  here, leave... We’re here to stay, I’m not so sure about you."

<title>Japan's PM Abe to arrive in Israel on Sunday as part of regional tour</title>
<date>17/1/2015</date>
<content>
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will arrive in Israel Sunday as part of a  regional tour, marking the first visit by a Japanese premier since  2006.In addition to Abe, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird arrived on Friday for  a five day visit to Israel and the West Bank. A nine-member US bi-partisan  Senate delegation, led by the new Charmian of the Senate Armed Services  Committee, John McCain, will also be in Israel at the beginning of the  week.




On Saturday in Egypt Abe pledged about $200 million in non-military  assistance for countries battling Islamic State. In addition to Egypt and  Israel, he is also visiting Jordan, the Palestinian Authority and  Lebanon.“It goes without saying that the stability of the Middle East is  the foundation for peace and prosperity for the world, and of course for Japan,”  Abe said in Cairo.“Should we leave terrorism or weapons of mass  destruction to spread in this region, the loss imparted upon the international  community would be immeasurable,” he said.Highlighting his concern, Abe  told a meeting of the Japan-Egypt Business Committee that Tokyo would provide  non-military financial backing for countries fighting Islamic State.“I  will pledge assistance of a total of about 200 million U.S. dollars for those  countries contending with ISIL, to help build their human capacities,  infrastructure, and so on,” said Abe.The Middle east is a vital region  for Japan because of its energy needs.In addition to the $2.2 billion in  assistance Japan pledged for the Middle East two years ago, Abe said his  government would provide another $2.5 billion in non-military assistance in  fields such as humanitarian assistance and infrastructure.“The Middle  East ... that’s the region endowed with great possibilities,” said Abe.“And yet now it appears to be no exaggeration to say that the  region is exposed to a challenge that is among the most serious in its modern  history.”Japan will provide Egypt with $360 million in loans for  projects including an airport and a power grid in a country suffering from an  energy crisis, Abe said.“These are intended to contribute to Egypt’s  development, and by extension, to widening the foundation for stability across  the entire region,” he added.“Japan believes that the day will come in  the near future when we can recognize Palestine as a state,” said  Abe.“In order for that day to arrive sooner, we will appeal to both  Israel and Palestine to resume negotiations to advance the so-called two-state  solution.”Abe's visit comes two weeks after the cabinet approved a plan  to strengthen economic ties with Japan and the investment of “tens of millions  of shekels” over the next three years to make it possible.While a  Japanese prime minister has not been to Israel since 2006, then prime minister  Ehud Olmert visited Japan in 2008, as did Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last  May.Abe will be accompanied by more than 100 government official and  business leaders including some of the heads of Japan's largest companies  looking at business possibilities in Israel. Expanding the bilateral economic  ties between the two countries is expected to be one of the main agenda items  when Abe meets Netanyahu.Israel is making a concentrated attempt to  significantly increase trade ties with Japan, which – after China and the US –  is the third largest economy in the world. Despite its size Israel exports to  Japan have been stagnant in recent years and amounted to only $720 million in  2013, or only about 1.3 percent of all Israel’s commercial exports.In  order to improve the trade, the plan approved recently in the cabinet called for  the opening of an Israeli trade office in Osaka, increasing the number of  commercial attaches in Tokyo, increasing joint research grants by 50% in 2015,  increasing space cooperation, and promoting plans to increase Japanese tourism  by 45% in two years.During Abe's visit Israeli firms are expected to  demonstrate various technological developments that could be used at the 2020  Summer Olympics in Tokyo.Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird, meanwhile,  arrived Friday and is also scheduled to meet Netanyahu on Monday, as well as  visit the Palestinian Authority and meet with Palestinian Authority’s Foreign  Affairs Minister Riad Malki and former prime minister Salam Fayyad.PLO  chief negotiator Saeb Erekat welcomed Baird with an op-ed in Canada's The Globe  and Mail under the headline. “It is John Baird who needs to apologize to the  Palestinian people.”In the piece, Erekat slammed Baird for his strong  support of Israel, saying Baird “should apologize for his active encouragement  of Israel’s brute and ugly occupation and its apartheid policies. He should  apologize for failing to promote those things Canadians hold dear such as  freedom, dignity and human rights and for replacing those ideals with an  outspoken support of Israel’s clear and undisputed violations of international  law.”
Baird, in a statement released before his arrival in Israel, said  “Canada deeply values its close ties with Israel and looks forward to continuing  to strengthen our partnership on security, diplomacy and trade. Our friendship  is based on shared values, and we are ambitious about what more can be achieved  together."

<title>Lapid lectures Brits on boycotting Israel</title>
<date>19/2/2015</date>
<content>
Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid castigated a group of British artists Thursday for calling on their colleagues around the world to boycott Israel until it ends what they termed the “colonial occupation.”Lapid responded in an opinion piece published in The Guardian that the signatories were ignoring many painful truths. He singled out Roger Waters, a veteran critic of Israel’s policies who co-founded the band Pink Floyd 50 years ago.




“As an Israeli politician who supports the creation of a Palestinian state, it has been a long time since I saw a letter so shallow and lacking in coherence,” Lapid wrote. “The fact that, as is common with petitions like this, the majority of the signatories are unaware of the reality here in the Middle East, doesn’t reassure me. It only takes one ‘useful idiot’ like Roger Waters [the expression is not an insult but a phrase attributed to Lenin to describe weak liberals used by cynical regimes for their own ends] to call Israel an apartheid state and the liberal choir will immediately stand to attention and sing the chorus with him. Why? Because everyone wants to be like Nelson Mandela but no one has the patience to learn the details.”Lapid said he wished the signatories knew that Israel twice offered the Palestinians the chance to build an independent state on more than 90 percent of the territories, and on both occasions the Palestinians refused.“Do they know that Gaza is ruled by Hamas, a terrorist organization that punishes homosexuality with hanging, that severely restricts the freedom of women to do such dangerous things as running a marathon or riding a scooter, and where Jews and Christians don’t have the right to live?” he asked. “Maybe when they aren’t signing petitions they would prefer democratic regimes, like Israel, where there is freedom of expression and freedom of the press and where rights for the LGBT community are protected by law, where Muslims and Christians serve in the Supreme Court, the Knesset and senior positions in the military, and where women have served as prime minister, as president of the Supreme Court and in the highest ranks of the army?” Lapid wrote that Israel’s only demand in the conflict was security for its citizens.
“As artists – who by definition are people with imagination – are they willing to take a moment and consider this: let’s imagine that following a call in The Guardian the IDF puts down its weapons and stops protecting the people of Israel for 24 hours – what do they think would happen?” he asked. “If you don’t share the imagination of an artist let me tell you: radical Islamists would kill us all. Women and children first. That’s what they’re doing to their brethren in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and across the Islamic world. What are the chances that they’d spare us?”

<title>South African president who helped end apartheid opposes boycott of Israel</title>
<date>21/6/2015</date>
<content>
South Africa's last president under white rule said Sunday that he opposes sanctions or a boycott against Israel as sanctions against South Africa had only served to delay reform and hurt the black population more than they hurt the white population.Speaking in an interview with Israel Radio, F.W. de Klerk said that sanctions "are more counterproductive than helpful to change any country on the course it is taking." 




South Africa's system of apartheid, or racial segregation between whites and blacks, drew international boycotts in the 1980s and saw American and European companies divest from the country.De Klerk was the last president under the apartheid regime, bringing about the end of the system together with Nelson Mandela, who replaced him as president.De Klerk posited in the Israel Radio interview that boycotts only serve to make the society being boycotted more extreme and to shut out the voices of moderates."In the case of South Africa, our experience has been that sanctions at times delayed reform. It had the affect of driving the white population, who at that stage had all the power, into a corner and they resisted it fiercely." de Klerk said."In the end, sanctions hurt the people they were intended to help much more than it hurt the white population. Blacks suffered, job creation suffered as a result of that and they were as much the victims of the sanctions as the people against whom the sanctions were actually intended," he said.The former South African president said that only through dialogue can a change in policy come. "Dialogue and negotiation and interaction between leading countries of the world and South Africa would have achieved a much better result, and would have inspired earlier reforms and changes in the South African situation," he said.De Klerk rejected the comparison of apartheid South Africa and Israel, saying, "I think comparisons are odious and I wouldn't like to draw direct comparisons. I prefer dialogue and negotiation as a way to get governments to change their attitude."De Klerk's comments came as the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel has gained steam in recent weeks, drawing frequent comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other politicians.Earlier this month the British National Union of Students passed a motion to boycott Israel and affiliate with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. Days later, the CEO of French telecom giant Orange said that his company wanted to cut ties with Israel. The move was perceived in Israel as a call to boycott Israel, a claim that Orange CEO Stéphane Richard later denied.Netanyahu has claimed that the BDS movement is motivated by anti-Semitism, saying that it will not help bring about peace between Israel and the Palestinians.

<title>Leftists in European Parliament torpedo meeting with visiting IDF Major General</title>
<date>5/2/2015</date>
<content>
A planned meeting of Maj.-Gen. Yoav Mordechai, the coordinator for government  activities in the territories, in the European Parliament was canceled on  Tuesday shortly before it was to take place because of objections by left-wing  politicians.Mordechai, in Europe to discuss closer cooperation with the  EU, a body extremely critical of Israel’s polices in the West Bank, was  scheduled to meet with the European Parliament’s Delegation for Relations with  Israel, a body responsible for “maintaining and developing Parliament’s contacts  and relations with the Knesset.”




Italian MEP Fulvio Martusciello, the  chairman of the group, sent a note inviting some members of the parliament to  meet Mordechai, saying his visit presented an “excellent opportunity to carry an  open dialogue, as well as raise issues of mutual interest.”The planned  visit, however, triggered opposition.Portuguese parliamentarian Marisa  Matias, from the European United Left–Nordic Green Left grouping, was quoted as  saying that “giving him [Mordechai] a platform to host a lecture would  legitimize his violations of international law and human rights. Rather than  giving a warm welcome to those who stand for repression and apartheid, the EU  institutions should pressure the Israeli government to abide by the rules of  international law and UN resolutions. We must bring to justice those responsible  for human rights violations in the Occupied Palestinian  Territories.”Another member of the same political grouping, Northern  Ireland MEP Martina Anderson (Sinn Féin), chairwoman of the parliament’s  Delegation for Relations with the Palestine Legislative Council, welcomed the  cancellation, even though she said the reasons behind it were  unclear.But, she was quoted as saying, “We condemn the fact that it was  set to go ahead in the first place. We can’t accept someone with such a track  record being welcomed to the European Parliament. Put simply, this man has blood  on his hands.”
Hadar Horon, the spokeswoman for the office of the coordinator for government activities in the territories, said that Mordechai's visit was meant to strengthen cooperation with the EU. While acknowledging that the meeting with the parliament members was called off, she said that Mordechai was “continuing with his meetings in Europe, where he will relay his message.”

<title>Letters to the Editor: Netahyahu's Speech</title>

Netanyahu’s speech
I greatly admire Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s  eloquence, so ably demonstrated last week in New York (“PM slams UN silence on  Iran threats,” October 2). However, I was disappointed at the emphasis he placed  on the Iranian dangers, which occupied more than two-thirds of the time he spoke  – his battle with US President Barack Obama on the issue was already lost, and  not much could be gained by an eloquent appeal to UN delegates.Less than  one-third of his speech dealt with the lack of a peace agreement with the  Palestinians.




The prime minister should have taken the opportunity to  refute Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’s claim that you cannot  negotiate with an occupying power. He should have explained that Israel is most  certainly not an occupying power.Historically, the whole of the  territory from beyond the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea belonged to the  Jewish nation from over 3,000 years ago.Moreover, in the Balfour  Declaration, the holders of the mandate over the territory decreed that such  land should be returned to the Jewish people. Despite this, Israel is prepared  to cede parts of this land for the setting up of a Palestinian  state.Acceptance by Abbas of the invitation to meet directly with  Netanyahu is essential, and this should be endorsed by the UN member  states.MONTY M. ZION Tel Mond Perhaps no other speech by a world leader  was more vital to US security, as well as that of the entire world, than the one  made by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the United Nations.It has  become abundantly clear that America and the free world have been sold out by  President Barack Obama, with his agreement to eventually allow Iran to develop  nuclear weapons. The Iranian demand that their assets be released proved the  sanctions were working. When I learned of the sell-out, I pondered: “My God,  what are we doing? Where have we failed in electing leadership to protect our  security?” I have come to the conclusion that our only hope for survival in  today’s crisis-filled world is Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel. I was overjoyed to  hear him state and restate that Israel will never allow the Iranians to acquire  a nuclear weapon. Israel is perhaps the only nation other than the US and Russia  that is capable of carrying out this guarantee.The saddest aspect of  this situation is that as citizens of the greatest, most powerful nation in the  world, we Americans must rely on Israel to protect us.JAMES W. ANDERSON  Talladega, AlabamaI observed the leader of your nation stand before the UN  General Assembly and put the envoys there in their place. In my opinion and the  opinion of many in the US, the UN does not represent what is good in the  world.The president of my country has turned his back on Israel for  political purposes, but I want you to know that the people of the United States  stand shoulder to shoulder with you. Our president will be out of office shortly  and will be replaced – God, I pray it will happen – with a man who represents  the people of this nation; much of what has happened in the past seven years,  including the stabbing of Israel in the back, needs to be corrected.Be  proud you are represented by a leader who “tells it like it is.”

PETER  KELLY Conroe, Texas Embarrassing opposition With regard to Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech at the United Nations, representatives of the Left –  who would give away the country slice by slice if only they could win the  approval of the undemocratic, inefficient UN – called the seconds of silence in  the prime minister’s speech “embarrassing” (“Opposition Knesset members  encourage PM to stay silent,” October 2).I watched some clips of the  address, and I was filled with pride in my country and my prime  minister.Those silent seconds were heavy with anger and rich with  determination.Zionist Union MK Shelly Yacimovich accuses Netanyahu of  “harming Israel by sticking his finger in the eye” of US President Barack Obama.  Now that’s embarrassing.MARCELLA WACHTEL Jerusalem Look who’s talking 
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas unbelievably stated at the UN that  the Palestinians “will not remain the only ones committed to the implementation  of these [Oslo] agreements” (“Abbas threatens to stop abiding by Oslo Accords,”  October 1). The fact is, the Palestinians themselves have failed to implement  the accords.• Terrorism: No actions to control individual or organized  terrorism.No attempt to disarm lawless militias.• Propaganda:  Failure to thwart calls for jihad and eliminate hatefilled rhetoric in schools  and adverse propaganda in Palestinian media outlets, instead nurturing a “cult  of death” among students as opposed to promoting peace education.•  Israel’s existence: Refusal to accept the Jewish state while using inflammatory  language, such as “occupation” and “illegal settlements.”ALEX ROSE  AshkelonIncisive Bones
I would like to congratulate Yaakov Kirschen for the  most incisive cartoon (Dry Bones, October 2).With the whole world  seemingly ganging up against us, we, whether on the Right, Left or Center,  religious or not, must realize that we have – and always have had – one true  friend and partner: the Torah.Well done, Jerusalem Post!

EALLAN  HIRSHFELD Ra’anana Any day of the year 
With regard to Gil Troy’s “Put  Jerusalem’s High Holy Days on your bucket list” (Center Field, September 30),  let’s just call a spade a spade: A shehakol (general) blessing on a glass of  water any day of the year in Jerusalem is worth more spiritually then a Yom  Kippur prayer service in any Jewish community in the Diaspora.REUVEN  PRAGER Jerusalem Good manners 
In “Are Labor MKs racist?” (Think About It,  September 21), Susan Hattis Rolef draws attention not to racism, but to lack of  manners.Allow me to add that it was Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett who  had the best manners. One day, he passed by my mother on the street. Not having  greeted her, he phoned to apologize.Arabs do have manners. On one of my  first days in the Knesset, fellow Alignment MK Abd el-Aziz e-Zoubi congratulated  me and gave me a gift, a necklace. According to required manners, I reciprocated  with a gift, a cigarette box, the very next day.We should teach manners.  It would help the relations with our neighbors and the world.ESTHER  HERLITZ Tel Aviv The writer was an MK in the 8th and 9th  Knessets.

Unreported news 
There have been new disclosures that close to  40 years ago, Yitzhak Rabin warned that expanding settlements meant Israel would  face a future of “apartheid.”This news did not appear in The Jerusalem  Post. It is one of a number of times I have found important stories reported by  other major Israeli news organizations that would be “inconvenient truths” for  the Israeli Right, and thus did not appear in the Post.Those who read  only the Post might be learning about Rabin’s statement just from this letter.  This is disconcerting.Rabin now joins three other Israeli prime  ministers who have linked settlement policy to the term “apartheid” or to South  Africa: David Ben-Gurion, Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak. This adds to the  statement’s credibility. (I myself emphatically deny that “apartheid” can be  used to describe the situation in Israel proper, only about the current reality  in the West Bank.)

<title>'Likud politicians instructed to emphasize that Congress can override Obama's veto'</title>
<date>25/1/2015</date>
<content>
Likud politicians have been instructed to emphasize in interviews that the US Congress can, by law, overide a veto of a bill by the US president, Army Radio reported on Sunday.According to the report, the party issued a list of talking points to its MKs and ministers, instructing them to stress that a majority of 67 senators can overturn a presidential veto.




The report comes amid criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for accepting an invitation from US House Speaker, Republican John Boehner, to speak before Congress, without the knowledge of the administration of US President Barack Obama.Critics have charged Netanyahu with damaging relations with the Obama administration in order to score points domestically by giving a speech to Congress against the wishes of the US president on March 3, just two weeks before Israel's election.Both Netanyahu and Republican members of the Congress, as well as many Democrats in Congress, support levying further sanctions on Iran, or passing a bill to threaten such sanctions in order to keep pressure on Iran in talks regarding the Islamic Republic's nuclear program.The Obama administration has argued that a bill calling for sanctions to be triggered should Iran deviate from an interim deal on its program, would violate the terms of the deal and throw a monkey wrench into efforts to come to a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue. Obama has said that he would veto any such bill.An initial vote on the the sanctions bill will be likely to earn bipartisan support; it was written by Democrat Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, and Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois. The bill will be introduced with “balanced co-sponsorship,” one senior aide says.However, both Obama and European leaders have lobbied Democratic senators against supporting such a bill. The bill will almost surely pass, but it is unlikely that it will garner the number of Democrats necessary to clinch more than 67 votes.That number matters because, should Republican leadership seek a second vote after the president vetoes the bill, 67 votes will be required to override his action.But asking Democrats to vote for a bill on Iran that the president opposes is an entirely different request from asking them to override a Democratic president’s veto.Historically, only four percent of all presidential vetoes have been overturned – and in the last fifty years, only one of those has related to foreign policy. Ronald Reagan vetoed a bill brought to a vote by his own party in the Senate in 1986 that sanctioned South Africa for apartheid; a vote to overturn the veto codified the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act in October, three months after it was originally introduced.

<title>Manfred Mann returns to Earth</title>
<date>19/9/2015</date>
<content>
There are only a handful rock bands that have enjoyed two more distinct, yet successful phases of their career. Fleetwood Mac comes to mind, with their bluesheavy, Peter Green-led lineup of the late 1960s that morphed into the tuneful pop mega-band of the Lindsay Buckingham/Stevie Nicks era.And how could anyone forget The Bee Gees, who transformed from endearing pop warblers into falsetto disco kings? In the current century, look no further than Darius Rucker, who transformed from the throaty lead singer of slacker rockers Hootie & the Blowfish into a cowboy-hatted country superstar.




Not as dramatic as any of those examples but perhaps the pioneers in the field of musical reinvention is Manfred Mann Earth Band, who are coming to Israel on Monday for a show at the Wohl Amphitheater in Tel Aviv. In the mid-1960s, the band was simply known as Manfred Mann, named after its Jewish founder, keyboardist (born Manfred Lubowitz).A jazz musician as a youth in Johannesburg, Lubowitz strongly opposed the apartheid system and in 1961 moved to the UK, where he fell in with a group of rock musicians. The band they formed - Manfred Mann - was one of the most popular acts of the British Invasion, with hits like their cover of Bob Dylan’s “Mighty Quinn” and other good-time tunes like “Pretty Flamingo” and “Do Wah Diddy Diddy.” The band became known as one of the most prolific interpreters of Dylan’s material, tackling “It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue” and “Just Like a Woman,” among others.But by the late 1960s, intent on joining the coterie of bands expanding their scope in the wake of the progressive rock explosion, Mann disbanded the group and reformed it as Manfred Mann’s Earth Band. For a few years, they released a series of albums that saw them stretch out in long, instrumental jams and synthesizer flourishes that met with modest success.It took a reinterpretation of another bard’s music - this time Bruce Springsteen - to resuscitate their career and propel them far beyond any place they had been. Mann’s cover of the Boss’s “Blinded by the Light” (spurred by the titillating high school crowd mystery of whether they were singing “deuce” or “douche”) was a giant hit worldwide. And they scored again with Springsteen’s “Spirit in the Night” and “For You.”The ensuing years didn’t see any major movement on the charts for the band, despite regular album releases and touring. But their popularity in the nostalgia realm remains high. Mann has veered in and out of retirement but occasionally dusts the mothballs away and takes the group on the road, joined by longtime member Mick Rodgers and three relative youngsters.
Their last performance in Israel took place in 2004, and if that show was any indication, Monday’s performance will cover the entire range of the group’s output, from the early pop hits to jazzy interludes to a whole lot of Dylan and Springsteen covers.

<title>Hamas’s Mashaal: ‘Jerusalem intifada’ will continue</title>
<date>22/10/2015</date>

Hamas political leader Khaled Mashaal was quoted on Thursday as saying that it  is the responsibility of all Palestinians to “liberate al-Aksa Mosque and  Palestine.”Mashaal, who is currently on a visit to South Africa, also  told an ANC-sponsored rally in Cape Town that the “Jerusalem intifada” would  continue “until Palestinians achieve freedom and the land returns to Palestine  and its people.”




During the speech on Wednesday, he said that Hamas is  “opposed to ideological extremism.” Hamas, he claimed, had chosen the path of  “moderation” and is not hostile towards anyone because of his  beliefs.Interrupted by cheers of “Takbir” from hundreds of Muslims in  the crowd, he denied claims that Hamas is “a terrorist organization,” saying  that it is a political movement struggling for justice, Palestinian freedom, and  independence.“Hamas believes in a struggle against the oppressors,” he  said.Mashaal claimed that Israel is seeking to “divide in time and  space” al-Aksa Mosque so as to allow Jews to pray at the site. He also claimed  that Israel’s actions are designed to “change the history and identity of  Jerusalem by turning it into a Jewish city.”Mashaal also drew parallels  between Israel’s actions, including the construction of the security barrier in  the West Bank, and the former apartheid regime in South Africa.“You in  South Africa have achieved your freedom and the Palestinians are also aspiring  to achieve their freedom,” Mashaal said. “Don’t expect them to stop their  uprising; don’t expect them to stop the resistance.”A guest of the ANC,  Mashaal has met in Pretoria and Cape Town with President Jacob Zuman and senior  officials, the party’s youth branch and representatives of NGOs that support  Hamas.
In Jerusalem, the Foreign Ministry summoned the South African  ambassador to voice Israel’s “shock and outrage” at South Africa’s hosting of  Mashaal.

<title>Matisyahu returns with a king’s crown</title>
<date>30/9/2015</date>
<content>
‘It feels nice to be back in the good graces of the Jews,” chuckles Matisyahu  into the phone. “I went to my old shul I used to daven in on the Upper West side  today – the Boyaner shtiebel – and everyone was happy to see me.”The  36-year-old singer with the Hassidic/reggae/ hip-hop roots had just moved back  East after years in California to a house in the upscale suburbia of Nyack, New  York and was referring to his much publicized outward transformation from  bearded black-hatter to clean-shaven, bareheaded, GQ-worthy pinup.




“After  I shaved, there were some mixed feelings for a lot of Jewish people,” he told  The Jerusalem Post last week.“Whatever, a lot of people thought that I  gave up on Judaism. But the people who really followed my music and listened to  what I had to say in my lyrics knew what was going on and respected what I did.  But I’m sure 80 percent of those people sitting around the Shabbes table were  going ‘oh yeah, he used to be Jewish.’” Born Matthew Paul Miller, Matisyahu  needed no reminder of his Jewish heritage and its connection to Israel this  summer when he found himself at the center of an international imbroglio  surrounding his appearance at Spain’s Rototom Sunplash Festival.The  former Chabad hassid who has identified with Israel regularly and performed here  many times said that the organizers of the festival emailed him before the event  to inform him that they were being pressured by Boycott, Divestment and  Sanctions (BDS) activists, and asked him to make a statement in support of  Palestinian statehood and against Israel “war crimes.”When he refused,  he was taken off the bill, resulting in mass publicity and a reversal of the  decision.But when Matisyahu hit the Spanish stage, he was greeted with a  sea of Palestinian flags in the crowd and anti-Israel taunts throughout his  performance.“I felt the anger – these people were bullies and were  really trying to mess with me,” said Matisyahu. “It didn’t feel like it was just  hippies in America protesting for the sake of protesting.”He performed  his usual set, defiantly including the song “Jerusalem,” that includes the lines  “The gas tried to choke but it couldn’t choke me.” But he recalled that he was  rattled during the set.“I felt like I was vulnerable, fully aware that  they were like 50 feet away from me standing on each other’s shoulders, and if  they wanted they could broach the stage,” he said. “But what happened was – and  it’s a very Jewish thing actually – was when the music began, I got this spark  that made me stand up and not back down. The only reason why Jews are here today  is because we have this thing inside of us that when we are threatened, it turns  on something.”“It was like when I used to play ice hockey as a kid. I  was this most peaceful guy with dreadlocks, but then get me on the ice and have  someone mess with me, this switch would turn on inside me. It happened again in  Spain and I haven’t felt that same energy since I was a kid.”Because of  the Spain experience, and then going on to perform in Poland, including a show  near Auschwitz at a synagogue in Oswiecim, Matisyahu then hightailed it to  Jerusalem in late August, where he found solace in making an impromptu  appearance at the Jerusalem Sacred Music Festival.“I always want to go  to Israel and I’ll play in Israel anytime someone asks me to,” he said. “Going  from the Spanish ‘inquisition’ to Poland, it just felt like the right thing to  come to Israel. The love I was getting from Israel during that time was really  intense.”Describing his performance at the festival with Hadag Nahash  leader Sha’anan Street and Palestinian rapper Sez, Matisyahu called it “perfect  – it was about unity and continuing the conversation between Israelis and  Palestinians. It felt right that I was together with Sha’anan and Sez. It’s all  about dialogue.”Matisyahu chalked up the Spain encounter to a number of  factors – mainly fashion, ignorance and anti-Semitism.“It’s fashionable  to attack Israel. Some people just want to be bullies and mess with someone and  Israel is a convenient target,” he said. “And there’s so much ignorance. Calling  Israel an apartheid state? They don’t have a clue to what the situation really  is. People are so quick to form opinions without investigating things on their  own. And ultimately, there is real anti-Semitism that exists in the world. It’s  a combination of all these things.”Experiencing none of that during his  brief visit to Israel, Matisyahu wanted more. The Jerusalem Sacred Music  Festival show was in front of a small, sold-out audience at the Tower of David  Museum, so the energized singer was eager to perform at other venues in Israel.  But logistics pushed back the efforts to the first possible date – October 10 at  Sultan’s Pool outside Jerusalem’s Old City walls – where the only flags likely  to be flown will be of the blue and white variety.Since his last full  show in Israel in 2011, Matisyahu has disbanded the Dub Trio which backed him up  through much of his career and said he’s excited about his new  lineup.“The music I made with the Dub Trio didn’t really connect with  people in Israel, I thought,” said Matisyahu.“It was a murky, sludgy and  heavy sound. People are looking for high energy from me and the new band I put  together with members of different bands I’ve played with helps me do  that.”Celebrating his 10th year as a recording artist and his 2005  breakout hit “King Without a Crown,” which helped make tzitzit and peyot cool  among the MTV crowd, Matisyahu said that he’s taken away some valuable lessons  from the journey.“I learned that it’s all about inspiration – about  making music that inspires me, and if I’m inspired, then the audience will be  inspired,” he said. “I always try to maintain an authenticity in my  performances.At times it’s been difficult, but I’m always looking for  that new fresh moment or groove or something new.”What he also learned  was the importance of balancing his career with his family. Divorced in 2011  from his ex-wife Talia, Matisyahu said his priority is to maintain a stable  environment for his three sons and his young daughter, who was born last year to  a different mother and recently successfully underwent heart surgery.
“My  home life is the main thing that’s suffered over the last 10 years, so my goal  for the next 10 is to be grounded and healthy, to take care of my boys and my  girl, my body, mind and spirit, and to continue to support them by making music.  It’s a tremendous blessing.”

<title>Michael Oren attacks Kerry - 'He won't deter Israel from protesting bad deal'</title>
<date>24/7/2015</date>
<content>
MK Michael Oren (Kulanu) assailed US Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday hours after the latter warned Israel against launching a military strike against Iran."If American legislators reject the nuclear deal, they will do so exclusively on the basis of US interests," Oren said. "The threat of the secretary of state who, in the past, warned that Israel was in danger of becoming an apartheid state, cannot deter us from fulfilling our national duty to oppose this dangerous deal."




Kerry said on Friday it would be a huge mistake if Israel decided to take unilateral military action against Iran over its nuclear program in the future.Kerry was asked in an NBC "Today" show interview if the nuclear deal reached last week between would make it more likely that Israel might attempt a military or cyber attack on Tehran."That'd be an enormous mistake, a huge mistake with grave consequences for Israel and for the region, and I don't think it's necessary," Kerry said.Oren's successor, Ron Dermer, met with House Democrats on Thursday, lobbying for their support in an effort to scuttle the Obama administration's signature foreign policy achievement since the president took office - the recently signed nuclear agreement between Tehran and world powers which aims to curb the Islamic Republic's ambition in an attaining a nuclear weapon.According to Politico, who spoke to multiple lawmakers about the effort, Dermer's message was clear: "Don’t worry about voting against the Iran deal, because no matter what, the US will not allow the Islamic Republic to obtain a nuclear weapon."Dermer may have a long hill to climb, however. Capital Hill insiders say their is not enough support amongst congressional lawmakers in either the House or the Senate to override President Barack Obama's promise of a  veto should the fiercely partisan US Congress agree to kill the deal, according to Politico. Yet, Dermer and company will not go down without a fight. In fact, the most influential pro-Israel group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), will deploy about 300 lobbyists on Capitol Hill next week to try to convince lawmakers, especially undecided Democrats, to vote against the deal, according to officials in the pro-Israel camp.AIPAC's plans are being coordinated with allied groups such as Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran that are sponsoring a national television advertising campaign, the pro-Israel sources said. They are expected to spend upwards of $20 million, one source said.

<title>National Arab school strike and protests next week if Christian school budget dispute not resolved</title>
<date>21/9/2015</date>
<content>
The Arab Higher Monitoring Committee met in the northern Israeli-Arab city of  Sakhnin on Monday and accepted a Joint List proposal presented by MK Yousef  Jabareen (Hadash) to declare a strike in all Arab schools in the country next  week if the Christian educational budget dispute has yet to be  resolved.The Committee would meet again next week to decide on a  specific day for the nationwide strike and protests that would affect  half-a-million students, Jabareen said.




He emphasized that “the planned  general strike reflects the joint struggle of the entire Arab community against  the continued discrimination of Christian schools.”The Arab Higher  Monitoring Committee is an organization that coordinates Arab political action  and is made up of Arab MKs, municipal leaders and other community  figures.Christian-Arab schools have been striking since September 1,  protesting budget cuts.Also on Monday, the Knesset discussed the strike  in Christian schools, and Education Minister Naftali Bennett explained that his  policy isn’t one of discrimination by race or religion, but to prefer public  schools over private ones.MK Zouheir Bahloul (Zionist Union), one of the  initiators of the discussion, complained that the Education Ministry wants to  make all church schools public and under its jurisdiction.“Why is the  Education Ministry sabotaging schools that already proved themselves? The Arabs  are not enemies of Israel, these are not underground schools. We want to be  integrated in the life of this country,” he said.Joint List chairman  Ayman Odeh said the fight is not only for Christian schools, but for equality  and justice.Referring to a result of the coalition agreement, he asked:  “Why is there a special article in the budget for haredi schools, and a  different one for non-public schools, including Christian ones? Is there  apartheid? Is there one law for one group and other laws for other groups?... I  want equality between church schools and haredi schools.”Odeh explained  that the current situation is a result of Yesh Atid, in the previous government,  seeking to force ultra-Orthodox schools to teach the core  curriculum.However, the new coalition, which includes Shas and United  Torah Judaism, budgeted funds for haredi schools, and now Christian schools are  being harmed by Yesh Atid’s policy instead.Bennett said that he needs  more time to examine the policy of cutting the budget for non-public schools,  and in the meantime, if the strike ends, he is willing to give the Christian  schools NIS 25 million to cover the funds slashed in the last two years and then  some.However, he would not commit to replenishing the funds for the  coming years, saying that he has to study the issue and that the policy of  preferring public schools over private ones is legitimate – even if he hasn’t  decided if he agrees with it or not – but it is not discriminatory.He  also said he has to make sure that changing the funding will not bankrupt public  schools.“I am the education minister of all Israeli children, without  preference of religion, race, gender or sexual preference,” Bennett said. “There  is no discrimination by religion or race, there is preference of public schools  over private ones and that applies to Jews as well.“I commit that, in  every office I hold or every job I have, I will never in my life allow a person  to be discriminated against because he is Arab,” he added.Bennett  explained that public schools must accept all children, and the private schools  do not, which he thinks is an elitist, unjust policy.He added that that  is the main problem with private schools, even more than the Education  Ministry’s supervision.“Meanwhile, there are children stuck at home for  no reason.... Come to my office in the Knesset now, and let’s solve the  problem,” he implored the Arab MKs.The 47 Christian schools around the  country teach 33,000 pupils and account for a third of students in the overall  Arab community, Jafar Farah, the director of Haifa’s Mossawa Center – The  Advocacy Center for Arab Citizens in Israel, told The Jerusalem Post earlier  this month.He added that around half of the pupils in Christian schools  are Muslim.

<title>Netanyahu: Kicking Israel out of FIFA will ruin world soccer</title>
<date>29/5/2015</date>
<content>
If world soccer governing body FIFA votes to oust Israel, it will be bad for  Israel, but ultimately destroy the organization, Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu said on Thursday.The prime minister spoke during a briefing  with the country’s diplomatic correspondents, came on the eve of Friday’s annual  FIFA meeting, and as Israel was working intently to prevent the Palestinian  motion to kick Israel out of the organization from coming to a vote.




“The  attempt to hurt Israel politically will destroy FIFA, because it will start with  Israel and then go to one country, and then the next,” he said. He said this  would mark the ultimate politicization of sport.Netanyahu said that when  he served as ambassador to the UN in the 1990s, his first speech – which lasted  three minutes – had to do with efforts at the time to get Israel expelled from  the world body.“I said that it was clear that disagreements had to be  dealt with in an equal manner, and that the model for all parliaments was the  ancient Greek Assembly,” he said. He then reminded them that the Greek Assembly  eventually fell apart because of the practices of ostracizing  members.“The same thing is liable to happen to FIFA,” he  said.The prime minister’s remarks came as additional demands raised by  FIFA President Sepp Blatter – now beleaguered with a massive scandal – in a  meeting with Israel Football Association chairman Ofer Eini on Thursday have  added to concerns about Friday’s vote.The Israeli officials had believed  they were nearing a compromise that would see the Palestinians withdraw their  proposal after negotiations between the sides had resulted in understandings on  several issues.Proposing Israel’s suspension, the PFA has accused it of  hampering its soccer activity in the West Bank by imposing travel restrictions  on its athletes and overseas visitors.Israel cites security concerns for  the restrictions and has proposed procedures to ease travel for athletes and  sporting officials.The parties agreed that once a month a committee,  which includes the IFA, Palestinian Football Association and FIFA  representatives, will meet to solve any travel problems that might arise, with  certain players and officials to receive passes that will allow them to travel  without special permission.Israel also agreed to help the PFA build new  stadiums in the West Bank.In Thursday’s meeting with Eini in Zurich,  however, where FIFA’s 65th Congress is being held, Blatter asked the IFA to also  agree that FIFA would approach the UN to determine whether the five Israeli  clubs that are based in the West Bank can be part of the IFA, while also  demanding to set up a committee that will look into racism in Israeli  soccer.Eini rejected Blatter’s additional requests and said he would  rather the proposal come to a vote.The IFA is concerned that FIFA’s  corruption scandal could hurt its chances in the vote.“Undoubtedly there  is a lot of politics going on here, and unfortunately Israel’s position is not  great,” Rotem Kamer, chief executive of the IFA, told Walla. “We are being  portrayed as an apartheid state.”Kamer said the confluence of a  reelection bid by Blatter and the arrest in Zurich of seven senior figures in  the organization on US corruption charges was not helping Israel.“There is  no way of knowing which way the vote will go when Blatter is seeking  reelection.There is no doubt that he can be pressured, also because of  the affair that has just exploded,” Kamer said. “He needs the Arab votes and it  could be that to this end, Israel will have to be sacrificed.”Blatter  visited Israel, including the West Bank, this month but failed to find a  compromise that would head off the PFA’s call for a vote. If Israel were  suspended, its clubs and teams would be unable to take part in international  competitions such as the Champions League and Euro 2016 competitions.The  Palestinian complaints are long-standing, with the PFA having put them on the  agenda of FIFA meetings in 2013 and 2014.Last-minute compromises were  found in the past to prevent the issue coming to a vote.Eini told UEFA  delegates on Thursday that he expects them to stand by Israel’s side if Friday’s  vote goes ahead. A vast majority of the 54 European members are likely to vote  against the proposal, meaning it is likely the Palestinian proposal will be  defeated, as 75 percent – 157 members – of the 209-member body are needed for it  to pass.Even though it is unlikely the Palestinians will garner 157  votes, Jerusalem would very much prefer that the motion not come to a  vote.Although Israel could claim that the world’s “moral majority” voted  against the move, if some 100 countries vote for it, it would demonstrate  Israel’s weakness in the international arena and could invite other such  initiatives.“The basic principle that needs to be adopted,” said Foreign  Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nachshon, is that “there is a need to completely  separate sports and politics.”Meanwhile, as PFA head Jibril Rajoub is  leading the charge, Palestinian Media Watch issued a report saying Rajoub  promotes terrorism.The report said Rajoub is a convicted terrorist who  spent 15 years of a life sentence for throwing a grenade and “continues to call  for the murder and slaughter of Israelis.”The report quoted an interview  with him on the Fatah-run Awdah TV in August 2014 saying that Fatah’s relations  with Israel are those between enemies and “no one is stopping anyone” from  “slaughtering a settlement.”“Our political decision is resistance in the  occupied territories in order to bring an end to the occupation [using] all  forms of resistance,” he said.The report quoted an anti-Semitic rant he  uttered on official PA TV in 2012, saying there will never be normalization of  ties with Israel.“Next time we are prepared to bring the Executive  Committee in helicopters [so they won’t go through Israel]... They will see no  Jews, no Satans, no Zionist sons of bitches.
Come by helicopter and go  back by helicopter,” Rajoub said.

<title>Netanyahu to Kerry: Green light for Palestinian building projects dependent on end to terror</title>
<date>25/11/2015</date>
<content>
Israel will not allow Palestinian projects in Area C, the West Bank territory  under its control, unless it is given a green light to build in the settlement  blocs, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told US Secretary of State John Kerry  on Tuesday, according to Israeli diplomatic officials.The comments came  amid reports that Israel was weighing the freeing up of hundreds of hectares in  Area C – which comprises some 60 percent of Judea and Samaria – for Palestinian  projects. The Palestinians and the EU have been clamoring for permits to build  industrial, residential and commercial projects in Area C for months and even  years.




Speaking at a conference in Tel Aviv two weeks ago, Martin Indyk,  former US Middle East envoy, said that during the final stages of the 2013-2014  peace negotiations, Israeli officials were willing to hand over portions of Area  C to the Palestinian Authority and freeze settlement building.“In the  last night of the negotiations that I was involved in, the Israeli negotiators  came with an offer of tens of thousand of dunams [thousands of hectares] of Area  C, that they were prepared to give over to the Palestinian Authority’s control  to build what they would want to on them, without the permit regime and so on,”  he said. “And that came in the context of a settlement freeze.”But  Netanyahu, according to diplomatic officials, told Kerry on Tuesday that if the  international community expects permission to be given to the Palestinians to  build, Israel expects recognition of its right to build in the settlement blocs,  in return. He also added that there would be no additional settlement  freeze.Netanyahu said that in any event, a restoration of calm is the  first condition to any economic or security steps that Israel may take toward  the Palestinians. In practice, Netanyahu said, the civilian projects that the  Palestinians are interested in will only be possible if the level of violence is  lowered and Israel’s security needs are met.The comments came over more  than four hours of talks that Netanyahu held with Kerry, shortly after his  arrival in the country on Tuesday morning. Kerry also met with President Reuven  Rivlin, before heading to Ramallah for a meeting with Palestinian Authority  President Mahmoud Abbas.Part of the Netanyahu-Kerry meeting was held  with only Netanyahu’s chief envoy to the Palestinians, Yitzhak Molcho, and the  US’s current Middle East envoy, Frank Lowenstein, participating. Other  officials, including Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon, and Interior Minister  Silvan Shalom, the minister in charge of negotiations with the Palestinians,  participated in various parts of the meeting.At the start of his meeting  with Netanyahu, Kerry – on his first visit to Israel in more than a year – said  Israel has both a right and an obligation to defend itself against  terrorism.“Clearly no people anywhere should live with daily violence,  with attacks in the streets, knives, or scissors, or cars,” he said. “It is very  clear to us that the these acts of terrorism that have been taking place deserve  the condemnation they are receiving. Today I express my complete condemnation  for any act of terror that takes innocent lives, disrupts the day-today life of  a nation.”Kerry, at a joint photo opportunity with Netanyahu in the  prime minister’s office, said he wanted to talk to Netanyahu about ways the  international community can “push back” against the terrorism.Kerry  indicated that the meeting with Netanyahu would also focus on other regional  issues, such as Syria and Islamic State.“We all have an interest,  needless to say, in working against this spasm of violence that is interrupting  the daily life of too many nations,” he said.Netanyahu, who greeted  Kerry by calling him a “friend in our common effort to restore stability,  security and peace,” said there could be no peace when there is an onslaught of  terrorism.Netanyahu said the international community should support  Israel’s fight against terrorism, since the rest of the world is “experiencing  this same assault by militant Islamists and the forces of terror.”“It is  not only our battle, it is everyone’s battle. It is the battle of civilization  against barbarism,” he said.Netanyahu, according to the officials, told  the secretary of state that the main problem right now is Palestinian religious  incitement – especially surrounding the Temple Mount – on social  media.In Ramallah, meanwhile, Kerry’s meeting with Abbas focused on ways  of calming the situation, and came amid widespread Palestinian criticism of  Kerry and the US administration.“Kerry did not carry any new ideas to  solve the current crisis,” one PA official said. The official added that Abbas  warned during the meeting that Israel’s actions in Jerusalem and the West Bank  were the cause of the current wave of violence.Abbas demanded that the  US put pressure on Israel to “stop its aggression and provocations against the  Palestinians,” the official said.PLO Secretary-General Saeb Erekat, who  attended the meeting, said Abbas handed over to Kerry five “files.”One  file, Erekat said, was about the 95 Palestinians killed between October 13 and  November 23, while another contains details about the bodies of Palestinian  assailants held by Israel.The three remaining files, according to  Erekat, are related to settlement activities, Israeli “incitement” against  Palestinians, and recent security measures taken by the IDF in the West Bank, in  general, and Hebron, in particular.Erekat said Abbas reiterated during  the meeting his commitment to a two-state solution.Abbas accused Israel  of working toward destroying the two-state solution and “consolidating an  apartheid regime” in the Palestinian territories.Erekat quoted Abbas as  telling Kerry that the Palestinians were “defending themselves” against Israeli  measures.Following the meeting in Ramallah, Kerry said he had a long and  very constructive and serious conversation with Abbas.“I want to say  that I know the situation for Palestinians at this time is very dire, that there  are extraordinary concerns, obviously, about the violence,” Kerry said. “I want  to make it very clear that I’m here at the request of President [Barack] Obama  to see what we can do to try to help contribute to calm and to restore people’s  confidence in the ability of a two-state solution to still be viable, to be  achieved at some point. We are committed to that, two states with two peoples  living side by side in peace and security.”Earlier, several Palestinian  factions condemned Kerry’s statements in Jerusalem describing the Palestinian  attacks as terrorism, and they said he was unwelcome in Ramallah.The  factions said Kerry’s statements were proof of “US support for Israeli  terrorism.”They called on the PA leadership to boycott Kerry because his  statements were “offensive to the blood of the martyrs and a provocation against  the feelings of our people.”The factions, including Hamas, Islamic  Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and others, claimed  that the main purpose of Kerry’s visit to the region was to “thwart the  intifada.”The factions said Kerry’s statements show that the US is  “biased” in favor of Israel.As Kerry was meeting with Abbas,  representatives of Fatah and other Palestinian factions held a protest in the  center of Ramallah and called for the expulsion of the US secretary of state  from the city.
The protesters carried placards condemning Israeli  “terrorism” and equating Israel with Islamic State. They also strongly condemned  Kerry for describing the Palestinian attacks as terrorism and “fully endorsing  the Israeli narrative.”

<title>'Netanyahu will soon find himself ruling from the Jordan to the Mediterranean'</title>
<date>23/10/2015</date>
<content>
The Palestine Liberation Organization is once again threatening to disband the Palestinian Authority and transfer overall control of West Bank towns and cities to Israel.In an interview with Al Jazeera on Friday, the PLO's secretary-general and top peace negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said that the interim administration in Ramallah that was created by dint of the Oslo Accords is on the verge of shutting down.




"Very soon, you’re going to hear some decisions," Erekat told Al Jazeera. "We are an authority without an authority. Soon enough [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu will find himself the only [one] responsible between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean because he’s destroying the Palestinian Authority.”“The PA...is being destroyed, finished by Netanyahu," Erekat said. "Now we’re not going to be an authority by name. Yes, if Netanyahu thinks he can sustain the status quo we’re telling him you’re wrong and you’re invited to assume your powers as the occupying power.”When asked about the recent wave of Palestinian violence against Israelis in Jerusalem and elsewhere, Erekat said “we don't condone the killing of people, we want to make peace, we want to save lives, Israelis and Palestinians”.
“We are fully supporting our people and their cry for freedom,” he said of the Palestinians.
The veteran peace negotiator also accused Netanyahu of aiming for an “apartheid” regime in Israel and the West Bank.“He doesn’t seek a two-state solution, he seeks one state, two systems – apartheid,” Erekat said.The Palestinians have threatened to dissolve the PA on numerous occasions in the past, only to backtrack under pressure from Israel and the United States.In his address last month at the United Nations General Assembly, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas dropped his promised bombshell when he threatened to stop abiding by the Oslo Accords, which have governed the relations between Israel and the Palestinians for more than two decades.“Israel has destroyed the foundations upon which the political and security agreements are based,” Abbas said.“We therefore declare that we cannot continue to be bound by these agreements and that Israel must assume all its responsibilities as an occupying power, because the status quo cannot continue....As long as Israel refuses to cease settlement activities and release of the fourth group of Palestinian prisoners in accordance with our agreements, it leaves us no choice but to insist that we will not remain the only ones committed to the implementation of these agreements.”Although he directly referred to the Oslo Accords, he stopped short of stating that they had been annulled, and instead relied on watered-down language that tempered the impact.Senior Palestinian officials have said that Abbas changed the text from concrete action to a threat under pressure from US Secretary of State John Kerry.The Palestinian leader also did not clearly announce the dissolution of the Palestinian Authority or the canceling of security cooperation with Israel, as some speculated he would. Nor did he resign.Abbas warned that either the PA would be a transitional power moving toward independent statehood, or Israel must take full control of the Palestinian people as an occupying power.
“Either the Palestinian National Authority will be the conduit of the Palestinian people from occupation to independence, or Israel, the occupying power, must bear all of its responsibilities,” he said. “The state of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders with east Jerusalem as its capital, is recognized by 137 countries and should be considered a state under occupation, as was the case for many countries during World War II.”

<title>‘Our mandate is to isolate Israel,’ BDS leader tells 'Post'</title>
<date>16/6/2015</date>
<content>
The mandate of the international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign is  “to isolate Israel,” a spokeswoman for the movement told The Jerusalem Post on  Tuesday.Interviewed by phone, Kwara Kekana of BDS South Africa denied  accusations leveled by Jewish organizations that her organization is  anti-Semitic, a claim heard increasingly as companies such as France’s Orange  appear to be buckling under pressure to sever ties with the Jewish  state.




The BDS movement’s branch in South Africa has been one of the most  vocal worldwide, and has been involved in a series of high-profile incidents  that have caused vocal outrage among Jewish communal bodies.In 2013 one  of the movement’s leaders justified calls to “shoot the Jew” heard during a  protest against a concert by an Israeli musician. During that incident,  protesters screamed at concertgoers slogans such as “Israel is apartheid” and  “Down, down Israel.” Some also threw paper at the Jewish attendees.The  call to kill Jews was “just like you would say ‘Kill the Boer’ at [a] funeral  during the ’80s [and] it wasn’t about killing white people. It was used as a way  of identifying with the apartheid regime,” BDS coordinator Muhammed Desai said  at the time.Asked if the group is hostile to Jews, Prof. Farid Esack,  writing on behalf of the board of BDS South Africa, expressed his opposition to  “any and all incitement to violence and racism – including anti-Semitism and  Zionism.”More recently the movement hosted convicted Palestinian airline  hijacker Leila Khaled on a nationwide speaking tour. In an email to supporters,  organizers termed her an icon of the Palestinian struggle, showing an image of  the PFLP member clutching an automatic weapon and comparing her to president  Nelson Mandela.“Many Palestinians including Leila Khaled are today  considered terrorists like the ANC and Nelson Mandela were once classified as  terrorists,” the group declared. “The picture of a young, determined looking  woman with a checkered keffiyeh scarf, clutching an AK-47, was as era-defining  as that of Che Guevara, Ruth First and other political figures from our recent  past.”At the time, Kekana said she did not expect the South African  Jewish Board of Deputies, which condemned the tour, to understand “the meaning  of hosting someone like Nelson Mandela, the South African struggle icon, or  Leila Khaled, the Palestinian struggle icon.”The Jewish communal group,  she said, had proudly supported the apartheid regime, just as it supports an  Israeli “regime that is killing innocent Palestinians.”Jewish ire at the  group continued to build in April, when a diplomatic spat between Pretoria and  Jerusalem prompted the BDS movement and allied organizations to threaten to  “take it upon ourselves to be at the Israeli Embassy… to expel the Israeli  ambassador.”The movement also complained about the “Israel  lobby.”Kekana denied accusations of anti-Semitism, explaining that the  campaign has Jews among its adherents.“Oftentimes there is a discussion  BDS being anti-Semitic which is completely false. BDS if anything subscribes to  peace.Against all forms of racism, which includes anti-Semitism,  xenophobia, you can name it,” she said.Asked if she believes that Israel  has a right to exist or if Zionism is a form of racism, she responded by  explaining that “the current form that Zionism as an ideology is being applied  today” constitutes a “fundamental problem” for her.Another such issue is  “the way in which Israel wishes to exist at the expense of an indigenous  population,” she said. “It wishes to exist in a state that wishes to exclude  another group and also wants to exist at the expense of an indigenous  population.”Her mandate is to “isolate the apartheid state of Israel  until it listens to international law” and gives in to three “nonnegotiable”  demands: the end of its occupation of lands claimed by the Palestinians, the end  of “apartheid” and acceptance of the Palestinian right of return.Asked  if going outside of the framework of negotiations to pressure Israel would make  it less likely that a negotiated solution could be reached, she said the issue  of talks is up to the political leadership of the Palestinians and her only  concern is getting Israel to begin “complying with international  law.”Negotiations, she added, have to be undertaken in good faith and  cannot go ahead while Arab “political prisoners” remain in Israeli jails or  while there is any building in settlements.Negotiations under such a  state are ridiculous, she said, indicating that she believes that negotiations  between the two sides could commence only once Israel has been isolated and made  to comply with her movement’s demands.The general consensus among the  international community is that issues such as Jerusalem, borders and refugees  must be dealt with in negotiations.Despite the presence of Arabs in the  Knesset and the Supreme Court, she insisted that Israel meets the definition of  an apartheid state under a United Nations definition.Asked how a right  of return might be implemented, especially given the Israeli reluctance to give  in on a point that many believe to be demographic suicide for the state’s Jewish  majority, she said that she does not know what it would mean at the end of the  day.“What is a right of return? I think that we really need to start  having those discussions.The preoccupation right now is not about  creating peaceful agreements, and I don’t think we are there yet. We are not at  a point where we need to be discussing what the right of return itself needs to  look like. For one now Israel does not acknowledge the fact that Palestinians  have a right to return to indigenous land,” she said.
In an interview  this week with the Arab website Bokra which was also run by 972 Magazine, Omar  Barghouti, one of the founders of the international movement, stated that the  “Oslo accords disenfranchised Palestinians in the 1948 region, causing a serious  rift. On the contrary, the BDS movement insists on the right of all Palestinians  to exercise self-determination as a unified people and, as such, insists on the  rights of all Palestinians, including ‘48 Palestinians.”

<title>PA leaders meet to seek mechanisms that ‘define’ relations with Israel</title>
<date>7/12/2015</date>
<content>
For the second time in less than 24 hours, a key  decision-making Palestinian body met in Ramallah to discuss putting in place  mechanisms to “define” the Palestinian Authority’s relations with  Israel.The discussions come amid increased demands from Palestinians to  suspend relations in wake of Israel’s “refusal to abide by signed agreements”  with the Palestinians.




On Saturday, the PLO Executive Committee during a  meeting chaired by PA President Mahmoud Abbas entrusted a special committee to  discuss the issue.The Fatah Central Committee also met in Ramallah on  Sunday to discuss “defining security, economic and political relations” between  the PA and Israel. This meeting was also chaired by Abbas.Both the PLO  and Fatah accused Israel of turning its back on signed agreements with the  Palestinians and “stepping up its dangerous assaults” on the  Palestinians.They also accused Israel of carrying out “summary  executions, ethnic cleansing, desecrating Islamic holy sites and house  demolitions.”A statement released by the Fatah leaders following their  meeting said Israel’s measures were tantamount to “war crimes” and accused  Israel of destroying the two-state solution and working toward creating a  one-state solution with an “apartheid” system.The Fatah committee hailed  the Palestinians killed in the recent wave of violence as “martyrs and  heroes.”In a related development, the PA Foreign Affairs Ministry  strongly condemned “continued invasions” by Jewish groups to al-Aqsa Mosque and  said that these “invasions” were aimed at dividing the Temple Mount in time and  space between Muslims and Jews.
It warned that the Israeli government was  seeking to turn the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from a political one to a  religious one.

<title>Palestinian group calls on Bon Jovi to boycott Israel</title>
<date>2/7/2015</date>
<content>
A Palestinian group has created an online petition urging Bon Jovi to "reconsider his upcoming concert in apartheid Israel," which is scheduled for October 3rd in Tel Aviv. The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel created the petition through the website change.org, claiming that Bon Jovi's concert "is already being used to divert attention from Israel’s human rights abuses and war crimes."




The petition, which was put online earlier this week, already has 1,000 signatures. This is not the first time a Palestinian organization has called on international artists to boycott Israel. In May, American hip-hop  vocalist Lauryn Hill canceled her scheduled  concert in Rishon Lezion after BDS members used social media to convince Hill not to play. They created an online petition, a 
KillingMeSoftly  hashtag, a meme  depicting an image of Lauryn Hill with the words “Hey  Lauren You’re  
KillingMeSoftly,” as well as a video of pro-Palestinian  activists singing their  version of the hit song.In recent years,  musicians such as Sinead O’Connor, Talib Kweli and,  more recently, Sonic Youth’s  Thurston Moore have come under pressure  from pro-Palestinian organizations to  boycott Israel.Earlier this year, Some 700 British artists pledged to boycott Israel in an initiative called Artists for Palestine. The artists,  who include Roger Waters, Brian Eno, Mike Leigh, Ken Loach, Richard  Ashcroft, and others, pledged that they “will not engage in  business-as-usual cultural relations with Israel.”Bon Jovi has not responded to the petition, and the concert is still set to take place as expected.

<title>PLO: Jewish plans to add installations at Western Wall a 'flagrant assault'</title>
<date>5/12/2015</date>
<content>
The PLO announced on Saturday its opposition to Israeli plans to build Jewish “installations” at the Western Wall plaza in the Old City of Jerusalem.Referring to the Western Wall by its Arabic name, Ha’it al-Buraq, the PLO Executive Committee warned that building Jewish “installations” at the plaza would constitute a “flagrant assault” on Islamic religious sites and its “status among Palestinians and Arab and Muslim peoples.”




The PLO ’s announcement, which came following a meeting in Ramallah chaired by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, was made in response to a plan to build a center called Beit Haliba (House of Core Values) in the plaza.The center, which has been promoted by the Western Wall Heritage Foundation and Western Wall administrator Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, will include offices, a museum and an educational center. The plan was recently approved by the Jerusalem Municipality.The PLO warned that the approval of the plan to build the center would have “dangerous repercussions and undermine prospects of moving forward with any political settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”The PLO called on the Israeli government to “take the hand of the [Jerusalem] occupation municipality off the Aksa Mosque and its premises.”The PLO meeting was held to discuss ways of implementing previous decisions by various Palestinian bodies to revise the PA ’s security, economic and political relations with Israel. The PLO leaders entrusted a political committee with putting in place mechanisms to “define” the Palestinians’ relations with Israel.They also repeated their charges that Israel is carrying out “summary executions” and imposing collective punishment against Palestinians.The PLO leaders also condemned house demolitions and arrests of Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, and accused Israel of destroying the two-state solution and “consolidating the status quo by creating a detestable apartheid system.”The PLO called for dispatching a commission of inquiry to the Palestinian territories to investigate Israeli “war crimes” against Palestinians.“Combating and defeating all forms of terrorism, regionally and internationally, requires ending Israeli occupation and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital on the 1967 borders,” the PLO said in a statement.
“The continuation of the occupation feeds all forms of extremism and violence in the region and the world.”

<title>Responding to UN speech, opposition encourages Netanyahu to stay silent</title>
<date>2/10/2015</date>
<content>
Knesset members in the opposition said they were unimpressed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to the UN General Assembly on Thursday.Reacting to Netanyahu’s 45-seconds of silence in the middle of his speech that were intended to protest the world’s lack of response to Iranian threats to destroy Israel, they said the prime minister should exercise his right to remain silent a lot more often.




“Instead of the embarrassing silence today, he should have been silent [seven] months ago rather than speaking to Congress and harming Israel by sticking his finger in the eye of the president of the United States,” Zionist Union MK Shelly Yacimovich said.The speech was full of useless gimmicks and recycled cliches, she said, adding that Netanyahu’s vow that the Jewish people would no longer be passive was farcical because, under his leadership, Israel has been completely passive and non-pioneering on both the Palestinian and Iranian issues.Zionist Union chairman Isaac Herzog said that if he were prime minister he would deliver messages of hope, not despair, calling the speech further evidence that he should replace Netanyahu rather than join his government.“The speech does not change anything, and won’t have any diplomatic impact,” Herzog told Channel 2. “He should have used the speech to invite the leaders of the region to a diplomatic process.”Yair Lapid, chairman of the Yesh Atid party, who is in the US for diplomatic meetings, praised the speech for relaying key messages to the world about the need to not have hypocritical policies against Israel, but said the prime minister missed an opportunity.“Speeches are not a replacement for polices,” Lapid said.“A real leader must present an alternative. Bibi needs to know that if he does not present an alternative vision, someone else will do it for him and harm Israel.”Bayit Yehudi MK Uri Ariel said the prime minister presented a mirror to the world’s hypocrisy on the Iranian and Palestinian issues, and he called upon Netanyahu to respond to the world in general, and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in particular, by strengthening Jewish communities over the Green Line and annexing part of Judea and Samaria.Joint List MK Yousef Jabareen said neither he nor the world believes it when Netanyahu says he accepts the two-state solution.
“Netanyahu is leading Israel to become an apartheid regime in which Israel controls the fate of five million Palestinians and prevents them from having the right to freedom and self expression,” Jabareen said. “Netanyahu’s political scare tactics endanger the future of the entire region. Only the creation of a Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital beside Israel will give hope to everyone.”

<title>PLO'S Erekat: Netanyahu attempting to construct an 'apartheid system'</title>
<date>13/12/2015</date>
<content>
PLO Secretary-General Saeb Erekat, speaking at the HaaretzQ conference in New York, accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government of working towards building an "apartheid system" in the West Bank, blaming the prime minister for the death of his nephew, who was killed last week after attacking soldiers guarding a checkpoint.Referencing his nephew's terror attack, Erekat said, "I don't dare talk about peace, I want to congratulate Netanyahu for  destroying the culture of peace and negotiation," adding that Netanyahu  is "destroying the two-state solution and trying to build an apartheid  system." 




The senior negotiator added that "a two-state solution is the most cardinal interest of the Palestinian people," saying that "there is no such thing as a one-state solution." "We might not be able to achieve a two-state solution tomorrow, but Israelis and Palestinians have no other option," Erekat said.
After his own conduct had been called into question, the senior Palestinian Authority diplomat acknowledged that with regards to incitement, sometimes "mistakes" are made, saying that "sometimes it's hard to differentiate between freedom of speech and incitement." He added that the Palestinian leadership is "trying to fix it."

<title>South African BDS activists set sites on US pop superstar Pharrell</title>
<date>4/8/2015</date>
<content>
Concerts scheduled by US pop star Pharrell Williams in South Africa next month face disruptions from pro-Palestine protesters over a promotional deal he has with major retailer Woolworths, which has trade ties with Israel.The Grammy award-winning producer and performer has been targeted by the South African branch of the international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel (BDS) movement. It objects to Israel's 48-year-old occupation of territories where Palestinians seek an independent state.




Williams is collaborating with Woolworths on its "Are You With Us" campaign, acting as style director on several sustainability-focused projects encompassing fashion and fundraising for education."He is about to face the biggest backlash any artist has faced in South Africa in over 30 years, since the days of apartheid," said Braam Hanekom, a BDS South Africa board member."He is walking into a very angry, unhappy environment because he has chosen to walk with Woolworths," Hanekom told Reuters after the City of Cape Town denied an application by thousands to protest at Pharrell's first concert on Sept. 21.He said protesters could block roads on concert nights, potentially delaying proceedings, or even rally inside venues.Pharrell's representatives did not respond immediately for comment. Grand West Casino, where the Cape Town concert will take place, said they would not allow any protests on their property. The second concert is in Johannesburg.Pro-Palestine marches in South Africa often attract large crowds, especially in Cape Town with its large Muslim community.Woolworths said in a statement that it did not source produce from the occupied territories, less than 0.1 percent of its food came from Israel and that it clearly labelled every product's country of origin.
The global BDS movement has also campaigned against British security firm G4S over its Israel links. It says its pleas have prompted musicians including Irish rocker Sinead O'Connor and hip hop star Lauryn Hill to support its cause.

<title>South African BDS activists threaten to personally expel Israeli ambassador</title>
<date>28/4/2015</date>
<content>
As South Africa’s Jewish community expressed concern Tuesday over Jerusalem’s  decision last week to bar Minister of Higher Education Blade Nzimande from  entering the country, the South African boycott movement threatened to march on  the Israeli Embassy in Pretoria and expel the ambassador.In a joint  statement, the South African Jewish Board of Deputies and the Zionist Federation  noted their concern regarding Israel’s denial of a visa to Nzimande, who has  been highly critical of Israel and was slated to attend a meeting with his  Palestinian Authority counterpart in Ramallah.




The higher education  minister, who accused Israelis of attempting to “hide their atrocities” by  blocking his visit, subsequently came under harsh criticism from Foreign  Minister Avigdor Liberman, who cited recent violent attacks against foreigners  throughout South Africa.Both the Jewish Board of Deputies and the  Zionist Federation called the diplomatic flap “regrettable,” arguing that  “regular interaction between Israel and South Africa and mutual visits of  political leaders, parliamentarians and government officials, as well as  business people, media, tourists and family visits, are to the benefit of both  South Africa and Israel and foster greater understanding between the two  countries.”The Jewish representative bodies also accused their own  government of imposing restrictions on the movement of officials between the two  nations, stating that the “practice of discouraging interaction between South  African officials and their Israeli counterparts is contradictory to the way  South Africa has traditionally engaged in conflict resolution, both domestically  and in its foreign policy in general.”Several years ago, the South  African government issued a directive to “discourage” its citizens from visiting  Israel.Not all members of the Zionist Federation agreed with their  national leadership, however.In an op-ed in The Jerusalem Post on  Tuesday morning, Ben Levitas – the president of the federation’s Cape Council, a  regional chapter – praised Israel’s decision to prevent Nzimande’s  entry.“Nzimande actively activated and propagated the severing of links  between the University of Johannesburg and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in  Beersheba,” he wrote, adding that the minister had “overstepped the line of  protocol” by accusing Israel of massacres and genocide.On Monday, a  number of South African organizations, including the South African Communist  Party, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement and the Congress of South  African Trade Unions, held a joint press conference to offer what they termed a  “plan of action to hold Israel accountable for its right-wing discriminatory  policies.”The plan of action – which the BDS movement said had the  support of the PA Embassy as well – includes a renewed push to institute a  travel ban to Israel, an end to granting Israelis automatic visas, an academic  and agricultural boycott, and the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador.If  the South African government does not send Ambassador Arthur Lenk home within 10  days, the groups said, “our progressive organizations will take it upon  ourselves to be at the Israeli Embassy on the 15th of May to expel the Israeli  Ambassador.”The Foreign Ministry declined to comment.By banning  the minister, Israel has shown itself to be an apartheid state and a suppressor  of academic freedom, the signatories to the plan asserted, blasting the “Israeli  lobby” for its attempts to “isolate” South African political figures such as ANC  Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte.
Both Israel and South African  Jews criticized Duarte last year after she condemned IDF strikes against Hamas  as “barbaric attacks on the defenseless Palestinian people of Gaza” that were  reminiscent of “the atrocities of Nazi Germany.”

<title>Ted Cruz: A fresh approach to American foreign policy – and US-Israel relations</title>
<date>22/10/2015</date>
<content>
US Senator Ted Cruz, the conservative Republican firebrand from Texas, is  running for president. Up until a few weeks ago, his candidacy was met with  indifference as the media and political operatives all dismissed the viability  of his candidacy. But that is beginning to change. The voices arguing that Cruz,  the favorite of Tea Party fiscal conservatives and Evangelical Christians may  have what it takes to win the Republican nomination have  multiplied.Since arriving in Washington four years ago, Cruz has  arguably been Israel’s most avid defender in the Senate. During Operation  Protective Edge in July 2014, Cruz used his authority as a member of the Senate  Foreign Affairs Committee to force the Obama administration to end the Federal  Aviation Commission’s ban on US flights to Ben-Gurion Airport. Cruz announced at  the time that he would put a hold on all State Department appointments until the  administration justified the flight ban.




Rather than defend its position,  the administration restored flights to Israel after 36 hours.Last summer  Cruz led the national opposition to US President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal  with Iran. He brought thousands of activists to the Capitol to participate in a  rally he organized calling for Congress to vote down the deal. Rather than use  the rally as a means to promote himself, Cruz invited Republican front-runner  real estate developer Donald Trump to join him at the rally. Trump’s  participation ensured that the event received wide coverage from the national  media.I interviewed Cruz by telephone from the campaign trail earlier  this week about his views on the purpose of American foreign policy, US-Israel  relations, the Iran nuclear deal and the Palestinian conflict with  Israel.The transcript of our conversation follows.
Sen. Cruz, you  have managed to anger the two foreign policy wings of your party – the  neoconservatives and the isolationists – with your foreign policy positions. How  would you describe the rationale behind your foreign policy positions? 

Cruz: I  believe American foreign policy should be driven by the vital national security  interests of our nation. The most central failing of the Obama-Clinton foreign  policy is it fails to look to America’s national security interests. And as a  result, we have undermined our friendships and alliances across the globe, and  we have allowed our enemies to grow stronger in the face of weakness and  appeasement.
How does the US alliance with Israel align with that view? A  lot of Americans argue that by supporting Israel the US has diminished its  capacity to form alliances with the Arab world.Nobody who understands  the reality of foreign policy believes that. That is the view of the Obama  administration and the far Left. I think America’s alliance with Israel is  overwhelmingly in our national security interest. Israel shares the same  democratic values. It has been a tremendously important ally to America in a  very troubled region of the world. The military assistance that America provides  Israel yields enormous national security benefits to America.There are  some politicians who characterize the United States military aid to Israel as  somehow a form of assistance rather than a mutually beneficial military  alliance.I think that stems from a misunderstanding of the fundamental  dynamics.
[This week Obama instructed federal agencies to begin  suspending economic sanctions on Iran, in conformance with the nuclear deal he  concluded with the regime last summer. Cruz argues that the Republicans in  Congress have the constitutional authority to prevent Obama from suspending  sanctions. He expresses deep frustration with the Republican congressional  leadership’s refusal to do so.] Over a month ago I wrote a detailed letter to  [Senate] Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and [House] Speaker John Boehner laying  out a specific course of attack to stop this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.  The first step, I believe, is that the majority leader and the speaker of the  House should jointly conclude that Obama has not submitted the entire deal to  Congress as required by the Congressional Review Act, which explicitly defines  the deal to include any and all side agreements.The side agreements with  the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] governing the incredibly weak  inspection of the regime were not handed over to Congress.So under the  terms of federal law, the deal has not yet been given to Congress, which means  the clock for the congressional review has not started. The reason that is  important is because under the terms of the Congressional Review Act, it is  illegal for the administration to lift the Iran sanctions until the expiration  of the congressional review clock. If the clock has not started, then the  sanctions cannot be lifted consistent with law.Now unfortunately we know  what the next step will be to that. After six-and-ahalf years we have seen that  with President Obama we have a president who has repeatedly ignored and defied  federal law.So we can anticipate that he would do the same here and say  that it does not concern him; he intends to lift sanctions anyway.At  that point, what I recommended is that congressional leadership make abundantly  clear to each of the banks that is in possession of the frozen billions of  dollars that whether or not Obama chooses to disregard or ignore federal law  does not exonerate those banks from the obligation to follow binding federal  statutes.And if those banks, contrary to federal law, release billions  of dollars to Ayatollah Khamenei, then those banks will face potentially  billions of dollars in civil liabilities and even possibly criminal  prosecution.
But senator, they didn’t do any of those  things.Caroline, you’re exactly right that congressional leadership  refused to do any of this. Likewise, we just had a battle over the continuing  resolution [which funds the government without an approved budget]. I urged  Congress to fund the entire federal government but deny any federal funds to  implement this catastrophic deal. Again Republican leadership refused to do  that. So long as Republican leadership is unwilling to use the constitutional  authority given to Congress, the Obama administration will move forward with  this catastrophic deal.I will continue to fight on every front to stop  this deal. I believe it is the single greatest national security threat facing  America – the threat of a nuclear Iran.And I also agree with Prime  Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu that a nuclear Iran is an existential threat to  the nation of Israel. The challenge right now is Republican congressional  leadership has been unwilling to use the constitutional authority we have to  stop this deal.If that does not change, then Congress will acquiesce and  this deal will go forward for the next 15 months.This means nothing is  more important to stopping a nuclear Iran than the next presidential election in  America.And indeed I believe this issue is becoming the single most  important issue in the presidential election. I have pledged that if I am  elected president, to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal on my very first  day in office and to make abundantly clear that under no circumstances will the  nation of Iran, led by a theocratic ayatollah who chants Death to America, be  allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.On the other hand, if Hillary Clinton  is elected president, we know to a virtual metaphysical certainty that Iran will  acquire nuclear weapons. And if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, the odds are  unacceptable that it will use those weapons, either against Israel or against  America.
Over the past 15 years, through its sponsorship of Hamas and  Islamic Jihad and occasional support for Fatah, Iran has become a key factor in  the Palestinian war against Israel. The nuclear deal, which guarantees Iran will  receive hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming years, ensures that Tehran  will massively increase its funding for Palestinian terrorism. What we’re now  experiencing in Israel may in part be a consequence of the nuclear  pact.How would you characterize the Obama administration’s stewardship  of US relations with the Palestinians? This past this week I publicly called for  John Kerry’s resignation as secretary of state. This is the second time I’ve  done so. A number of months ago I called for Kerry’s resignation when he  wrongfully suggested that Israel could become an apartheid state, which is  slander. It is one often repeated by the terrorists, and it should not be coming  out of the mouth of a United States secretary of state.This past week  John Kerry and the State Department accused the nation of Israel of terrorism.  That is a blatant lie. There is a qualitative difference between antics of  Palestinian terrorists murdering innocent women and children in response to the  relentless incitement from Hamas, from the PA.There’s a qualitative  difference between that and the IDF defending the safety and security of the  nation of Israel.And John Kerry’s suggestion that they are morally  equivalent is wrong, harmful and deeply offensive.
If you are elected  president in 2016, what would your relationship be with the PA? I believe that  nobody wants to see peace more than the Israeli people. The barrier to peace is  not the government of Israel. The barrier to peace is Palestinians who refuse to  renounce terrorism and refuse to even acknowledge Israel’s right to exist as a  Jewish state.As it regards to US policy, I think for far too long,  American presidents have attempted to dictate the terms of a peace settlement.  In my view, America has no appropriate role dictating the terms of a peace  settlement.If Israel chooses to negotiate and reach a settlement with  the Palestinian Authority, that is Israel’s right as a sovereign state, and  America can help provide a fair forum for negotiations.But it is not the  role of the American government to attempt to lecture the Israeli people or  dictate terms of peace.No one has a greater incentive to seek peace than  the people of Israel, who have lived with the daily threat of rocket attacks or  knifings or terrorist bombs.
Do you think a Palestinian state west of the  Jordan River is a US interest? I think that is a question to be decided by the  nation of Israel and the Palestinian people.
You don’t think it’s a  question for America? I do not believe the United States should try to dictate  the terms of peace. We have seen now for two decades American presidents trying  to dictate the terms of peace. And it hasn’t worked.The Palestinians  have turned down every reasonable offer of peace. And I believe America should  stand unshakably alongside the nation of Israel. If I am elected president, that  is exactly what we will do.
Right now the PA is spending around $150  million a year to pay salaries to convicted terrorists sitting in Israeli  prisons. The US gives the PA about $550m. annually. Do you think  the US should reconsider its commitment to funding the PA? Of course we should.  The PA has formed a unity government with Hamas. The idea that American taxpayer  dollars are going to a government that is in unity with terrorists makes no  sense whatsoever. The idea that American taxpayer dollars are going to the PA,  which routinely engages in incitement, which celebrates the terrorists who  murder women and children, makes no sense whatsoever. We should not be funding  people who want to kill us. We should not be funding terrorists.This  goes back to what I mentioned before about the central failing of the  Obama-Clinton foreign policy – that it fails to focus on the vital national  security interests of America. Funding terrorists is directly contrary to our  national security interests and we should not be doing so.
The prevailing  wisdom is that building in Israeli communities beyond the 1949 armistice lines  causes Palestinian terrorism. Do you accept that? That is yet one more area in  which the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy is deeply misguided. The question  of settlements is a question for Israel as a sovereign nation to decide. I don’t  believe an American president should be dictating to the nation of Israel where  Israelis can choose to live. And the fact that Israelis choose to live in Judea  and Samaria is not justification for terrorism or murder. And it is yet another  example of the Obama administration’s repeated false moral equivalency to  suggest that it is.
That isn’t just Obama’s position. In the road map  peace plan, the Bush administration also called for Israel to revoke Jewish  property rights beyond the armistice lines, saying that doing so promotes peace.  Do you think that makes sense? I do not. As I said, my views are markedly  different from the Obama administration but also from the Bush  administration.I do not believe the American government should be  dictating terms of peace or settlement policy to the nation of Israel. Israel is  a sovereign nation.Israel is our ally. We should stand with Israel. We  should not presume to dictate matters of internal governance for the nation of  Israel. If I am elected president, we will not do so.
Under the Obama  administration, American power in the region has been massively diminished. The  power vacuum that followed is now being filled by Russia, Iran, Turkey, Islamic  State and others. How would you reassert American leadership, if you become the  next president? I believe one of the most, if not the most important issue in  the 2016 presidential elections will be restoring American leadership in the  world. That consists of number one, standing by our friends and allies. And  number two, standing up to our enemies. In both regards, the Obama-Clinton  foreign policy has been deeply misguided. We have proven over and over again to  be an unreliable friend to our allies under President Obama. Indeed, as I travel  abroad and meet with heads of states, foreign ministers and defense ministers of  allies across the world, the message is consistently the same, which is: “Where  is America? We cannot do this without America leading in the world.”
And  you are right, the consequence of America’s withdrawal from leadership is that  it has created a vacuum, and into that vacuum have stepped bad actors like  Russia and China and Iran and even ISIS [Islamic State]. That will change on  January 20, 2017. As I mentioned, on the first day in office, I will abrogate  this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. Also on the first day of office, I will  begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, the  once and eternal capital of Israel.

<title>The Brits that want to see Netanyahu behind bars</title>
<date>8/9/2015</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will visit London on Wednesday, where he  will be welcomed by his friend and ally British Prime Minister David Cameron.  “The visit will provide the opportunity to explore new bilateral cooperation in  a number of fields,” the Embassy of Israel in London said ahead of the visit,  “and to discuss regional issues affecting both countries.”When  Netanyahu’s convoy reaches Downing Street, however, he may notice that not  everyone is happy about his trip. Several anti-Israeli organizations are  planning a protest under the slogan “We tell Cameron: Netanyahu not welcome in  the UK.”




“Mr Cameron should get his priorities straight”, says Hugh  Lanning, Chair of Palestine Solidarity Campaign who claims to have sent Cameron  a letter with 10 thousand signatures, calling on the British prime minister to cancel Netanyahu's  visit and instead impose sanctions and an arms embargo on Israel. “We want to  know why David Cameron is welcoming a man directly responsible for UN-identified  war crimes to the UK,” he states. “His welcome for Netanyahu sends out a very  negative message about the UK government’s attitude towards Israel’s serial  human rights abuses and the war crimes it committed in Gaza last  year.”Participating in the protest is also Member of Parliament Tommy  Sheppard of the Scottish National Party, who will be a keynote  speaker.“I want to register on behalf of myself and my SNP colleagues a  concern about Mr. Netanyahu being welcomed by Cameron to London when we think  the British government should be trying to put pressure on the Israeli  government to change some of its policies with regard to settlements, the  occupied territories, treatment of Palestinians and actions in Gaza,” Sheppard  said in an interview with The Jerusalem Post. “I believe the current policies of  the Israeli government are probably the current largest obstacles to achieving  peace in the Middle East.”
MP Tommy Sheppard (left) meets Pro-Palestinian activistsOn the heels of an anti-Semitic attack in  Manchester on Monday, the Post questioned Sheppard over whether an anti-Israel  protest could snowball into an anti-Jewish one, in light of oft seen tendencies  to confuse the two. “Not if I have anything to do with it,” the MP responded,  saying he is very clear on the difference between criticizing the Israeli  government -- which he describes as “belligerent”-- and attacking the Jewish  religion. Addressing his views on Hamas -- which was also accused of war crimes  in the last Gaza war -- Sheppard said he thinks the terrorist organization needs  to be part of the conversation about Middle East peace. Sheppard himself shies  away from using the EU-designated term “terrorist organization” as a label for  Hamas: "They represent a significant strand within Palestinian opinion and they  have to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem." He opines that  if Hamas were involved rather than ostracized, Palestinian rockets on Israel  could be stopped.This protest is actually the climax of a long internet  campaign that started on August 7, when a formal petition calling for  Netanyahu’s arrest in the UK, created a media buzz that helped it reach more  than 105 thousand signatures. “Benjamin Netanyahu is to hold talks in London  this September.” The petitions states. “Under international law he should be  arrested for war crimes upon arrival in the UK for the massacre of over 2000  civilians in 2014.”

The government response was sharp and decisive:  “Under UK and international law, visiting heads of foreign governments, such as  Prime Minister Netanyahu, have immunity from legal process, and cannot be  arrested or detained.”The government response was no surprise to  petition initiator Damian Moran. “I didn’t really expect anything to happen,”  admits 38-year-old Mancunian Moran in an interview with the Post, “For sure not  with the UK’s current Prime Minister Cameron who supported South African  apartheid and supports the current apartheid in Israel, but the petition does  send a clear message that he (Netanyahu) is not welcome in the UK and that we  haven’t forgotten his crimes.” But I cannot take the credit for all the hard  work that has been done for this to go viral. I have a few good friends that I  network with and they did all the hard work.”
Petition initiator Damian Moran

Some of his “few good  friends” as he calls them are actually activists for numerous anti-Israeli,  pro-BDS organizations, that are conducting an aggressive campaign, including  graphic images, some of which have anti-Semitic undertones. One of these  activists, who requested not to disclose his details out of fear of being  heckled by pro-Israel activists - agreed to share his views and tactics with the  Post.“Are we anti-Semites? anti Jewish?”, he asks and answers, “No. We  do not campaign against Jewish people. Where is our campaign against Jewish  people living in Poland or The USA? We don't have one. We campaign against the  illegal occupation of Palestine by Israel.”This London based activist  calls himself a “human right activist”, but has no problem tweeting pictures of  Israeli leaders in Nazi uniforms, or horrific illustrations depicting IDF  soldiers as vicious murderers.

He claims that many people in the UK would  like to see Netanyahu behind bars. “Anyone who saw how (Palestinian youth) Abu  Khdeir was burned alive, anyone who saw Israeli people gathered on a hillside to  watch and be entertained by children being killed in Gaza would understand why  we don’t want anything to do with Israel.”
Netanyahu will land in the UK,  he won’t not be arrested, and he will meet and talk to Cameron on numerous  subjects. Are these protesters just a noisy minority? Could be, but it does  shine a light on Israel's diplomatic challenges in a not-always friendly Europe.

<title>UK Labor Party leadership front-runner unlikely to attend anti-Israel rally</title>
<date>26/8/2015</date>
<content>
British Labor Party leadership candidate Jeremy Corbyn, who has been dogged by allegations of anti-Semitism, is not now expected to participate in an anti-Israel rally in Cardiff next month.The protest is due to take place while Israel plays Wales as part of the European Championships soccer tournament qualifier series.




While media reports in recent days had stated that Corbyn will attend the rally, the Cardiff Palestine Solidarity Campaign website that promoted the demonstration on Tueasday did not list his name among the expected participants.According to a Sunday report, Corbyn was among those touted by organizers as planning to attend the protest, scheduled for September 6. It is due to take place less than a week before the Labor Party unveils the result of its leadership election.The British Jewish community has expressed misgivings about Corbyn. The Jewish Chronicle editorialized this month that it speaks “for the vast majority of British Jews in expressing deep foreboding at the prospect of Mr. Corbyn’s election as Labor leader.”“Although there is no direct evidence that he has an issue himself with Jews, there is overwhelming evidence of his association with, support for – and even in one case, alleged funding of – Holocaust deniers, terrorists and some outright anti-Semites,” the paper continued.The Palestine Solidarity Campaign is planning a march from Cardiff City Hall to the stadium where the match will be played.The advertisement for the march and rally reads, “In its treatment of Palestinians, Israel is an apartheid state, just as South Africa was. It imposes apartheid policies on all aspects of Palestinian life including football. Join the protests.”The PA led an unsuccessful attempt earlier this year to get Israel kicked out of soccer’s world governing body, FIFA.According to media reports, Corbyn was to join European Parliament member Jill Evans, Welsh Green Party chief Pippa Bartolotti and PLO Ambassador to the UK Manuel Hassassian at the event.While the other names appeared on the Cardiff Palestine Solidarity Campaign website on Tuesday, Corbyn’s was not featured.A query to the Corbyn campaign from The Jerusalem Post asking whether Corbyn ever planned to attend the rally – and if he did, the reason why he backed out – went unanswered.Eitan Na’eh, acting Israeli ambassador to the UK, spoke to officials in the British Foreign Office and the Secretary of State for Wales Stephen Crabb about the planned protests.Na’eh said the embassy asked the relevant officials to “look into the sensitivity of the timing of this protest,” and also “expressed concern over possible clashes around the stadium.” He said the police have also been consulted regarding security arrangements.Embassy officials are planning a series of events throughout the day with the Jewish community in Cardiff and the Israeli consul for Wales. Na’eh said that Jews from all over Great Britain were expected to come to support the Israeli team, but that there was no plan to counter the anti-Israel protests.Instead, he said, the embassy will “focus on positive events, in coordination with Friends of Israel chapters across the country.“We would like to see as many fans as possible at the game, and the embassy too will be present, celebrating friendship in football rather than hatred,” he said. “The Welsh team had a very good experience in Israel, and we are focused on promoting the positivity of Israel. What others choose to do to promote peace and understanding is their and their supporters’ problem.”
Wales decisively defeated Israel 3-0 when the two teams played their first qualifying game in Haifa in March.

<title>US national industrial union endorses anti-Israel BDS movement</title>
<date>31/8/2015</date>
<content>
A US national industrial union accused Israel of ethnic cleansing and voted to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers union voted on the resolutions on Aug. 20 during its national convention, the union reported on its website Friday.




The resolutions involving Israel and the Palestinians were voted on as part of a series of resolution on foreign policy issues, including support for the Iran nuclear deal. The union said in a statement that it was the first US national union to endorse BDS.The union has nearly 37,000 members throughout the country.The resolution on the Palestinians and Israel “points to Israel’s long history of violating the human rights of the Palestinians, starting with the ethnic cleansing of 750,000 Palestinians in 1947-48 that turned most of Palestine into the State of Israel,” according to the union. It also cites a statement issued by the union’s officers in 2014 condemning Israel’s war on Gaza.The resolution also calls for cutting off US aid to Israel as well as US support for a peace settlement on the basis of self-determination for Palestinians and the right of return.It endorses the worldwide BDS movement in order to “pressure Israel to end its apartheid over the Palestinians just as similar tactics helped to end South African apartheid in the 1980s.”
Union delegate Autumn Martinez, who said she met Palestinian trade unionists at the World Social Forum in Tunisia, said, “It’s absolutely disgusting what is going on. Free Palestine!”

<title>Violence breaks out at Arab riots in Ramle, Nazareth</title>
<date>11/10/2015</date>
<content>
Arabs rioted and protested throughout the country over  the weekend, with violent altercations taking place in Ramle and Nazareth on  Saturday.Around 100 Israeli Arabs demonstrated illegally in Ramle and  threw rocks at security forces that dispersed the demonstration.




In  Ramle, scores of youths clashed with police and destroyed property, hurling  stones and defacing traffic signs. At least 10 rioters were arrested by security  forces.Ramle was the scene of a violent protest on Saturday night, when  a group of around 100 locals, most of them young men, held a demonstration at  the Bialik traffic circle in the city.During the protest, a number of  masked youths blocked traffic and began throwing rocks at police. The rioting  persisted off and on for a couple of hours, until police arrested 10 people on  suspicion of throwing rocks.One of the protesters was lightly hurt and  taken to hospital for treatment, police said.In Nazareth on Saturday  night, a few dozen protesters blocked Paulos Street in the city and began  burning dumpsters and throwing rocks at police.Riot police and Border  Police officers arrested seven of the rioters, all of them Nazareth locals aged  18 to 39.Fayez Eshtiwy, the owner and general manager of the popular  Israeli-Arab news website Kul al-Arab at alarab.net told The Jerusalem  Post in an interview on Saturday night that he sees things quieting down in the  coming week.He said that the key issue for Arabs is the Aksa Mosque on  the Temple Mount. If it is quiet there, it will be quiet elsewhere. “When Jewish  extremist activists go to the Aksa Mosque it inflames the situation,” he  said.Eshtiwy also said that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud  Abbas said that Israeli Arabs should seek to calm the  situation.“Tomorrow [Sunday] things should go back to normal,” he said,  adding that Israeli Arabs should be allowed to return to visit Aksa  Mosque.Also in the North, small groups of rioters blocked off streets in  Kafr Kana and Kafr Manda.Saturday’s riots included disturbances in Taibe  and Kalansua in the Triangle, and Rahat in the Negev.Arab MKs were  planning to visit the Temple Mount on Sunday, but on Saturday night reconsidered  because of concern they would be playing into Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu’s hands.
MK Yinon Magal (Bayit Yehudi) wrote a biblical  reference on Twitter: “I have no problem if Arabs pray at al-Aksa, ‘because my  house will be called a house of prayer for all nations.’ “However, unlike the  Arab MKs who make provocations, Jews ascend quietly and respectfully, and if  Arab MKs are allowed on the Mount, then I will go on it, too,” he added. “It is  important to protect sovereignty and freedom of worship and oppose the apartheid  that Arab MKs are trying to force, as usual.”

<title>Ex-Mossad chief at anti-Netanyahu rally: Our leadership scares me more than our enemies</title>
<date>7/3/2015</date>
<content>
Speakers and attendees at a mass rally Saturday night against the reelection of  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on Israelis to vote in new leadership  in the March 17 election.The star of the rally was keynote speaker Meir  Dagan, the former head of the Mossad and a vocal critic of  Netanyahu.




“Israel is a nation surrounded by enemies, but I am not afraid  of enemies,” Dagan said.“I am frightened by our leadership. I am  afraid because of the lack of vision and loss of direction. I am  frightened by the hesitation and the stagnation. And I am frightened,  above all else, from a crisis in leadership. It is the worst crisis that  Israel has seen to this day.”Dagan’s speech came the day after Channel 2  aired an interview with the former spy chief in which he leveled scathing  criticism at Netanyahu. In the interview, Dagan can be heard saying “bullshit”  while watching Netanyahu tell the US Congress last week that Iran could sprint  to a nuclear device in less than a year. Dagan said the assessment is inaccurate  and also ridiculed the prime minister’s assertion that Iran has missiles that  could hit the US.Dagan also said Netanyahu’s appearance before Congress  was “a political speech that caused diplomatic and defense damage to Israel,”  and while an Iranian nuke is an “almost intolerable threat” to Israel, the way  Netanyahu has handled the issue has hurt efforts to stop the Islamic Republic’s  nuclear armament program.Tens of thousands attended the rally, which was  held under the title “Israel wants change.”The Facebook page for the  event said “Netanyahu’s leadership has failed. After being in power for six  years and heading two governments, the situation has only become more difficult  for Israelis: the cost of living has gone up, there is a real estate crisis,  there is no security, no peace, no hope.”The rally was organized by the  group “Million Hands,” which, according to its website, is devoted to the  two-state solution and made up of “a number of Israeli citizens who see the need  to separate from the Palestinians through establishing clear borders – a  necessary step in ensuring the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic  state.”Hillel Fertouk, a spokesman for the demonstration, said it was a  “political, nonpartisan rally.” He said no political parties were behind its  organization, and its message is meant to support “the Center and the Left” and  “to shift the priorities of Israel towards investing in education, health,  public housing, the cost of living, helping the elderly and the periphery, and  finding a political solution to the conflict.”Partisan or not,  supporters of the Meretz party and the Zionist Union were out in force, and  placards for Peace Now dotted the crowd.Above all, the message from the  attendees was: Netanyahu must go.Ohad and Hagar, a couple in their 30s  from Tel Aviv carrying a young infant, said they came because of the need to  send the prime minister packing, since “over the past six years he’s failed in  every field – in security, economy, social issues and in  diplomacy.”Though the election campaigns have focused mainly on social  issues, Maj.-Gen.(res.) Amiram Levine, the former OC Northern Command  and former deputy head of the Mossad, focused on diplomatic and security issues  in his speech at the rally, like his former comrade Dagan.“I have felt  that Israel is losing its way and we are on the path to disaster,” Levine said,  adding that he believes Netanyahu and others are leading Israel to a binational  or apartheid state.“If we continue to hold on to the dream of a great  Israel and control another people,” he said, “we will lose all of Israel.” He  said the IDF cannot continue to occupy another people, because it is a recipe  for failure.Earlier in the rally the crowd heard from Michal  Kesten-Keidar, whose husband, Lt.-Col. Dolev Keidar, was the commander of the  Geffen Battalion when he was killed in combat in July during a Hamas tunnel  infiltration in Operation Protective Edge.She also sounded the alarm  about the need for a political settlement with the Palestinians and the Arab  world.“I would give everything to prevent the last war from happening,”  she said. “That I cannot do, but I am asking you, for our children, we deserve  hope, we deserve a different, better life. Do whatever you can to prevent the  next war.”A number of speakers also addressed social issues, included  activists representing recent workers’ rights struggles, the social justice  protests since the summer of 2011, and those calling for more investment in  public housing.An impassioned speech was given by Rami Ibrahim, a Druse  officer in the IDF.“Just like the Jews, the Druse don’t have another  country,” he said, adding that the Druse suffer from terrible inequality in the  allocation of social services.Throughout the protest – which was  significantly more raucous before Dagan and Levine finished their speeches –  shouts of “revolution” and “Bibi go home” could be heard, as well as occasional  chants backing Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog.Wearing a Zionist Union  sticker on his shirt, 74-year-old Tel Avivian Eli Cohen said he worried mainly  about the anti-democratic trends in Israeli life under the Netanyahu government,  and what the future holds for Israeli society.“My father came to Israel  at the turn of the century,” Cohen said.“He is terrified of where this  country is going.”In response, the Likud said the rally was part of an  organized campaign by the Left funded by millions of dollars from abroad that is  intended to replace Netanyahu with a left-wing government led by Zionist Union  leaders Herzog and Tzipi Livni.The party said it is “strange that Dagan  says now that he does not believe in the current leadership after he himself  asked to have his term as Mossad chief extended by Netanyahu.”Knesset  Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee chairman Yariv Levin (Likud) also blasted  Dagan, noting that his attacks on Netanyahu have been featured on state-run  television in Iran.“The irresponsible blabbing of Dagan caused great  harm to the security of the state,” Levin said.“Dagan is acting out of  clear political motives. His hatred for the prime minister has blinded him long  ago from seeing reality.”Levin said he hoped someone who once held a  sensitive post would “restrain himself and not use his past to harm the future  of all Israeli citizens.”

<title>WATCH: Peres says upcoming Israeli election can break impasse in peace process</title>
<date>22/1/2015</date>
<content>
The upcoming election will determine whether or not the moribund peace process  can break out of its stalemate, former president Shimon Peres said on  Thursday.In an interview at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in  Davos, The New York Times’s Thomas Friedman asked Peres if there was any way to  break the deadlock for a peace process he termed “dead in the  water.”




Peres responded: “It depends who will win the  elections.There are actually two camps: one for a two-state solution and  one for managing the crisis.” If it were possible to manage a crisis, the former  president quipped, it would not be a crisis.When asked what Israel’s  founding father David Ben-Gurion would advise the current government, Peres, who  worked with Ben-Gurion, said he would seek peace.“Clearly he would go –  I mean he went for the two states,” Peres said, referring to Ben-Gurion’s  acceptance of the 1947 UN partition plan to create side-by-side Jewish and Arab  states. That plan, he said, was tough to accept because it didn’t leave Israel  much land, water or resources, but Israel took it anyway. The reality of Israel  turned out to exceed even the dream its founders had.“Since then I am  afraid of small dreams,” Peres said. “We should have dreamed greater and  larger.”Asked if he agreed that Israel would be safer if all French Jews  moved there, Peres responded, “I think a Jew must try to live freely in a free  world.” Those who come to Israel, he said, should not just come because of fears  of anti-Semitism, and Jews should feel free to live wherever they  want.“Anti-Semitism is not a Jewish sickness, it’s a non-Jewish  sickness,” he said. “And whoever is sick should go to a doctor, because it makes  the whole nation sick.”Throughout the short interview, Peres also  addressed the difficulty of dealing with Iran’s nuclear program. Israel, he  said, could not act alone on the issue, which he said was a world  problem.“If we shall do alone, we shall remain alone,” he said,  seemingly backing US President Barack Obama’s strategy of negotiating with the  Islamic Republic.Iran, he noted, was facing economic hardship not just  from sanctions, but also from low oil prices and a drought.“It’s very  hard to be great and poor at the same time,” he said.Peres said the idea  was to keep Iran isolated until it caved in, citing apartheid South Africa as an  example.According to Peres, F. W. de Klerk, the South African president  who oversaw the transition from apartheid, told him it wasn’t the sanctions that  forced South Africa’s hands, as much as the international isolation, the fact  that people stopped wanting to come to visit or participate with it in sports  events.“That can happen to Iran as well,” Peres said.He also  held out hope that Iran, like other places in the Middle East, would re-prioritize based on the needs of its young people.“I’m not sure that  the young generation in Tehran is of the same mind as the old leaders,” he said,  noting that 60 percent of people in the Middle East were under the age of 25.  “The Middle East will change finally by young people and women, because they are  victims of the current state.”Women’s empowerment, in particular, is  crucial for turning around Middle Eastern economies, he said, citing a World  Bank study that found Egypt’s GNP would increase by over a third if its women  had full rights.When Friedman asked Peres how, at the age of 91, he  remained so active and acute, Peres said the secret was to keep working instead  of taking “boring” vacations.“Count the number of achievements in your  brain,” Peres said. “Then count the number of dreams. If the number of dreams  exceeds the number of achievements, you are young.”Using the Hebrew  idiom for a long life, Friedman wished Peres “Ad 120,” to live until 120  years.
Peres’s reply? “Why are you so stingy?”

<title>White House: Settlement building isolates Israel in world, undermines chance for 2-state solution</title>
<date>1/2/2015</date>
<content>
Settlement building isolates Israel internationally and undermines the possibility of a two-state solution, the White House charged in response to the Israel Lands Authority’s issuance of tenders for 450 homes in the West Bank on Friday.“We have deep concerns about these highly contentious settlement construction announcements.




They will have detrimental impacts on the ground, inflame already heightened tensions with the Palestinians and further isolate the Israelis internationally,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters in Washington.Such announcements, he said, harms the US’s ability to build international support for Israel.“The United States, as a close ally of Israel, works – you know, uses our diplomatic influence around the globe to try to build support for Israel, and an announcement like this only serves to further isolate them,” he said.“Settlements are illegitimate and counterproductive to achieving a two-state solution,” Earnest said. “I can tell you that issuing tenders like this does nothing to bolster Israel’s security, it does not increase its prosperity and it does not further the cause of peace, in fact it does precisely the opposite.”The list of tenders includes the following projects: 156 homes in Elkana, 114 homes in Geva Binyamin (Adam), 102 in Kiryat Arba and 78 in Alfei Menashe.In addition, tenders were published for a hotel in Ma’aleh Adumim, as well as for business buildings in that city and in Emmanuelnorth of Ariel.According to Peace Now, a plan to construct 93 homes in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Gilo was deposited for public review with a municipal planning committee.A senior government official downplayed the significance of the ILA announcement.“Contrary to reports, there has been no authorization for new construction,” the official said.This is merely the automatic recycling of construction procedures for housing units authorized and announced over a year ago, during the negotiations with the Palestinians, which were known to all parties, the representative said.“No new housing units have been authorized or added.”The official’s words did not placate the US or the European Union, which similarly condemned the announcement.Settlements “are illegal in international law and constitute an obstacle to peace,” a representative of EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on Friday.“Israel should reverse these decisions, thereby putting an end to settlement expansion. The decisions risk inflaming the very tense situation on the ground,” the representative said.PLO chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said the world should recognize a Palestinian state in response to the tenders.“We call on the international community to recognize the State of Palestine,” Erekat said. He also said it should “ban all settlement products and to divest from companies and institutions linked directly or indirectly with the Israeli occupation and apartheid policies.”Such settlement building, he said, proved that the Palestinians must seek a two-state solution through the international community and not by directly negotiating with Israel.“This should serve as yet another reminder that empty calls for resumption of negotiations are not a substitute for justice and will not save the two-state solution,” Erekat said.Many Palestinians argue that only an imposed international solution can end the conflict and that negotiations with Israel are fruitless. The US, however, has continued to work behind the scenes to return the two to the negotiating table.On Tuesday, US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, “We continue to believe that final-status negotiations are the only way for the parties to reach a peaceful resolution, and we continue to work to move forward that objective.”The last US-led round of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations ended in April 2014, with no tangible signs of progress.Israel has insisted that settlement building has no relationship to the peace process, and that such construction continued during past periods of negotiation, such as after Oslo in the 1990s, Camp David in 2000 and Annapolis in 2008.It has further noted that the 10-month moratorium Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu implemented on construction over the Green Line from November 2009 to September 2010 did not lead to renewed negotiations.The Palestinians, in turn, have said that settlement activity is illegal under international law and must be halted.“Once again we call upon the international community to stop treating Israel as a state above the law and to support our diplomatic initiatives, which aim to preserve the two-state solution and to end the Israeli oppression of our people,” Erekat said.Netanyahu’s opponents immediately attacked him over the publication of the tenders and noted that the announcement, which comes in the midst of the election campaign, also followed a diplomatic spat between US President Barack Obama and the White House.Peace Now, which opposes any Jewish building over the pre-1967 lines, immediately said that it was yet another attempt by Netanyahu to embarrass Obama.“It is a preelection grab to establish facts on the ground made by the Netanyahu government. After embarrassing the Obama administration with the invitation to Congress, Netanyahu adds another slam in the face to the Americans, and showing no respect to Israel’s closest ally,” the NGO’s executive director, Yariv Oppenheimer, said.Former ambassador to the US Michael Oren, who is running for Knesset on the Koolanu ticket, said it was a mistake for Israel to announce the new housing units.“In light of the events of this week [Hezbollah’s attack on the northern border], a more appropriate Zionist response would have been to build in the Golan Heights and northern communities, ratheer than in Kiryat Arba,” Oren said.“This move certainly does not contribute to our relationship with the United States. It does not strengthen Israel’s ability to defend itself, nor does it allow it to garner international support for that defense.”Labor MK Stav Shaffir slammed both Netanyahu and Bayit Yehudi head Naftali Bennett.
Both men, she said, have a “distorted sense of priorities” in which they focus attention and funds on a small sector of society rather then looking out for the greater good.

<title>World would blame Israel if Congress vetoes Iran nuclear deal, Kerry says</title>
<date>24/7/2015</date>
<content>
Israel would be blamed by the international community if Congress succeeds in killing the nuclear deal reached with Iran, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned on Friday.Kerry made an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, during which he launched an impassioned defense of the agreement while warning of the consequences of a congressional rejection.




"What happens is if the United States Congress unilaterally walks away from this arrangement that we have reached, we go right back to square one where we were with no alternative," Kerry said. "Iran is enriching. We have no inspections. We have no ability to know what they're doing. We don't roll back their program. We're right back where we were and we are going to head to conflict.""I fear that what could happen is if Congress were to overturn it, our friends in Israel could actually wind up being more isolated and more blamed," the secretary said.Congress has opened a 60-day review of the deal considered crucial to its fate. And Iranian hardliners are trying to undermine the pact, which ally Israel calls a dire security threat.Earlier Friday, Kerry said that it would be a huge mistake if Israel decided to take unilateral military action against Iran over its nuclear program in the future.Kerry was asked in an NBC "Today" show interview if the nuclear deal reached last week between would make it more likely that Israel might attempt a military or cyber attack on Tehran."That'd be an enormous mistake, a huge mistake with grave consequences for Israel and for the region, and I don't think it's necessary," Kerry said.The remark drew a rebuke from Kulanu MK Michael Oren, who entered politics following a stint as Israel's ambassador to Washington.
"If American legislators reject the nuclear deal, they will do so exclusively on the basis of US interests," Oren said. "The threat of the secretary of state who, in the past, warned that Israel was in danger of becoming an apartheid state, cannot deter us from fulfilling our national duty to oppose this dangerous deal."

<title>Ya'alon denies Left's charges of 'separating Israelis and Palestinians on buses'</title>
<date>20/5/2015</date>
<content>
There is no separation of Palestinians and Israelis on the public transportation system in the West Bank, Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon said on Wednesday after he rescinded a controversial travel ban.“There is no separation between Jews and Arabs on the public transportation system in Judea and Samaria,” the defense minister said. “We did not hold a discussion on that. We didn’t make such a decision and we don’t plan on making such a decision.” 




He explained that he had ordered a pilot program to address security issues that related to the fact that there was no oversight system to ensure that Palestinians who work within the pre-1967 lines in Israel return home at the end of the day.The pilot program, he said, was limited to four crossings in Judea and Samaria.“Every well-run and responsible country, particularly those with sensitive security issues, check people as they enter and exit,” Ya’alon said.“That is all we were talking about. We weren’t talking about anything else,” he said.Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered Ya’alon to shelve a controversial pilot program – which in its execution – would have prevented Palestinian workers from traveling home on Israeli buses in the West Bank after working in the country’s center.“The proposals are unacceptable to the prime minister. He spoke to the defense minister this morning and it was decided to shelve the entire program,” a senior official in the PMO told The Jerusalem Post.Ya’alon had just taken a decision on Tuesday to begin the three month pilot program.The decision, which was widely publicized on Wednesday morning, appeared to have caught a number of people by surprise including Netanyahu and Deputy Defense Minister Eli Ben-Dahan (Bayit Yehudi).The latter had started a speech in defense of the program in the Knesset plenum, when MK Tamar Zandberg (Meretz) told him that it had been canceled.Earlier in the morning, Meretz Party head Zahava Gal-On attacked the pilot program stating: “This is what apartheid looks like. There is no other polite definition, that could fall more pleasantly on one’s ears.”But Samaria Regional Council head Gershon Mesika said it was a necessary measure to prevent a terror attack in Tel Aviv. “When the next terror attack occurs in Tel Aviv, the left will have only themselves to blame,” Mesika said.His council and its settler leaders had long urged the Defense Ministry to tackle the problem of Palestinian workers using Israeli buses in the West Bank to travel home at the end of the day.Under a system set in place two year ago, Palestinians with work permits who live in the West Bank but work in areas of the country within the pre-1967 lines, must use certain crossings in the security barrier, where bus lines do not exist.But West Bank Palestinians can head home through any crossing, a move which allows them to make use of Israeli public bus lines that travel to the settlements, but which have stops near their homes.Mesika has warned that such a system endangers travel on the buses. It also made it more difficult for the security services to deal with Palestinians – particularly those involved in terrorist activities – who had illegally entered areas of Israel over the pre-1967 lines.The pilot program would not have affected all Palestinians and was limited to four checkpoints in the center of the country.At present Palestinians who enter Israel through those passageways take Israeli buses homes, because they allow for easier travel routes.The technicalities of the program which would have kept Palestinians from using central West Bank Israeli bus lines and forced them to rely on Palestinian-only transportation.It had drawn sharp protests from Left-wing politicians and activists.Opposition leader Isaac Herzog, who heads the Zionist Union party, said, “the separation of Palestinians and Israelis from public bus lines is an unnecessary humiliation. It is also a stain on the face of the state of Israel and its citizens.”He added that at “this sensitive time it would be better to avoid steps which tarnish Israel’s name and reputation.”“It only adds fuel to the fire of hate against Israel in the world,” Herzog said. “This is yet another mistake by the prime minister who lent his hand to this unfortunate decision, which has no bearing on the country’s security.”

<title>Yisrael Beytenu campaign focuses on Arab loyalty</title>
<date>15/1/2015</date>

‘Ariel for Israel, Umm el-Fahm to Palestine’ is Yisrael Beytenu’s campaign slogan, Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman revealed at a press conference Thursday.Liberman said that, in debating what to emphasize in the party’s campaign, he came across a video of Muhammad Zoabi, an Israeli-Arab teen and cousin of MK Haneen Zoabi (Balad), who spoke out as a Zionist during Operation Protective Edge and went into hiding because of threats to his life.




“We talk about Jews in Europe who are afraid to wear a kippa or peyot [sidelocks]... What angered me is that a supporter of Israel had to run away with no protection and was made an anathema to his society,” Liberman said.The Yisrael Beytenu leader contrasted the younger Zoabi’s situation with MK Zoabi, who “said kidnapping the three boys [in Gush Etzion last summer] is legitimate resistance with her head high, defended by the law.“This norm has to change,” he declared.As such, Liberman said Israeli Arabs who are loyal can stay Israeli, but “there is no reason for [Haneen] Zoabi, [UALTa’al MK Ahmed] Tibi or the northern branch of the Islamic Movement to remain Israeli citizens” when a Palestinian state is formed.Liberman asserted that the current conflict is not between Israel and the Palestinians; rather, it is between Jews and Arabs. He listed several incidents of Arab violence against Jews before the State of Israel’s establishment, adding that no one talked about a Palestinian nation at the time.The foreign minister repeated his analysis that there are three layers of conflict – the Arab world, Palestinians and Israeli Arabs – saying he is most concerned about the third.“Yisrael Beytenu is the only party with a pragmatic approach from the Right, the nationalist camp, that will have a Jewish state in the maximum amount of land and [Jewish] people,” he said. “[Labor leader Isaac] Herzog proposed his ideas at Camp David with [thenprime minister Ehud] Barak [in 2000], and [Tzipi] Livni did at Annapolis [in 2007], and they failed. [Bayit Yehudi leader Naftali] Bennett’s plan will lead to either a binational state or apartheid.”A second campaign slogan presented at the press conference was “Tachles Liberman,” using a Yiddish word that roughly translates to “the bottom line.” It is reminiscent of the party’s past slogan: “Our word is our bond.”“We’re a consistent party. I don’t know how to zigzag. This is the party line with which we always identified,” Liberman said.Liberman also said he and the members of his party will no longer speak of the corruption investigation in which Deputy Minister Faina Kirschenbaum was implicated.“Ask us about it only after there is a conviction or exoneration from the court – we won’t accept one from the press,” he said, after repeating that he found the timing of publicizing the probe troublesome.As for the possibility of joining a left-wing government, Liberman said he did not commit to anyone and that he would decide based on the guidelines for the coalition.However, Liberman set conditions that would make it difficult to join either a right-wing or a left-wing coalition.First, Liberman said Yisrael Beytenu won’t join a coalition with Livni’s usual positions.Then he added: “I heard [that Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and Bennett promised the haredim that they would cancel parts of the haredi enlistment law and conversion reforms. We won’t be there.”Still, Liberman praised Labor’s newly elected slate, especially in that it left out two primary candidates who focused on fighting corruption, MK Moshe Mizrahi and former Barak adviser Eldad Yaniv, whom he called “a professional traitor.” This was proof that “even Labor doesn’t like snitches.”According to Liberman, a poll sponsored by Yisrael Beytenu showed it will get eight seats in the next Knesset, and his goal is 16.On Sunday, the party’s selection committee will finish putting together its list for the next Knesset and submit it to Liberman.On Monday, the central committee will vote on it.Liberman said there were 65 applicants to be Yisrael Beytenu MKs – “men, women, Druse, Muslims, Jews, mayors, kibbutzniks and professors – the whole spectrum of Israeli society.”“I usually accept the committee’s recommendations in full.Last time I made one change,” Liberman added, a reference to removing then-deputy foreign minister Danny Ayalon.MK Zoabi responded to Liberman’s campaign, saying: “Maybe I shouldn’t have been born at all or been as far away as possible, to make Liberman and every other racist happy.“What can I do, this is my homeland, unlike Liberman, whose homeland is Russia,” she said of the minister who was born in Moldova. “The difference is that he denies his homeland and I do not. I don’t have any conflicts between the place I was born and the place where I will continue living.”Zoabi posited that Liberman is blurring Israel’s true history in which its natives were exiled by immigrants and a majority became a minority.“This minority fights and will continue to fight stubbornly for its rights facing an ignorant racist like Liberman, the racist Center and the dormant, defeated, hypocritical Left,” she added.Meretz leader Zehava Gal-On said that “in Liberman’s transfer campaign [which] lashes out at Israel’s Arab citizens, the racist inciting Liberman jumped out, despite his attempts to be nicer and move to the Center in recent months.”Gal-On added that Liberman’s ideas send a message to Israeli Arabs that they are merchandise that can be sold.Givat Haviva, an NGO that works for Jewish-Arab coexistence, came out against Liberman’s campaign.“Liberman is drowning [politically], so he went for his last option – racism,” Givat Haviva director-general Yaniv Sagi said. “Liberman’s incitement encourages violence and hatred and undermines our coexistence.”Sagi added that if there was a vote on who should remain in Israel – Umm el-Fahm residents or Liberman, the latter could lose.Construction Minister Uri Ariel said at an event in Harish, which is near Umm el-Fahm: “There is no Palestine and no land in the Land of Israel will be given to anyone.
“We don’t have a partner, and everyone understands that. This whole land is ours. We are building it with God’s help and developing it for the good of all our citizens,” he added.

<title>Kerry told the simple truth</title>
<date>Thu Apr 10 01:28:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
One can only regret the American administration’s attempts, coated with praise for Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s government, to clarify and modify Secretary of State John Kerry’s statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday.
Describing the events leading to the collapse of the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, Kerry said Israel had not released prisoners as it had pledged to do as part of the agreement to resume the talks, and had then approved tenders for constructing 700 new settlement units in East Jerusalem (which followed other huge tenders for accelerated construction in the settlements).
Kerry refuted the spin issued by Netanyahu’s office — that the talks broke down because Mahmoud Abbas had signed applications to join Palestine to 15 UN treaties. Kerry said this move, which he described as “not helpful,” came in response to the Israeli violations of the agreement, not as an intention to sabotage the talks. So Kerry was right to blame Israel with blowing up the talks.
His words hewed to the simple truth. Throughout the negotiations, Prime Minister Netanyahu has been busy spreading fog around his intentions and inventing spin tactics aimed at avoiding any significant decision. Housing Minister Uri Ariel and Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon have done everything they could to sabotage the talks. Finance Minister Yair Lapid made do with lip service to the peace process, while Justice Minister Tzipi Livni served as a fig leaf trying to cover Israel’s insincerity.
So instead of automatically blaming the Palestinians for the negotiations’ failure, they should ask themselves what their own part was in the foot-dragging and obstructionism in the talks, and how they helped create he pretense that Israel and the Palestinians are two state entities with equal military and economic status.
The Israeli public deserves a government that is candid with it and admits clearly that it has no desire for a peace agreement, and that its main motivation is to continue developing the West Bank settlements. In other words, it wants to continue the occupation and separate the Palestinians from their lands.
Once the government admits that, Israelis will be able to choose which kind of state they want to live in and which vision of a state they want to vote for – that of a democratic state that respects the rule of law and human rights and sees international relations as a vital asset, or of a messianic, separatist state with features of an apartheid regime, in which a privileged Jewish population rules over millions of Palestinians.
These are Israel’s options. Any other portrayal of them is a false one.

<title>Apartheid in planning rights</title>
<date>Mon Apr 28 03:05:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The High Court of Justice is scheduled to hold a hearing Monday on the issue of planning rights in Area C of the West Bank, which is under full Israeli control and constitutes 60 percent of the territory. The petition, filed in 2011 by, among others, the village of Dirat-Rafa’aya in the southern Hebron Hills, Rabbis for Human Rights and the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions, asks the court to restore the planning committees that dealt with Palestinian development that were annulled in 1971 by the Israel Defense Forces and their authority transferred to what eventually became the Civil Administration, which is appointed by the military and consists solely of Jews.
The planning body’s affiliation and composition reflect the policy of discrimination and lack of representation suffered by the Palestinians in the regional planning system, which leads to their eviction so that settlements can be expanded. From the data supplied by Bimkom − Planners for Planning Rights, it emerges that the areas currently designated for Palestinian development total only 1 percent of Area C, while the settlement areas with master plans constitute 26 percent of Area C (as reported by Amira Hass on Sunday). The petitioners note that the land area the state allocates to Palestinian towns is significantly less than that allocated to settlements and limits Palestinian options for future development and expansion.
The result is that nearly all Palestinian construction in the area is considered “illegal” and subject to demolition. Between 2009 and 2013, 2,224 Palestinian structures were demolished for this reason.
Given these statistics it is hard to understand the state’s response to the petition, in which it argues that claims of discrimination are groundless. Not only is the planning inequitable in scope, it is carried out by separate planning bureaucracies; while the settlers enjoy a planning system sympathetic to them, the Palestinians face a military planning bureaucracy that is hostile. Even though in recent years, in response to the petition and under pressure from Europe, the Civil Administration has prepared 11 master plans for Palestinians and slowly approved a few local plans that were prepared, the discrimination is still built in to the system and results in planning apartheid.
The state’s argument that these issues have diplomatic ramifications and should be dealt with during the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, and not by the courts, is false and disingenuous. Not only is Israel doing its best to avoid negotiating with the Palestinians. Moreover, according to the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, it has actually stopped advancing what building plans there are, as punishment for the Palestinian Authority applying to join UN conventions.
But in any case, the rights of those living in occupied territory and who are considered “protected” by international law are not subject to negotiation, and cannot be undermined on any political or diplomatic pretext.
The military that controls an occupied area is obligated to preserve the law that existed in it before it was occupied and attend to the welfare of the local population. Israel’s discriminatory planning policy in the West Bank violates this obligation, and it behooves the court to halt it.

<title>Is this not apartheid?</title>
<date>Thu May 01 02:47:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Is Israel at risk of becoming an apartheid state, as John Kerry said on Friday, or not, as he said on Tuesday? Who knows? Given his feeble performance as U.S. secretary of state and his disgraceful apology, maybe it no longer matters what Kerry thinks or says. Given the aggressiveness of the Jewish lobby and the weakness of the Obama administration, which capitulates to every “pro-Israel” whim, Israel doesn’t need enemies with friends like these. Look what happened to its genuine friend, who was only trying to warn it from itself.
What a miserable secretary of state, up to his neck in denial. And how unfriendly to Israel he is to retract his frank, genuine and friendly warning merely for fear of the lobby. Now millions of ignorant Americans, viewers of Fox News and its ilk, know that Israel is in no risk of becoming an apartheid state. They believe the power of Hamas and the sophistication of Qassam rocket pose an existential danger to Israel .
But Kerry’s vacillations do not change the reality that shrieks from every wall. From every West Bank Palestinian village, from every reservoir and power grid that is for Jews only; apartheid screams from every demolished tent encampment and every verdict of the military court; from every nighttime arrest, every checkpoint, every eviction order and every settlement home. No, Israel is not an apartheid state, but for nearly 50 years an apartheid regime has ruled its occupied territories. Those who want to continue to live a lie, to repress and to deny are invited to visit Hebron. No honest, decent person could return without admitting the existence of apartheid. Those who fear that politically incorrect word have only to walk for a few minutes down Shuhada Street, with its segregated road and sidewalks, and their fear of using the forbidden word will vanish without a trace.
The history of the conflict is filled with forbidden words. Once upon a time, it was forbidden to say “Palestinians” was forbidden, after that came the prohibitions against saying “occupation,” “war crime,” “colonialism” or “binational state.” Now “apartheid” is prohibited.
The forbidden words paralyze debate. Did you let the word “apartheid” slip out? The truth is no longer important. But no political correctness or bowdlerization, however sanctimonious, can conceal reality forever. And the reality is an occupation regime of apartheid.
The naysayers can find countless differences between the apartheid of Pretoria and that of Jerusalem. Pretoria’s was openly racist and anchored in law; Jerusalem’s is denied and repressed, hidden beneath a heavy cloak of propaganda and messianic religious faith. But the result is the same. Some South Africans who lived under the system of segregation say that their apartheid was worse. I know South Africans who say that the version in the territories is worse. But neither group can find a significant difference at the root: When two nations share the same piece of land and one has full rights while the other has no rights, that is apartheid. If it looks like apartheid, walks like apartheid and quacks like apartheid, it’s apartheid.
Israel is an incipient apartheid state, just as Kerry I said on Friday. Kerry II, on Tuesday, merely tried to blur and hide the truth for fear of the lobby. But apartheid is in our future. If there won’t be two states, there will be only one. If there won’t be a democratic, egalitarian state, a state of all its citizens, then there will be an apartheid state. There is no other option. With its actions, Israel is saying a firm “no” to the two-state solution. With its fear of a non-Jewish state, Israel is saying no to a democratic, binational state. Where does that leave us? With an apartheid state. As Naomi Shemer said in her optimistic song “Mahar” (“Tomorrow”): If not today, then tomorrow, and if not tomorrow, then the day after.

<title>The truth, off the record</title>
<date>Thu May 01 03:25:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
At a G-20 conference in Cannes in November 2011, then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy termed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a “liar” and said he “can’t stand” the Israeli leader. U.S. President Barack Obama responded, “You’re tired of him; what about me? I have to deal with him every day.” These rare quotes, revealing truths that are usually kept from the public due to the rules of diplomacy and political correctness, came to light only because the two presidents didn’t realize that the microphones were still on.
Now, it is John Kerry’s turn. In contrast to Sarkozy and Obama, the U.S. secretary of state was caught revealing truths not about people, but about fundamental issues. During a meeting of the Trilateral Commission last week, Kerry was recorded as saying, “A two-state solution will be clearly underscored as the only real alternative. Because a unitary state winds up either being an apartheid state with second-class citizens—or it ends up being a state that destroys the capacity of Israel to be a Jewish state.” He also warned that a stalemate in the peace process could lead to renewed violence in the territories, while hinting that progress might be possible under a different government: If “there is a change of government or a change of heart, something will happen,” he said.
Kerry’s frank statements weren’t the sort that diplomatic ears are accustomed to hearing, and he was therefore subjected to a wave of political and personal attacks for having made them. He was even forced to publicly express regret for having used the word “apartheid,” saying, “If I could rewind the tape, I would have chosen a different word.”
It’s no accident that Kerry was forced to retract the term “apartheid” in particular. There’s good reason for the sensitivity over comparisons of Israel with apartheid-era South Africa: Aspects of apartheid already exist in Israel, and they are liable to expand if the two-state solution collapses. But instead of working to alter the country’s destructive direction, groups and individuals that call themselves “pro-Israel” are trying to obscure the grim reality by denying the “apartheid” label.
Kerry’s “off-the-record” remarks essentially described reality: Israel cannot remain a Jewish and democratic state without a two-state solution, a unitary state would be an apartheid state, a stalemate in the peace process is liable to lead to another intifada and a change in the composition of Israel’s government, and/or the person heading it, is liable to change the picture. The troubling snapshot of reality that Kerry presented must be altered by implementing a two-state solution. For unlike an audio recording, the tragedy that is gradually taking shape here won’t be possible to rewind or erase.

<title>Don’t redefine Jewish state</title>
<date>Sun May 04 00:21:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that he intends to advance a new basic law to guarantee Israel’s existence as the state of the Jewish people, after recognizing that there are those who “seek to undermine the historic, moral and legal justification for the existence of the State of Israel as the state of our people.” But Netanyahu is mistaken, and perhaps he is intentionally being misleading.
In Israel and outside it, no significant challenge has been made to its right to exist as the state of the Jewish people. There is a meaningful challenge to Israel’s operational policy — led by the prime minister — the implication of which is that the occupation, the settlement enterprise and the apartheid regime imposed on the Palestinian population are a foundation of Israel’s existence.
The passage of another nationalist law, the likes of which are passed in certain regimes, would be very damaging to Israel and would not have a positive impact on attitudes toward the state. Only eliminating the occupation would have that effect.
The real significance of the proposed law was explicated by one of its proponents, MK Yariv Levin (Likud), who claimed it would “return Israel to the Zionist path, after years of continual injury by the judicial system to the basic principles on which the state was founded.” In other words, the judicial system, which has in many instances prevented major damage to Israel in the international arena and acted as an upholder of civil rights in the absence of a constitution, is not, according to Levin, part of “the basic principles on which the state was founded.” Indeed, this bill lays the groundwork for discriminating between Israeli citizens and violating the civil rights of Arab citizens, and for annexing territory while violating the rights of its inhabitants — violations that the judicial system has so far succeeded in preventing, in instances where the injustice was intolerable.
Israel boasts of being the only democracy in the Middle East, and it does have many important components of democracy, on account of which it is considered part of the democratic world. But the occupation and the apartheid, antidemocratic regime that it creates have long since gone from being a constraint that was imposed on Israel to being a goal in itself. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that supporters of the occupation such as Levin seek to remove the democratic obstacles from their path. That is the true meaning of the proposed Basic Law on Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish people.
Israel was defined as a Jewish and democratic state in a Basic Law around 20 years ago. This definition reflects the realization of the Zionist program to establish a state for the Jews in a democratic framework that grants equal rights to all citizens, including those who are not Jewish, and gives equal weight to both descriptors. This definition does not need to be changed by the prime minister.

<title>United, the Palestinians have endorsed 1967 borders for peace. Will Israel?</title>
<date>Wed May 07 15:05:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
When Yasser Arafat, in the framework of the Oslo agreement,  accepted 22% of historic Palestine, many people including myself had reservations.
Why recognize the State of Israeli within the 1967 borders when Israel hadn’t yet recognized the state of Palestine or signaled a willingness to halt settlement construction and rapidly move toward a withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from the occupied territories? The risk, many people said, was that the Israelis would simply refuse to give up East Jerusalem and most of the West Bank. What would we do then? Arafat replied to such fears by assuring us that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, “the Israeli Charles de Gaulle” as he likened him, was his partner. The two of them, he and Rabin, would end the conflict that had lasted too long and destroyed too many lives. 
Of course, Arafat was aware of those Israelis who suspected him of using Oslo as a plot, and of planning to launch a final war against Israel from lands “given” to him by the Rabin government.
In the countless meetings I and other friends and advisers had with Arafat, never did he talk about any such conspiracy. His vision was for Gaza to be the “lungs” of our new state, a place with an international airport, a harbor, light industries, and new housing for our refugees. Citizens of Palestine would be able to jump in their cars or even board a train and travel along a highway or tracks to the West Bank. A unified people, willing to turn the page on the past, would make peace with Israel, a final, lasting and warm peace.
This seems like a distant utopian dream in today’s landscape of walls, hermetic closures, and a fractured Palestinian people. The plans for the sea port and the Gaza-West Bank road link are still filed away and ready to be implemented; there just seems no political way of doing so.
But the logic that was behind Arafat’s peace with Rabin is as sound today as it was in 1993. Israelis and Palestinians have no choice but to find a way to share the Holy Land, and this will happen only when our two nations are prepared once and for all to set to once side their maximalist claims. Israelis have to learn to live within their 78%, just as we must use our talents to transform our 22% into a unified and productive democracy.
For us Palestinians, the reconciliation agreement concluded between Fatah and Hamas in Gaza two weeks ago was a necessary condition for moving on from the past. The agreement brings our main political players to the same side, namely to the side of a historic agreement with Israel. The terms of agreement includes recognition of the 1967 borders. Hamas's political leaders, moreover, are willing to back the Arab peace initiative of 2002, which is the clearest sign I know that their readiness to sign off on the 1967 border is not a mere tactical move but reflects deeper strategic calculations.
The new technocratic government that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will form over the coming weeks will abide by all the terms of the Oslo Accords and the Middle East Quartet. It will be as well a government willing to use the Arab peace initiative as a framework for a negotiated peace agreement that, once signed, will offer the Israelis full diplomatic and commercial relations with fifty-seven Arab and Islamic states.
The real question is how the Netanyahu government will respond. Will it be strong and united enough to conclude what Arafat called the "peace of the brave"? Will it lower its walls and permit the Israeli people to get to know our aspirations, or will it keep in place its policies of separation that contribute to suspicion and fear? Will it open itself to our region, or will it continue the relentless expansion of settlements and population control that will lead to an apartheid regime?Munib al Masri is a co-founder and chairman of the Palestine Development and Investment Company (Padico), co-founder and honorary chairman of the Welfare Association, founder and chairman of Edgo Group, and chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce in Palestine. He is a trustee of Al-Quds University, trustee emeritus of the American University of Beirut, and support numerous schools and universities. He is dedicated to promoting social welfare, education and development in Palestine, and advancing the cause of peace.

<title>Education minister has a lot to learn</title>
<date>Fri Jun 13 01:11:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The nationalist word laundry never stops working. It seems that every minister feels obliged to practice collective brainwashing, aimed at removing the two-state solution as far as possible. After the usual “occupation stars” – Naftali Bennett, Uri Ariel, Moshe Ya’alon, Gideon Sa’ar – now it’s the turn of Education Minister Shay Piron.
Unlike the official extremists, who aren’t ashamed of their nationalist positions – and even enjoy ramping up the violent rhetoric occasionally for political purposes – Piron presents the “educational version” of occupation.
As befits an education minister, Piron isn’t interested in occupying any old territories that don’t belong to Israel. All he wants is to “connect different parts” of the people. He’s not interested in causing the Palestinians harm, but wants to create “a meeting of cultures of Jews from east and west.” He doesn’t want to do injustice to another, but yearns to return to “another discourse” – because he’s concerned over the “either-or” culture that “emphasizes the contradictions.” He doesn’t want to turn Israel into an apartheid state, of course, but believes that “only a complete culture, which has some of both, will lead to consolidating a rooted Jewish world.”
The trouble is that all these lovely words have one role – to prevent, as Piron says, “restricting the Greater Israel vision.” Because, he adds, “the Land of Israel without Hebron and Nablus, without Tel Aviv and Deganya, without Ofakim and Kiryat Shmona, is not whole.”
Of course he doesn’t “know a peace without withdrawals,” but the education minister – who is supposed to ensure that hundreds of thousands of students develop a democratic, egalitarian, humane awareness – believes his job obliges him “to educate, tour the country, occupy and study the land to its length and breadth.”
Piron said these things on Thursday in a speech at Ariel University, which symbolizes, by its very existence beyond the Green Line, the dangerous process of normalizing the occupation. Four days after his Yesh Atid leader, Yair Lapid, threatened to topple the government if it annexes settlements, the education minister proved how flimsy his party’s ideology is. His statements show what stuff a party that takes part in a radical rightist government, which acts regularly to sabotage a peace agreement, is made of.

<title>Boycott in the air</title>
<date>Sun Jun 29 04:29:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The winds of international boycott of the settlements are quickening, picking up. On Friday the Spanish and Italian governments warned citizens against conducting business with settlements in the Golan Heights, the West Bank or East Jerusalem, saying such activity could expose them to a number of legal and financial risks. France, Germany and Britain had previously issued similar warnings to their nationals.
The individual warnings by these five countries may soon become an all-European resolution. European Union institutions are considering the issue of a general warning on behalf of all 28 EU member states, and the statements by the five nations will presumably expedite these discussions. It was no coincidence that the EU envoy to Israel, Lars Faaborg-Anderson, said on Friday that the warnings indicate that EU member states “are losing their patience with concerns not being treated” by Israel.
For now, Europe is taking only small, measured steps. While the European Council last week took a firm stance last week in banning the import of goods from Crimea and the occupied city of Sevastopol, EU institutions have thus far made do with warnings only regarding the Israeli settlements. But the message is clear in the winds from Europe, and Israel cannot afford to ignore it. A European boycott of all economic activity originating would be a blow to the Israeli economy, nearly all of which is invested in the settlement enterprise, whether directly or indirectly.
The world is indeed beginning to lose its patience, as the EU envoy said. The status quo in the territories, which already has characteristics of an apartheid regime, is intolerable to the Europeans, who will not stand by indefinitely. After the last attempt to revive the peace talks, the collapse of which was largely due to Israel, friendly nations including Europe and the United States will be forced to take concrete measures against an intransigent Israel. In the 21st century, the world will not accept another 47 years of occupation, dispossession and widespread violation of the rights of an entire people.
The warning by these five states to their citizens should, therefore, become an even stronger warning to Israel’s government: If it does not hasten to take concrete steps toward ending the occupation, all Israelis will pay the price, and it could be high indeed.

<title>My plea to the people of Israel: Liberate yourselves by liberating Palestine</title>
<date>Thu Aug 14 21:56:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
The past weeks have witnessed unprecedented action by members of civil society across the world against the injustice of Israel’s disproportionately brutal response to the firing of missiles from Palestine.
If you add together all the people who gathered over the past weekend to demand justice in Israel and Palestine – in Cape Town, Washington, D.C., New York, New Delhi, London, Dublin and Sydney, and all the other cities – this was arguably the largest active outcry by citizens around a single cause ever in the history of the world.
A quarter of a century ago, I participated in some well-attended demonstrations against apartheid. I never imagined we’d see demonstrations of that size again, but last Saturday’s turnout in Cape Town was as big if not bigger. Participants included young and old, Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, agnostics, atheists, blacks, whites, reds and greens ... as one would expect from a vibrant, tolerant, multicultural nation.
I asked the crowd to chant with me: “We are opposed to the injustice of the illegal occupation of Palestine. We are opposed to the indiscriminate killing in Gaza. We are opposed to the indignity meted out to Palestinians at checkpoints and roadblocks. We are opposed to violence perpetrated by all parties. But we are not opposed to Jews.”
Earlier in the week, I called for the suspension of Israel from the International Union of Architects, which was meeting in South Africa.

I appealed to Israeli sisters and brothers present at the conference to actively disassociate themselves and their profession from the design and construction of infrastructure related to perpetuating injustice, including the separation barrier, the security terminals and checkpoints, and the settlements built on occupied Palestinian land.
“I implore you to take this message home: Please turn the tide against violence and hatred by joining the nonviolent movement for justice for all people of the region,” I said.
Over the past few weeks, more than 1.6 million people across the world have signed onto this movement by joining an Avaaz campaign calling on corporations profiting from the Israeli occupation and/or implicated in the abuse and repression of Palestinians to pull out. The campaign specifically targets Dutch pension fund ABP; Barclays Bank; security systems supplier G4S; French transport company Veolia; computer company Hewlett-Packard; and bulldozer supplier Caterpillar.
Last month, 17 EU governments urged their citizens to avoid doing business in or investing in illegal Israeli settlements.
We have also recently witnessed the withdrawal by Dutch pension fund PGGM of tens of millions of euros from Israeli banks; the divestment from G4S by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; and the U.S. Presbyterian Church divested an estimated $21 million from HP, Motorola Solutions and Caterpillar.
It is a movement that is gathering pace.
Violence begets violence and hatred, that only begets more violence and hatred.
We South Africans know about violence and hatred. We understand the pain of being the polecat of the world; when it seems nobody understands or is even willing to listen to our perspective. It is where we come from.
We also know the benefits that dialogue between our leaders eventually brought us; when organizations labeled “terrorist” were unbanned and their leaders, including Nelson Mandela, were released from imprisonment, banishment and exile.
We know that when our leaders began to speak to each other, the rationale for the violence that had wracked our society dissipated and disappeared. Acts of terrorism perpetrated after the talks began – such as attacks on a church and a pub – were almost universally condemned, and the party held responsible snubbed at the ballot box.
The exhilaration that followed our voting together for the first time was not the preserve of black South Africans alone. The real triumph of our peaceful settlement was that all felt included. And later, when we unveiled a constitution so tolerant, compassionate and inclusive that it would make God proud, we all felt liberated.
Of course, it helped that we had a cadre of extraordinary leaders.
But what ultimately forced these leaders together around the negotiating table was the cocktail of persuasive, nonviolent tools that had been developed to isolate South Africa, economically, academically, culturally and psychologically.
At a certain point – the tipping point – the then-government realized that the cost of attempting to preserve apartheid outweighed the benefits.
The withdrawal of trade with South Africa by multinational corporations with a conscience in the 1980s was ultimately one of the key levers that brought the apartheid state – bloodlessly – to its knees. Those corporations understood that by contributing to South Africa’s economy, they were contributing to the retention of an unjust status quo.
Those who continue to do business with Israel, who contribute to a sense of “normalcy” in Israeli society, are doing the people of Israel and Palestine a disservice. They are contributing to the perpetuation of a profoundly unjust status quo.
Those who contribute to Israel’s temporary isolation are saying that Israelis and Palestinians are equally entitled to dignity and peace.
Ultimately, events in Gaza over the past month or so are going to test who believes in the worth of human beings.
It is becoming more and more clear that politicians and diplomats are failing to come up with answers, and that responsibility for brokering a sustainable solution to the crisis in the Holy Land rests with civil society and the people of Israel and Palestine themselves.
Besides the recent devastation of Gaza, decent human beings everywhere – including many in Israel – are profoundly disturbed by the daily violations of human dignity and freedom of movement Palestinians are subjected to at checkpoints and roadblocks. And Israel’s policies of illegal occupation and the construction of buffer-zone settlements on occupied land compound the difficulty of achieving an agreementsettlement in the future that is acceptable for all.
The State of Israel is behaving as if there is no tomorrow. Its people will not live the peaceful and secure lives they crave – and are entitled to – as long as their leaders perpetuate conditions that sustain the conflict.
I have condemned those in Palestine responsible for firing missiles and rockets at Israel. They are fanning the flames of hatred. I am opposed to all manifestations of violence.
But we must be very clear that the people of Palestine have every right to struggle for their dignity and freedom. It is a struggle that has the support of many around the world.
No human-made problems are intractable when humans put their heads together with the earnest desire to overcome them. No peace is impossible when people are determined to achieve it.
Peace requires the people of Israel and Palestine to recognize the human being in themselves and each other; to understand their interdependence.
Missiles, bombs and crude invective are not part of the solution. There is no military solution.
The solution is more likely to come from that nonviolent toolbox we developed in South Africa in the 1980s, to persuade the government of the necessity of altering its policies.
The reason these tools – boycott, sanctions and divestment – ultimately proved effective was because they had a critical mass of support, both inside and outside the country. The kind of support we have witnessed across the world in recent weeks, in respect of Palestine.
My plea to the people of Israel is to see beyond the moment, to see beyond the anger at feeling perpetually under siege, to see a world in which Israel and Palestine can coexist – a world in which mutual dignity and respect reign.
It requires a mind-set shift. A mind-set shift that recognizes that attempting to perpetuate the current status quo is to damn future generations to violence and insecurity. A mind-set shift that stops regarding legitimate criticism of a state’s policies as an attack on Judaism. A mind-set shift that begins at home and ripples out across communities and nations and regions – to the Diaspora scattered across the world we share. The only world we share.
People united in pursuit of a righteous cause are unstoppable. God does not interfere in the affairs of people, hoping we will grow and learn through resolving our difficulties and differences ourselves. But God is not asleep. The Jewish scriptures tell us that God is biased on the side of the weak, the dispossessed, the widow, the orphan, the alien who set slaves free on an exodus to a Promised Land. It was the prophet Amos who said we should let righteousness flow like a river.
Goodness prevails in the end. The pursuit of freedom for the people of Palestine from humiliation and persecution by the policies of Israel is a righteous cause. It is a cause that the people of Israel should support.
Nelson Mandela famously said that South Africans would not feel free until Palestinians were free.
He might have added that the liberation of Palestine will liberate Israel, too.

<title>Path cleared to treat asylum seekers humanely</title>
<date>Wed Sep 24 06:00:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
What can’t be achieved by force can be achieved by more force, believes outgoing Interior Minister Gideon Sa’ar, who wants to amend the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Freedom and curb the High Court of Justice’s authority.
On Monday, the High Court ordered the state to close the Holot detention facility for asylum seekers within 90 days. It also overturned a provision that allowed asylum seekers who entered Israel illegally to be incarcerated without trial for up to a year.
Sa’ar says the responsibility to protect the state’s borders is the government’s, not the court’s. If the High Court’s ruling is implemented, he argues, Israel will no longer be a Jewish and democratic state. But we haven’t heard Sa’ar voice concerns about the threat to the Jewish and democratic state stemming from the settlements and the dispossession and apartheid derived from them – in the absence of an eastern border, which Israel refuses to set.
It’s hard to believe that even after the High Court’s decision, Sa’ar can say the amendment to the Prevention of Infiltration Law “made a considerable contribution to the voluntary departure process.” The High Court described the law’s harsh impact on the asylum seekers’ lives. The only refuge the state left them was “voluntary” return to the countries where their lives were in danger. Clearly there was no free will in the process.
In the court’s ruling, Justice Edna Arbel was right when she said the amendment was merely a rehash of an earlier amendment that the court had annulled a year ago.
The prime minister, interior minister and attorney general must now do some soul-searching after thinking they could cheat the High Court and enact a law identical to one that had been annulled. They blatantly violated the asylum seekers’ rights and caused an injustice whose full scope will only be clear in the future. The attorney general is particularly responsible because he did not prevent the cabinet from this failure and disgrace.
Sa’ar’s new ideas must be rejected. The Basic Law on Human Dignity and Freedom is a vital component of Israel’s essence as a democracy, which places the individual at its center. A change to the law must not even be considered – and certainly not an amendment to the Prevention of Infiltration Law that deviates from the spirit and clear wording of the High Court’s rulings.
Israel must grant the asylum seekers the freedom and ability to run their lives. The burden on south Tel Aviv’s residents will ease if the refugees are allowed to take part in the labor market and gradually resume a normal life.
Sa’ar, with the prime minister’s backing, led Israel on an illegal and immoral path. His decision to resign from politics must therefore be seen as a positive development. It lets the prime minister consider a new way to take care of the asylum seekers.

<title>Israel’s moment of choice</title>
<date>Fri Sep 26 19:28:00 IDT 2014</date>
<content>
When the Palestinian consensus government was sworn in on 2 June 2014, ending seven years of Palestinian political and institutional division, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately rejected it, telling Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in a public statement that he must choose between peace and Hamas.
In the wake of Israel’s brutal war on Gaza, however, even Netanyahu’s right-wing government now understands that a unified Palestinian government is in everyone’s interest, including Israel’s. The real choice today is not between peace and Hamas but between occupation and freedom. The time has come for Israel to choose between a deteriorating status quo that promises only continued confrontations and further isolation for Israel or a path toward genuine peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike by ending Israel’s military occupation once and for all.
Unlike Netanyahu’s coalition, which includes ministers explicitly opposed to the creation of two states, the Palestinian government was formed on a peace agenda: recognizing Israel on the pre-1967 borders, renouncing violence, adhering both to international law and previous agreements signed with Israel. Bringing Hamas and other Palestinian factions together on such terms was the Palestinian gift to the prospects of real peace, and the only solution to ending the division that has plagued the Palestinian people.
For Netanyahu, 'peace' means returning to the status quo ante: Gaza besieged and severed from the West Bank as the latter continues to be colonized under a smokescreen called the 'peace process.'
A unified Palestinian government administering both Gaza and the West Bank as one integral territory is not an option but a national obligation and an international demand. While such a government was imperative for addressing Gaza’s accumulated problems and sheer human suffering before the war as a result of Israel’s criminal siege, it has become the only life line for both Gaza and the West Bank after Israel’s military onslaught on both areas this summer. No other entity has the domestic and international legitimacy to help end the siege on Gaza, provide relief and reconstruction for the 1.8 million Palestinians while reintegrating Gaza with the West Bank, and address the legitimate security requirements of Palestinians.
Israel’s latest war on Gaza was not the first but it must be the last. Under no circumstances can such senseless mass murder and destruction – which has seen the lives of 2,200 people, mostly civilians, including more than 550 children, taken away, with more than 10,000 injured, and almost quarter of Gaza buildings and infrastructure obliterated – be permitted again. This calamity left most Palestinians, and with us the majority of world opinion, with one conviction: never again.
The Palestine National Movement embodied in the PLO made its choice on behalf of the Palestinian people on 15 November 1988. The Palestine National Council voted overwhelmingly for a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, ipso facto recognizing Israel on the pre-1967 lines. Five years later, the PLO formalized this recognition as part of the Oslo agreements. Despite the lack of reciprocal recognition from Israel and its vagueness and open-ended provisions, many Palestinians supported Oslo, hoping that it meant Israel too had reached its moment of truth and choice: ending its occupation of the land occupied in 1967 and addressing Palestinians’ legitimate historic rights, including the right of return.Alas, we were wrong. In hindsight, successive Israeli governments have instead used the 'peace process' for the exact opposite purpose: to avert and delay that moment of choice. Neither in 1993 nor today Israel is ready to answer the one basic question: where it wants its final border to be? Instead negotiations have been used by Israel as a conflict management tool and a smoke screen for the ongoing colonization of East Jerusalem and the West Bank. In short, the 'peace process' has been used by Israel to delay and prevent the outcome of a Palestinian state.
The recent and biggest land grab in years, confiscating 4,000 dunams (about 1,000 acres) south of Bethlehem, the very heart of where the Palestinian state is supposed to be established, is another confirmation that the current Israeli government’s master map has nothing to do with the 1967 lines. Rather, facts on the ground follow the map of the 'Greater Israel project.' That is, Israel is the only state, controls the whole of Palestine, and is unilaterally partitioning the occupied territories by a complex system of military rule, annexation (colonization), exclusion (ethnic cleansing) and separation (siege and apartheid), keeping Palestinians disconnected, atomized, and unable to function as one political and economic unit.
Twenty one years of a failed 'peace process’ are enough to conclude that the bilateral route to ending occupation is working - but in the wrong direction. We must try something else. Israel must be denied access to its 'we are talking' comfort zone, and the Palestinians must exit the state of limbo we have been in since Oslo.
Today we are saying this is Israel’s moment of choice. Either Netanyahu must declare that the status quo is a military occupation of the territory occupied in 1967, in which case after 47 years it must come to an end. Or he must declare that the status quo is not an occupation and that Israel intends to continue taking effective control of the entire territory of historic Palestine and denying basic individual and collective rights to Palestinians living inside and in exile. Netanyahu’s habit of giving lip service to the first, while following the second, can no longer continue.
Israel can’t have it both ways: land without people, control without responsibility. This has gone on for far too long. Either Israel takes full responsibility or it gives up control of the lives and territory of millions of Palestinians.
President Abbas demanded a firm expiry date for occupation. No more business as usual. Repeating that the status quo in Palestine is unsustainable must not be just a statement, but our and the international community’s goal. On 15 November this year, the Palestinian people will celebrate the 26th anniversary of our Declaration of Independence, reaffirming the collective choice we made in 1988. By next year, we either celebrate our real and full independence or we will have redefined the status quo and with it our national goals and ways to achieve them.

 Peace cannot be privatized
	While Guy Rolnik’s article (“To keep the best, let’s be the best,” TheMarker, October 10), is comprehensive and well written, all the quotes at the beginning to describe those leaving Israel are exactly the same as those used against the people who left their kibbutzim 40 years ago. As then, so now, some will be very successful, some will be happy with their move without becoming tycoons, and some will eventually return.
	Secondly, I reject entirely Rolnik’s assumption that achieving peace in the Middle East is not dependent on our government truly accepting the two-state solution, and negotiating to achieve that end. The status quo, to which Netanyahu and the messianic right wing are loyal, is catastrophic. For Israelis as well as Palestinians. The continued, meteoric growth of the defense budget is destroying education, health and social services. Continued settlement in what is considered by all the world as Palestinian territory, followed by recurring wars, is leading to an increase in anti-Israel and anti-Semitic action. BDS is growing slowly but steadily. (As it did against apartheid South Africa, which eventually collapsed.)
	The economic boom in Israel/Palestine after a peace agreement could be enormous. Tourism, investment by the European Union, America and other countries could be expected. All it needs is for our PM to stop terrifying Israelis with his horror stories of terrorism and nuclear destruction.

 The receipt as an art form
	The art forms described by David Sperber in his review of the catalog for the “Local Judaica” exhibit at the Eretz Israel Museum (“When art and Zionism converged to give Jewish holidays a new meaning,” English Haaretz Online, October 11) have personal meaning for me. Pieces created in the first two decades of the 20th century here, especially by a company called Moinster, took on a second life as giant kabalot (receipts) for donations made to institutions in Eretz Israel.
	Since my grandfather, Rabbi Tuvia Geffen (1910-70) of Atlanta, Georgia, was a fervent giver of charity, constantly collecting and forwarding contributions of $1, $3.50 or a little more to orphanages, little yeshivas and hospitals in this country, he saved kabalot received in his first decade in the American South by framing them and then hanging them on the walls in his study.
	In my family’s case, I was the only one of 18 grandchildren living in Atlanta. My cousins visited every summer from cities in the eastern and Midwest USA. We had great fun being invited into zadie’s study – looking at the well-used, large folios of Shas, Mishneh Torah, Shulchan Aruch and many other works.
	What was most interesting for American born and bred Jewish children like ourselves were these kabalot on the walls. They offered us our childhood views of this land, the wonderful images which Sperber talks about, in particular the romantic presentation of Orthodox Jewish life here.  Dr. David Geffen	Jerusalem

<title>Welcome aboard Israel's apartheid bus</title>
<date>Mon Oct 27 14:40:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon has instructed that Palestinian laborers be prohibited from using Israeli public transportation to travel between their homes in the West Bank and work in Israel. According to the report by Chaim Levinson in Haaretz on Sunday, Palestinian laborers will not be allowed to board buses traveling directly between central Israel and the West Bank at the end of their work day.
	The minister’s decision comes despite the fact that the Israel Defense Forces see no security risk in Palestinians traveling on Israeli buses, because the only ones to do so are those with entry and work permits who undergo careful security checks when they enter Israel. Thus, Ya’alon’s decision is purely a result of his having given in to the longtime pressure exerted on him by settlers demanding that Palestinians not be allowed to board “their” buses.
	The minister’s decision reeks of apartheid, typical of the Israeli occupation regime in the territories. One of the most blatant symbols of the regime of racial separation in South Africa was the separate bus lines for whites and blacks. Now, Ya’alon has implemented the same policy in the occupied territories. In so doing, he justifies the claims of those who brand Israel internationally as an apartheid state.
	Ya’alon’s decision also means a heavier burden on the Palestinians in the West Bank. Few among them are allowed to work in Israel, and those who are allowed to work in Israel face an exhausting, humiliating and painful experience on their way to and from work. Now, Ya’alon is making it even harder on them.
	The defense minister made it his goal a long time ago to satisfy the settlers; to dance to their tune and make almost all their wishes and demands come true. He does this out of cynical personal and political considerations - to reinforce his status as a leader of the extreme right. The saga of his murky relations with the American administration following his disparaging remarks about Secretary of State John Kerry and other senior officials shows how much Ya’alon longs for the settlers’ embrace.
	This time, Ya’alon is kowtowing to the settlers at the expense of the image of the State of Israel internationally and its remaining shreds of morality. And all by abusing a few tens of thousands of Palestinians permitted to make a paltry living in Israel.
	Ya’alon’s has instructed the Civil Administration to prepare for the implementation of his decision until it can be done in practice. It would be better for him to annul it immediately and remove this shame from Israel.

<title>American Jews: Challenge Israel’s segregated bus lines</title>
<date>Tue Nov 04 21:29:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	The American Jewish community has a proud and celebrated history of activism in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ‘60s. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel famously marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma, saying afterwards, “I felt my feet were praying.”
	Young Jews comprised a large number of Freedom Summer activists fighting against racism and segregation in the South; some like Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner even gave their lives in the pursuit of racial equality. Even the threat of personal harm did not stop American Jews from acting on their values.
	Jewish communal organizations often remind us that we have a proud, historical commitment to civil rights. By recounting our history of civil rights activism and our strong values of equality and justice, our communal leaders and organizations hope to inspire those same values in our generation. As J Street U leaders, we see our obligation to pursue social justice and civil rights side-by-side with our commitment to a just and secure future for the State of Israel. That work becomes far more challenging when the Israeli government undermines its own democratic precepts and runs counter to the values of the American Jewish community.
	This week, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon announced a plan  which would require Palestinians who work in Israel during the day to return home to the West Bank through a separate checkpoint than Israelis with the same commute. This will effectively segregate buses in the West Bank; keeping Palestinians off of buses used by Jewish settlers. And while Ya’alon cited “security concerns” as his rationale, the decision contradicts the IDF, which maintains that shared buses do not pose a threat to Israelis. Israel’s Justice Minister, Tzipi Livni, has said that if the policy is carried out, it will mean nothing less than “apartheid.”
	By imposing the ban, Ya'alon, who once threatened to address the "Palestinian cancer" with "chemotherapy" – lines up with MK Moti Yogev, a settler himself, who recently said, “riding these buses is unreasonable. They are full of Arabs.” A settler group in Ariel also recently released a video and staged a protest demanding the racial segregation of buses. The video depicts a lone Jewish woman exiting a bus filled with Palestinian workers, and is captioned, “it's not about racism, it's about a simple question – would you be willing to go on a bus [packed with Arabs]?”
	The idea of segregated buses should send chills down the spine of anyone who has ever witnessed or learned about apartheid South Africa’s separate bus system for whites and blacks, or the segregated Jim Crow-era American south. But sadly, this is just the latest in a long series of discriminatory acts and policies that define Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. It also marks the disturbing rise of influence of the settler movement in Israeli politics – and the government’s willingness to kowtow to their demands.
	Since the busing decision was announced, only two major Jewish organizations – J Street and the Union for Reform Judaism – have spoken out publicly against bus segregation. We note positively that the Anti-Defamation League have also said that they will look into the matter, though they have not yet made a public statement.
	If they are truly committed to both civil rights and Israel’s future, Jewish organizations cannot stay silent. The occupation is nightmarish for Palestinians; it also guarantees that Israelis cannot live with true security, stability, or international respect. That is the simple truth, and it isn’t changing. Segregated busing in the West Bank should serve as a wake up call that Israel’s future has been hijacked by a racist settler movement that cares only for its own continued presence in the West Bank. We must recognize that these segregationist policies are morally repugnant and destroy Israel’s image in the international arena, even among its usual friends.
	When American Jewish leaders actually act on their values, it is a potent and invaluable antidote to discrimination within Israel, and all over the world. We saw this last year when the ADL lauded Israeli government efforts to address the scourge of gender-segregated buses. Groups like the American Jewish Committee have a long history of involvement in the civil rights movement in America and in challenging civil rights abuses across the globe. That makes their current silence even more deafening.
	An urgent letter from the youth arm of the Israeli Labor party has called on the leaders of some of the most prominent institutions of the American Jewish community – the Conference of Presidents, the Jewish Federations of North America, AIPAC, and others – to speak out against segregation in Israel. This call must not go unheeded.
	Segregation was wrong in Birmingham, Alabama, and it is wrong in the West Bank. Denying Palestinians civil rights and self-determination is wrong. The occupation, which began while Dr. King and Rabbi Heschel were alive, is also wrong. We must continue the Jewish communal legacy of fighting for civil rights – even when it means addressing unjust Israeli policies. J Street U is committed to seeing a reversal of this policy and will hold our communal organizations accountable to push for the same.

<title>Israelis must demand: Equality now</title>
<date>Fri Nov 21 05:45:00 IST 2014</date>
<content>
	Ashkelon Mayor Itamar Shimoni on Wednesday issued an order barring Arab workers from building projects in three preschools, in the wake of Tuesday’s fatal terror attack in a Jerusalem synagogue.
	Shimoni has done nothing new: Arab workers for public organizations suffered harassment and dismissal threats during Operation Protective Edge as well. But his blatant racism evoked a wave of political denunciations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “There is no place for discrimination against Arab Israelis.” Economy Minister Naftali Bennett checked and found that “99.9 percent of the Arabs are loyal to the state.”
	Netanyahu and Bennett’s condemnations set new records for hypocrisy. Shimoni merely translated into deed the spirit of the rightist leaders in Jerusalem. On Sunday, Netanyahu will present the latest version of the so-called nation-state law to his cabinet. The bill establishes the state’s commitment to the Jewish people’s “right to national self-determination in Israel,” to Jews in distress overseas, to Jewish holidays, to the Jewish calendar, to Jewish law and to the cultural and historical heritage of the Jewish people. As to the entirety of Israel’s citizens, the draft law promises them only “personal rights in accordance with every law.”
	Netanyahu pasted into the bill a portion of Israel’s Declaration of Independence, but deleted that document’s explicit promise of equal rights.
	The nation-state bill ignores the existence of an Arab community in Israel, with its own language, culture and rights, placing the state’s Arab citizens in a position that is inferior status to that of its Jews, who are also given collective rights. Instead of moving to end discrimination, Netanyahu means to give it the strength of a Basic Law.
	Netanyahu’s conduct is not surprising. He has ignored the Arab community throughout his term as prime minister, and his coalition acts tirelessly to “Judaize” the state.
	The conduct of Labor and Meretz in this matter is disappointing. Instead of challenging the government by proposing an alternative model of civil and communal equality, they settle for feeble statements to the media.
	The time has come to establish a broad, resounding social movement of Jews and Arabs that will call for “equality now” in order to counter the racism on the right and the political enervation on the left. We must not let Netanyahu obliterate the Declaration of Independence. Otherwise Shimoni won’t be the last to practice apartheid in a public institution.

<title>Abbas must unilaterally declare Palestinian state</title>
<date>Fri Nov 13 01:45:09 IST 2009</date>
<content>
It is precisely now that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas must not give up hope, and not because of the sweet nothings that Shimon Peres uttered at the rally in the square last Saturday night about people giving up hope in Ramallah. As if at the President's Residence every day is Carnaval, and not only when he's packing his bags for his trip to Brazil.  
Abbas was right when he decided to announce he would soon resign: It is impossible to hold negotiations "without prior conditions" while settlement is going on. For 42 years Israel has been scattering prior conditions and faits accomplis all over, marking them with red tile roofs and making the peace process into nothing more than a never-ending process.  
But before Abu Mazen quits, he has just one more job to do: He must declare, unilaterally, the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Palestine now.  
Both sides have a right to act unilaterally. Abbas owes it to his people, to himself, and to us. This week, there were reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finds this possibility very scary, and he expects the Americans to nip it in the bud. But his nightmare is our only chance for an end to the occupation in our time.  
When he declares independence, Abbas should call upon the Jews living in the state of Palestine to preserve the peace and to do their part in building up the new country as full and equal citizens, enjoying fair representation in all of its institutions. David Ben-Gurion would not have been upset by such a pretty act of plagiarism from his Declaration of Independence.  
And thus, Abbas will become the Palestinian Ben-Gurion. Conditions were no less foggy and circumstances were no more certain when Ben-Gurion declared independence in 1948. But our founding father took the risk, and we are fortunate that he did.  
The risk Abbas would be taking is much smaller. Of the 192 member states of the United Nations, over 150 would recognize a free Palestine, and it would soon become the 193rd. Although the American position is an unknown, it is hard to believe that Barack Obama would agree to drag America back into isolation now that it has begun to be part of the world again.  
And what would Netanyahu do? Invade and re-conquer the West Bank? Restore the military government in the Muqata in Ramallah?  
And what orders will Ehud Barak give his army? Serbia didn't dare invade Kosovo after it declared independence, and even Russia the great didn't allow itself to remain inside the sovereign territory of Georgia after their war.  
Immediately after the declaration, celebrations will begin in the capital, East Jerusalem, and people from all over the world will join in, including Israelis. The masses of the House of Ishmael will carouse joyously through the city's neighborhoods, and especially those neighborhoods from which they have been evicted by people with priestly pretensions. This will have to be joy without any manifestations of violence, not even one stone thrown.  
This week, I phoned Abbas, after not having spoken to him for at least four years. I told him everything that I am writing now. I also told him something else: What happened to the wall in Berlin 20 years ago, and to apartheid a few months later, would also happen to the occupation: It will collapse, even if attempts are made to reinforce it with nails.

<title>A modest proposal </title>
<date>Thu Sep 03 01:23:11 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Like the president of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Prof. Rivka Carmi, I too believe the demand that Dr. Neve Gordon resign as head of the university's Department of Politics and Government is a legitimate and even modest demand, given the financial damage the university will sustain if he fails to do so. Accordingly, it is up to Gordon, who desires what is best for his institution, to comply with the demand forthwith.  
Carmi's appeal to her faculty colleagues reveals that the economic crisis has dealt the university a severe blow: Donations are dwindling, and its financial situation has never been this bad. Gordon's call for a boycott of Israel, as published in his op-ed piece in the Los Angeles Times - a newspaper with a wide circulation, "particularly among Jews," - could, in Carmi's words, cause devastating harm: "Without these donations, we have no life, and certainly no development and progress," she wrote. What is being demanded of Gordon is therefore a modest sacrifice, a small bone to be tossed to the donors.  
Thus the many faculty members from all of the universities in this country who have urged Carmi "to declare that she regrets her initial reaction and that she encourages political activity by lecturers from all shades of the political spectrum," will presumably reconsider their position in view of the high price, in hard cash, that freedom of expression exacts.  
By her own account, Carmi has received an unprecedented flow of angry e-mails and phone calls from Jewish donors in Israel and abroad. There can be no doubt that faculty members understand the significance of this.  
It is also reasonable to assume that the faculty members who elected Gordon to his post, and who want him to remain there, will understand the motive behind the demand that he resign, even though thousands of messages of support for Gordon have also reached Carmi - an indication of the tremendous harm her response is causing the university.  
For example, Prof. David Ingleby, who is involved in the European Union's research initiatives, has written Carmi that Israel's preferential status in these projects could be harmed because of the contempt BGU is showing for academia's traditional commitment to democratic traditions.  
And Prof. Virginia H. Aksan, president of the Middle Eastern Studies Association of North America, which has a membership of over 3,000 scholars, has demanded that Carmi withdraw the threat to Gordon's position and protect freedom of expression.  
But one can understand Carmi. There is not as much money behind the above arguments as there is behind the donors' demands. Also sure to understand are those students who have written Carmi that "we are taught history, but we are forbidden to learn from it. In gender studies, we are taught to identify violent discourse, but we are expected to go on speaking the routine and familiar militaristic language. We are taught to be social workers, but not to identify with exploited cleaning workers. Learning is allowed, but not drawing practical conclusions - especially not in a newspaper, in English, with a large circulation."  
These students will certainly ultimately realize that the existence of research universities in Israel depends on those who have money to give them, and thereby also the ability to dictate the subjects of research and the limits of freedom of thought and expression.  
Students, you are our future, and I have a modest proposal for you: Stay in the ivory tower. Try not to see reality as it is. And certainly do not describe it with pejorative words like "apartheid" or try to change it. Try to understand, in practical terms, what is worth studying and what you are better off not publishing, since your future depends mainly on the degree of flexibility you can display and on your ability to toe the line. Above all, you must remember that to adapt is to survive. See the Carmi case.  
The writer is a professor at Tel Aviv University.

<title>  Bibi needs Tzipi </title>
<date>Wed Jul 01 02:07:20 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
The dispute with the United States over the settlement freeze is a futile controversy serving only one purpose: to bolster the status of the administration of President Barack Obama as an honest broker in the eyes of the Palestinians and the Arab states, in contrast to that of his predecessor, which was seen in Ramallah, Cairo and Riyadh as serving Israel. Obama wants to show that he can bend Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. That is not necessarily bad for Netanyahu. Every minute spent on unnecessary discussions on the future of unfinished buildings and empty apartments in the settlements defers the tough decisions that he still must face, and it leaves his coalition stable.  
In fact, even if construction in the settlements is frozen forever and not a single dog kennel or sheet of drywall is put up, the reality of the peace process will not change. Peace will not break out. Israel will not free itself of the occupation and its opponents around the world will continue to accuse it of apartheid and oppression of the Palestinians. There is a limit to what can be received in compensation for what one is not doing.  
The real debate will come in the next phase, when Obama presents his Middle East peace plan, or when Netanyahu surprises him with an end run and an initiative of his own, thereby avoiding an imposed agreement. Proposing their own plans is what Menahem Begin did in connection with the peace process with Egypt and what Ariel Sharon did with the Gaza disengagement. They preferred to pay a smaller price up front, but they controlled developments in the peace process and were not asked to make even greater concessions.  
Until now Netanyahu preferred to be seen as giving into Obama's pressure and compromising on Likud principles for the sake of relations with America. If he maintains this passive approach he will be faced with a demand for a complete withdrawal from the territories, which he will find difficult. His responsiveness to Obama on the issue of a Palestinian state shows that Netanyahu is not Yitzhak Shamir. He doesn't have the emotional strength to go head to head with the Americans, nor does he have the same ideological commitment to the Greater Land of Israel.  
Even if Netanyahu doesn't believe in peace and compromise with the Arabs, he wants Israel to be accepted in the international community and understands the importance of relations with the United States. For better or worse he is nearing a decision like those made by Begin and Sharon.  
Netanyahu might think he would do well to propose evacuating isolated settlements, to return settlers from the West Bank without withdrawing the army or to conduct expedited negotiations with Syria (as he attempted in 1998 to avoid U.S. pressure for an additional West Bank withdrawal). And maybe he will come up with something original and interesting that no one has thought of.  
The common denominator of all these ideas is that they cannot be implemented with Netanyahu's current coalition. To go beyond talk of a settlement freeze to a real peace process, Netanyahu will need Kadima's Tzipi Livni by his side. Shas, Yisrael Beiteinu and Habayit Hayehudi will not allow him to cede even a millimeter. Kadima constitutes his strategic reserves, and without it he will be doomed to wander the world like a leper, absorbing public blows from Obama and the Europeans and concluding yet another term without leaving a legacy.  
That's why Netanyahu must keep Kadima strong in the opposition. Without the party he will become a pawn in the hands of Yisrael Beiteinu's Avigdor Lieberman and Shas' Eli Yishai. Only the prospect of an alternative to the current coalition will allow him to continue moving forward.  
In attempting to fracture Kadima through the "Mofaz bill," which would enable seven or more Knesset members to form their own party, Netanyahu is acting against his own interests. If he adds a few more MKs to Likud he would only be buying himself more "rebels," who would act against every initiative and move in the peace process. Anyone returning to Likud from Kadima would have to demonstrate allegiance to the party's old values and take right-wing positions. One can understand the temptation to destroy the rival party, but if Kadima splits apart Netanyahu will be trapped in a coalition with his "natural partners" from the far right and be faced with a bitter, ongoing confrontation with Washington.  
Netanyahu must preserve his strategic reserves instead of looking for token gains. In his previous term as prime minister he fell from power because he stuck with the extreme right and didn't cultivate an alternative coalition, and then the right abandoned him over the Wye River accord. It would be a shame if that happened to him again after working so hard to get back into office.

<title> Bibi should shoot for the net</title>
<date>Sun Apr 26 01:08:28 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
No word in Hebrew appeals more to Benjamin Netanyahu than "block." He uses it in every conversation or speech, let alone in interviews. He works it into his speech and uses it to underline his achievements. That word is the essence of his worldview, a view that favors dribbling the ball away from the goal rather than kicking it into the net.  
Faithful to this, he boasts how he used to block slander from Arab countries as ambassador to the United Nations. How he blocked the dangers of Oslo during his first stint as prime minister and how he blocked the Histadrut labor federation's attempts to prevent structural reforms when he served as finance minister. But what Israel needs today is a striker, a real scoring machine, not a goalie. Israel needs a Barack Obama, not a Yitzhak Shamir.  
Netanyahu has been telling us for three years that he has an orderly work plan, that if we just let him take over again, he'll block the dangers that Ariel Sharon, Ehud Olmert and Tzipi Livni bequeathed on us.  
He has promised that he offers more than televised sound bites; he has a solid and mature strategy, a genuine alternative for getting out of the current situation. Yet, one month into his term, Israel is still dribbling around the penalty area.  
In Istanbul, Obama committed to a Palestinian state. He pledged his support to Annapolis, and George Mitchell is making sure the message is received in Jerusalem. Netanyahu, meanwhile, is doing his homework. Between the four walls of the prime minister's chambers, which have heard all the secrets, he is busy reevaluating, drowning in a sea of pages from dozens of folders containing documents on the peace process.  
And while Netanyahu the student is busy studying the writings of Livni and Ahmed Qureia - the minutes of their 70 encounters - a historical first is underway. For the first time in over a generation, the Israeli prime minister has not rushed to the Oval Office to extend his friendship to the president of the United States. Instead, Netanyahu has allowed the king of Jordan to beat him to Andrews Air Force Base en route to the White House.  
The Israeli prime minister, who promised Ehud Barak that he would honor the commitments of his predecessors, is turning against David Ben-Gurion's commitment under UN General Assembly Resolution 181 of November 29, 1947 - two states for two peoples. Suddenly the Palestinians are the ones crying about not having a partner, and Mahmoud Abbas is telling Tony Blair that there is nobody to talk to.  
The new world arena, overseen by Obama, is moving ahead at Twitter speed, a world where Hugo Chavez gets a handshake and a first visit to Havana is in the works. Netanyahu's bunker tactics won't work for long in this world. He will not be able to stall much, hoping for some global security calamity or other delays during stoppage time.  
And what will Netanyahu find when he's finished reading the folders? He'll find that the sea is the same sea and the Arabs are the same Arabs, and soon they will enjoy a majority between the Jordan River and the sea, and this majority will wash over our country unless we divide it in two. And what do we do when that happens? Import apartheid? Dust off the Allon Plan, which proposed ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank through a deal with Jordan? Shall we dispatch Shimon Peres to Amman with the draft of the London Agreement for ceasing all violence?  
Soon Netanyahu will discover what most of us have known for a long time, that a daring regional peace plan must be put forward, an initiative that corresponds with the Arab initiative and hitches Obama to the effort. This initiative will let us score: yes to the 1967 borders, yes to an exchange of territory, yes to the partition of Jerusalem, no to the right of return.  
Without a comprehensive regional peace plan for both banks of the Jordan, a plan that reinforces the American withdrawal from Iraq and reestablishes the coalition of the first Gulf War to block the axis of evil, Netanyahu can only dream that the Americans will look the other way when planes bedecked with stars of David show their radar signature on their dangerous and long journey to Natanz, Isfahan and Arak.  
In the world according to Obama, soccer matches do no last more than 90 minutes. So shoot Bibi, shoot.

<title>Comment / Settlement freeze is like racial segregation in U.S.</title>
<date>Tue Dec 29 01:46:19 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Once upon a time there was a black woman; her name was Rosa Parks. There were racially discriminating laws in the United States, but she continued to sit on the bus even when she was told to vacate her seat for a white person. She was arrested, which set off a process whose end saw the abolishment of racial segregation on American buses. How is it possible that one little black woman, a dressmaker by profession, could change history simply because she remained sitting? Her protest was stronger than any demonstration, op-ed piece or Knesset vote. She opted for the natural choice; that is why she was triumphant.  
People get married and have children. The children need space. The children grow up and get married. The children need a house. That is known as life. No one has ever managed to stop it. But every time another evil person arises who plans to destroy us, he does not succeed. And he does not succeed in destroying life itself.  
We have enemies who are big and strong. But the defense minister and prime minister are apparently too small to contend with them, so they contend with us instead. That is how we were defined as the enemy. My family and friends were outlawed. Why? Because we are building in the Land of Israel. After all the permits and approvals, in recognized and orderly settlements in which a third generation has already been raised, we woke up one morning to the humming of drones in the sky, taking pictures of us and the situation on the ground. It is forbidden to build. Not even a storeroom. Not a kennel. In certain places, it is even forbidden to add an air conditioner.  
The security forces have plans to cut off the area and act with paralyzing force; to achieve the element of surprise. They have a bank of targets that must be evacuated, and they screen mobile telephones to prevent us from calling up reinforcements against the demolition. This is humiliating, insulting and outrageous.  
The freeze is an edict that the public cannot tolerate. It is not democratic, nor is it humane. It hits hard at the pockets of law-abiding citizens and embitters their lives. But at its foundation, either intentionally or by accident, is pure and basic apartheid - it is forbidden for Jews to live in certain places. It is forbidden to build. It is forbidden to develop. And it doesn't matter what the reasons are.  
What makes me most furious is that there was no normal decision-making process for approving the move in the cabinet and Knesset. It was a wicked act done stealthily. On Wednesday night, the inner cabinet met, and the minutes are classified, of course. On Thursday there were already drones in the sky taking pictures of us. Suddenly there are no individual rights or civil rights because the law is above everything. This is a move that contravenes the substance of democracy, because democracy is the government of the people. And here rights are being trampled on.  
And if we are talking about democracy, how is it possible that the system of government in Israel always lets down the right? It happens to us time and time again. We elected a clearly right-wing leader and we got uprooting, evictions, freezes and delegitimation. What are we supposed to do to make our voices heard? The Knesset elections, after all, don't change a thing. Should we demonstrate? We've already had demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of people that have had no effect whatsoever. What is left for us to do? How can we stop what is clearly going to happen? How can we influence the reality?  
Despite the fury and the insult, let's not turn to violence. There is a simple, natural solution that is full of life - continuing to build. That will perhaps embarrass the prime minister in front of U.S. President Barack Obama, but that's precisely the point. A person with a manual cement mixer in Samaria can change history. Sometimes the man in the field can be a lot stronger than the great leaders. Just like Rosa Parks.

<title>Finish it now</title>
<date>Mon Oct 19 01:21:18 IST 2009</date>
<content>
In the early 1990s, when Judge Richard Goldstone headed a commission of inquiry on the rising violence in South Africa toward the end of apartheid, he garnered the same kind of compliments from the Afrikaners as he has been getting from Israel over the last few weeks. But the "Jew boy" wasn't the problem then, and he isn't the problem now. And PR isn't the solution. Take a look in the mirror; it's not Goldstone, it's us. We're the problem as well as the solution.  
Israel is being pushed to the side of the world stage and will yet find itself in the same position South Africa was during the final years of the right-wing "crocodile," P.W. Botha, a conservative ideologue. The Goldstone report is a cruel but accurate image of Israel the leper as seen by the "anti-Semitic" Goldstone and Israel's good friends around the world, who are having a hard time continuing to defend the country.  
When Martin Luther King Jr. was fighting for the rights of black people in the United States, it didn't bother anyone that South Africa had benches for white people only. But then the weather changed, winter turned to spring and racism became a crime once more, first in the United States and then around the world. That's exactly what's happening in Israel now. George W. Bush retired to his ranch and America has gotten tired of the settlers. Everyone understands what every decent and patriotic Israeli also realizes: Israel won't be in Hebron or Ofra when it celebrates its 70th anniversary. So why not be done with it before then?  
When will be the appropriate time? When Ankara recalls its ambassador? When Vice Premier Moshe Ya'alon is arrested in London? When the Security Council imposes sanctions? When Angela Merkel, Nicolas Sarkozy and Silvio Berlusconi start saying behind our backs the same things the Swedes and Norwegians say about us to our faces?  
We could be total suckers and not be done with it until then, or we could decide now, the way David Ben-Gurion took action at 4 P.M. one Friday afternoon: mightily, and in thrall to a Zionist vision. Complete the ugly, injurious fence that causes injustice but saves lives and turn it into Israel's internationally recognized border. Patriotic Israel realizes that the Palestinians must not beat us in the War of Independence and become the majority here, just as Ben-Gurion understood in 1948 when he made his decision. So the Arabs oppose dividing the land under reasonable conditions and want to talk until they form the majority here? Let them oppose. The world agrees, and we act.  
Israel didn't have to wallow in Lebanon for 18 years because of the Katyusha threat, and it doesn't need to immerse itself in Hebron for 42 years because of the Qassams. The Israel Defense Forces successfully defends our internationally recognized borders from security threats. We've waited too many years to give the Palestinians an answer on this, and time is against both sides of the conflict - mainly us.  
And when Israel establishes recognized borders, maybe peace will make a surprise appearance. The Palestinians will no longer be living under occupation, no one in the world will listen to them anymore, and the leaders of Egypt and Jordan will be worried about staying in power if it's not quiet in Palestine. So maybe something will move and we'll bury the sword.  
And if not? We will continue to seek peace while establishing ourselves as a model society with recognized borders; we will be respected members of the European Union and sought after by the entire world.  
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must decide whether it will be on his watch that Israel closes the book on its control over the territories, just as Ariel Sharon closed the book on Israel's presence in Gaza and Ehud Barak did in Lebanon. Or not, in which case Bibi will be followed by the Israeli F.W. de Klerk, who will lead us to a safe harbor and a historic, and final, victory in the War of Independence.

<title>Forcing Arabs to study Zionism is no solution</title>
<date>Wed Jun 17 02:17:34 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
The ministerial committee on legislation did well when it decided earlier this week to reject a bill by a group of Knesset members from Yisrael Beiteinu that would have required all Israeli schools to teach "Israel studies and Zionism."  
Aside from the fact that this was a stupid proposal, drafted by people who have apparently never in their lives entered a classroom, it was clear to all that the goal was to spark unnecessary national ferment - or, to be more precise, nationalist ferment.  
For when a bill says "all schools," and even stresses "all schools required to teach the core curriculum," it is clear that it is aimed at the Arabs. In other words, it is clear that this bill - like the Nakba bill before it and the long list of other bills that will undoubtedly follow (the disappointed sponsors are already preparing to submit the Israel studies bill to the Knesset as a private member's bill) - has one goal, and one only: to provoke the Arabs.  
What is important here is not the bill itself, but the trend. It began long ago, and now encompasses many areas of life - from a law sponsored by Likud's Limor Livnat that requires Arab schools to fly the Israeli flag to a bill by Kadima's Israel Hasson (which quietly passed its preliminary reading this week) that would "launder" family farms in the Negev (of which some are illegal and most are problematic), eradicate the limitations set by master plans and cleverly circumvent the principle of equality. Under Yisrael Beiteinu's auspices, this trend has broken through the few barriers that still existed, and its purpose is clearer than ever.  
Since this is the trend, the Israel studies and Zionism bill will undoubtedly be passed by the Knesset in some form or other. And strange as it might seem, the Arab school system - or at least, large parts of it - will probably welcome it joyfully. Granted, this is a poor man's joy, which will destroy the last vestiges of the Arab public's feeling of partnership in Israeli society, but joy nevertheless - because there is nothing like oppression to awaken and intensify slumbering national sentiment.  
Ukrainian youths who refuse to speak Russian, Corsicans who spit at signs written in French, and Jerusalemites who, during the British Mandate, refused to learn English in school will all attest to this.  
There is no better way to spark a bitter, mutinous discussion full of painful memories than a forced course in "Zionism." Do you want to know the history of the settlement movement? Of the land purchases? Of the "tower and stockade" era? Of the War of Independence? Be my guest. Israeli research into the history of Zionism offers an endless supply of different accounts and interpretations of every event. The revival of the term "Nakba" ("catastrophe") in the wake of the idiotic bill that seeks to bar its commemoration on Independence Day is only the beginning. Every debate and every nuanced discussion within Israeli Arab society has now been silenced by the nationalist, ostensibly Zionist, onslaught.  
But the gravest, most worrisome aspect of the whole affair is Yisrael Beiteinu's effort to adorn itself with the trappings of Zionism. Even though all the new laws and regulations it has proposed are designed simply to hammer the Arabs, they are dangerous to Israeli society as a whole, and especially to Israel's definition as a nation-state. Just when the prime minister has made Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish nation-state an ironclad condition for starting negotiations, Yisrael Beiteinu has exposed the real battle that is raging today - between the definition of Zionism as a national political movement and the perception of it as an apartheid movement.  
The "Zionism" that Yisrael Beiteinu wants to teach is not that of Herzl, and certainly not one that embodies dialogue among different strains, including those that seek to implement the principles of equality and the inclusion of those who are not "Zionist." This warped Zionism reflects a tradition of violent, colonialist conquest that silences all debate and grates on both sides' nationalist nerves. In such a context, reality disappears while symbols become all-important, and thus a source of ongoing conflict.  
Nor is this accidental. None of the people who have proposed bills of this kind have a genuine solution to either Jewish-Arab relations in Israel or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. So in a series of aggressive moves, they are turning the politics of "there is no solution" into a fact and trying to entrench it. And they will welcome any Palestinian counterreaction with open arms.

<title>From Sheikh Jarrah to Sheikh Munis</title>
<date>Thu Aug 06 02:07:14 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
At the top of the hill, a few dozen meters from where a house now stands, there used to be an irrigation pool for the village citrus groves. I swim every morning at the municipal swimming pool built on the ruins of the village irrigation pool. Palestinian Jaffa oranges grew in the now-vanished groves. My house stands there now. The land was "redeemed," as land acquisition was called in Zionist propaganda. In the case of Sheikh Munis, it was redeemed by force, and Tel Aviv's Ramat Aviv neighborhood was built there, including Tel Aviv University, a magnificent academic institution built on the ruins of a village whose 2,230 inhabitants were surrounded and threatened. They fled, never to return.  
All that remains of the large village is Habayit Hayarok (now a conference and party center) another house on Levanon Street and the cemetery, which sits neglected on the outskirts of the parking lot of an intimidating government facility - no outsiders allowed. Of course, there is neither a memorial nor a monument to the village that was wiped off the face of the earth - one of 418.  
Somewhere, perhaps in a refugee camp in terrible poverty, lives the family of the farmer who plowed the land where my house now stands. According to the Israeli judicial system, they have the right to get their land back immediately, destroy my house, return and grow Jaffa oranges for export on its ruins, and remove me by force if necessary. The Jerusalem District Court, which recently ruled that representatives of the Sephardi community committee had the right to take back the Hanun and Gawi families' apartments in East Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, has opened the 1948 file.  
That is, if Israel had an egalitarian system of law and justice, if the legal system were fair, because then millions of Palestinians would be able to applaud the court and demonstrate their joy in the streets at the ruling. The road to justice denied in 1948 has been opened to everyone. From now on, Jews and Arabs will be able to demand the restitution of their property. The return is in the offing, with the backing of the Israeli justice system.  
But of course, it's not like that. The court that sealed the fate of the two Palestinian families and allowed extremist settlers to live in their place has once again laid bare the rule of law's true state in Israel: racist and applying a double-standard, with separate legal systems for Jews and Arabs.  
We should perhaps thank the court for its scandalous ruling, which not only sparked a justifiable international wave of protest against Israel, but also revealed its true face. "There are judges in Jerusalem," as Menachem Begin said, and they have made it official: apartheid. Ownership rights are for Jews alone.  
The distance between Sheikh Jarrah and Sheikh Munis has been shortened in one fell swoop. Those who contend that Jews must be given back their property cannot in the same breath deny the Palestinians' property rights because of their national origin. It's true that a system of strict laws and regulations denies the Palestinians what it allows the Jews, but all reasonable Israelis must now ask themselves if this is the system of justice and the law of the "Jewish" state they want to live in.  
It is impossible to ignore the injustices of 1948 while hundreds of thousands of refugees rot in the camps. No agreement will hold water without a solution to their plight, which is more feasible than Israel's strident scaremongers suggest. But rulings like the current one make it harder to distinguish clearly between Sheikh Jarrah and Sheikh Munis, between the conquest of 1948 and the conquests of 1967. My house stands on land stolen by force, and it is the obligation of Israel and the world to redress the injustice without creating injustice and new dislocation. My house stands on land that was stolen, but the whole world has recognized the Jews' right to establish their state there. At the same time, no country in the world has recognized Israel's right to conquer Sheikh Jarrah as well.  
In my morning musings on the way to the pool, I sometimes think about the land's original owners. I long for the day when Israel takes moral and material responsibility for the injustice done to them. Now, because of the court ruling, my right to continue to swim here may also be in doubt.

<title>How Goldstone erred </title>
<date>Fri Sep 25 01:12:18 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
At least three times in his life, Richard Goldstone has gone against prevailing wisdom in taking on challenging jobs. Two were in apartheid South Africa - and he was brilliantly successful in both. The third, his Gaza inquiry, has brought down the coals of hell upon his head.  
During the first three decades of apartheid, many judges were appointed because of their loyalty to the Afrikaner government. One result was a decline in the quality and status of South African courts. In response, the government sought to appoint some liberal lawyers of quality. Most, however, were reluctant to join the bench because it meant applying apartheid laws.  
Some accepted: Goldstone, who made his name as a barrister in nonpolitical commercial cases, became a Supreme Court judge in 1980. The next year, far from merely applying the law, he handed down a judgment that struck at the heart of a basic apartheid law - the Group Areas Act, which had split the entire country into different areas where people of different races were respectively compelled to live and work, and displaced hundreds of thousands of people of color.  
Goldstone ruled in favor of an Asian woman appealing against eviction from her home, and said she first had to be provided with alternative accommodation. His startling judgment ended such evictions.  
His second challenging job came in 1991. Apartheid was winding down and the country was beset by violence, in which thousands were killed. A mysterious "Third Force" of government agents was rumored to be behind the killings. President F.W. de Klerk asked Goldstone to head a commission to investigate the terrible violence. Goldstone accepted - and ran it like no other commission before: Over three years, he issued 47 reports, revealing horrendous details about murder squads set up and funded by the government.  
Gaza has been Goldstone's latest challenge. He again accepted a mandate from a poisoned source: the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. I have no doubt that he acted with the best of intentions, as he has his entire life, first in South Africa and then in the world, to ensure justice be done. But I also believe that this time, his decision is open to question.  
First, Goldstone underestimated the Human Rights Council's malevolence toward Israel. Most members harbor deep hatred for Israel, and wish for no less than its destruction. Goldstone should have been warned off by the refusal of several people before him to accept the job, including former Irish president Mary Robinson.  
Second, he accepted the council's mandate, even though it had declared in advance that Israel was guilty of war crimes in Gaza. It is not enough that the council's chairman later said the mandate could include Hamas: Apart from the fact that this statement does not bind the council, his findings on Hamas will mean little or nothing in practice because the organization is not a recognized government and is beyond international action. Israel is the council's target and Goldstone has delivered it. His report has more strength because he is a Jew and enjoys international status.  
Third, rejecting objections, he allowed Prof. Christine Chinkin to remain a member of his four-person commission even though, back in January, she had already publicly found Israel guilty, referring to its "prima facie war crimes" in Gaza. Goldstone thus seriously, even fatally, undermined the commission's credibility, and in doing so raised questions about his own good sense.  
Fourth, the nearly 600-page report includes many pages of descriptions and allegations of Israeli oppression at home and on the West Bank. That is valid if the intention is to provide a context for Israel's actions in Gaza. But then it must be done properly, with careful research and assessments for a fair presentation of the mix of history, religion, culture and politics that make up the complex situation, including both good and bad. The report does not show that knowledge and understanding; instead, time and again, it's Israel that is bad, bad, bad.  
Fifth, the report follows the usual line pursued by members of the council and Israel's other enemies - treating Israel as though it were a unique source of evil instead of examining Gaza in the light of experience elsewhere, in places such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan, where the military has taken on terrorists in a civilian setting.  
Richard Goldstone is now under savage attack from many in the Jewish world. Right-wingers have gone berserk, with outpourings of hysterical condemnation. More measured criticism has come from Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the UN, who said there were "very serious concerns about many of the recommendations in the report," and U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly, who criticized the report for its "cookie-cutter conclusions" about Israel's actions, while it limited its comments on "the deplorable actions of Hamas to generalized remarks."  
But Kelly also urged Israel to further investigate IDF actions in Gaza. And that indeed is what Israel should do. I believed last December and still do that Israel was justified in going into Gaza. But I remain uncertain and uncomfortable about exactly what Israel did and why it did it. Was white phosphorous used over civilian areas? If so, why? What about the early killing of scores of policemen? What about reports that rescue parties were blocked from reaching the wounded, civilians carrying white flags were killed while fleeing and human shields were used? Why were journalists kept out?  
The IDF says emphatically that it behaved correctly, but it is not enough for it to investigate itself. An independent investigation is needed - and the obvious person to head it is former Israeli Supreme Court president Aharon Barak, who would give it strength and status, at home and abroad. Israelis need it for their own moral peace of mind, or if wrong was done, to recognize and to address it. Israel needs to be certain that it can tell Goldstone and other critics that their accusations are skewed and unjustified.

<title>How to talk to a right winger </title>
<date>Thu May 28 13:22:03 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
MK Tzipi Hotovely is a rising star in the Likud party. Well spoken, young and passionate, she decided to hold a diplomatic conference this week. The subject: Alternatives to the two-state concept.  
On the eve of the conference, Hotovely appeared on the nightly current events program "London and Kirschenbaum" on Channel 10. For seven minutes the pair tried to get one answer out of their guest: What is your alternative?  
The question was repeated no fewer than 10 times, in various versions, but they didn't get an answer. Instead they heard replies that seemed better suited to an amusing skit: "I'm very happy that you're asking that question"; "What's important is not the alternative"; "Palestinian society is not ripe for a solution"; "Jews will not be evicted from their homes again." Hotovely knows what she doesn't want, but she hasn't the faintest idea what she does want.  
Let's not blame Hotovely, she's not alone. From the prime minister down to the last of the right wingers, none of them has an answer to the simplest, most natural and most obvious question of all: What, in heaven's name, do you suggest? How will the country look according to your vision, and only according to your vision, 15 to 20 years from now?  
After all, at the conference that took place the day after the interview, the farce repeated itself. No less a personage than Strategic Affairs Minister Moshe Ya'alon said that there is no room for discussion of the two-state outline; that such a process has no chance; that the Palestinians don't want two states. All together now: an alternative - forget it.  
We therefore have before us the marvelously easy and effective way to bring down the right's house of cards in one fell swoop: Ask them what they suggest. Ask them what their solution is. They will squirm like Hotovely; there isn't a single decent right winger who has a ready answer.  
With the exception of those who favor transfer - "voluntary" transfer, of course - the right has no vision of how the country will look less than a generation from now, when the Arabs make up the majority between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean. What will a country where the minority rules the majority look like? For how many more years will millions of people continue to live without basic rights while the world remains silent?  
In the outside world such a country is called an apartheid state. In Israel they call it the one-state solution. Once it was out of bounds, only the radical left in both nations dared to suggest it. Now it is being proposed by the Israeli right, while they blur and repress the reality.  
Do you know what the right is proposing? It is proposing a continuation of the status quo. What was ostensibly good for Israel for 40 years will also be good for another 400 years. For 40 years we were able to deceive ourselves, to mock the world, to occupy, to oppress, to trample and to kill. So why shouldn't we continue?  
But the status quo is never static: It changes quickly. The Palestinians are intensifying their struggle and the world is gradually becoming disgusted with us. During the first 20 years of the occupation, we too were convinced that it could continue undisturbed: The Palestinians would continue to build our homes, sweep our streets, wash our dishes and cultivate our fields forever. Then came the first intifada which destroyed the illusion with stones and knives; then the second intifada did so with rifles and explosive devices.  
The third one is on the way, more violent than its predecessors. The soul of the world will become fed up: During the first intifada it remained silent for the most part, during the second it began to ostracize Israel, and during the third it will take painful practical steps against it.  
Some of the right wingers understand this. They have a secret wish in their hearts, which they will never dare to utter: Let's make the lives of the Palestinians intolerable, until they get the hint - which is as obvious as the barrel of the cannon directed at their homes - and leave.  
That's an idea. The problem is that the idea is not practical: The Palestinians, unfortunately, are staying put, more than the Jews are. Perhaps we haven't stepped on them hard enough as yet. There is also a chance that the camel's back will break in the end, just as Fatah is about to break, and then there will no longer be anyone with whom to solve the problem.  
So here is another way to deal with the slogans of the right: Expose the truth that lies behind them, and its hopelessness.  
There is nothing easier than causing the arguments of the right to collapse. Not a single genuinely secular person can be convinced of our right to the territories for religious reasons. The grave of Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav in Uman, Ukraine, is also holy and at the moment we have no claim to sovereignty over it.  
Just as absurd are the security-related explanations in an era of missiles capable of nearly anything. All that remains is the greed for real estate. And when it comes to real estate, let's talk about its price: it's rising. On the day when Israelis also begin to pay for the ground personally, with blood and money, and also understand the context - the deal will be called off.  
Until then the right will continue to use scare tactics, without proposing a single alternative, and the settlers will continue with their tricks; the solution of the left, the only one around, will become impossible and the right will win again.  
It will be a Pyrrhic victory; it will be too late to amend it. The largest and most dubious real estate deal of all will collapse and with it those who claimed that they were the owners of the property, even though something else was written on the deed of reality and justice.

<title>Israel boycott of U.K. goods would be toothless, stupid</title>
<date>Thu Dec 24 02:57:18 IST 2009</date>
<content>
"I admit I've bought a few things there in the past, but one can do without Marks & Spencer." With this observation on life's hardships before the cameras, MK Ronit Tirosh (Kadima) launched her "the Knesset says no to British products" campaign.  
Tirosh launches into her war against Britain with a lethal arsenal. Forty-two MKs from most of the parties in the Knesset signed a petition threatening "a boycott of British goods in the wake of the [British] government's recommendation that Israeli products made beyond the Green Line be marked as such." They are backed by Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin (Likud) who called the initiative "correct and important" and offered to have the petition translated and sent to his U.K. counterpart, the speaker of the House of Commons.  
Some say the petition's delivery should be accompanied by the Knesset choir belting out "Fools Britannia, Britain's fools and knaves." We'll give them boycott for boycott. Tirosh began with Marks & Spencer. We'll proceed to the Tate galleries and the West End Theater. We'll stay out of Hyde Park, we'll ignore Susan Boyle, and as for the Beatles we don't need them. And if all that doesn't help, we'll recall Liverpool's Israeli soccer star Yossi Benayoun, and even Avram Grant, now coaching bottom-of-the-league Portsmouth.  
Just as Tirosh was sticking out her neck to win the "we'll show 'em" sprint, up came Deputy Foreign Minister Daniel Ayalon to pip her at the post with his riposte to European Union Foreign Minister Katherine Ashton. His "just as the Romans failed to cut Israel off from Jerusalem, so too will United Nations and EU diplomats," gave him the gold medal.  
Patriotism, it turns out, is also the last refuge of those who can't read the map of reality. Nonetheless it would behoove our legislators and cabinet ministers, as well as their deputies, to take an occasional peek at those irrelevant international factors such as Europe, the UN and the United States. They may well discover that our constant whining is starting to have an effect. And if Tirosh and Ayalon would kindly look eastward from their Jerusalem offices, they would see that what has sprouted there, right under their noses, is not exactly Jack's magic beanstalk.  
It is an area whose value has risen several times more than anywhere else in Israel, and whose Jewish residents enjoy privileges several times greater than the residents of the state itself. These are territories that were conquered in war, and a policy of segregation between Jews and Palestinians has been in force for a long time. It is a state within a state, and some call the policy implemented there apartheid - not only in Britain, Sweden, Spain, Austria and Holland. It is in the air. Even in Washington.  
The day is not far off when that epithet will be spoken aloud, in the institutions of the EU and the UN, and perhaps also be translated into resolutions like those used against other states and regimes. Tirosh and Ayalon and their leaders should prepare themselves. It begins with trivialities: The sheet music for "Hatikva" can't be found at an international sporting event, an Israeli troupe's invitation to a dance festival is canceled - but it will steadily gather momentum, at conferences, in the discussions of international organizations and in cooperation with them.  
Although Tirosh and Rivlin may not have noticed it, the world has grown tired of us, and although it may be asleep, sometimes it kicks in its sleep. In the meantime, they should start checking how many and which Israeli companies are registered as suppliers of Marks & Spencer. Their threats against Britain are even dumber than the dumbest of dumb British shaggy dog stories.

<title>Israel's apartheid is worse than South Africa's</title>
<date>Sun Nov 08 01:11:22 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The shock that gripped the shrunken peace camp following Hillary Clinton's statement that the settlement construction freeze is not what we thought it would be, but rather what Benjamin Netanyahu thought it would be, is reminiscent of other shocks generated by American peace plans ever since the 1960s.  
Had the educated people of this camp not outnumbered its foot soldiers, this shock and amazement could be compared to other superstitions, like the correlation between rainfall and women's fertility.  
But precisely because the Israeli intelligentsia is always coming up with prophecies about "American pressure," it would not be unreasonable to assume that we can once again expect expert regurgitation of speculations about a "first-term president" versus a "second-term" one, and about when he stops being an "incoming" president and starts being a "lame duck."  
The truth is simpler. Regardless of whether there is a Democrat or a Republican in the White House, the United States became a distinctly pro-Israel world power after the 1967 war. It has no intention of being a "balanced mediator" when it comes to the conflict with the Palestinians.  
Barack Obama's public relations moves in the Arab world have frightened many average Israelis. But Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, allies of the final takeover of the West Bank, know very well that U.S. policy has not changed. It doesn't take a genius to read the working papers of past prime ministers.  
The prevailing attitude of all U.S. administrations was drafted by Henry Morgenthau, and was later updated by Kenneth Waltz. One line guided all of them - Dennis Ross, Martin Indyk, George Mitchell - essentially, that any possible settlement must match the positions of the stronger party.  
This is how the Americans abandoned the refugee issue, and this is why they abandoned the opposition to settlements. Netanyahu is no genius. He is simply not interested in saying good-bye to the occupation. That is all. After all, he came to power because of this. To complain about him is to complain about November rain.  
The Israeli public's choice is a different matter. The spokesmen of the dovish camp tell us horror stories about a future binational state. But the binational state is already here. It has a rigid apartheid legal system, as the High Court of Justice fades away.  
The system preserving this apartheid is more ruthless than that seen in South Africa, where the black were a labor force and could therefore also make a living. It is equipped with the lie of being "temporary." Occasionally, Israel's indifference comes up with allegations against the Palestinians.  
Abba Eban captured the allegation by coining a phrase repeated by the doves of all parties, who never really went to battle over Israel's future and allowed the "settlement project" to spread. After all, occupation makes Israelis richer. Why oppose it?  
Yaakov (Jack) Teitel is the American aid secured by moderate Israel. What Yitzhak Rabin failed to do after the massacre by the last import, Baruch Goldstein - to uproot the Jewish settlement in Hebron - will not happen now either. Shvut Rachel, Tapuah or any other such town will not be moved, nor will the smaller "illegal" outposts.  
Beyond the two Palestinians whose murders were never really investigated, and past what Ami Ortiz or Professor Ze'ev Sternhell went through, Teitel is a Made-in-the-U.S.A. reminder that "no one will do for you what you fail to do for yourselves."  
How to do what needs to be done? Surely, not through the rules drafted back in the 1970s, when "we" were in power and "they" were the opposition. The settlers are in power. The Shin Bet security service and Obama will not fight them.

<title>Jews as canaries and hawks </title>
<date>Fri Dec 25 01:17:15 IST 2009</date>
<content>
John Mann is a British Labor MP who explains that there isn't a single Jew among the industrial workers, farmers and retired coal miners in his constituency. He is one of the handful of MPs who came out of the recent parliamentary-expenses scandals cleaner than he went in. He was honored with an award at the Knesset during last week's conference of the Global Forum for Combating Anti-Semitism, for his work in Britain and internationally against anti-Jewish racism. Mann compared the Jews to a canary, like the ones his constituents used to take three miles down into the mines to make sure that the atmosphere was healthy for human beings. The process of the decay of all human values begins with anti-Semitism, said Gert Weisskirchen, who was honored in the same ceremony. Weisskirchen is a scholar as well as a long-time member of the Bundestag, a man imbued with the spirit of the gentle, civilized and worldly social democracy that built post-war West Germany out of the ashes of the Holocaust.  
So what's going on? The Jews are hawks, not canaries, aren't they? The Global Forum is run by Israel's Foreign Ministry, making Avigdor Lieberman its current host. He is a political figure who has broken new ground in Israel, mainstreaming the kind of racialized thinking of which anti-Semitism was a historic prototype, garnering votes by rhetorically threatening the status of the state's Arab citizens. He is the deputy prime minister in a government that continues to fail to bring its army and its settlers home from Palestinian territory, where they perpetrate the daily violence and humiliation characteristic of all occupations.  
In truth, it is only by denying whole facets of reality that one can fit Jews and Israelis into a simple worldview that defines everyone either as oppressed or as oppressor. Similarly, we would all like to believe that anti-Semitism is a thing of the past, but the ready-made ways of thinking that it offers are too deeply embedded in various cultural imaginations around the world for it to disappear easily. No matter how much serious consideration of anti-Semitism is ridiculed as a dishonest attempt to silence criticism of Israel; no matter how much Israelis would prefer to think of themselves as strong, and as being responsible for their own situation rather than perceiving themselves as victims of anti-Semitism - the old libels are still manifested in the ways in which people think about Israel and about Jews.  
Sammy Eppel, a journalist from Venezuela, explained to the conference in Jerusalem how half the members of that country's Jewish community have left, as the Chavez regime continues to whip up fervor against "Jewish Zionist imperialism" and to embrace the Jew-hating Iranian regime. Furthermore, a 747 fully loaded with who-knows-what flies from Caracas to Tehran weekly.  
Dovid Katz, who teaches Yiddish in Vilnius, raised the alarm about current trends to normalize the Holocaust in the Baltic states by portraying Stalin and Hitler as perpetrators of twin genocides. This is a rhetoric that hides a preference for Hitler, and allows surviving perpetrators of the Holocaust to be honored as anti-communist partisans, and anti-fascists to be put on trial as Stalin's collaborators. An additional worry is that this kind of "re-understanding" of the Holocaust fits in with other kinds of revisionism - like those that portray the Shoah as an invented justification for the State of Israel, or as a minor intra-European spat, dwarfed in importance and impact by the history of European colonialism - of which the oppression of the Palestinians is currently the key manifestation.  
Patrick Desbois, a quiet but hugely charismatic French Catholic priest, was also present at the Global Forum gathering, explaining how he has been traveling Ukraine and Belarus encouraging perpetrators, witnesses and bystanders of the Nazi genocide to divulge their memories before they are lost. Many who refuse to talk to investigators, and who appear to be Jewish, happily chat with him when he is wearing his comforting priest's collar.  
Stories were also presented to the conference about intellectuals, trade unionists, anti-racists and other good people who seek to exclude Israelis, and only Israelis, from the global academic, cultural and economic community; who declare that anti-boycott lawyers are financed by stolen Lehman Brothers money from New York; who say that "Zionist" Jews are the new Nazis, the new racists, the new imperialists, the new supporters of apartheid; who teach that the "Israel lobby" is responsible for the Iraq war; who find excuses for anti-Semitic violence and terrorism; who act as apologists for "critics of Israel" who learn from far-right conspiracy theorists; and who seek to silence those who speak up against anti-Semitism by saying that they only do so to give Prime Minister Netanyahu an easy ride.  
Eminent Israeli scholars Yehuda Bauer and Emmanuel Sivan skewered the worldview of those who ignorantly and innocently embrace anti-Semitic notions when all they think they are doing is speaking up for Palestinians. Yet they both warned the Global Forum that the fight against anti-Semitism is only part of the general fight against bigotry. Both found it necessary to spell out what ought to have been obvious to the delegates: that the struggles against Islamophobia and other types of racism are intimately related to the fight against anti-Jewish racism.

<title>Lieberman is no better than Feiglin </title>
<date>Fri Feb 20 01:36:26 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Kadima achieved its great accomplishment thanks to votes from the left, whereas Likud did not lose even more seats to Kadima because it succeeded in temporarily concealing and silencing Moshe Feiglin's Jewish Leadership movement. Now, even though Avigdor Lieberman and his aides - who, when it is convenient, like to wear the mask of pragmatists - are no better than the group from Jewish Leadership, Tzipi Livni and Benjamin Netanyahu are both competing for their favors.  
That is the nature of politics and the reason why politics are loathed by decent people who consider them the opposite of integrity and basic morality. It is no wonder that so many people do not bother to go to the polls.  
But Lieberman is not a unique phenomenon. About one-third of the members of the current Knesset show contempt for democracy's moral contents.  
Yisrael Beiteinu is joined by the ultra-Orthodox parties, whose patterns of behavior and principles in the political sphere are not substantially different from the concepts held by Lieberman's party or the Feiglin branch of Likud. Even though the ultra-Orthodox parties' source of authority is spiritual and the leader who makes the decisions achieved his position due to his intellectual prowess - while Lieberman draws on his skill at sowing hatred - the result is similar. Lieberman and Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, along with the factions at the fringes of their parties, represent those in our society who have authoritarian temperaments and tendencies.  
Yisrael Beiteinu, Shas and United Torah Judaism, National Union and the "Feiglins" openly show contempt for human rights. The claim that human rights are the heart of democracy and that the reason for its existence is to preserve human rights granted equally to all people everywhere, causes them revulsion. From their point of view, anyone who believes this is an enemy of the Jewish people and undermines the very foundations of the Jewish state.  
Even though some members of the nationalist camp are worse than Lieberman, he is the most dangerous because he is a natural street leader, the only one here. And lo and behold, instead of being an outcast, Lieberman has become the kingmaker. Anyone who in the past demanded that the Europeans denounce Joerg Haider's Austria, anyone who considered Jean-Marie Le Pen an anti-Semite who must not be allowed near power, cannot treat the Lieberman phenomenon with forgiveness.  
Until now, anti-democratic trends in Israel have been halted by a political framework designed in an era that had not yet known Lieberman and before religious Zionism had undergone a radicalization of the kind not even dreamed of by Agudat Yisrael, Poalei Agudat Yisrael and the National Religious Party as it was then. That is why the recent elections are a milestone. Not because of the success of Israel's version of Haider-Le Pen, but because of the legitimacy granted to him by politicians who lust for power and lack restraints.  
It is likewise wrong for Kadima's leaders to be blinded by Yisrael Beiteinu's secularism. Secularism is not a philosophical value in Lieberman's eyes but rather a means to solving his voters' problems. When that issue is resolved, the settler Lieberman will be seen joining religious nationalists in the most natural fashion. Less separates those two camps than what unites them. On the one hand, both of them want to rule over the territories and continue expanding there, and to perpetuate the policy of apartheid. On the other hand, they strive to reduce individual freedoms and rights to a minimum. With regard to the Arabs, their intention in practice is to do away with the defense of these rights.  
Later on, the judicial oversight of legislation and government actions will be abolished, the significance of which is the beginning of the end for democracy. It is interesting that Lieberman, like South American dictators at the end of the previous century, also supports capitalism run wild. Like them, he is a great liberal when it comes to the freedom to exploit another person, but not with regard to other freedoms.  
The experience of the previous century proved that when the liberal and conservative right joins up with the extreme right, in the hope of becoming stronger, it ends up disintegrating both morally and politically. So this is not the time to toss aside basic values. A front must be set up to preserve democratic freedoms. Those for whom our society's future is important must understand that a partnership with Lieberman will destroy everything in politics. Therefore blocking his way to power is a national interest, and a party interest, from Likud to Labor. The leaders of Likud and Kadima must be aware that teaming up with the man who for years has thrived on the frustrations, fears and complexes of Israeli society will ultimately lead to their own end.

<title>Lieberman is no racist</title>
<date>Sun Apr 26 01:08:00 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
I did not vote for Avigdor Lieberman and never will. I do not agree with some of his political positions and do not accept his framing of certain issues. But I am appalled by the left's delegitimizing of Lieberman and anyone connected with him. I do not believe that Israel's Arab citizens must be required to declare their loyalty to the Jewish state. What must be demanded of them and of all Israeli citizens, whether Jewish, Druze or other, is unflinching loyalty to the State of Israel and its laws. But even if one can, and sometimes should, disagree with Lieberman on his approach and statements on this sensitive issue, he's still not a racist. Lieberman is neither a racist nor a fascist, and depicting him as such does an injustice to his voters and harm to Israel.
What's racist is denying the Jewish people a state of their own. Certain Arab Knesset members talk incessantly about the Palestinian people's rights, including their own state. But in the same breath they refuse to acknowledge Israel as the state of the Jewish people and deny the very existence of a Jewish people as a nation with national rights. The person who deserves the racist epithet is MK Jamal Zahalka, who attended the conference of hate in Geneva and called himself "a victim of Israel's racist apartheid" while serving as a member of the Israeli parliament.
The left's tendency to delegitimize and demonize people with whom they disagree is no less reprehensible than similar tactics by the right. Just as we must condemn right wingers' attempts to cast doubt over the patriotism of Yossi Beilin and his fellow subscribers to the Geneva Initiative - provocative as this plan might be to most Israelis - we must condemn the left's lamentable habit of denigrating Lieberman.
The idea to change the state's borders in a peace agreement may not be practical or implementable in our circumstances, but we cannot deny its legitimacy and sense. And in any case, it has nothing to do with racism. Lieberman has said publicly that he supports the principle of establishing a Palestinian state. The media attacked Lieberman for his comments on Annapolis, but his statement on Israel's commitment to the road map is of infinitely greater importance. It's a fact that the Annapolis process did not mature into an agreement, and the road map enjoys widespread international recognition. Incidentally, it's interesting to note that no such assurances of Israel's commitment to the road map have come from Benjamin Netanyahu.
It's time that both the left and right learn to engage in debates over issues, not individuals, and stop delegitimizing and demonizing once and for all.

<title>Manipulating the marketplace of ideas </title>
<date>Fri Nov 27 02:15:17 IST 2009</date>
<content>
For over a decade, European governments have been major sources of funding for dozens of Israeli and Palestinian organizations claiming to promote human rights and similar moral causes. While these groups are known as "nongovernmental organizations," or NGOs, they are, in fact, selected and nurtured by foreign governments. And as seen in research to be discussed in a Knesset conference on December 1, their agendas are more political than moral.  
This often hidden support helps pay for expensive newspaper advertisements, such as those recently announcing B'Tselem's 20th anniversary; the salaries of lawyers involved in dozens of High Court cases about the security barrier, treatment of Palestinian terrorists, etc.; the Geneva Initiative's conferences and booklets; and a flood of statements submitted to the United Nations condemning Israeli policies. Recipient NGOs have a major influence on many issues in our lives, and on the decisions of our democratically elected government.  
Although foreign funding for Israeli NGOs is labeled as support for "civil society," this is false advertising. Organizations such as Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, B'Tselem, Hamoked Center for the Defense of the Individual, and many more, cannot claim to be rooted in Israeli civil society when they are funded both directly by the Swedish government, and indirectly through budgets provided by the same government to the Diakonia church organization. This process is repeated by another 15 governments (including Norway and Switzerland), as well as the European Commission, which between them fund more than 50 similar organizations.  
The nature and scale of European influence is unique - in no other case do democratic countries use taxpayer money to support opposition groups in other democracies. Imagine the French response to U.S. government financing for radical NGO anti-abortion campaigns in Paris, or for promoting Corsican separatists under the guise of human rights. Would Spain tolerate foreign government funding of NGO campaigns involving the violent Basque conflict? But here, as in other areas, Israel is singled out and subject to different rules.  
Taken together, the large sums provided to NGOS by European governments through secret processes constitute a major effort to manipulate the Israeli marketplace of ideas. This is inherently colonialistic, undermining the goals of Zionism and Jewish sovereign equality.  
For example, Adalah's 2007 "Democratic Constitution" seeks to abolish the Law of Return; Mada al-Carmel's "Haifa Declaration," featuring the EU logo, calls for a "change in the definition of the State of Israel from a Jewish state" and accuses Israel of "exploiting" the Holocaust "at the expense of the Palestinian people." In the judicial arena, dozens of politicized court cases are brought by these NGOs, making them "repeat players" with an unfair advantage that greatly distorts the legal process.  
Externally, officials from fringe ideological NGOs frequently speak at UN sessions on human rights, in churches and on university campuses, where they demonize Israel with terms like "apartheid," "ethnic cleansing," "genocide" and "war crimes." The allegations in the Goldstone report on the Gaza war are in some cases copied directly from reports of more than 20 NGOs funded by Europe, and many are also involved in the boycotts, divestment and sanctions campaign based on the Durban NGO Forum strategy of isolating Israel. The Coalition of Women for Peace, which receives grants from the EU, operates the "Who Profits?" divestment Web site, which tracks Israeli and international corporations allegedly "involved in the occupation." "Who Profits?" was central in the anti-Israel divestment campaign in Norway, and a similar project has begun in Britain. In parallel, using European funding, B'Tselem lobbyists in Washington and London campaign for the adoption of the Goldstone report, and oppose the policies of Israel's elected government. And the travel expenses provided to Breaking the Silence are used to promote its efforts to spread allegations of war crimes around the world. The use of taxpayer funds for this political warfare against Israel is unjustifiable.  
The first step to ending this practice is a law to require full transparency - a principle that European officials preach, but when it comes to Israel, do not practice. Before any NGO can accept foreign government funding, the details of the grant would have to be made public. Israeli law should also require full notification when the money is used, so that the backing for NGO activities - newspaper ads, political protests and conferences - is clearly stated. Transparency would also allow European parliamentary oversight and expose the absence of professional evaluation of the purposes to which funds have been put.  
Opponents and critics of research exposing European government funding allege that transparency requirements would hinder free speech. This is a diversion: Free speech is not the issue. As should be the case in civil society activities, private funding will always be available from local and Diaspora supporters for organizations representing the full spectrum of ideologies, including for allegations (real and fabricated) regarding human rights and related issues. Their main fear is that transparency will lead responsible Europeans to reconsider the wisdom of sending tens of millions of government euros, pounds and krona to favored Israeli fringe NGOs. Transparency may not halt the European practice of using Israeli NGOs to sell these agendas and manipulate policy and politics, but this is an important beginning.

<title>Manipulating the marketplace of ideas </title>
<date>Thu Nov 26 21:56:10 IST 2009</date>
<content>
For over a decade, European governments have been major sources of funding for dozens of Israeli and Palestinian organizations claiming to promote human rights and similar moral causes. While these groups are known as "nongovernmental organizations," or NGOs, they are, in fact, selected and nurtured by foreign governments. And as seen in research to be discussed in a Knesset conference on December 1, their agendas are more political than moral.  
This often hidden support helps pay for expensive newspaper advertisements, such as those recently announcing B'Tselem's 20th anniversary; the salaries of lawyers involved in dozens of High Court cases about the security barrier, treatment of Palestinian terrorists, etc.; the Geneva Initiative's conferences and booklets; and a flood of statements submitted to the United Nations condemning Israeli policies. Recipient NGOs have a major influence on many issues in our lives, and on the decisions of our democratically elected government.  
Although foreign funding for Israeli NGOs is labeled as support for "civil society," this is false advertising. Organizations such as Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, B'Tselem, Hamoked Center for the Defense of the Individual, and many more, cannot claim to be rooted in Israeli civil society when they are funded both directly by the Swedish government, and indirectly through budgets provided by the same government to the Diakonia church organization. This process is repeated by another 15 governments (including Norway and Switzerland), as well as the European Commission, which between them fund more than 50 similar organizations.  
The nature and scale of European influence is unique - in no other case do democratic countries use taxpayer money to support opposition groups in other democracies. Imagine the French response to U.S. government financing for radical NGO anti-abortion campaigns in Paris, or for promoting Corsican separatists under the guise of human rights. Would Spain tolerate foreign government funding of NGO campaigns involving the violent Basque conflict? But here, as in other areas, Israel is singled out and subject to different rules.  
Taken together, the large sums provided to NGOS by European governments through secret processes constitute a major effort to manipulate the Israeli marketplace of ideas. This is inherently colonialistic, undermining the goals of Zionism and Jewish sovereign equality.  
For example, Adalah's 2007 "Democratic Constitution" seeks to abolish the Law of Return; Mada al-Carmel's "Haifa Declaration," featuring the EU logo, calls for a "change in the definition of the State of Israel from a Jewish state" and accuses Israel of "exploiting" the Holocaust "at the expense of the Palestinian people." In the judicial arena, dozens of politicized court cases are brought by these NGOs, making them "repeat players" with an unfair advantage that greatly distorts the legal process.  
Externally, officials from fringe ideological NGOs frequently speak at UN sessions on human rights, in churches and on university campuses, where they demonize Israel with terms like "apartheid," "ethnic cleansing," "genocide" and "war crimes." The allegations in the Goldstone report on the Gaza war are in some cases copied directly from reports of more than 20 NGOs funded by Europe, and many are also involved in the boycotts, divestment and sanctions campaign based on the Durban NGO Forum strategy of isolating Israel.

<title>Not refusal at all</title>
<date>Wed Nov 25 02:28:28 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The clandestine gathering of the heads of the hesder yeshivas (which combine Torah study with military service) this week in Jerusalem let the cat out of the bag. Anyone who thinks it really is possible to describe those from the hesder yeshivas who raise signs and oppose evacuation as "refuseniks" must now understand that the old definitions no longer suit the settlers' domination of the Israeli reality.  
If we add to them IDF Chief Rabbi Avichai Rontzki, who a week ago said "Troops who show mercy to the enemy will be damned," it is difficult not to reach the dismal conclusion that the Israel Defense Forces is but a clear expression of this domination.  
Who are the rabbis who met to discuss the "IDF attack against the hesder yeshivas"? Rabbi Eliezer Melamed, his father Rabbi Zalman Baruch Melamed, Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu, Rabbi Yaakov Yosef and many others, all of whom are familiar to the Israeli public in one connection: undermining Israeli sovereignty. They have all come out openly against the legal system. They all have an ultra-Orthodox, faith-based worldview. They all promised their public that "there will be no disengagement" and when it began they spurred soldiers to fight against it.  
They all conduct messianic activity. For example, Rabbi Yehoshua Shapira - the students of his Ramat Gan yeshiva "illuminate the city" with Shabbat candles and booths for laying tefillin (phylacteries), and hold Hasidic dancing and awareness ceremonies that are controversial even in the religious community.  
They are all dragging the students into a stringent separation between men and women, and are forcing the IDF to subordinate itself to these extremist norms. They all support, to some degree or other, the "hilltop youth," for example Rabbi Eliezer Melamed, who in his book "Revivim" called them "the dear hilltop youth, who devote themselves to settling the land and making the desert bloom."  
They all teach their students that the blood of a Jew is redder than the blood of others, certainly than the blood of Arabs. In general, they all divide the world into Jews and the rest, like Rabbi Rontzki, who is praised in the hardali (ultra-Orthodox nationalist) press for the "revolution" he has brought about in the IDF and for his success in minimizing the influence of the Education Corps as compared to the military rabbinate, which is now in charge of the sphere of values.  
Since the establishment of the Gush Emunim settler movement this group has had one project, which is becoming increasingly focused: to impose their worldview on Israeli society, until the Green Line dissolves and we all become settlers. Today, more than ever, this goal is close to being realized. The fact is that the prime minister, defense minister and chief of staff are all speaking in a hollow and unsubstantial way about their opposition to "refusal from any direction," including draft evasion. As though it were all the same thing.  
And in fact the settlers, in whose eyes any means of penetrating public awareness are kosher, are now using explanations taken from the lexicon of draft evasion and the discourse of individual rights characteristic of the liberals of north Tel Aviv.  
They no longer say "Eretz Israel" ("the Land of Israel") but rather "A Jew does not expel a Jew." Not "the sanctity of the land," but "we have to support parents whose children are forced by the army to carry out missions against their consciences." How touching. And how well it disconnects the political-ideological element from the discourse.  
After all, we can understand a soldier whose conscience does not allow him to shoot on Shabbat, can't we? Well, the answer is absolutely not. That is precisely the path to the hardali takeover of the IDF: The rabbis have succeeded in keeping women away from their students, encourage them to turn to a rabbi on any issue related to "conscience" or "ethics," and have created a blatant separation between soldiers who have to obey every order every day of the week, and their favorites, the skullcap wearers.  
There can no doubt: The domination of the Israeli reality by the settler norm is a successful enterprise. Every fiery speech by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who bangs on the table with his fist and declares that "we will not agree to refusal from any side," and every demonstration of evasiveness by Defense Minister Ehud Barak who threatens to punish opponents of evacuation but ingratiates himself with the hesder yeshivas and says that we must not harm all of them "because of a handful of refuseniks," are increasing this domination.  
Just as the Supreme Court once permitted the two different legal systems in the territories and created a basis for apartheid, the political establishment is allowing the destroyers of democracy, who want to replace sovereignty with the rabbinate, to take it apart from within. That's not refusal at all. That's war.

<title>Obama is changing the rules of Mideast pressure</title>
<date>Mon May 11 02:39:32 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
It is not hard to imagine what a tumult it would stir in Jerusalem if the United States decided to temporarily ease the pressure on Iran regarding its nuclear program. Or if President Barack Obama ordered a freeze, for the time being, on the sanctions against Syria. God help the U.S. administration if it even considers lifting the boycott on the Hamas rulers in the Gaza Strip before the Palestinian group agrees to a two-state solution within the 1967 borders. And how nice that Congress is delaying the emergency assistance package to the Palestinian Authority until a new government is formed in Ramallah, in order to ensure that it's one we like.
International pressure on neighbors has always been a welcome and even essential tool. Without pressure from the outside why would Iran give up, voluntarily, its nuclear capability? If the United States does not pressure Syria to disengage from terrorist groups, what reason does Damascus have to clash with Hamas and Hezbollah? Were it not for the pressure applied by the Reagan administration on the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Palestinian National Council would not have declared a cessation of the armed struggle against Israel and would not have adopted UN Resolution 242. Presumably Benjamin Netanyahu will not complain about pressure that the Obama administration might apply against the Palestinians; for example, to push them to recognize Israel as a state of the Jewish people.
However, the legitimacy of international pressure comes to an end when it has to do with Israeli interests, or more precisely, with what the politician at the wheel perceives as Israeli interests. Why should the European Union pressure Netanyahu to resume the negotiations on a permanent settlement? Where did this audacity come from, to condition upgrading ties with Israel on the commitment of its government to abide by a two-state solution? What are they thinking? Are we Arabs? When Israel promises the U.S. president to evacuate outposts and freeze settlement activity, it does not need any pressure to keep its promises. In our case, our word counts for something.
Like a spoiled child, Israel is in no rush to willingly surrender real estate it holds and has settled for decades. (A survey by Prof. Daniel Bar-Tal and Dr. Eran Halperin found that 53 percent of Israelis consider the West Bank liberated territory and only a minority sees it as occupied territory?.) Even though the threat of Israel becoming a binational or apartheid state increases annually, such pressure is insufficient to make it pull out of the territories. Israeli decision makers have decided to give up the territories only if the price of the status quo, in foreign currency, is much higher than the price they will have to pay in local currency for the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of settlers and the division of Jerusalem.
Obama had already announced during the campaign for the presidency that a "friend of Israel" is not, in his opinion, synonymous with being a Likud member. In his first days at the White House he has made clear that whether a two-state solution is acceptable to a Likud government or not, that is the only formula up for negotiation. Moreover, according to Quartet envoy Tony Blair, the establishment of a Palestinian state is considered a U.S. national interest in Obama's eyes. This means that pressure on Israel to end the conflict with the Arabs will certainly not disrupt efforts to pressure Iran to halt its nuclear program, and may even contribute to it.
President George W. Bush enjoyed the title "friend of Israel" because he made do with paying lip service to pressure on Israel and passed around documents that lacked teeth. He taught the Israelis that it is possible to behave contemptuously and make a laughingstock of the road map, all the while preserving a most important strategic asset - special ties with the United States. Obama has already managed to alter the rules of the game of the U.S. in the Middle East; everyone, with no exception, is welcome to choose between understandings and sanctions, between carrots and sticks.
The question is not whether Obama will pressure Israel; the pressure is already there. There were times when an invitation to an Arab leader to Washington before an invitation to an Israeli prime minister was considered a serious offense. Once a visit by an American president to a neighboring Arab state, without a promise to also come to Israel, was interpreted as serious pressure.
The repertoire of pressure available to the president of the United States is extensive and multifaceted. It looks like we will have to learn about it the hard way.

<title> Obama's choice: Truman or Marshall </title>
<date>Mon Jan 19 01:37:32 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Click here for more articles by Akiva Eldar
In March 1948, then-U.S. secretary of state George Marshall informed president Harry Truman that he personally would not vote for Truman due to the president's support for the establishment of the State of Israel. Marshall argued that this contradicted American interests and accused Truman of supporting Israel out of electoral considerations - namely, Jewish money and votes. Marshall was being a bit unfair: The Holocaust of European Jewry also affected Truman's support for the establishment of a Jewish state. At that time, the prospect of a black man entering the White House seemed like science fiction.  
Today, Barack Obama has received the votes, and the money, of about 80 percent of American Jews, even though his rival, John McCain, was more outspokenly sympathetic to the Jewish state. Israelis were the only people in the world who hoped the Republican candidate would win. The new president can thus permit himself to reexamine the "special relationship" with Israel, especially with regard to its shared values with the United States and its contribution to American interests.  
What shared values did the black American liberal observe over the last few days as he watched the broadcasts of sites bombed by Israel in the heart of the world's most densely populated region? Is it possible to expect that the memory of the horrors of the Holocaust will influence Obama's relationship with Israel? Last week, a Jewish member of Britain's parliament said his grandmother was not murdered by the Nazis in order to provide a pretext for Israeli soldiers to murder Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza.  
The spokesman for the Israeli consulate in New York boasted of the masses who attended a solidarity demonstration with the children of Sderot. He did not mention the masses of Jews who do not know where to hide their shame at the sight of pictures of Palestinian men weeping bitterly over the families who perished under the ruins of their houses.  
Israeli spokesmen try to cope with the values question by using the following question/argument: "Would the United States have restrained itself in the face of ongoing rocket fire from Mexico at its children, in its sovereign territory?" It is hard to believe that such a comparison will make any impression on an intelligent man like Obama. Mexico is not under an American aerial and naval blockade, nor is it considered occupied territory under international law. The U.S. Army and American settlers have not controlled parts of Mexico for the past 41 years (and the United States was a guarantor of the Oslo Accords, which stated that Gaza and the West Bank constitute a single political entity).  
As for Israel's contribution to American interests, the second component of the "special relationship," this has been in doubt for years. Every time Jews kill Arabs in the territories, American flags are burned in Egypt and Jordan. In both of its wars against Iraq, the United States managed (or failed to manage) without Israel's help, and even thanked it for remaining on the sidelines. And fear of the pro-Israel lobby sometimes compels the administration and Congress to subordinate their policy to Israel, in violation of American interests. There is no better example of this than the restraint displayed by the last two U.S. administrations toward the ongoing expansion of the settlements, which utterly contradicts the Oslo process, the road map peace plan and the Annapolis declaration.  
Obama has two choices. First, he can let the Israelis bleed and kill all the way to an ostracized apartheid state, observing from the sidelines as Israel endangers peace in the Middle East and undermines his country's interests, just as George Marshall predicted. The second option is to stand at Israel's side in its struggle to achieve peace and maintain its Jewish and moral character en route to regional acceptance, which has been offered by 22 Arab states. Or in other words, to finish Truman's work.

<title>On praising Tel Aviv and its wonders </title>
<date>Wed Jun 17 02:17:32 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
As the first Hebrew city celebrates its centennial, there are patriots and nationalists in this country who are disrespectful to one of the greatest achievements of the Zionist revolution. The coarse remarks by Shlomi Katabi, the outgoing police commander of the Judea and Samaria District, in condemnation of Tel Aviv are an example of this deplorable trend. On the other hand, it has also become fashionable to declare Tel Aviv an island of sanity and enlightenment in the dark sea of fanaticism called the State of Israel. "Tel Aviv is the oasis of normalcy in an insane country," Gideon Levy replied to Katabi ("Yes, we do drink espresso," Haaretz English Edition, June 7).  
And how exactly does this realm of normality manage to exist in the very heart of an insane country? What is preventing the state from imposing its madness on the stubborn city? Who is protecting Tel Aviv and preventing its occupation by Jewish nationalism, which, as everyone knows, hungers for conquests? United Nations forces? Perhaps the forces of the Arab League?  
After all, this is no remote corner, but rather the country's economic and cultural center. Shouldn't this influence one's take on Israeli society and government? Of course, the very claim that all the enlightenment in Israel is concentrated in Tel Aviv - and that beyond its boundaries only darkness and fanaticism prevail - is neither enlightened nor liberal nor multicultural. Let us, however, assume for purposes of this discussion that the forces of darkness have prevailed in every place in Israel except for Tel Aviv; why haven't they vanquished Tel Aviv itself?  
In the 20th century there were a number of liberal cities that found themselves under the control of a benighted nationalist regime. Berlin had been known as Red Berlin. It was controlled by the Social Democrats and culturally, it was a tolerant, progressive and cosmopolitan city with a prominent Jewish presence. Berlin remained neither red nor cosmopolitan after January of 1933.  
Cape Town was once a liberal and pluralist city, in South African terms; the Cape Province even gave blacks the right to vote. However, after the nationalists came into power and imposed apartheid, those laws also applied to Cape Town.  
Alexandria, too, was once an open, tolerant, multi-ethnic and multicultural city - until it felt the touch of Arab nationalism. But today, the Egyptian city is what Gamal Abdel Nasser made of it.  
Tel Aviv, however, blossomed, flourished and became more and more modern and liberal precisely during the years when the country's elite opinion makers decided that Israel is at one and the same time a fascist state and a third-world country, as well as being the only third-world country that it is permissible to call fascist.  
There is, of course, something unique about Tel Aviv, but during those years of the city's flourishing, the entire country also became freer. The recent outrageous proposals aimed at imprisoning those who reject Zionist ideology will fail. They will not alter the reality that Israeli citizens are freer today to curse and execrate their country than they were in 1967 or in 1977 - and in this we take pride.  
Jerusalem was shaped only in part by Zionism and the State of Israel; Tel Aviv, however, is the handiwork of the Zionist revolution, and its purest expression. Anyone who rejects the Zionist project in principle should not glorify Tel Aviv, since the city represents not only Zionism's achievements, but also its price. Those who praise Tel Aviv praise Israel and the national movement that established it. One should know what one is praising.

<title>Please, with might </title>
<date>Sun May 17 02:25:27 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
The headline of this piece may be taken from a Kabbalistic prayer, but it's not aimed at God; this is rather an earthly plea to the American president. The statesman he will be hosting tomorrow has already shown during his brief tenure that might is the only language he understands. We should hope that Barack Obama will succeed just like the defense minister and the Histadrut labor federation chairman, who twisted Benjamin Netanyahu's arm in the budget deliberations.  
A political U-turn by the prime minister is much more vital to Israel than his impressively sharp economic U-turn. Obama is the final hope: Only if he throws his entire weight into the process will anything in the Middle East start moving. Any American president could have long ago brought about substantial progress, first and foremost ending the intolerable Israeli occupation. But Obama's predecessors shrank from the task, preferring to yield to the Jewish and Christian lobbies and to engage in masquerades of negotiations leading nowhere.  
A whole lot more is expected from Obama: "Change" in the Middle East; "Yes We Can" is also about Israel. This change must encompass two components: Genuinely pressuring Israel - and no, there isn't any other way - and demanding actions rather than words. We've had plenty of the latter, and it doesn't really matter if Netanyahu utters the words "two states" or if he does not.  
The real test is Moshe and Mohammed. Only if both of them feel a change can we say a truly different president is now in Washington. Mohammed, any Mohammed living in the occupied territories, should feel his life has become more free and prosperous; Moshe, any Moshe living in Israel, must feel he is withdrawing from being an occupier, after two successive generations. At the end of the day, both Moshe and Mohammed will be grateful to Barack Obama.  
It'll take more than sticky smiles. Netanyahu will be clinging to his usual excuse, the Iranian threat; Obama will have to explain that there is nothing like neutralizing the Arab-Israeli conflict to secure the future of the State of Israel. And this should be the order of the day, too: resolving the Palestinian issue as leverage for negotiating with Iran, even if Netanyahu tries to change the agenda and buy some time. Deep inside, we yearn for an Israeli prime minister who realizes that opportunities are running out and that the alternatives are dangerous, but this hope has long since been abandoned. Israel talks two states while expanding Ma'aleh Adumim; Israel talks peace and sets out on two unneccesary wars.  
Which is why, sadly, nothing will happen without pressure, and true pressure can come only from Washington. An American president who is a friend to Israel not only can, but must, apply this pressure; Israel is a protectorate addicted to occupation - and the only way to ditch a habit is the hard way. A bogus friend sponsors the addiction, a true friend gets us into rehab.  
Nor is this the time to present the Palestinians with endless demands or preconditions - to acknowledge, to give up, to compromise. They've done it plenty over the last two decades: Now is the time for the occupier to end the occupation, immediately, unconditionally, moments before the two-state solution draws its final breath and passes beyond the realm of possibility, if it hasn't already. Which is why Obama should be standing with a stopwatch, too: Time is running out.  
There's one message that should emerge from Washington: Israel is beginning to act, not to talk but to act, to end the occupation. Freeze the settlements without any lies, dismantle the outposts without tricks, give Palestinians freedoms without feints, and establish a rigid agenda to dismantle the entire settler enterprise. Anything less will be seen as failure, any move less daring will ensure a deadlock that will bring more bloodshed and the eventual establishment of a permanent binational apartheid state.  
Does it sound big and pretentious? Well, there's a big, pretentious president now sitting in Washington. The Arabs have already learned that Israel understands force and force alone; all its limited concessions were carried out after bloodshed, never before. It's time Washington learns the same lesson: Please, with might, Barack Obama, because there is no other way.

<title>Protesting with a prize in their hands </title>
<date>Mon Oct 12 07:16:01 IST 2009</date>
<content>
The Tel Aviv municipality's decision to award the Dizengoff Prize to artist David Reeb has stirred up protests and calls that the award be rescinded after it turned out that Reeb has called for sanctions on Israel and signed a petition against events honoring Tel Aviv at Toronto's film festival. According to the petition, identifying with Tel Aviv is the same as identifying with white Johannesburg in the apartheid era.  
The protests were duly rejected, of course. As a rule, from the moment a competent panel awards a prize out of professional considerations, attempts to have the decision rescinded for political reasons should be avoided. Liberal democracy today not only tolerates, but even pampers and embraces its denouncers.  
It may be infuriating and a little perverse, but on the whole liberal democracy is a good deal. There's no need to get worked up over the abuse leveled by radical prize winners, the establishment's spoiled brats. The question is not why the Israeli establishment decides sometimes to reward people who depict Israel as a fascist apartheid state, but rather why people who depict Israel that way are prepared to accept prizes and honors from the establishment of such a state. What does it say about them, their integrity, honesty and seriousness?
Who's heard of an Italian anti-fascist who received a prize from Benito Mussolini? What would we say about the sincerity and self-respect of such a person? Did the opponents of apartheid in South Africa get prizes and honors from the government? Certainly not. And my grandfather, who was a revolutionary anarchist in Czarist Russia, never received any awards from Nicholas II for his activities. There wasn't a single revolutionary on the committee organizing the celebrations of the Romanov dynasty's anniversary in 1913.
Clearly, these repressive regimes did not offer their opponents awards and honors like today's liberal governments. Even South Africa, which was less harsh to its white critics, certainly didn't pamper them. The Israeli establishment's conduct in this regard attests to the liberal and democratic nature of this country's system of government.  
Of course, the radical left won't acknowledge this. Some of its supporters see the root of all evil in the very fact that the Jewish people have a state of their own. They are generally unwilling to say anything favorable about this country. Others refer to the evil perpetrated by the government. And indeed, the evil of which they speak does exist, in the form of the occupation and Israel's contribution to its perpetuation - the settlements.  
The refusal on the radical left to deal seriously with the Palestinians' contribution, with the threats Israel faces, or with the evil latent in Arab nationalism and Islamic fundamentalism creates a picture of reality that is more a lie than truth, but it is impossible to say there is no truth in it. In such a situation, we cannot expect that everyone will accept authoritative definitions regarding the political reality or even the Israeli government. We can only expect all people who adopt a certain definition - including a radical one - to be consistent and honest with themselves.  
Whoever wishes, therefore, can argue, however groundless it may be in my opinion, that a unique and sophisticated form of fascism has evolved in Israel, one that does not prevent the establishment from embracing its denouncers. And still the question remains, why are these denouncers willing to accept the establishment's pampering? No one can expect people to give up their livelihoods - even an anti-fascist has to eat - but what about prizes and honors? Sartre rejected the Nobel Prize without calling the people who offered it to him fascists. Even in the eyes of those who claim that Israeli fascism is real, despite its liberal attitude to its political opponents, it must be clear that Israeli anti-fascism is phony.

<title>The binationalism vogue </title>
<date>Thu Apr 30 01:02:26 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Judging by the increasing number of symposia around the world devoted to promoting a binational state instead of two states for two peoples, a sea change is underway among academics and organizations engaged in progressive thinking.  
A generation ago, the demand for establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel expressed a radical, post-Zionist stance. Now that this position has been deemed acceptable by the heart of the establishment, and even serves as the platform of centrist political parties, the circles that fought for it are distancing themselves from it. In its stead has come talk of a binational state.  
Is a new trend taking shape? And are those who adhere to the old formula in danger of losing their position as the leaders of progressive thinking? Will the skeptics and naysayers opposed to a binational state today claim in a few years that they always favored this approach?  
Without a doubt, the intense interest is not solely academic or intellectual in nature. The steep decline in Israel's standing in the wake of its violent actions has spurred attempts to undermine the legitimacy of the Jewish state - and even the legitimacy of the Jewish collective in Israel - by advocating a binational formula. Those hostile to Israel have discovered that the call for one state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, a state based on civil and collective equality, is a powerful propaganda tool, because it is based on universal norms that enable critics to denounce Israel as an apartheid state.  
Israelis who seek to earnestly examine various models that could serve as the basis of a future sovereign entity at times find themselves being used as fig leaves to cover up efforts to spread anti-Israel propaganda. But this is always the lot of those who pursue new avenues. We should not rule out participating in such a discussion by denouncing it as illegitimate, because it is taking place in the shadow of the reality that has taken hold in the territories and in the midst of a diplomatic stalemate.  
Several factors have combined to rouse greater interest in the binational option. First, there is a growing realization that the chances of establishing an independent, viable Palestinian state no longer exist, aside from an entity along the lines of a Bantustan. Second, the status quo that has emerged, though it appears chaotic, is in practice quite stable and could be characterized as de facto binational. Third, the diplomatic positions of Benjamin Netanyahu's government inevitably lead to a diplomatic deadlock and a deepening of the policy of annexation.  
Under these circumstances, it appears that the continued preoccupation with establishing a Palestinian state is not just hopeless, but also injurious, since the delusions that it fosters enable the continuation of the status quo.  
Nothing serves the interests of Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman better than the demand that they recognize the principle of "two states." What happens if they agree to it? They do not intend to offer the Palestinians any proposals more generous than those Mahmoud Abbas already turned down in talks with Ehud Olmert. And in the meantime, they would have a free hand to expand settlements. Even the impassioned pleas for the Obama administration to finally enforce the "road map" lead to the same smokescreen of imagined progress toward a dead end.  
But if the fictitious option is taken off the table, the real dilemmas will finally be revealed. And this is precisely what the talk of a binational state seeks to accomplish.  
It is customary to classify people as belonging to either the left or the right on the basis of their positions toward "the Arabs," with the standard litmus test being a person's position on a Palestinian state. But take away this acid test, and after a short period of confusion, people's real positions on issues such as civic equality and the right to determine one's own future will be revealed. And then, to our amazement, left-wingers will be exposed as rightists and vice versa.  
But in any event, discussion about a binational state should not be of interest only to the radical left. For if the two-state option melts away, the burden of coping with a binational reality will fall on all of us.

<title>The carrot's moment has arrived </title>
<date>Tue Jun 16 01:12:48 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
After Israel conquered Sinai in 1956, the United States allowed David Ben-Gurion to make his speech about the "Third Kingdom of Israel." The Americans then sent the Israel Defense Forces quickly back to their tents. Had the Americans also wanted to resolve the conflict in 1967, they would have gotten Israel out of the territories four or five wars ago, with the same ease with which they coerced Yitzhak Rabin's first government into the first separation-of-forces agreement with Egypt. But the years went by, the dead were buried, the disabled have covered many long kilometers in their wheelchairs, the American peace plans have continued to create hopes, and the United States has not expelled Israel from the Palestinian territories.  
In his memoirs, Henry Kissinger boasts how he pulled the wool over Andrei Gromyko's eyes when the Soviet foreign minister thought the Geneva conference after the 1973 war would bring a comprehensive solution agreed on by the great powers. The Palestinian question would be included. Kissinger also boasts how he put together, behind the Soviets' backs, the disengagement agreements between Egypt and Israel in anticipation of a partial and separate peace. This is the key to reading the region's history.  
A withdrawal by us from the territories was always the American carrot. A carrot is accompanied by a stick, and over the years it was an Israeli stick, to the joy of our security elite (an inseparable part of the state's leadership since 1967). For example, there were the bombings deep inside Egypt of cities and their residents, factories and even a school during study hours. This happened without pity, without the High Court of Justice, without B'Tselem.  
The system worked. In less than 30 years, the entire Middle East, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, underwent a pro-Western change, except for the Syrians (who have not yet received their territories). In 1967, on the eve of the occupation, the United States was at its lowest point in the region. The three secular regimes - Egypt, Iraq and Syria - were closer than ever to the Soviet Union, and no one serious would guarantee the existence of the two feudal regimes - Jordan and Saudi Arabia.  
The turning point came with the Israeli victory. Today the Middle East is not merely poorer, it is fragmented, beaten and fundamentalist, and Israel has apparently completed its role. The fact that it identified itself as an ally and not a stick, and the fact that talk about withdrawal was always seen as an edict that did not necessarily have to be met is part of our tragedy in which the return to the 1967 borders and an independent Palestinian state have never been considered by the majority as being in our interest. And this is without any connection to the American policy that for many years did not favor a Palestinian state and therefore did not really oppose the settlements.  
Now it seems the shrunken peace camp is again waiting for the sheriff to release us from the imbroglio created by our governments - settlements, taking over the Palestinian water economy and integrating the West Bank into Israel (without integrating its subjects).  
If U.S. President Barack Obama indeed plans to solve the conflict, the carrot's great moment has arrived. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech stuttered despite all its fluency and sweated from being so dry. He seemed to be waiting for the moment in which, within the American agglomeration of interests, the U.S. religious right would strengthen, led by Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin and the military industries, the greatest beneficiaries of the special relations with Israel (like our military elite, which has been living in a fool's paradise since 1967).  
The Israeli war machine has apparently done its job and can now close shop. Already in the 1991 Gulf War, it was hinted that the IDF should keep its equipment and weapons empire for policing the towns and villages in the occupied territories, or for harsh strikes in Lebanon (until it becomes completely Westernized). Over the decades, this machine has turned us into a nation that lives by the sword, drugged as if its power were unlimited. It's a nation that protects a system for building settlements that is nothing more than an apartheid state.  
No one will free us from the labyrinth if we do not do it ourselves. For that we need to be ready for a confrontation as well. Certainly not to build a national consensus around "large settlement blocs."

<title>The covenant for the land </title>
<date>Sun Dec 20 01:12:20 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Since the first half of the 20th century, it has been impossible to speak of obedience to the rule of law as a supreme value, but important in this respect regarding the settlers, their rabbis and soldiers is not disobedience but the entire concept of sovereignty. The sovereign, from their standpoint, is not the electorate. A proclamation by the Greater Land of Israel movement already in 1967, in the name of which Yitzhak Rabin would be murdered years later, said the following: "Inasmuch as we have no authority to relinquish the State of Israel, we are also commanded to maintain what we received from it [the state] - the Land of Israel .... And no Israeli government is entitled to relinquish this as an integral whole."  
This stance is linked in its very essence to Zionism's "secular" roots. The signatories to that proclamation by the Greater Land of Israel, some of whom came from the left, defined themselves then as right-wingers - it was a distinction that began after 1967 as an answer to the implied question "Who is the sovereign?" While the settlers talk about their consciences, the interviewers stammer because they think there's a difference between religious and secular people in this context. In fact, a different question should be asked: On what basis did these messianic people obtain their great power, and what is the connection between the Labor movement's Land of Israel and the settlers?  
The time has come to acknowledge that the most important undertaking of the State of Israel, within narrow or expanded borders, has always been to maintain the supremacy of the Jews. In the 1950s, when looting Arab land was at its height, even Marxists were assigned to do the job. The role only passed to the right wing when, after 1967, the task became replete with contradictions, and the contradictions could only be resolved with the help of the Almighty, the Holy One Blessed Be He, and his militarist representatives. In any event, to this day, when the secular elite collaborates in excluding the Arabs, the state has no need for settlers or the hesder yeshivas that combine Torah study with military service.  
For example, at the University of Haifa, 20 percent of the students are Arab, but the faculty that very much enjoys its privileges is purely Jewish, if one overlooks the few who are not. But here there is no concern about compromising Jewish hegemony and redistributing wealth as a result of changed demographics. The hedonistic elite continues to collaborate with apartheid. The University of Haifa will not pursue any kind of affirmative action, but its people will feel disgust for the hesder yeshivas.  
Thus, when the country has no better representatives than academics, yuppies who move to Jaffa, residents of purely Jewish communities from the Galilee who work in Haifa, only then does the state summon its messianism and its violent soldiers.  
For example, in mixed Jewish-Arab towns, instead of telling the Arab residents that they can't surpass a 30 percent presence (which is apparently the quota in those cities), they give rights to a yeshiva, which discovers ancient Jewish roots - even in Acre, where it is not clear when the city was Jewish. They then make the Arabs' lives miserable until the Arabs move to Arab villages that the country's modern infrastructure has bypassed.  
There is nothing here that some future historian could not explain as the absolute logic of a systematic state effort at gradual expulsion, either in the occupied territories or within the state's borders, each area at its own pace. All you have to do is examine infant-mortality figures or the education budget in the Arab community in Israel to understand that there is no conflict between Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Rabbi Eliezer Melamed of the Har Bracha hesder yeshiva, who called on soldiers to disobey orders to remove settlers. This is the true historic covenant, whether in Nablus or Jaffa or Haifa.

<title>The 'guardians' of Israeli academia </title>
<date>Fri Oct 23 01:53:19 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Israeli academics are being watched. Vigilantes check what they say or write - and, if they are judged "anti-Israel," incite donors to the universities and colleges where they teach to act against them. Students are encouraged to spy on their teachers and to report what they say.  
Academics on the left are the targets. They are vilified as "Israel's academic fifth column" and "our inner scourge." They are called "traitors" and are accused of "treasonous betrayal" and of wanting "to suck up to and be accepted by the enemy."  
One vigilante group is Israel Academia Monitor (IAM) started five years ago by the American-born Dana Barnett. Another is IsraCampus, which does not reveal who its organizers are although many of its articles are written by Seth J. Frantzman, also from the United States.  
Prof. David Newman, of the department of politics and government at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU), who has been a target for attack, warns: "The academic McCarthyism of the right endangers Israeli democracy and society. It threatens the very basis of freedom of speech."  
Newman, who has spent the past three years working informally on behalf of Israel's universities against the academic boycott attempts in Europe, sees these so-called watchdog groups as causing as much harm to Israel's academic community and reputation as the Israel boycotters themselves.  
Both IAM and IsraCampus say they are modeled after Campus Watch in the United States, which is controversial for its monitoring of Middle East studies at American universities and of academics who are critical of Israel.  
Barnett sends out near-daily e-mails fingering and quoting named academics, and decides when protest and dissent are "anti-Israel." Every e-mail ends by asking the recipient: "Are you a donor to Israeli universities? Learn about what is happening on Israeli campuses." She urges donors to know "what is being done with your gifts and generosity" and to "speak about anti-Israel Israeli academics when you are in touch with university officials." She does not say who funds her work. She has acknowledged in a newspaper interview that "most of them are from abroad," and claims they are "Zionists with a love of Israel."  
The vigilantes totally attack any boycotts from abroad of Israel. But they want to use boycotts against the Israeli academics they condemn. They do not seem aware of the obvious contradiction in their stance.  
Inevitably, Dr. Neve Gordon, the BGU political science lecturer who has been in the headlines for urging a boycott of Israel, is a particular target for them: IAM has for weeks now been soliciting signatures for a petition urging that he be dismissed as chair of the politics and government department and from any university committee, that all his courses be made electives rather than required, and that he be denied travel and research funding.  
The response from international academic networks has not been long in coming. Respected academics throughout the world are said to have written letters to BGU President Rivka Carmi and to the Israel Academy of Sciences, protesting this attempt to infringe on the freedom of speech.  
The vigilantes have also gone after Israeli academics who expressed support for Gordon.  
Their net of condemnation is cast wide, and includes: Iaroslav Youssim, of the School of Social Work of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who was listed after circulating an invitation to a weekly "Stand Up for Jerusalem" march against Israel's occupation policies in the city. Dr. Kobi Snitz, professor of mathematics at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, is listed for having served 20 days' in jail for trying to prevent soldiers from demolishing a house in a Palestinian village as well as other activities, such as "support[ing] Palestinian struggle against Israel." Also Dr. David Shulman, of the Hebrew University department of comparative religions, was named after writing about a court case in which colleagues were acquitted on charges of disorderly behavior during a protest. Former foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, a former head of Tel Aviv University's history department, is listed for his review, in Foreign Affairs magazine, of Benny Morris' history of the 1948 war.  
IAM got itself into a knot, however, over the call by Tova Rosen, of BGU's Hebrew literature department, and many others for civil disobedience against three antidemocratic Knesset bills. IAM acknowledged that civil disobedience was a "time-honored expression of protest in democracies." But in classic McCarthyite style it added a dark warning that the "Communist Party" was involved in this particular case - even though it said it did not know what role, if any, the party played.  
IsraCampus has what it calls a "Rogues Gallery," with scores of names. Who are these dangerous people? They include many of Israel's most distinguished intellectuals: Amoz Oz ("and his ilk") features, as does historian and Haaretz journalist Tom Segev ("anti-Israel Israeli"), plus educator and feminist Dr. Alice Shalvi and Prof. Mordechai Kremnitzer, of the Hebrew University's Faculty of Law.  
No doubt the vigilantes view themselves as super-patriots serving Israel's interests. The opposite is true. They are dangerous cranks. The crude censorship they use to shut up academics runs counter to the most cherished beliefs about freedom of speech in Western democracies. They undermine Israel's status as a democracy.  
Benjamin Pogrund is a South African-born journalist who learned about academic freedom as a student, fighting against the imposition of apartheid on universities.

<title>The princess and Ivan the Terrible </title>
<date>Fri Feb 06 01:46:26 IST 2009</date>
<content>
This is not the title of a children's book but one that sums up the situation today, as we head for the 18th Knesset elections on Tuesday. On the one hand, we are facing colossal defense, economic and social problems, and on the other, a political rift. No matter what government comes to power, it will be led by a prime minister who has won by the tiniest of margins and a defense minister who doesn't understand how he it that he did not wind up back in the prime minister's seat, considering what a genius he is.  
This government will also have a coalition partner who will kick himself at the thought that an inexperienced princess has beat him, by a mere hairsbreadth, and all the while Avigdor Lieberman will be hovering in the background, spewing venom and threatening to turn Israel into a binational state.  
And then the question will arise of whether this government is capable of handling the challenges posed by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Will it have the power to carry out withdrawals and evacuate tens of thousands of settlers? With all the hot air and hatemongering at home, all we have done is confuse ourselves to death. With less than a week to go before the elections, the vote is totally splintered and everyone is at each other's throat.  
The Likud is attacking Kadima and Labor, but wants Ehud Barak for defense minister without Labor. Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu is dreaming of a world without Kadima.   
Barak himself is dying to be prime minister, and out of frustration is attacking Tzipi Livni as unsuitable for the job.  
And let's not forget that he was the one who threw the wrench into the works when Livni tried to form a new coalition and avoid going to the polls, with his batty demands to be acting prime minister and have the Knesset pass a law that the head of the opposition doesn't have to be a Knesset member. With the delay Barak caused with his bizarre requests, he pushed Shas into clamoring for money and issuing ultimatums over Jerusalem.  
Many people complain that Livni didn't make proper use of the 10 days left to her to put together a government, so it was her fault we had to go to early elections.   
In my opinion, Livni only proved her worth: She showed us that she is a determined and principled politician, not a political hack and horsetrader.  
Livni is not a backslapper or a sweet-talker. She is serious about her missions - the ones she took on herself or those Olmert doled out to her with intentional stinginess, so she wouldn't hog too much of the limelight. She did not complain, but rather  carried out her duties with skill and dedication.  
If some secret "jury" has popped up a few minutes before Election Day and decided to lop off her head through the auspices of my colleague Ari Shavit ("A Cautionary Note," Haaretz, February 2), I tip my hat to her. These guys are scared. Two macho men, otherwise known as Netanyahu and Barak, who both failed as prime minister, don't want to see her being elected and becoming their boss. What they have to say about her does not appear under their name in this verdict.  
Now, about this person who was "especially agitated despite being a mature, restrained and conservative man," and told Shavit he felt like "a member of some cult with a terrible secret: Tzipi Livni is not fit to be prime minister" - what I want to know is why he and the others kept their mouths shut until a week before the elections. What are they afraid of? That little Tzipi the weakling will have them executed?  
The outcome of these elections must be the establishment of a different kind of government. The last three years will be remembered as a grim era in Israeli political history. Since the Netanyahu administration, no prime minister has gone through office without a police investigation. A former finance minister is on trial. A senior minister was found guilty of an indecent act and did not appeal.  
And we haven't even gotten yet to the bungled Second Lebanon War, or to Operation Cast Lead, for which Israeli ministers and generals may face indictment for crimes against humanity, and which may have put an end to terror, but then again, maybe did not.  
Kadima, when Ariel Sharon established it, was an innovative party with a fresh new outlook and hope for the future, based on the idea of two states for two peoples. A few days before the 2001 elections, a well-known columnist wrote why Israel must not let Sharon become prime minister. His arguments were convincing. Next thing we knew, he was Sharon's great defender, hailing him as the best thing that ever happened to us.  
Tzipi Livni is not Sharon, but she wrote the party platform at his ranch, and was his loyal helpmate all along. When she won the Kadima party nomination for prime minister, the public greeted her victory with approval and optimism.  
To her credit, let it be said that long before Lieberman popped up with his demands to take away the citizenship of a million and a half Israeli Arabs, and Netanyahu tried to rebrand the Likud as a centrist party, Livni supported the establishment of a unity government with Likud and Labor on the grounds that "the left isn't so left anymore and the right isn't so right."  
A 20-percent abstention equals dozens of seats, which could neutralize Liebermanism. Tzipi and Netanyahu would do well to join forces in a new government that will tackle both the problems of peace and the demon that is turning the country into a bastion of apartheid.  
Lieberman, like Kahane, must remain outside.

<title>The real face of Tisha B'Av </title>
<date>Sun Aug 02 01:21:18 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Israel makes a lot of fuss about Jerusalem, much more than most countries make about their capitals. Nevertheless, most Israelis don't live in Jerusalem if they can help it, just like the elites zooming down the highway to Tel Aviv at the end of a workday.  
It's easy, of course, to blame the ultra-Orthodox (the "Jews" in the Israeli version of anti-Semitism), but the truth is that our capital is a city of memorials at the military cemetery on Mount Herzl, Israel Prize ceremonies, visits to the President's Residence, Yad Vashem delegations, ugly government offices and nouveau-riche-looking central bank and Supreme Court buildings. Above all, there's the monument to idiocy known as the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University, whose construction aptly demonstrates not only blindness to West Jerusalem's urban interests, but a preference for control over love of ancient landscapes. It is also a stark illustration of the academic elite's impotence, as early as the 1970s, when they were told that we "must return to Mount Scopus". Why? Because.  
In the evenings, the city that does the most begging in the world does not resemble a capital city. The money flowing to cultural institutions and foundations to host national and international conferences produces a living for ushers and clerks more than it produces any life in the city. And most of all, that symbol built in concrete - the wall - is becoming increasingly cruel to the Palestinian residents, living under an apartheid regime. What value do the Jerusalem Film Festival or Adenauer Foundation conferences have when the Shin Bet security service arrests Palestinian guests at conferences debating their own literature and cinema?  
The wall, not the one brought down to the tunes of Naomi Shemer and Rabbi Shlomo Goren, but the one cut into the Palestinians' living flesh, separates fathers from sons, believers from places of worship, West Bank Palestinians from their cultural centers - theaters, bookstores and libraries, not to mention the long-since-stolen Rockefeller Museum.  
And still, the city we're all supposed to salute as a highly-touted symbol ("freedom of worship for all," "the city of three religions," "the eternal capital of the Jewish people") has not managed over the past 42 years to become a sacred value in its own right. Even Jerusalem Day, for all the propaganda around it, is no real holiday, compared to Independence Day or Hanukkah. Why? Well, just look at the euphoria of the national-religious community, which made Jerusalem Day into everything the secular (and Haredi) Jews never subscribed to, an omen of messianic redemption spanning from the prayer book to Almighty God and then back to construction plans and the Shin Bet.  
When the city was "united," no Zionist party could be found to oppose the annexation. Quite the contrary, they all got up to sing "Hatikva." Like antiwar protests, the talk about dividing the city comes too late: The devastation is already upon its victims. United Jerusalem demonstrates better than anything else the distance between the left, or secular, public and its leaders. The leaders always rushed to make "right-wing" decisions, assuming the electorate would have to bear with it. David Ben-Gurion was closer to Zeev Jabotinsky than to his constituents; Moshe Dayan was closer to Menachem Begin than to his voters. And for most of his years as prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin was bitterly, grudgingly alienated from Peace Now.  
Jerusalem Day is heavily promoted every year. But on the eve of Tisha B'Av, Tel Aviv, too, seemed like a worldlier Jerusalem - empty and mourning not the Temple, but the blandness of national life, characterized by a separation wall.

<title>There's a party missing </title>
<date>Tue Feb 10 01:53:43 IST 2009</date>

Click here for exclusive Haaretz coverage of the Israel elections
In our political reality, left and right are divided over their positions on the conflict. On the left, you support the peace process and recognize that this requires withdrawal from territory and concessions. On the right, you talk about security and oppose the evacuation of even the smallest settlement.  
But what about those citizens who believe in a peaceful solution but also believe in a free-market economy? That voter has no party representing him.  
If he wants to vote for Meretz, a party whose worldview for years has called for two states for two peoples, without the vacillations of Labor, the package includes a socialist worldview that backs big government, a bloated budget, high taxes and the belief that the central authority knows best what the citizen should do with his money.  
If he wants to vote for a party that represents liberal economics, he needs to support Benjamin Netanyahu, who believes in the free market, in privatization, in reducing taxes and in spurring growth.  
How is it possible to vote with a single ballot both for Jumas (Haim Oron, head of Meretz) and for Bibi? After all, there is no such party, even though a combination of Oron in politics and Netanyahu in economics makes sense to me. There's a solid common denominator here: freedom, equality and economic prosperity for all.  
At the root of the two-state notion lies the belief that the other side has the right to a normal life, to an independent state, in which life is free, liberated from the chains of occupation. This is a liberal approach that believes that all humans are equal, and that which you hate you should not do to your neighbor. Because if this is not the case, you will always have to live by the sword.  
This is also the view of liberal economics, which supports a free market in which an individual lives by the fruit of his labor, and the government intervenes as little as possible and causes the least amount of damage and disorder. Under such an economic regime an individual assumes responsibilities and gains the maximum amount of freedom and the highest possible standard of living.  
A free-market economy means limiting the national budget, thus lowering taxes, which is the best way to fuel growth. We have seen in recent years how the budget was curtailed and taxes lowered, resulting in rapid growth of 5 percent per year and in 500,000 people joining the workforce. Factories opened, and business flourished. Is there a more important social contribution than taking the unemployed and providing them with jobs? It is also worth noting that 80 percent of those newly joining the workforce came from the lower classes.  
A free-market economy does not mean complete nonintervention. The government is obligated to intervene and support the weak, the handicapped, the elderly, the unemployed and the sick. But this is possible only when the economy operates according to free-market principles. Because then there is growth, and there are resources to support the needy.  
But where can one find a party that holds dear a liberal view in both politics and socioeconomics? The one closest to this worldview is Tzipi Livni. She is the only one who is talking about peace as a strategic goal. Livni has also not hesitated to talk about the dove of peace that is sitting on the window ledge. We can be cynical about her statements, as if she is only talking peace as a campaign tactic to woo center-left voters to Kadima. But this would be wrong. Livni was among the leaders of the ideological rift with Likud that led to leaving that party and establishing Kadima. She supported the evacuation of settlers from the Gaza Strip in recognition that the dream of a greater Land of Israel has passed, and it is necessary to reach an agreement on dividing the land, including evacuating settlements; for if this is not done the nightmare of an apartheid state, or of one in which the Arab minority becomes the majority, will come true.  
In socioeconomics, Livni also shares a liberal worldview. She believes in a compassionate free-market economy. She believes in lowering taxes and in reforms. While she is not passionate about it the way Netanyahu is, we have already noted that we can't have everything.  
Livni has two other important qualities. She has proven to be honest. Her record is spotless, and that is no small thing these days. And she has also not yet failed as prime minister like Netanyahu and Ehud Barak.  
So, while our political spectrum lacks a party reflecting the full synthesis between Jumas and Bibi, the closest to it is Livni.

<title>The silence of the left </title>
<date>Mon Dec 07 02:56:12 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Forty-one years after it declared that it is incumbent on Israel to recognize "the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people" and that "the territories held by Israel will be a bargaining chip in peace negotiations," the Israeli left has fallen silent.  
Its political frameworks have collapsed. Its protest has all but ceased to exist. Whether it concluded its historic role, or passed before its time, the Labor Party collapsed, taking with it the entire left.  
One by one, its leaders have also disappeared. They have ensconced themselves in research laboratories, libraries, writing desks, boardrooms and classrooms. They have sentenced themselves to self-imposed political exile in their homes. They have found consolation in a good book, in their children and in their grandchildren.  
It was the left that outlined the principles and paved the way toward an agreement with the Palestinians. Now, as Israel reaches a crossroads between two states for two peoples on the one hand and a bi-national state on the other; between a democratic state with borders and an apartheid state; between an agreement and yet another conflagration in the Middle East, this same left remains silent.  
It is silent to the extent that one needs to peer closely to see whether it is even still breathing. Perhaps this does not bother Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak. It might even be convenient for them, but it is bad for Israel. Because when the left is silent, what needs to be said once we have reached that crossroads is not heard.  
How long will it take before international organizations and institutions that clung to the Israeli voice of reason make the decision to push us into the margin of the international community?  
It was not easy, to say the least, to demonstrate 30 and 40 years ago against Golda Meir's "there is no such thing as a Palestinian people." The tyranny of settler leader Rabbi Moshe Levinger and Co. against the Arabs of the West Bank, the theft of their lands and the torching of their crops and the policy of successive Israeli governments, all were difficult to challenge.  
The only blows I absorbed in my life were from the batons of police officers during protests in Hebron, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as well as from the fists of two individuals who ambushed me in front of the entrance to my apartment in Tel Aviv. They left behind pamphlets which read "Down with the traitors."  
This struggle, which was inevitable, exhausting and devoid of any hint of martyrdom, is without a doubt the longest and most difficult struggle waged in Israel from 1968 to the present day.  
One would need a whole series of articles to explain the discrepancy between the acceptance of the slogan "two states for two peoples" into the national consensus and the attendant collapse of the left; between Labor's capturing 44 Knesset seats under Rabin, while Meretz got 12 seats when headed by Shulamit Aloni in 1992, and the fiasco of the recent elections in which Labor mustered just 13 seats while Meretz captured just three.  
The left has not survived the "war of attrition" it has waged since 1968. Its claim that its positions won the day do not hold water. It doesn't matter who is more left-wing, be it Ehud Olmert or Haim Oron or Yuli Tamir.  
What matters is whether there is a decision. And it has yet to be made. Until there is an agreement stipulating two states for two peoples, there are no winners. Not the left, not Israel, and not the Palestinians.  
In the meantime, what we have is something that may yet endure. Maybe it is an examination. Perhaps the removal of outposts. Maybe a settlement freeze. Perhaps a jumpstart of settlement construction. Maybe a process.  
All of these represent a huge question mark - which way will Netanyahu and Barak turn at the crossroads? Toward two states or toward a bi-national state? In the fourth quarter of the game, the left is floundering on the sidelines. What a pity that it is not summoning what is left of its strength in order to call on the Israeli government and the Palestinians (yes, also the Palestinians) to return to negotiations. These are our lives and theirs as well. Does anyone else have a better option?

<title>The third threat </title>
<date>Wed Sep 30 01:08:12 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Ever since its establishment, Israel has had to deal with the threat from the Arab states. At first the Arab countries put together a military force with the aim of conquering Israel. In the face of this physical threat, Israel developed a doctrine of building a force that allowed it to thwart the invasion attempts. When the enemy realized that their approach was not effective, the doctrine of "resistance" was constructed, combining activity by states and organizations.  
This doctrine is backed by the developing of teams to send steep-trajectory weapons from civilian areas into population centers in Israel. Since this threat was identified, defense officials have been working to answer it. The Second Lebanon War and Operation Cast Lead are part of the process of formulating that answer.  
In recent years, however, an additional threat has been developing. Its main thrust: attempts by pro-Arab organizations to destroy Israel's legitimacy as a political entity. There are many examples of this such, as accusations of an apartheid policy, Holocaust denial and the claim that the state's establishment was an illegal act, as well as accusations that Israel has committed war crimes. These lead to boycotts of Israeli companies and products, academic and cultural boycotts and ultimately calls to destroy the Zionist entity.
This threat is different from the previous ones - its characteristics are not physical and the areas of action are the countries of the world and their citizens. But it combines with the physical threat in an attempt to delegitimize the Israeli response to the Hamas threat. The Goldstone report, which constitutes part of it, is creating an infrastructure that supports the filing of suits abroad against top officials in the army and defense establishment. In fact, it is possible to see the two elements of the threat, the physical and political, as two parts of a complete action against Israel.  
The Defense Ministry has led the development of a response to the changing military threat to Israel. However, the threat of delegitimization is not getting the attention it needs; it is not clear who bears the overall responsibility for dealing with this and putting together a complete response doctrine. In fact, if we accept the argument that the two threats, the physical and political, are two parts of a single threat, no one out there is looking at the picture with an overall strategic vision.  
The government's decision makers have to understand that the attacks on Israel's political legitimacy are not a mere drip but a flood. The danger that this attack will in the future influence decision makers in the international community must not be ignored. To take preventive action, we must set up a framework to examine the threat and develop a comprehensive response. It seems that in the structure of the regime here, the most suitable place is the National Security Council, which can get help from the defense establishment, the Foreign Ministry, the authorities responsible for public relations, world Jewry and pro-Israel organizations.  
During its existence, Israel has been able to create a suitable response to the changing military threat. However, a response to the delegitimization of Israel also depends on the development of a strategic outlook with respect to another important factor: the faith of the country's citizens in our national existence in this land, regardless of political disagreements. Various pro-Arab bodies in the world are trying, with some success, to confuse some of the people of this country and damage their basic belief in the Jews' right to a national home in Israel. Deepening the belief in the justice of our national existence here is one of the main tools for thwarting this plot.  
The writer is head of the military research program at the Institute for National Security Studies.

<title>The year of hatred</title>
<date>Wed Aug 12 02:10:14 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Lacking an external enemy (at least so far), 2009 should be called "the year of hatred." Israeli public discourse has focused in recent months on virulent attacks on various groups: Arabs, the ultra-Orthodox, settlers, the liberal-secular. "They" are depicted as terrible enemies plotting against us, as people whose political and social power must be broken.  
This hatred is neither coincidental nor vague. It expresses a real power struggle in Israeli society, which has always been typified by factions and tribalism. Some people want to keep their positions of power, some seek a new social order. The front lines of the struggle vary according to demographics and political correctness. These days it is unacceptable to incite against Mizrahim or people from the former Soviet Union or Ethiopia. After the recent murders at the gay community center, derogatory remarks about homosexuals have been delegitimized. It's a pity that it took bloodshed.  
Although "they," the targets of the hatred, change with time and circumstances, its manifestations are identical. The side that hates purports to speak in the name of true and proper values, while "they" are described as a danger to the state's existence: the ultra-Orthodox who want a state based on Jewish law, Arabs who want a state of all its citizens, settlers who are leading to apartheid or a binational state, secular people and leftists who are abandoning Zionism to pursue hedonism.  
As support for the claim that they constitute an existential threat, "they" are depicted as parasites and law breakers who enjoy everything good the state has to offer without assuming the burdens. The ultra-Orthodox and the Arabs do not serve in the army and "do not pay taxes," the Tel Avivians evade military service or do not join combat units, the settlers cost us billions and enjoy subsidized services, the Arabs and the settlers build without permits, the ultra-Orthodox do not work and live off the public purse.  
The rapid natural increase of the ultra-Orthodox, Arab and settler populations amplifies the anxiety: Our country is changing, it is being stolen right out of our hands; in no time they will multiply, take over and drag us down to the third world. Look how they are taking over neighborhoods and cities that were once "ours." How frightening: The Arabs who bought apartments in the Jewish neighborhood "will want to build a mosque." The ultra-Orthodox will build a synagogue and ritual bath on our street and will squeeze us out. "Jerusalem is lost." They will kidnap our children to make them religious. They will harass our daughters. Luckily, political correctness does not permit casting aspersions on the personal hygiene of the hated group, its lack of culture or sexual habits; public discourse has eschewed these repulsive stereotypes almost entirely.  
Factional hatred is characterized by the utter negation of the enemy group and by seeking ways to get rid of it or limit its burdensome presence. The side that hates wants the state to "take care of 'them'" and remove them from our sight: revoking the Arabs' citizenship, forcing ethnic and religious separation in cities and neighborhoods, drafting the ultra-Orthodox into the army and forcing secular education on them, evacuating the settlers and destroying the outposts, breaking down the High Court of Justice's secular fortress. These proposals are largely impractical, which only magnifies the frustration and expressions of hatred.  
The time has come to say enough. Calm down. The state will not come apart so quickly; it will only change. This change cannot help but involve struggles. The opposing groups cannot be made to disappear, nor can love and dialogue be forced on them. There is no point in holding tightly to David Ben-Gurion's vision of a public that must be "remelted, poured into the mold of a renewed nation." These ideas belong to the history books, not to contemporary reality. Even the great Ben-Gurion was unable to establish a constitution, change the electoral system or force state education on the ultra-Orthodox.  
The task of leadership in 2009 is not to force a unified national narrative on everyone, but to seek out and foster common interests that will make it easier for rival tribes to live together and allow groups on the margins to integrate into the mainstream. That will not make the hatred go away, but perhaps it will channel some of the energy now invested in it for the greater good.

<title>Time to poll Israelis on continuing occupation</title>
<date>Sun Sep 13 01:31:19 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
This charade really has to stop. Forty-two years into the Israeli occupation, it's time to find out once and for all, without caveats or reservations, what Israelis actually want. Governments deceive us, one after another, as with generation after generation of a seemingly apathetic public. Now we have a prime minister who talks about a two-state solution and simultaneously works to undermine any chance of realizing it. No one knows what he, or we, are striving for, other than his own survival.  
The prime minister that preceded him made even more far-reaching, imaginary compromises, while simultaneously building up the settlements and leading us into two unnecessary wars. Another prime minister offered the skies to Yasser Arafat, and built 1,000 housing units in the West Bank alone. The settlements have blossomed and grown under every single Israeli government, absorbing colossal budgets, while settler leaders proclaim the public is with them. It's difficult to say whether they've been right or wrong, because the public has been as deceitful as the governments. In surveys, most of it says it supports the two-state solution, but at the same time it votes for right-wing, centrist or pseudo-leftist parties that have no intention whatsoever of ending the occupation.  
Occupation is not on the Israeli agenda. Not a single Jewish MK in today's Knesset ran on a ticket calling for an end to the occupation. The media, too, is doing everything it can to blur and suppress this issue. While everyone is busy blurring and deceiving, it's time to use the one tool Israel has never employed: a referendum - Israel's first - for or against continuing the occupation, whatever either choice entails. 
If supporters of the occupation win, we should storm the West Bank, build up more settlements, and proclaim to the world that this is the will of the people. If, however, opposition wins, all activity for the occupation's entrenchment must be stopped and the occupation itself must be ended, whether as part of an agreement or unilaterally. We don't need Barack Obama, we don't need Mahmoud Abbas, we don't even need Netanyahu: Let the people speak, and then we'll see who dares defy them.  
The arguments against a referendum are well-known. What's good for Switzerland, Ireland and Australia, is not necessarily good for Israel. And it's not as if we're not holding general elections every two to three years. If general elections in Israel provided an answer as to what the people want done about the occupation, a referendum would not be necessary. If Israel had a strong, determined leader - who proposed a clear choice to his voters between two states or one state, without any middle ground - elections would suffice. But Israel does not and never had such a leader.  
True, the charade can continue even after a referendum, which is why the question must be razor-sharp: Do we continue the occupation, all of the occupation, yes or no? If yes, then yes, if no, then no. But let's decide what it is that we want. This will be the real Big Bang: The referendum and the campaigns leading up to it will cut across party lines, rattle the system, drive it out of its dead-end brain freeze, and result in a defining moment of truth for Israeli politics and politicians. The latter, too, will once and for all have to answer truthfully.  
Without a referendum, any leader can go on deceiving, and the public can maintain its smug indifference. With the stopwatch of occupation ticking incessantly, the time has come to produce this doomsday weapon, because doomsday is very near indeed. Very soon, if not already, we'll be past the point of referenda and sentenced to live forever in a racist, bleeding, forever warring bi-national apartheid state. The government won't want the referendum and the Knesset won't like it; this is why the call must come from elsewhere - from the parched throats of the last Israelis, left and right, who still want to know what on earth we want and where we are going.

<title>Wanted: national priorities </title>
<date>Fri Dec 11 02:24:17 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Both the government's support for the referendum law and its proposed new map of the country's national priority zones, which will be brought to the cabinet for approval on Sunday, raise questions about our leadership's national order of priorities. What do economic benefits for 110,000 settlers, most of whom live in dozens of settlements outside the major blocs, have to do with the vision of two states for two peoples? What does a political roadblock in the form of a requirement for either an inflated majority in the Knesset or a referendum have to do with the desire to resume negotiations with the Palestinians and Syrians, which are based on the principle of land for peace?  
These two recent moves appear to be an attempt by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to appease his colleagues in the extremist wings of his Likud party and his coalition, and to compensate the settlers for the limited, temporary freeze on construction in the settlements. As in his previous term, Netanyahu is taking one step forward and then immediately two steps back. The decision to attach a ball and chain to the peace process in the form of a referendum lessens the value of his speech at Bar-Ilan University last June. Encouraging settlement in the heart of the West Bank by giving economic benefits to settlers increases suspicions among both the Arabs and the international community that the settlement freeze was not intended to do anything but repulse pressure from the U.S. administration.  
Yuval Diskin, the head of the Shin Bet security service, briefed the inner cabinet on Wednesday about the Palestinian security services' success in reducing terror in the West Bank. But the meager harvest they have reaped from the Oslo process is increasing popular Palestinian support for players such as Hamas, who insist that violence is the way to end the Israeli occupation. These players derive encouragement from every Israeli move that contradicts a solution of dividing the land and recognizing Palestinian rights.  
Even the most pragmatic elements of the Palestinian leadership such as Prime Minister Salam Fayyad are losing faith in the possibility of reaching an agreement with Israel through dialogue. At the same time, the referendum law - which has been nicknamed, and not for nothing, the "Law to Safeguard the Golan" - raises doubts about Israel's willingness to pay the price of peace with Syria.  
The erosion in this government's credibility regarding the diplomatic process - and in the credibility of each coalition member, including the Labor Party - is exacting a heavy price from Israel on both the domestic and international fronts. The diplomatic vacuum is being filled by Arab and European initiatives designed to advance a unilateral solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The latest evidence of this is the European Union's decision this week on the status of Jerusalem. And it is doubtful that the United States can for long (or would want to) save Israel from the slippery diplomatic slope onto which it is being dragged.  
The prime minister must decide where he is headed: toward an agreement that will assure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state, or toward a perpetuation of the occupation at the price of turning Israel into either a binational state or an apartheid one. It is impossible to woo the settlers while seeking a compromise with the Palestinians. The Israeli public has a right to know where its elected leadership is taking it.

<title>Why Livni </title>
<date>Thu Feb 05 01:17:23 IST 2009</date>
<content>
Click here for exclusive Haaretz coverage of the elections in Israel
If the forecast comes true, we will wake up on February 11 to a coalition of Netanyahu-Lieberman-Shas-National Union and Habayit Hayehudi. The roars of joy will be heard throughout the Middle East, from our youths of the hilltops to their youths with explosive belts. All those who live on extremism will then be able to continue nurturing one another with hatred.  
Vis-a-vis the hope for a new world that Barack Obama has brought, the Israeli voter will present the old world with its ills - Benny Begin, Limor Livnat, Moshe Feiglin, Uzi Landau, Avigdor Lieberman and Aryeh Eldad.  
Already now, according to the surveys, the extreme right-wing has a "blocking majority" in the next Knesset. If Benjamin Netanyahu gets even one more seat than Tzipi Livni, and he is the first to be called to the president and presents him with a majority of right-wing Knesset members who support him, the question of whether he will get Labor to join him or not will become marginal. The constant backing that Netanyahu will enjoy from the right will be what determines the path of the government that is established.  
This scenario of horror is not written in stone since about one-quarter of the voters have not yet decided for whom to vote. If more people take the trouble of going to the polls, and on the assumption that most of those who are wavering are from the center, it will be possible to turn the tables. If the left is able to overcome its urge to vote for a perfect party, and its regular tradition of not voting at all when there is no party that is both beautiful and has an influence, perhaps the trend will be reversed and a centrist-left government will be able to be set up.  
The sentimental approach to elections led to Netanyahu's victory at the polls in 1996, with a margin of a mere half a percent. The white ballot slip then was meant to punish Shimon Peres for the Grapes of Wrath campaign, and it became a collective punishment for the entire country.  
According to the voter surveys, the gap between Likud and Kadima now stands at three to five seats while more than 20 seats are still floating among the parties. Indeed, this is not enough for Livni to close the gap since there has to be a majority of MKs who will recommend to the president that she try to form the government, but an advantage of one seat may be able to give her the first chance. In the situation that is beginning to seem likely, a vote for any other party is a gamble on the entire jackpot. Deliberating over the question whether the premiership is "too big a job for Livni" is of no importance since it has already been proven that the job is too big for Netanyahu, while Ehud Barak is nowhere near getting a majority. The debate over the problems of Livni's personality is likewise strange, since reams have been written about Netanyahu's weaknesses, and billboards have even been filled about those of Barak.  
Livni represents decent politics without obsequiousness. If she survived the Likud Central Committee and proximity to Ariel Sharon without her reputation being stained by even an iota of corruption, she is apparently made of the right stuff.  
During an "Erev Hadash" program on Channel 1, Limor Livnat was asked what is Likud's political platform, and she was unable to answer. Likud knows mainly what it does not want. Not two states, not concessions, not disengagement, not partition, not surrender, not compromise. This worldview, if it gains the upper hand, is likely in the not too distant future to bring about international pressure for annexing the occupied territories and granting the right of to vote to the Palestinians.  
The right is deaf to the voices that call Israel an apartheid state, and it ignores the scenario in which the rule of the Jewish minority over the Palestinian majority between the Jordan River and the sea will be abrogated. It seems that only Livni has been able to internalize this concrete danger and therefore she sees in the establishment of two states an urgent strategic necessity.  
True, Kadima is seen as an artificial party, a kind of refugee camp for those who left Likud, but it should not be forgotten that it broke away from Likud because of an ideological rift, and not for seats. Sharon's decision to divide the land and to evacuate settlers so as to make possible the continued existence of the Jewish state is just as important now as it was then. There is no leader who relates to this need with greater seriousness than does Livni.  
That is why a vote for Kadima is not a compromise nor is it a gamble. With the assistance of the American administration, which is keen to find a solution, and with the support of European leadership, Livni has more of a chance than did her predecessors to achieve results. Whoever has despaired of a two-state solution has also despaired of the existence of a Jewish state. Planes and bombs will not be able to save us from mistaken decisions.

<title>Work for Labor's refugees</title>
<date>Tue Apr 07 02:25:36 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Ehud Barak and his friends saved Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing/ultra-Orthodox coalition, which appears unable to stand on its flimsy legs. The question is whether the Labor refugees will settle down to enjoy their considerable loot, or if they will try to be of some use to the Israeli people despite the political dead-end they've pushed themselves into.  
It's hard to believe that anything serious can come from these people, who haven't lived up to a single promise in more than 30 years. Still, we should pray that some pangs of conscience and commitment are left over. They face a challenge, and it remains to be seen whether they can muster the strength and courage to live up to it.  
To save Israel as a democratic country of the Jewish people we need forces that understand what hangs in the balance. The right ignored Napoleon's famous warning that you can do anything with bayonets except sit on them; the right still maintains it is possible to rule millions of desperate people who demand their freedom from Zionist occupiers, at least in the territories. The insistence to expand the settlements and bypass roads in the West Bank shows that the people in power today believe that blunt, brutal force and self-righteousness are enough to put facts of occupation and control on the ground.  
On the other side stands the universalist left, which is uncomfortable with the Jewish identity of the Israeli state. Too many in that camp are caught up in the illusion that Israel's Jewishness must be exchanged for an open democracy that will protect the rights of all those living between the river and the sea. This growing group knows full well that the Israelis will sink to oppression, apartheid and moral degradation before they hand their state over to the Palestinians. But they still go on hoping that Barack Obama, the Europeans, the rest of the world and sanctions will somehow shut down the current Israel and build up a wonderful new democracy where Palestinians and Israelis live in peace and quiet.  
The notion that we will all drown in a murky mire of Jewish dictatorship and the entire region will go up in flames before Israel gives up its sovereignty to the Palestinian majority doesn't appear to bother them too much.  
The real question is why the two groups manage to outshout the third, most decent and appropriate solution. Why should the Palestinian people be denied a state of their own, where their freedom and sovereignity will be assured? And why should the Jewish people lose the basic right to maintain their own state, guaranteeing the security and rights of all who see themselves as Jewish?  
You can try to avoid this admittedly difficult solution. You can pile up reservations and reasonable doubts and postpone the decision time. But in the meantime, do we risk finding we lost both the opportunity and our human character in the bargain? The demographic balance between the Jordan and the sea is already tipping toward the Palestinians. They are waiting.  
Tzipi Livni showed foresight and good sense when she realized that the Netanyahu-Yishai-Lieberman government must be toppled. But the Labor Party decided to rescue it instead. The little they now owe their voters, history and their conscience is to relentlessly push the government toward the two-state solution. Anything else would be an unforgivable oversight.

<title>Zuma and the original sin </title>
<date>Thu May 14 01:57:22 IDT 2009</date>
<content>
Here's what has been said of Jacob Zuma, sworn in Saturday as president of South Africa - that he enjoys dancing at public events wrapped in tiger skins and a loincloth, that he has 22 children from six wives, that he spent 10 years in a prison run by the apartheid regime and 15 more in exile, and that he supports the death penalty and examining women's virginity before marriage. He was also charged with raping a woman he knew was HIV-positive who had "tempted" him with her "provocative" posture, then took a shower to (by his account) reduce the risk of contracting the virus. We also know he was found guilty of corruption and fraud, but was acquitted due to procedural failings.  
The tale of the uneducated Zulu shepherd who became one of Africa's most powerful men can compete with any story of achieving the American dream. South Africa's ambassador to Israel, Ismail Coovadia, has said the rise to power of this unlikely, colorful figure would have a positive influence on relations between the two countries, and spoke of "excellent relations" that will only grow deeper. Representatives of South Africa's Jewish community who met with Zuma last year were impressed with his charisma and personal warmth, and are pinning their hopes on a letter he gave them, in which he committed his support for the two-state solution with the Palestinians.  
Other observers are convinced Zuma's activities in the Middle East will be largely influenced by such bodies as the ANC Youth League, the South African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) - all of them central pillars of Zuma's base and widely perceived as having anti-Israel views.  
In February, Cosatu refused to unload ships belonging to Israel's Zim shipping company. A senior Cosatu official also called on South African Jews supporting Israel to leave the country, promising "Zionist" students in Johannesburg their lives would be "hell."  
During the term of Zuma's predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, the intelligence minister declared Israel's military action in the West Bank made the apartheid regime look like a "picnic." The deputy education minister under Mbeki insulted an Israeli diplomat of Ethiopian origin and said at a pro-Palestinian demonstration that most Western countries were in the hands of "Jewish money." Mbeki's South Africa hosted the UN anti-racism conference in Durban in 2001, where Zionism was equated with racism, and calls were made to stop the "Holocaust in Palestine" and to oust the Israeli ambassador.  
Israel is in large part still paying for its original sin - forging comprehensive security ties with the Apartheid regime and "selling its soul and morality to a racist, oppressive devil." In the words of former South African ambassador to Jerusalem Fumanekile Gqiba: "Israel must refrain from putting a question mark in front of our relations with the Palestinians. It must remember that it was, in the past, of the same flesh as the apartheid regime," he said.  
Presumably, Zuma will be too occupied with his country's massive domestic problems to focus on foreign policy issues. From Israel's perspective, the good news is that the former intelligence minister and deputy education minister are not in his government. Still, other members of the new government have signed a petition which likens Israel's government to an apartheid regime, condemns the "Bantustanization of Palestine" and calls for the commemoration of Nakba Day instead of Israel's Independence Day.  
Despite all this, observers in South Africa, including those in its Jewish community, are projecting a certain cautious optimism - even if their president does not transform into a Zionist, they foresee a warming in South African-Israeli relations. In their view, the government endangering the future of those ties sits not in Pretoria but in Jerusalem. If the new Israeli administration continues to oppose the two-state solution, South Africa will have a pretext for downgrading relations. For Zuma, Benjamin Netanyahu's verbal contortions of "economic peace" and Palestinian "autonomy" simply will not suffice.
